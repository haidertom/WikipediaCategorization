The term "'''ADA Signs'''" has come into common use in the [[architecture|architectural]], [[construction]] and [[signage]] industries with the advent of the [[Americans With Disabilities Act]], or ADA. The Americans with Disabilities Act regulates accessibility; and includes requirements for signage that is conveniently located and easy to read both visually and through tactile touch. 

"ADA Signs" are sometimes misunderstood as being synonymous with [[braille]] signs. Signs with braille and raised characters are the most visible manifestation of the law requiring access to the built environment, but the sign standards in the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (or ADAAG) require much more than just braille and raised characters on some signs. In general, almost every sign that would be considered an "architectural" sign&lt;ref&gt;Example of architectural ADA room number sign up close from Martin Awards Resource blog https://www.martinawards.com/ada-signs-being-ada-compliant/&lt;/ref&gt; must comply with one or another of the ADA Guidelines. If a sign identifies a permanent [[room]] or space of a facility (including exits), directs or informs about functional spaces of the facility, or identifies, directs to, or informs about accessible features of the facility, it must comply. Signs for [[advertising]] and [[marketing]] purposes, temporary signs, company logos and names are examples of signs or sections of signs that do not have to comply.&lt;ref&gt;Further Info from Image360 Signmaker's Resource Center. http://www.image360.com/Resource-Center/ADA-Requirements/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Because of the rules requiring [[Braille]] on some signs, the signage section is most often considered as benefiting persons who are blind and visually impaired. Some of the sign guidelines are also designed to benefit persons with mobility or hearing impairments. In addition, it is generally considered that easy to read and well thought out [[signage systems]] are of benefit to deaf people, people who have problems speaking, and people with cognitive disabilities or psychiatric conditions that cause them to avoid speaking to strangers.

==Rules==
The general rules for signage covered by the law are these:&lt;ref&gt;the exact wording may be consulted on the website of the United States Access Board at http://www.access-board.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;

All signs (except for reflective parking and other [[traffic sign]]s) must have non-[[Glare (vision)|glare]] backgrounds and characters. Glare and reflection are a major problem for persons with vision impairments, and particularly for the elderly.

All signs that contain visual characters must have a high dark to light (or vice versa) [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] between characters and their background. The important issue is not color, but lightness and darkness: a sign with very light gray letters on a charcoal gray background would be acceptable, but a sign with red letters on a black background would not.

All signs must have "easy to read" [[typeface]]s. There are different rules for signs that identify rooms and spaces, versus signs that direct and inform. This is because persons who are "functionally blind" (have no usable [[Visual perception|vision]]) are able to locate doors, and therefore can locate signs adjacent to doors that identify them; but have no consistent way to find directional and information signs that could be located anywhere along corridors.

Directional and informational signs can use upper and lower case letters (recommended by many experts for visual readability) and "simple" [[serif]] typefaces of a non-decorative nature. Condensed or extended [[typeface]]s are not allowed. Strokes are of medium weight, not too bold or too thin. The size of the letters is dictated by the distance of the sign from the expected position of the sign reader. Character size on these signs is to be determined by a chart in the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design that uses a combination of the height of the text above the floor and the distance the reader has to stand from the sign.

ADA signs that identify rooms and spaces are to be located adjacent to the door they identify so they can be located by persons who are functionally blind. For the most part, one sign is used by both [[Touch|tactile]] and visual readers, so there are compromises to assist tactile readers. However, it is possible to use two separate signs with the same information. Tactile signs require uppercase characters in sans-serif typefaces. ([[Helvetica]] is most common; however other sans-serif typefaces can be used.) The characters can be between 5/8&amp;nbsp;inch and 2&amp;nbsp;inches high. The Braille must accompany the characters (below the characters) and must be Contracted Braille (formerly called Grade 2 Braille). The signs are installed 48&amp;nbsp;inches minimum from the baseline of the lowest raised character and 60&amp;nbsp;inches maximum from the baseline of the highest raised character. (Although the definition of "character" doesn't include Braille cells, the Access Board has stated that the 48 inch rule applies to the base of the lowest line of Braille cells.) If pictograms are used to identify the space (for example, restroom signs with gender pictograms), they must be in a six inch high clear field and accompanied by a tactile character and Braille label below the field.

There are four symbols that stand for accessibility. One is the familiar [[International Symbol of Access]], or "wheelchair symbol." This is used generally to show that persons with mobility impairments can access entrances, restrooms, or pathways. Three are specifically for persons with hearing impairments: the "ear" symbol is the International Symbol of Access for Hearing Loss, and is used to show the availability of an assistive listening system. The "keyboard" symbol stands for a TTY or [[text telephone]]. The "phone" symbol with sound waves stands for the availability of a volume controlled phone.

==Standards==
The standards for the signs (and most other standards used in ADA regulations and state building codes) are the product of the ANSI ([[American National Standards Institute]]) A117.1 Committee. This large committee is made up of a balanced group of representatives from industry, the government, disability organizations, designers, code officials, and experts. The committee meets in five year cycles to revise the last published standard. The standard is then used by the International Code Council for its model [[building code]], and has formed the basis of the new version of the ADA Guidelines, now called the 2004 ADA/ABA.&lt;ref&gt;available on the website of the Access Board at http://www.access-board.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; (However, with the final publication of the standards by the Department of Justice, we now generally refer to the Guidelines as the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design.)

The standards had been already adopted by several federal agencies, and had been approved by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and were awaiting final review by the [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] when the [[Obama Administration]] came in. Although they are actually a product of the [[Clinton Administration]] and had taken eight years to make it through the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]], the Obama Administration considered them Bush Administration regulations, and held them up for review. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}} They were approved by the Department of Justice for publication on September 15, 2010, and made legally enforceable on March 15, 2012.

'''Agricultural chemistry''' is the study of both [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]] which are important in agricultural [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]], the processing of raw [[Product (business)|products]] into foods and beverages, and in [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[Environmental monitoring|monitoring]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]. These studies emphasize the relationships between plants, [[animals]] and [[bacteria]] and their [[Natural environment|environment]].
The science of chemical compositions and changes involved in the production, protection, and use of crops and livestock. As a basic science, it embraces, in addition to test-tube chemistry, all the life processes through which humans obtain food and fiber for themselves and feed for their animals. As an applied science or technology, it is directed toward control of those processes to increase yields, improve quality, and reduce costs. One important branch of it, [[chemurgy]], is concerned chiefly with utilization of agricultural products as chemical [[raw material]]s. Etc.

==Sciences==

The goals of agricultural chemistry are to expand understanding of the causes and effects of biochemical reactions related to plant and animal growth, to reveal opportunities for controlling those reactions, and to develop chemical products that will provide the desired assistance or control. Every scientific discipline that contributes to agricultural progress depends in some way on chemistry. Hence agricultural chemistry is not a distinct discipline, but a common thread that ties together [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[microbiology]], [[entomology]], and numerous other sciences that impinge on agriculture.

Chemical materials developed to assist in the production of food, feed, and fiber include scores of [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, and other [[pesticide]]s, plant growth regulators, [[fertilizer]]s, and animal feed supplements. Chief among these groups from the commercial point of view are manufactured fertilizers, synthetic pesticides (including herbicides), and supplements for feeds. The latter include both nutritional supplements (for example, [[mineral nutrients]]) and medicinal compounds for the prevention or control of disease.

Agricultural chemistry often aims at preserving or increasing the [[fertility (soil)|fertility of soil]], maintaining or improving the [[agricultural yield]], and improving the quality of the crop.

When agriculture is considered with [[ecology]], the [[sustainablility]] of an operation is considered. Modern agrochemical industry has gained a reputation for [[profit maximization|maximising profits]] while violating sustainable and ecologically viable agricultural principles. [[Eutrophication]], the prevalence of [[genetically modified crops]] and the increasing concentration of chemicals in the food chain (e.g. [[persistent organic pollutant]]s) are only a few consequences of naive [[industrial agriculture]].

''' Agricultural marketing ''' is inferred to cover the services involved in moving an [[agricultural]] product from the [[farm]] to the [[consumer]]. It is also the planning, organizing, directing and handling of agricultural produce in such a way as to satisfy the farmer, producer and the consumer. Numerous interconnected activities are involved in doing this, such as planning production, growing and [[harvesting]], [[Food grading|grading]], [[Food packaging|packing and packaging]], transport, [[Food storage|storage]], agro- and [[food processing]], [[Food distribution|distribution]], [[advertising]] and sale. Effectively, the term encompasses the entire range of supply chain operations. However, its key function is to help direct these services, by providing competent and able market information, thereby linking the other operations into an integrated service with targeted outcomes.

==Agricultural marketing development==
[[File:Adjamemarche2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Congestion at a market in [[Abidjan]]]]
[[Image:Mercado de Xipamanine Maputo Moçambique.png|thumb|right|250px|A typical market in Africa]]
Efforts to develop agricultural marketing have, particularly in developing countries, tended to concentrate on a number of areas, specifically infrastructure development; information provision; training of farmers and traders in marketing and post-harvest issues; and support to the development of an appropriate policy environment. In the past, efforts were made to develop government-run marketing bodies but these have tended to become less prominent over the years.&lt;ref name="AbbottNations1986"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbott|first1=John Cave|author2=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|title=Marketing Improvement in the Developing World: What Happens and what We Have Learned|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-1I-W3lvIsC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1986|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org.|isbn=978-92-5-101427-1|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural Market infrastructure===
Efficient marketing infrastructure such as [[wholesale marketing|wholesale]], retail and assembly markets and [[Warehouse|storage]] facilities is essential for cost-effective marketing, to minimize [[post-harvest handling|post-harvest losses]] and to reduce health risks. Markets play an important role in [[rural development]], income generation, [[food security]], and developing rural-market linkages. Experience shows that planners need to be aware of how to design markets that meet a community's social and economic needs and how to choose a suitable site for a new market. In many cases sites are chosen that are inappropriate and result in under-use or even no use of the infrastructure constructed. It is also not sufficient just to build a market: attention needs to be paid to how that market will be managed, operated and maintained.&lt;ref name="Tracey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-y4851e.HTM|title=Planning and Designing Rural Markets|author=Tracey-White, John|date=2003|location=Rome|publisher=Food And Agrilculture Organization Of The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ags/publications/AGSF_WD_24.pdf|title=A guide to upgrading rural agricultural retail markets|author=Marocchino, Cecilia|date=2009|location=Rome|publisher=Food And Agrilculture Organization Of The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural assembly markets are located in production areas and primarily serve as places where farmers can meet with traders to sell their products. These may be occasional (perhaps weekly) markets, such as haat bazaars in India and Nepal, or permanent.&lt;ref name = "Tracey"/&gt; Terminal wholesale markets are located in major metropolitan areas, where produce is finally channelled to consumers through trade between wholesalers and retailers, caterers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracey-White John | title= Wholesale markets: Planning and Design Manual|url= http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0521e/t0521e00.htm |publisher=FAO|location= Rome| accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics of [[wholesale market]]s have changed considerably as retailing changes in response to urban growth, the increasing role of supermarkets and increased consumer spending capacity.

Retail marketing systems in western countries have broadly evolved from traditional street markets through to the modern hypermarket or out-of-town shopping center. In developing countries, there remains scope to improve agricultural marketing by constructing new retail markets, despite the growth of supermarkets, although municipalities often view markets primarily as sources of revenue rather than infrastructure requiring development. Effective regulation of markets is essential. Inside a market, both hygiene rules and revenue collection activities have to be enforced. Of equal importance, however, is the maintenance of order outside the market. Licensed traders in a market will not be willing to cooperate in raising standards if they face competition from unlicensed operators outside who do not pay any of the costs involved in providing a proper service.&lt;ref&gt;Tracey-White, J.

===Market information===
{{Main|Marketing information system}}
Efficient [[Market Information Systems|market information]] can be shown to have positive benefits for farmers and traders. Up-to-date information on prices and other market factors enables farmers to negotiate with traders and also facilitates spatial distribution of products from rural areas to towns and between markets.&lt;ref&gt;Aparajita Goyal  [http://www.aeaweb.org/issue.php?journal=APP&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=3], Information, Direct Access to Farmers, and Rural Market Performance in Central India, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Most governments in developing countries have tried to provide [[Market Information Systems|market information services]] to farmers, but these have tended to experience problems of sustainability. Moreover, even when they function, the service provided is often insufficient to allow commercial decisions to be made because of time lags between data collection and dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd  [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/003/X6993E/], Market information services – Theory and Practice. FAO, Rome, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern communications technologies open up the possibility for market information services to improve information delivery through [[Short message service|SMS]] on cell phones and the rapid growth of [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio stations in many developing countries offers the possibility of more localised information services. In the longer run, the internet may become an effective way of delivering information to farmers. However, problems associated with the cost and accuracy of data collection still remain to be addressed. Even when they have access to market information, farmers often require assistance in interpreting that information. For example, the market price quoted on the radio may refer to a wholesale selling price and farmers may have difficulty in translating this into a realistic price at their local assembly market.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd  [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/x8826e/x8826e00.pdf], Understanding and Using Market Information. FAO, Rome, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Various attempts have been made in developing countries to introduce commercial market information services but these have largely been targeted at traders, commercial farmers or exporters. It is not easy to see how small, poor farmers can generate sufficient income for a commercial service to be profitable although in India a new service introduced by [[Thomson Reuters]] was reportedly used by over 100,000 farmers in its first year of operation. [[Esoko]] in West Africa attempts to subsidize the cost of such services to farmers by charging access to a more advanced feature set of mobile-based tools to businesses.

===Marketing training===
Farmers frequently consider marketing as being their major problem. However, while they are able to identify such problems as poor prices, lack of transport and high post-harvest losses, they are often poorly equipped to identify potential solutions. Successful marketing requires learning new skills, new techniques and new ways of obtaining information. Extension officers working with ministries of agriculture or NGOs are often well-trained in agricultural production techniques but usually lack knowledge of marketing or post-harvest handling.&lt;ref&gt;Grahame Dixie [https://www.share4dev.info/ffsnet/documents/3628.pdf] Horticultural Marketing, Marketing Extension Guide 5, FAO, Rome, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enabling environments===
Agricultural marketing needs to be conducted within a supportive policy, legal, institutional, [[macroeconomics|macro-economic]], infrastructural and bureaucratic environment. Traders and others are generally reluctant to make investments in an uncertain policy climate, such as those that restrict imports and exports or internal produce movement. Businesses have difficulty functioning when their trading activities are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. Inappropriate law can distort and reduce the efficiency of the market, increase the costs of doing business and retard the development of a competitive private sector. Poor support institutions, such as [[agricultural extension]] services, [[municipality|municipalities]] that operate markets inefficiently and inadequate export promotion bodies, can be particularly damaging. Poor roads increase the cost of doing business, reduce payments to farmers and increase prices to consumers. Finally, [[Political corruption|corruption]] can increase the transaction costs faced by those in the marketing chain.

===Agricultural marketing support===
Most governments have at some stage made efforts to promote agricultural marketing improvements. In the United States the [[Agricultural Marketing Service]] (AMS) is a division of [[USDA]] and has programs that provide testing, support standardization and grading and offer market news services. AMS oversees marketing agreements and orders research and promotion programs. It also purchases commodities for federal food programs. USDA also provides support to agricultural marketing work at various universities. In the United Kingdom, support for marketing of some commodities was provided before and after the Second World War by boards such as the [[Milk Marketing Board]] and the [[Egg Marketing Board]]. These boards were closed down in the 1970s. As a colonial power, Britain established [[marketing board]]s in many countries, particularly in Africa. Some continue to exist although many were closed at the time of the introduction of [[structural adjustment]] measures in the 1990s.

Several developing countries have established government-sponsored marketing or agribusiness units. South Africa, for example, started the [http://www.namc.co.za/ National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC)] as a response to the deregulation of the agriculture industry and closure of marketing boards in the country. India has the long-established [[National Institute of Agricultural Marketing]]. These are primarily research and policy organizations, but other agencies provide facilitating services for marketing channels, such as the provision of infrastructure, market information and documentation support. Examples from the Caribbean include the [http://www.namdevco.com/ National Agricultural Marketing Development Corporation (NAMDEVCO)] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and the [http://www.newgmc.com/ New Guyana Marketing Corporation] in [[Guyana]].

===Recent developments===
New marketing linkages between [[agribusiness]], large retailers and farmers are gradually being developed, e.g. through [[contract farming]], group marketing and other forms of [[collective action]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen Markelova and Ruth Meinzen-Dick {{cite web|url=http://www.capri.cgiar.org/pdf/CA-Market_WksReport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716224158/http://www.capri.cgiar.org/pdf/CA-Market_WksReport.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-16 |df= }} Collective action and market access for smallholders: A summary of findings.

More attention is now being paid to the development of regional markets (e.g. East Africa) and to structured trading systems that should facilitate such developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CTA and EAGC|title=Structured grain trading systems in Africa|url=http://publications.cta.int/media/publications/downloads/1749_PDF.pdf|publisher=CTA|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of [[supermarkets]], particularly in Latin America and East and South East Asia, is having a significant impact on marketing channels for horticultural, dairy and livestock products.&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, T., C.P. Timmer, C.B. Barrett, J. Berdegue. “The Rise of Supermarkets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America,” American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 85 (5), December 2003: 1140-1146.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, “spot” markets will continue to be important for many years, necessitating attention to infrastructure improvement such as for retail and [[wholesale marketing|wholesale markets]].

A survey of death certificates over a four-year period showed that deaths among Native Americans due to alcohol are about four times as common as in the general US population and are often due to [[traffic collision]]s and [[liver disease]] with [[homicide]], [[suicide]], and [[Falling (accident)|falls]] also contributing. Deaths due to alcohol among Native Americans are more common in men and among Northern Plains Indians.

Native American youth are far more likely to experiment with alcohol than other youth with 80% alcohol use reported. Low self-esteem is thought to be one cause. Active efforts are underway to build self-esteem among youth and to combat alcoholism among Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ericdigests.org/pre-9221/indian.htm "Fighting Alcohol and Substance Abuse among Native Americans and Alaskan Native Youth. ERIC Digest."]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Precolonial ===
Prior to contact with colonists, alcohol use and production was mainly concentrated in the southwestern United States. Some tribes produced weak beers, wine and other fermented beverages, but they had low alcohol concentrations (8–14%){{huh?|date=January 2018}} and were to be used only for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref name="statistics" /&gt; The distillation technique required to make stronger, potent forms of alcohol were unknown. It was well documented that Mexican Native Americans prepared over forty different alcoholic beverages from a variety of plant substances, such as honey, palm sap, wild plum, and pineapple.&lt;ref name=statistics&gt;Frank, J W, R S Moore, and G M Ames. “Historical and Cultural Roots of Drinking Problems among American Indians.” American Journal of Public Health 90.3 (2000): 344–351. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southwestern U.S., the [[Tohono O'odham people|Papago]], [[Piman]], [[Apache]] and [[Maricopa people|Maricopa]] all used the saguaro cactus to produce a wine, sometimes called ''haren a [[Stenocereus thurberi|pitahaya]]''.&lt;ref name="statistics" /&gt; The [[Coahuiltecan people|Coahuiltecan]] in Texas combined mountain laurel with the Agave plant to create an alcoholic drink, and the Pueblos and Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitahaya and even grapes.&lt;ref name="statistics" /&gt; To the east, the Creek of Georgia and [[Cherokee]] of the Carolinas used berries and other fruits to make alcoholic beverages, and in the Northeast, there is some evidence that the Huron made a mild beer made from corn. In addition, despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Alaska were believed to have made alcoholic drinks from fermented berries.&lt;ref name="statistics" /&gt;

=== Colonialism ===
When Europeans began making a large quantity of distilled spirits and wine available to American Indians, the tribes had very little time to adapt and develop social, legal, or moral guidelines to regulate alcohol use.&lt;ref name="NIH" /&gt; Early traders built a large demand for alcohol by using it as a means to trade, using it in exchange for highly sought after animal skins and other materials and resources. Traders also discovered that giving free alcohol to the Native Americans during trading sessions made the likelihood of trading much higher.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Kevin, and Peter Wakefield. "The Perfect Colonizer: Understanding Alcoholism and its Treatments in Native America through Humanistic Inquiry."''Journal of Student Research'' 4.1 (2015): 174-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme intoxication was common among the colonists, contrary to the inexperienced native populations.&lt;ref name="NIH" /&gt; Numerous historical accounts describe extremely violent bouts of drinking among native tribes during trading sessions and on other occasions, but at least as many accounts exist of similar behavior among the colonizing traders, military personnel, and civilians.&lt;ref name=turnup&gt;Coyhis, Don, and William L. White. "Alcohol problems in Native America: Changing paradigms and clinical practices." Alcoholism Treatment Quarterly20.3-4 (2002): 157-165.&lt;/ref&gt; Such modeling was not limited to the early colonial era but continued as the land was colonized from east to west; trappers, miners, soldiers, and lumbermen were notorious for their heavy drinking sessions. History may have therefore sown the seeds for the prevalence of alcohol abuse in North American indigenous populations. Early demand, with no regulation and strong encouragement, may have contributed to a heavy alcohol use. It was then passed down from generation to generation, which has led to the current high level of alcohol-related problems.&lt;ref name="turnup" /&gt;

=== Influence of Mesoamerica ===
The use of alcohol originated in Middle America but rapidly diffused to [[Northern Mexico]] and from there to the [[Southwestern United States]]. The majority of aboriginal production and use of alcoholic beverages was in this region. However, there was a surprising number of scattered accounts of intoxicating beverage use throughout the United States prior to White contact.&lt;ref name="statistics" /&gt; For the most part, the use of alcoholic drinks required an agricultural base but not in all instances. The reason for this is primarily that alcoholic beverages were made from domesticated plants, but there are examples of liquor being derived from wild plants. Aboriginal use generally did not involve excessive drunkenness but controlled and supervised use often in highly ritualized occasions. Further, accounts of American Indians' initial encounters with alcoholic beverages did not describe reckless or disinhibited behavior.&lt;ref name="statistics" /&gt;

=== Patterns ===
Rather than infatuation, most Native peoples initially responded to alcohol with distaste and suspicion. They considered drunkenness "degrading to free men" and questioned the motives of those who would offer a substance that was so offensive to the senses and that made men foolish. Most Native people who did drink alcohol were reported to show "remarkable restraint while in their cups". Most drank alcohol only during social or trading contact with whites. Although drinking patterns since colonization grew almost exponentially, since 1975, drinking patterns among Native Americans have remained constant. Around the world,  since 1975, Native Americans can be found more commonly among other US citizens in places that serve alcohol.&lt;ref name=NIH&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = American Indians and Alcohol|last = Fred|first = Beauvais|date = 1998|journal = Spotlight on Special Populations|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume =  22| issue =  4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firewater myths  ===
After colonial contact, white drunkenness was interpreted by whites as the misbehavior of an individual. Native drunkenness was interpreted in terms of the inferiority of a race. What emerged was a set of beliefs known as firewater myths that misrepresented the history, nature, sources and potential solutions to Native alcohol problems.&lt;ref name="turnup" /&gt; These myths proclaimed that Indian people:
* had a natural craving for alcohol, were sensitive to alcohol, became belligerent when they were intoxicated, were susceptible to alcohol addiction, and could not resolve such problems on their own.

The scientific literature has refuted the claims to many of these myths by documenting the wide variability of alcohol problems across and within Native tribes and the very different response that certain individuals have to alcohol opposed to others. Another important way that scientific literature has refuted these myths is by identifying that there are no current discovered genetic or other biological anomalies that render Native peoples particularly vulnerable to alcoholism.&lt;ref name="turnup" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/2/9428659/firewater-racist-myth-alcoholism-native-americans&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributing factors==
There are long standing beliefs that date back to colonial times when it was thought native people all over the world were particularly vulnerable to addiction, but there is no evidence of this. &lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.abc.net.au/queensland/2008/09/indigenous-drin.html&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been found that the incidence of alcohol abuse varies with gender, age, and tribal culture and history.&lt;ref name=stat&gt;{{cite journal |author =Krause, Traci M |title=A potential model of factors influencing alcoholism in American Indians |journal=Journal of Multicultural Nursing &amp; Health |date=Fall 1998 |doi= |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3919/is_199810/ai_n8810819/ |quote=[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3919/is_199810/ai_n8810819/pg_3/?tag=content;col1 Psychosocial Factors]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While little detailed genetic research has been done, it has been shown that alcoholism tends to run in families with possible involvement of differences in alcohol metabolism and the [[genotype]] of [[Alcohol dehydrogenase|alcohol-metabolizing enzymes]].&lt;ref name="stat" /&gt; There is no evidence, however, that these genetic factors are more prevalent in Native Americans than other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Caetano, Raul, Catherine L. Clark, and Tammy Tam. "Alcohol consumption among racial/ethnic minorities." Alcohol health and research world 22.4 (1998): 233-241.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one 2013 review of academic literature on the issue, there is a "substantial genetic component in Native Americans" and that "most Native Americans lack protective variants seen in other populations." &lt;ref&gt;Ehlers, Cindy L., and Ian R. Gizer. “Evidence for a Genetic Component for Substance Dependence in Native Americans”. ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 2013 170:2 , 154-164. Web. Dec. 4, 2014. &lt;http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12010113&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientists have provided evidence of the genetic component of alcoholism by the biopsychosocial model of alcoholism, but the [[molecular genetics]] research currently has not found one specific gene that is responsible for the rates of alcoholism among Native Americans, implying the phenomenon may be due to an interplay of multiple genes and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Tamara L., Lucinda G. Carr, and Cindy L. Ehlers. "Protective association of genetic variation in alcohol dehydrogenase with alcohol dependence in Native American Mission Indians." ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 160.1 (2003): 41-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

High concentrations of thiamin found in beans may buffer symptoms of alcoholism while the preparation of maize using “lime water” in the traditional preparation of tortillas may free folate for human biological use.    The agricultural food practices in Mesoamerica differed from the dietary food preparation of North American indigenous people.  Because of the differences in diet, the effects of tequila on Mesoamerican Native Americans with regards to macrocytic anemia and alcohol induced beri-beri disease and may be less pronounced than the effects of whisky or other ethanol beverages in North American tribes that do not pre-treat maize with alkaline solutions prior to eating.

===Binge drinking===
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or NIAAA, defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels to 0.08 g/dL. This typically occurs after 4 drinks for women and 5 drinks for men, in about 2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Drinking Levels Defined {{!}} National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)|url = http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/moderate-binge-drinking|website = www.niaaa.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anastasia M. Shkilnyk, who conducted an observational study of the [[Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation]] of Northwestern Ontario in the late 1970s, when they were demoralized by [[Ontario Minamata disease]], has observed that heavy Native American drinkers may not be physiologically dependent on alcohol, but they abuse it by engaging in [[binge drinking]], a practice associated with child neglect, violence, and impoverishment.&lt;ref name=PSL&gt;{{cite book|title=A Poison Stronger than Love: The Destruction of an Ojibwa Community|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300033257|author =Anestasia M. Shkilnyk|page=21|type=trade paperback|date=March 11, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the Institute of Psychiatry and Stanford School of Medicine outlined the following stages of [[alcohol dependence]]:&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, E. Jane, [[Keith Humphreys]], and David M. Ball. The Treatment of Drinking Problems: A Guide to the Helping Professions. Cambridge University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Craving: a strong need to drink
* Loss of control: cannot stop drinking once drinking has started
* Physical dependence: having withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, sweating, shakiness, and anxiety after a time of heavy drinking
* Tolerance: need to drink greater amounts of alcohol in order to become inebriated

Indian youth become socialized into the culture of alcohol at an early age this pattern of testing alcohol limits persists until early adulthood.&lt;ref name="NIH" /&gt; Approximately 20 percent of Indian youth between 7th and 12th grade belong in this category. Other youth exhibit an experimental pattern of drinking through adolescence and this is noted as one of the biggest identifiers of binge drinking later in life.&lt;ref name="NIH" /&gt; Given the high rates of alcohol and substance abuse on reservations, researchers have seen higher rates of academic failure, delinquency, violent criminal behavior, suicidality, and alcohol-related mortality among Native American youth, which is far greater than the rest of the United States population.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Linda R., et al. "Rates of Substance Use of American Indian Students in 8th, 10th, and 12th Grades Living on or Near Reservations: Update, 2009–2012." Public Health Reports 129.2 (2014): 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease and death ===
Compared with the US population in general, the American Indian population is much more susceptible to alcoholism and related diseases and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;May, Philip A. "Overview of alcohol abuse epidemiology for American Indian populations." ''Changing numbers, changing needs: American Indian demography and public health'' (1996): 235-261.&lt;/ref&gt; According to IHS records on alcohol-related illness, the mortality due to alcohol was as much as 5.6 times higher among the Indian population than among the U.S. population in general. The rate was 7.1 times higher in 1980. Disproportionately more males are affected by alcohol related conditions than females. The highest risk of alcohol-related deaths is between 45 and 64. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis are 3.9 times as prevalent in the Indian population as in the general U.S. population. [[Driving under the influence|Alcohol-related fatal car accidents]] are three times as prevalent. Alcohol was shown to be a factor in 69% of all [[Suicide among Native Americans in the United States|suicides of American Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;May, Philip A., et al. "Alcohol and suicide death among American Indians of New Mexico: 1980–1998." Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior 32.3 (2002): 240-255.&lt;/ref&gt; This number has grown larger since 1975.

=== Domestic violence ===
During the past twenty years, there has been growing recognition among health care professionals that domestic violence is a highly prevalent public health problem with devastating effects on individuals, families, and communities. A risk factor is a characteristic that has a high correlation with levels of [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jones, Loring. "The distinctive characteristics and needs of domestic violence victims in a Native American community." Journal of Family Violence 23.2 (2008): 113-118.&lt;/ref&gt; They include the offender and victim both being under the age of 40, substance abuse, receiving public assistance, and the offender and/or the victim witnessing domestic violence between their parents as a child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For abuse victims, the health care setting offers a critical opportunity for early identification and even primary prevention of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Building Domestic Violence Health Care Responses in Indian Country: A Promising Practices Report. Family Violence Prevention Fund, 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol and drugs use is attributed higher rates of domestic violence among Native Americans compared to many other demographics. Over two-thirds (68%) of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] and Alaska Native sexual assault victims attribute their attacker's actions to drinking and/or taking drugs before the offense&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice. Violence Against American Indian and Alaska Native Women and the CriminalbJustice Response: What is known. 2008:39&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) ===
Native Americans have one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol syndrome recorded. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], from 1981 to 1991, the prevalence of FAS in the overall US population per 10,000 births was 2.1. Among American Indians, that number was 31.0. The significant difference between the FAS rates of the US population and American Indians has been attributed to a lack of healthcare, high poverty levels, and a young average population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Healthcare spending for an average American on Medicare is about $11,762 whereas average spending on healthcare for a Native American is $2,782.&lt;ref&gt;Coughlin, Teresa A. "Health Policy for Low-Income People in Minnesota." (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 document, "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders among Native Americans," the US Department of Health and Human Services reported that the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in Alaska was 1.5 per 1,000 live births but, among American Indians and Alaska Natives, the rate was 5.6.&lt;ref&gt;Montag, Annika C., et al. "Preventing Alcohol‐Exposed Pregnancy Among an American Indian/Alaska Native Population: Effect of a Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment Intervention." Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research 39.1 (2015): 126-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alcohol and substance abuse Programs ==
=== Indian Health Services ===
The Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is a program for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals to reduce the incidence and prevalence of alcohol and substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program {{!}} Indian Health Service (IHS)|url = http://www.ihs.gov/asap/|website = www.ihs.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are administered in tribal communities, including emergency, inpatient and outpatient treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals covered under [[Indian Health Services]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sno-nsn.gov/services/asap&lt;/ref&gt; It addresses and treats alcoholism from a [[Disease model of addiction|disease model]] perspective.

=== Tribal Action Plan ===
The Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1986 was updated to make requirements that the Office of Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse (OIASA) is to work with federal agencies to assist Native American communities in developing a Tribal Action Plan (TAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TAP|url = http://www.samhsa.gov/tloa/tap|website = www.samhsa.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20|last = ann.lynsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TAP coordinates resources and funding required to help mitigates levels of alcohol and substance abuse among the Native American population.

The '''Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center''' at [[Barnes-Jewish Hospital]] and [[Washington University School of Medicine]] is a cancer treatment, research and education institution with six locations in the [[St. Louis]] area. Siteman is the only cancer center in Missouri and within 240 miles of St. Louis to be designated a [[Comprehensive Cancer Center]] by the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = VandeWater | first = Judith | title = St. Louis cancer center achieves highest designation | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | date = 4 January 2005 | url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7767343_ITM | accessdate = 27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siteman is also the only area member of the [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NCCN Member Institutions | publisher = National Comprehensive Cancer Network | url= http://www.nccn.org/members/network.asp | accessdate = 27 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit alliance of 28 cancer centers dedicated to improving the quality and effectiveness of cancer care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Siteman joins cancer center alliance | newspaper = St. Louis Business Journal | date = 21 March 2006 | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2006/03/20/daily21.html | accessdate = 29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Siteman received the highest rating possible - exceptional - by the NCI for cancer research. At Siteman's review leading to the rating, researchers presented their findings in genomics, cancer imaging, cancer prevention and disparities, and the use of the body's immune system to fight cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Munz |first= Michele |date= 7 July 2015 |title= Siteman Cancer Center earns highest rating from federal cancer institute |url= http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/siteman-cancer-center-earns-highest-rating-from-federal-cancer-institute/article_1ddf4080-0a7e-5d7b-a5ef-49b600ccda19.html |newspaper= St. Louis Post-Dispatch |location= St. Louis, Missouri |access-date= 14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Siteman was named a top 15 U.S. cancer center by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Siteman Cancer Center Rankings &amp; Ratings | publisher= U.S. News &amp; World Report | url= https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/mo/barnes-jewish-hospitalwashington-university-6630930/cancer?int=scorecard-specialty-click | accessdate = 14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition is part of the overall ranking of its parent institutions, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, which is tied for No. 11 on the newsmagazine's “The Best Hospitals 2018-19 Honor Roll,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last1=Comarow | first1=Avery | last2=Harder | first2=Ben | date= 14 August 2018 | title = 2018-19 Best Hospitals Honor Roll and Medical Specialties Rankings | publisher= U.S. News &amp; World Report | url= https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview | accessdate = 14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Washington University School of Medicine, which is No. 8 on the newsmagazine's "2019 Best Medical Schools: Research" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2019 Best Medical Schools: Research  | publisher= U.S. News &amp; World Report | url= https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/research-rankings | accessdate = 14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Siteman treated nearly 9,000 newly diagnosed cancer patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Siteman Cancer Center earns top federal agency rating | newspaper = St. Louis Business Journal | date = 10 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and every year provides continuing care to about 40,000 people, making it one of the largest cancer centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Summary 3: Reportable Patients/Participation in Therapeutic Protocols | publisher = National Comprehensive Cancer Network | url = http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/data/sum3.html | accessdate = 6 April 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111113051358/http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/data/sum3.html | archive-date = 2011-11-13 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and leadership==

In 1999, Alvin J. and Ruth Siteman committed $35 million to the development of the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. The commitment was the largest gift ever received by Barnes-Jewish and Washington University in support of cancer research, patient care and services, education and community outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Couple donate $35 million for cancer research | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | date = 20 November 1999 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=%20COUPLE%20DONATE%20$%2035%20MILLION%20FOR%20CANCER%20RESEARCH | accessdate = 24 June 2013}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Eberlein, M.D., has been director of the center since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Siteman Cancer Center gets $23M | newspaper = St. Louis Business Journal | date = 1 November 2010 | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2010/11/01/wash-u-gets-23m-for-siteman-cancer.html | accessdate = 27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John DiPersio, M.D., Ph.D., is deputy director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Comprehensive Cancer Network, MD, PhD | publisher= Siteman Cancer Center | url= http://www.siteman.wustl.edu/DocProfile.aspx?Type=Patient&amp;memid=85 | accessdate = 29 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the NCI designated Siteman as a Cancer Center, which signaled that the institution had demonstrated significant scope and quality in its cancer research programs. The designation came with $850,000 per year in federal research grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = VandeWater | first = Judith | title = Siteman Center Here Wins Designation from National Cancer Institute | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | date = 16 August 2001 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=SITEMAN%20CENTER%20HERE%20WINS%20DESIGNATION%20FROM%20NATIONAL%20CANCER%20INSTITUTE&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=2001&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28%22SITEMAN%20CENTER%20HERE%20WINS%20DESIGNATION%20FROM%20NATIONAL%20CANCER%20INSTITUTE%22%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no | accessdate = 15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCI named Siteman a Comprehensive Cancer Center in 2005, recognizing its broad-based research, outreach and education activities, and awarded the center a five-year, $21 million support grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = VandeWater | first = Judith | title = Siteman Cancer Center here achieves highest designation | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | date = 4 January 2005 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Siteman%20Cancer%20Center%20here%20achieves%20highest%20designation&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=2005&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28%22Siteman%20Cancer%20Center%20here%20achieves%20highest%20designation%22%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no | accessdate = 15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCI renewed the designation in 2010 and awarded another five-year grant, totaling $23 million. The grants fund programs and specialized services that promote multidisciplinary research, as well as shared scientific resources and seed awards that enable investigators to develop and pursue new research opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Munz | first = Michele | title = Siteman Cancer Center designated as Comprehensive Cancer Center, gets $23 million | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | date = 21 November 2010 | url = http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/health/health-matters/siteman-cancer-center-designated-as-comprehensive-cancer-center-gets-million/article_30960ad2-f5b2-11df-b89e-00127992bc8b.html | accessdate = 13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alvin J. Siteman announced in 2010 that he would donate $1 million annually to an endowment fund at the center to advance cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment programs that might not receive federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = St. Louis philanthropist endows cancer fund | newspaper = The Associated Press | date = 26 January 2010 | url = http://www.kmov.com/news/local/82667972.html | accessdate = 15 June 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100407040135/http://www.kmov.com/news/local/82667972.html | archive-date = 2010-04-07 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patient care and services==

More than 350 Washington University research scientists and physicians provide inpatient and outpatient care at Siteman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= NCCN Member Institution Profile | publisher= National Comprehensive Cancer Network | url= http://www.nccn.com/component/content/article/42/209-siteman-cancer-center.html | accessdate= 15 March 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120512053015/http://nccn.com/component/content/article/42/209-siteman-cancer-center.html | archive-date= 2012-05-12 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The center also offers patient and family support services, including discussion and education groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Patient &amp; Visitor Information | publisher= Siteman Cancer Center | url= http://www.siteman.wustl.edu/SectionFront.aspx?id=3738&amp;mid=9 | accessdate = 15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Scientists and physicians affiliated with Siteman hold more than $145 million in cancer research and related training grants. The results of basic laboratory research are rapidly incorporated into treatment advances. This process is enhanced by patient access to more than 500 therapeutic clinical studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Find A Clinical Trial | publisher= Siteman Cancer Center | url= http://www.siteman.wustl.edu/FindProtocol.aspx | accessdate = 15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including many collaborative efforts with other leading cancer centers throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About Siteman | publisher= Siteman Cancer Center | url= https://siteman.wustl.edu/about/about-siteman/ | accessdate = 27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, three scientists affiliated with Siteman, Washington University School of Medicine and the [[McDonnell Genome Institute]] were included on the [[Thomson Reuters]] list of “Hottest Scientific Researchers of 2012”: [[Richard K. Wilson]], Ph.D.; [[Elaine Mardis]], Ph.D.; and Li Ding, Ph.D. The list recognized the 21 most-cited researchers of 2012. Robert Fulton, a fourth scientist from Washington University School of Medicine and the [[McDonnell Genome Institute]], also made the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Who and What Was Hot in Scientific Research in 2012 | url = http://sciencewatch.com/articles/hottest-research-2012  | accessdate = 5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research advances===

Researchers affiliated with Siteman and/or Washington University School of Medicine have pioneered important advances in cancer research, prevention, education and treatment. Highlights and ongoing studies include these projects:

'''2018 — Personalized brain cancer vaccines'''

* In a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a [[glioblastoma]] vaccine, some patients "lived significantly longer" - up to seven years longer - than most people who are diagnosed with the brain cancer. Researchers developed personalized vaccines for each patient, removing as much of the brain tumor as possible, then combining pieces of the tumor with cells from the patient’s immune system. This “trains” the immune cells to attack tumor cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berson |first=Scott |date=30 May 2018 |title=Scientists created a brain-cancer vaccine - and so far it's 'remarkably promising' |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article212173189.html |work=The McClatchy Company/Miami Herald |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2017 — CAR-T cell therapy and using Zika virus to fight brain cancer'''

* In a clinical trial at Siteman, at least 16 of 20 people who received a new treatment called CAR-T cell therapy saw their cancers disappear after treatment. The patients had previously failed standard therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bernhard |first= Blythe |date= 19 August 2017 |title= New treatment for deadly blood cancers expected to be approved soon |url= http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/new-treatment-for-deadly-blood-cancers-expected-to-be-approved/article_14a09d12-5eea-5c3f-94bd-2a216e1eb58f.html |newspaper= St. Louis Post-Dispatch |access-date= 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapy, [[Axicabtagene ciloleucel]], received FDA approval on Oct. 18, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= McGinley |first= Laurie |date= 18 October 2017 |title= Cutting-edge immunotherapy treatment approved for another deadly cancer |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/10/19/cutting-edge-immunotherapy-treatment-approved-for-yet-another-deadly-cancer |newspaper= The Washington Post |access-date= 25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* While Zika virus causes devastating damage to the brains of developing fetuses, it one day may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma, a deadly form of brain cancer. Joint research from Washington University School of Medicine and [[UC San Diego School of Medicine]] shows that the virus kills brain cancer stem cells, the kind of cells most resistant to standard treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Roberts |first= Michelle |date= 5 September 2017 |title= Zika virus used to treat aggressive brain cancer |url= http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/new-treatment-for-deadly-blood-cancers-expected-to-be-approved/article_14a09d12-5eea-5c3f-94bd-2a216e1eb58f.html |newspaper= St. Louis Post-Dispatch |access-date= 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2016 — Chemotherapy for brain tumors'''

* Neurosurgeons using lasers to treat brain cancer discover that the technique breaks down the blood-brain barrier for about four weeks, allowing them to use chemotherapy to treat the tumor. A clinical trial is still ongoing, but Eric C. Leuthardt, M.D., considers the initial results promising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Gruber |first= Ben |date= 4 May 2016 |title= Laser brain cancer treatment may bring extra advantage |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-brain-idUSKCN0XV28A |newspaper= Reuters |access-date= 13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2015 — Melanoma vaccine and urine test for kidney cancer'''

* In a proof of concept study, a research team led by Beatriz Carreno, Ph.D., shows that personalized medicine can "wake up" the immune systems of melanoma patients. Further study needs to be done to see if the customized vaccines can prevent recurrence in patients with advanced melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Norton |first= Amy |date= 2 April 2015 |title= Experimental Melanoma Vaccine Shows Early Promise |url= http://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/mis-cancer-news-102/experimental-melanoma-vaccine-shows-early-promise-698026.html |newspaper= HealthDay |access-date= 14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A urine-based screening test is found to be more than 95 percent accurate in identifying early-stage kidney cancer, according to a study led by Evan Kharasch, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 20 March 2015 |title= Urine Test Shows Promise for Early Diagnosis of Kidney Cancer |url= http://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/kidney-cancer-news-431/urine-test-shows-promise-for-early-diagnosis-of-kidney-cancer-697607.html |newspaper= HealthDay |access-date= 14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2014 — Breast cancer vaccine and cancer goggles'''

* A breast cancer vaccine developed by William Gillanders, M.D., is shown to activate the immune system to fight tumor cells and slow down cancer progression. The vaccine, which targets [[mammaglobin-A]], a protein expressed in breast tumors, involved very few side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Mahesh |first= Roshni |date= 2 December 2014 |title= Vaccine to Slow Down Metastatic Breast Cancer |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.in/vaccine-slow-down-metastatic-breast-cancer-615771 |newspaper= International Business Times |access-date= 14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* High-tech goggles developed by [[Samuel Achilefu]], Ph.D., help surgeons see cancer cells in real time. The technology, which includes a digital display, infrared light and use of an intravenous dye, could negate the need for follow-up surgeries due to undetected cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Mintz |first= Joe |date= 11 February 2014 |title= New Glasses Makes Sure ‘No Cancer Is Left Behind,’ Causes Malignant Cells To Glow Blue |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/new-glasses-makes-sure-no-cancer-left-behind-causes-malignant-cells-glow-blue-photo-1554755 |newspaper= International Business Times |access-date= 14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2013 — Endometrial cancer and leukemia'''

* In separate studies, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine and the [[McDonnell Genome Institute]] help identify major genetic mutations that promote [[endometrial cancer]] and [[acute myeloid leukemia]]. The research, part of [[The Cancer Genome Atlas]] project, provides new information that could change treatments for patients and aid drug development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Winslow | first = Ron | title = Genomic Studies Unlock Details on Two Cancers | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | date = 1 May 2013 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324582004578456701717954658 | accessdate = 1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2012 — Leukemia, breast cancer research and cancer prevention'''

* Siteman leukemia doctor Lukas Wartman, M.D., who was diagnosed with the disease himself, goes into remission for an unprecedented third time after [[Timothy Ley]], M.D., and his colleagues at the [[McDonnell Genome Institute]] sequenced Wartman’s cancerous and normal genes. Researchers also analyzed his [[RNA]]. By doing so, his treatment team, which includes John DiPersio, M.D., Ph.D., deputy director of Siteman, discovered that a normal gene might be contributing to the growth of Wartman's cancer by producing mass amounts of a certain protein. They found that a drug used to treat a type of kidney cancer was able to inhibit the gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolata | first = Gina | title = In Treatment for Leukemia, Glimpses of the Future | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 7 July 2012 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/health/in-gene-sequencing-treatment-for-leukemia-glimpses-of-the-future.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = 20 July 2012 }}{{cite episode | title = Frontiers in Cancer Research | episodelink =  | url = http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/12455 | series = Charlie Rose | serieslink =  | network = PBS | location = New York | airdate = 17 July 2012 | minutes = 28 | access-date = 2012-07-20 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120721201331/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/12455 | archivedate = 2012-07-21 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scientists including Matthew Ellis, M.B., Ph.D., use [[whole genome sequencing]] to compare differences between the [[DNA]] of breast cancer tumors and healthy cells in 46 women.

In a 2012 paper, Colditz argues that half of all cancer cases can be prevented, thereby saving more than 280,000 people in 2011, and that individuals, medical and health experts, government officials and others must start taking already known steps to reduce cancer’s impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Harmon | first = Katherine | title = U.S. Cancer Rates Could Be Cut in Half Today Based on What’s Already Known | newspaper = Scientific American | date = March 2012 | url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2012/03/28/u-s-cancer-rates-could-be-cut-in-half-today-based-on-whats-already-known/ | accessdate = 6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2011 — Blood-related cancers'''

* Siteman completes its 5,000th [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]], a common therapy for patients with blood-related cancers such as [[leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], and [[multiple myeloma]] or another blood-related cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gamble | first = Molly | title = 70 Hospitals and Health Systems With Great Oncology Programs | newspaper = Becker’s Hospital Review | date = 18 January 2012 | url = http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/lists/hospitals-and-health-systems-with-great-oncology-programs/all-pages.html  | accessdate = 20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2010 — Pediatric cancers'''

* Washington University School of Medicine and [[St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital]] announce their joint Pediatric Cancer Genome Project to identify the genetic changes that give rise to some of the world’s deadliest childhood cancers. The team plans to decode the genomes of more than 600 childhood cancer patients who have contributed tumor samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Szabo | first = Liz | title = Genetic study targets cancer in kids | newspaper = USA Today | date = 26 January 2010 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20100126/genome26_st.art.htm | accessdate = 20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2008 — Genetic sequencing'''

* For the first time, scientists decode all the genes of a cancer patient and find a suite of mutations that might have caused the disease or aided its progression. [[Timothy Ley]], M.D., [[Elaine Mardis]], Ph.D., [[Richard K. Wilson]], Ph.D., and their colleagues at [[McDonnell Genome Institute]] say the finding could lead to new therapies and could help doctors make better choices among existing treatments, based on a more detailed genetic picture of each patient's cancer. Though the research involved [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] (AML), the same techniques can also be used to study other cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Grady | first = Denise | title = Experts Decode Cancer Patient’s Genes, Seeking Treatment Clues  | newspaper = They New York Times | date = 6 November 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/health/research/06cancer.html | accessdate = 20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2007 — Nanotechnology and radiation therapy'''

* Gregory Lanza, M.D., Ph.D., Samuel Wickline, M.D., and researchers in their labs announce the development of [[nanoparticles]], significantly smaller than the width of a human hair, aimed at attacking cancer by locating and “latching on” to tumors. Used in conjunction with [[magnetic resonance imaging]], the nanoparticles could help physicians monitor cancerous tissue and deliver medicine directly to the tumor, not to the rest of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nanoparticles used to track cells | newspaper = UPI | date = 27 July 2007 | url = http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2007/03/27/Nanoparticles-used-to-track-cells/UPI-90741175008534/ | accessdate = 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Researchers led by Daniel Low, Ph.D., and Parag Parikh, M.D., develop a machine called the 4D Phantom that follows a patient’s complex breathing pattern to deliver radiation therapy to tumors that move, such as those in the lung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Melcer | first = Rachel | title = Innovating with Daniel Low | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | location = St. Louis | pages = B4 | date = 27 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2006 — Photoacoustic imaging'''

* Lihong Wang, Ph.D., announces his work on [[photoacoustic imaging]], a new technique that uses light and sound to create detailed, color pictures of tumors and organs. The noninvasive imaging technique, which can be performed without the dangers of radiation exposure associated with [[X-ray]] and [[CT scans]], also may help doctors detect cancer earlier than ever before, its developers say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Lihong Wang, Ph.D. | title = New technique brings cancer screening into sharper focus | medium = Web news | publisher = Reuters | location = St. Louis | date = 30 April 2012 | url = https://www.reuters.com/video/2012/04/30/new-technique-brings-cancer-screening-in?videoId=234198822 | accessdate = 25 June 2012}}ß&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2003 — Breast cancer'''

* Thalachallour Mohanakumar, Ph.D., and other researchers at Siteman develop and test on mice a prototype vaccine that causes cancerous tumors to stop growing, then to shrink. The vaccine, which is being developed to fight breast cancer in humans, helps the immune system target a protein found in 80 percent of breast tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Breast cancer vaccine ready for tests soon | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | date = 10 March 2005 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3315963/Breast-cancer-vaccine-ready-for-tests-soon.html | accessdate = 15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2001 — Imaging and the immune system’s role in controlling cancer'''

* Research led by Joanne Mortimer, M.D., shows that [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans can often identify within two weeks which women with advanced breast cancer are likely to respond to [[hormone therapy]], a gentler alternative to chemotherapy that is usually just as effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hesman | first = Tina | title = Scan test may aid choice for breast cancer therapy | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | location = St. Louis | pages = C5 | date = 15 June 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings may make possible a blood test that would determine what dose, or even which drugs, would be most effective for each patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Cancer Care Tied to Genetic Makeup | newspaper = The Toronto Star | pages = A06 | date = 26 March 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1998 — Biopsies'''

* Ralph G. Dacey Jr., M.D., performs the world's first magnetic [[stereotactic surgery]] to biopsy a human brain tumor using an indirect route to the tumor. The route is designed to avoid regions that would normally be entered when a surgeon manually inserts a surgical tool straight at a site. The investigational computerized system allows surgeons to carefully manipulate surgical tools inside the brain through the use of a catheter driven by precisely controlled magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = First magnet-controlled brain surgery performed | newspaper = BBC News | date = 23 December 1998 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/241244.stm | accessdate = 13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1994 — Genetic screening test for thyroid cancer'''

* Led in part by Helen Donis-Keller, Ph.D., researchers for the first time develop genetic screening tests that detect a rare, lethal form of [[thyroid cancer]] in the preclinical state, permitting early treatment in children predisposed to the disease. It was the first surgical prevention of cancer based on genetic test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Signor | first = Roger | title = WU Surgeons Remove Gland, Cancer Threat | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | location = St. Louis, Missouri | pages = 1A | date = 29 June 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1979 — Bone marrow transplants'''

* As part of a clinical trial, [[leukemia]] patients at Washington University in St. Louis and four other medical centers receive transplants of their healthy bone marrow cells to determine how effective the procedure is in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The new technique would later be called autologous [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Leukemia Victims Get Own Marrow In Transplants | newspaper = The Washington Post | location = Washington, D.C. | pages = A9 | date = 24 August 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mid-1970s — Imaging'''

'''1954 — Growth factors and cancer'''

* [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], Ph.D., and [[Stanley Cohen (biochemist)|Stanley Cohen]], Ph.D., isolate for the first time [[nerve growth factor]], a potent substance that promotes nerve cell growth. The discovery later leads to insights into cancer and birth defects, and in 1986 the two are awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The New Nobels | newspaper = Newsweek | pages = 111 | date = 27 October 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1691">'''American Anti-Drug Council ''' originated as an anti-[[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] campaign.  The mission of this council is to help teens stand up to negative choices and aims to educate about the  dangers of Illegal drugs. The council tries to keep pages on social network sites from posting illegal drug content.
The council has even blasted some celebrities for posting smoking selfies. 

The AADC is located in the state of [[Tennessee]] and was established in 2008. 
[[File:The American Anti Drug Council Loo.jpg|thumb|200px|American Anti-Drug Council logo]]

== AADC campaigns ==
The American Anti-Drug Council has run many anti-drug campaigns. In 2014 it ran a campaign called "College 101"  which looked at how college kids are using illegal drugs to stay up longer to study. Another was the "Forget Pot" campaign, which focused on how smoking marijuana has caused a lot of teens to fail classes or even drop out of high school. Its 2015 campaign is called "Pick Healthy." This is not focused on a particular drug, but tries to get people to pick healthy fruits instead of using deadly drugs. This campaign wants people to use the "#pickhealthy" hastag when someone is eating a healthy treat.

== Blasting celebrities ==
The American Anti-Drug Council has blasted many celebrities for posting smoking selfies or drug content images. The AADC requests that if these celebrities post this kind of content  they should have +18 in their bio which means no one under 18 should view their page. The AADC has posted comments on [[Snoop Dogg]]'s Instagram claiming that he is "targeting the youth to smoke marijuana."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5462">'''''Arseculeratne v. Priyani Soysa''''' is a landmark and controversial case of alleged [[medical malpractice]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. Apart from being the first such case in recent times, it is also unique because the principal parties to the case were well known professionals of the country - lawyer Rienzie Arseculeratne (Plaintiff) and Emeritus Professor of Paediatrics, [[Priyani Soysa]] (Defendant).

== Material facts ==
The plaintiff's three-year-old daughter Suhani, was shown to the defendant with the complaint of dragging of feet. The defendant examined the child and observed involuntary movements of the upper limbs based on which she made a diagnosis of [[Rheumatic Chorea]] and admitted the child to hospital for further management. As there was no improvement in the child's condition after several days of hospital stay, the plaintiff discharged his daughter from the care of the defendant and entrusted her to Professor [[Sanath Lamabathusooriya]], Professor of Paediatrics of the [[Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo]].

Prof. Lamabadusuriya initially concurred with the diagnosis of Rheumatic Chorea, making an entry in the Bed Head Ticket- ''"All features of Rheumatic Chorea Seen"''. He however noted that, unlike in Rheumatic Chorea, the tendon reflexes were brisk. Two days later after re-examining the child, Prof. Lamabadusuriya ordered a [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] scan of the brain, since he could not exclude the possibility of a Space Occupying Lesion in the Brain. 

The CT Scan revealed a Brain Stem [[Glioma]] (BSG), which is a growth of certain nerve cells in the proximal part of the brain which houses most of the vital structures necessary for life - hence it is associated with a very poor prognosis [http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic40.htm]. The local neurosurgeons consulted were unanimous in their opinion that the tumour was inoperable. The distressed parents thereafter took the child to the United Kingdom for review by Neurosurgeon Dr. Srilal Dias, who also stated that no surgery was possible in the present state.

The child died a few days after returning to Sri Lanka.

== Legal issues ==

The plaintiff's case was that the defendant was negligent in not diagnosing Brain Stem Glioma and in the misdiagnosis of Rheumatic Chorea. Had a timely diagnosis been made, it was argued by the plaintiff, survival or prolongation of life would have been possible.

Although the plaintiff listed several specialist doctors including Prof. Lamabadusuriya as witnesses, only Dr. Srilal Dias was called to give evidence. It was alleged by his counsel that doctors in the country were reluctant to testify against the defendant in view of her esteemed standing in the medical profession. 

Dr. Dias claimed that had the BSG been diagnosed earlier curative radiotherapy or surgery would have been possible. His claim was disputed by all expert witnesses who testified for the defendant, including the eminent neurosurgeon Dr. Shelton Cabraal. Since the tumour was found in the brain stem region it is extremely unlikely that any form of treatment would have had prospect of cure.

The defendant argued that since Prof. Lamabadusuriya too made an initial diagnosis of Rheumatic Chorea and ordered a CT scan only two days later, she was not negligent in her care. This argument was controversially rejected by all courts including the Supreme Court, which held that the defendant was negligent in not ordering a CT Scan.

Since Brain Stem Glioma was a terminal condition with no prospect of effective treatment, it was also argued for the defendant that even if her negligence was established, causation had not been proved and as such the plaintiff's action should fail. It was on this ground that the Supreme Court allowed her appeal.

== The trial ==

The case lasted almost a decade traversing the full extent of litigation in the country - from the District Court of Colombo to the Court of Appeal to finally the Supreme Court. The District Court upheld the Plaintiff's case and awarded him Rs. 5,000,000 (around US$ 125,000 at the time) and costs. 

Arseculeratne was represented by eminent civil lawyer President's Counsel Romesh de Silva throughout the proceedings while Prof. Soysa was defended by Queen's Counsel Vernon Wijetunga at the District Court,  and later by President's Counsel H.L. de Silva and senior lawyer R.K.W. Goonesekere at the appellate courts.

Prof. Soysa's appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed, however the quantum of damages was reduced as under the Common Law of Sri Lanka which is Roman Dutch law, damages could only be awarded for patrimonial loss. The Supreme Court allowed Prof. Soysa's appeal setting aside judgments of both lower courts. In a landmark judgment heavily critical of the decisions of the lower courts, the Supreme Court held that causation was not established on a balance of probabilities by the plaintiff. The defendant was also allowed costs of action, which she declined to accept.

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Asbestosis is caused by [[inhalation|breathing in]] asbestos fibers.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Int/&gt; Generally it requires a relatively large exposure over a long period of time.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Int/&gt; Such levels of exposure typically only occur in those who work with the material.&lt;ref name=EU2009/&gt; All types of asbestos fibers are associated with concerns.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Ca&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestosis symptoms and treatments|url=https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/asbestosis#causes|website=NHS Inform|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recommended that currently existing asbestos be left undisturbed.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Pre&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestosis symptoms and treatments|url=https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/asbestosis#prevention|website=NHS Inform|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is based upon a history of exposure together with [[medical imaging]].&lt;ref name=Mer2013/&gt; Asbestosis is a type of [[interstitial pulmonary fibrosis]].&lt;ref name=Mer2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestosis - Pulmonary Disorders|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/en-ca/professional/pulmonary-disorders/environmental-pulmonary-diseases/asbestosis|website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|accessdate=19 December 2017|language=en-CA|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
There is no specific treatment.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Int/&gt; Recommendations may include [[influenza vaccination]], [[pneumococcal vaccination]], [[oxygen therapy]], and stopping [[smoking]].&lt;ref name=NIH2017Tx&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestosis symptoms and treatments|url=https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/asbestosis#treatment|website=NHS Inform|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asbestosis affected about 157,000 people and resulted in 3,600 deaths in 2015.&lt;ref name=GBD2015De&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators.|title=Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.|journal=Lancet|date=8 October 2016|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1459–1544|pmid=27733281|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(16)31012-1|pmc=5388903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence|first1=Collaborators.|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.|journal=Lancet|date=8 October 2016|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1545–1602|pmid=27733282|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31678-6|pmc=5055577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asbestos use has been banned in a number of countries in an effort to prevent disease.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Int/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of asbestosis typically manifest after a significant amount of time has passed following asbestos exposure, often several decades under current conditions in the US.&lt;ref name="ATS 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=American Thoracic Society |title=Diagnosis and initial management of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos |journal=Am.

When a [[physician]] listens with a stethoscope to the lungs of a person with asbestosis, they may hear inspiratory [[crackles]].

The characteristic pulmonary function finding in asbestosis is a restrictive ventilatory defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller A, Lilis R, Godbold J, Chan E, Selikoff IJ |title=Relationship of pulmonary function to radiographic interstitial fibrosis in 2,611 long-term asbestos insulators.

The TLC may be reduced through alveolar wall thickening; however, this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kilburn KH, Warshaw RH |title=Airways obstruction from asbestos exposure.

==Cause==
[[File:Weißasbestfaser 5000fach Rasterelektronenmikroskop.jpg|thumb|[[White asbestos]] fibers identified in room air analysis, magnified 5000 times using a [[scanning electron microscope]]]]
The cause of asbestosis is the [[inhalation]] of microscopic [[asbestos]] mineral fibers suspended in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/asbestos/default.html|title=Asbestos|website=CDC|accessdate=13 November 2015|date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, E. R. A. Merewether found that greater exposure resulted in greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Health Effects of Asbestos: An Evidence-based Approach|date=2015|isbn=9781498728409|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=mTDSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathogenesis==
Asbestosis is the scarring of lung tissue (beginning around terminal [[bronchiole]]s and [[alveolar duct]]s and extending into the alveolar walls) resulting from the inhalation of [[asbestos]] fibers. There are two types of fibers: amphibole (thin and straight) and serpentine (curly). All forms of asbestos fibers are responsible for human disease as they are able to penetrate deeply into the lungs.  When such fibers reach the alveoli (air sacs) in the lung, where oxygen is transferred into the blood, the foreign bodies (asbestos fibers) cause the activation of the lungs' local [[immune system]] and provoke an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] reaction dominated by lung macrophages that respond to chemotactic factors activated by the fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Warheit D. B. |author2=Hill L. H. |author3=George G. |author4=Brody A. R. | year = 1986 | title = Time Course of chemotactic factor generation and the macrophage response to asbestos inhalation | url = | journal = Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. | volume = 134 | issue = | pages = 128–133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This inflammatory reaction can be described as chronic rather than acute, with a slow ongoing progression of the immune system attempting to eliminate the foreign fibers. [[Macrophage]]s [[phagocytosis|phagocytose]] (ingest) the fibers and stimulate [[fibroblast]]s to deposit connective tissue. Due to the asbestos fibers' natural resistance to digestion, some macrophages are killed and others release [[cytokine|inflammatory chemical signals]], attracting further lung macrophages and fibrolastic cells that synthesize fibrous scar tissue, which eventually becomes diffuse and can progress in heavily exposed individuals. This tissue can be seen microscopically soon after exposure in animal models.   Some asbestos fibers become layered by an iron-containing proteinaceous material ([[ferruginous body]]) in cases of heavy exposure where about 10% of the fibers become coated.  Most inhaled asbestos fibers remain uncoated.  About 20% of the inhaled fibers are transported by cytoskeletal components of the alveolar epithelium to the interstitial compartment of the lung where they interact with macrophages and mesenchymal cells. The cytokines, transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, appear to play major roles in the development of  scarring inasmuch as the process can be blocked in animal models by preventing the expression of the growth factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liu J.-Y. |author2=Brass D.

Cell Mol. Biol. | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 3–7 | doi=10.1165/ajrcmb.25.1.4481}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is fibrosis in the interstitial space, thus asbestosis. This fibrotic scarring causes alveolar walls to thicken, which reduces elasticity and gas diffusion, reducing oxygen transfer to the blood as well as the removal of [[carbon dioxide]].  This can result in shortness of breath, a common symptom exhibited by individuals with asbestosis.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, A. R.  Asbestosis.  In: Comprehensive Toxicology.  (Roth, R. A., Ed.), Elsevier Science, New York, Vol. 8(25), pp. 393–413, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

[[Image:Asbestosis.ILO 2-2 S-S.jpg|thumb|Close-up asbestosis right lower zone ILO 2/2 S/S]]
[[Image:Early Asbestosis in a Retired Pipe Fitter.jpg|thumb|right|Lateral chest X-ray in asbestosis shows plaquing of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].]]
According to the [[American Thoracic Society]] (ATS), the general diagnostic criteria for asbestosis are:&lt;ref name="ATS 2004"/&gt;
*Evidence of structural pathology consistent with asbestosis, as documented by imaging or histology
*Evidence of causation by asbestos as documented by the occupational and environmental history, markers of exposure (usually pleural plaques), recovery of asbestos bodies, or other means
*Exclusion of alternative plausible causes for the findings

The abnormal chest x-ray and its interpretation remain the most important factors in establishing the presence of pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;ref name="ATS 2004"/&gt; The findings usually appear as small, irregular parenchymal opacities, primarily in the lung bases. Using the [[ILO Classification]] system, "s", "t", and/or "u" opacities predominate. CT or high-resolution CT (HRCT) are more sensitive than plain radiography at detecting pulmonary fibrosis (as well as any underlying pleural changes). More than 50% of people affected with asbestosis develop plaques in the [[parietal pleura]], the space between the chest wall and lungs. Once apparent, the radiographic findings in asbestosis may slowly progress or remain static, even in the absence of further asbestos exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Becklake MR, Case BW |title=Fiber burden and asbestos-related lung disease: determinants of dose-response relationships |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=150 |issue=6 Pt 1 |pages=1488–92 |date=December 1994 |pmid=7952604 |url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7952604 |doi=10.1164/ajrccm.150.6.7952604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid progression suggests an alternative diagnosis.

Asbestosis resembles many other diffuse interstitial lung diseases, including other [[pneumoconiosis]]. The differential diagnosis includes [[idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]] (IPF), [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], [[sarcoidosis]], and others. The presence of pleural plaquing may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although lung biopsy is usually not necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with pulmonary fibrosis establishes the diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Craighead JE, Abraham JL, Churg A |title=The pathology of asbestos-associated diseases of the lungs and pleural cavities: diagnostic criteria and proposed grading schema. Report of the Pneumoconiosis Committee of the College of American Pathologists and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |journal=Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. |volume=106 |issue=11 |pages=544–96 |date=October 1982 |pmid=6897166 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis in the absence of asbestos bodies is most likely not asbestosis.&lt;ref name="ATS 2004"/&gt; Asbestos bodies in the absence of fibrosis indicate exposure, not disease.

There is no cure available for asbestosis.&lt;ref name="Castleman"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Berger, Stephen A. |author2=Castleman, Barry I. |title=Asbestos: medical and legal aspects |publisher=Aspen |location=Gaithersburg MD |year=2005 |isbn=0-7355-5260-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxygen therapy]] at home is often necessary to relieve the shortness of breath and correct underlying low blood oxygen levels. Supportive treatment of symptoms includes respiratory [[physiotherapy]] to remove secretions from the lungs by postural drainage, chest percussion, and vibration. [[Nebulizer|Nebulized]] medications may be prescribed in order to loosen secretions or treat underlying [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]. Immunization against [[pneumococcal pneumonia]] and annual [[influenza]] vaccination is administered due to increased sensitivity to the diseases. Those with asbestosis are at increased risk for certain cancers. If the person smokes, quitting the habit reduces further damage. Periodic pulmonary function tests, chest x-rays, and clinical evaluations, including cancer screening/evaluations, are given to detect additional hazards.

{{main|Asbestos and the law}}

The death of [[England|English]] textile worker [[Nellie Kershaw]] in 1924 from pulmonary asbestosis was the first case to be described in medical literature, and the first published account of disease attributed to occupational asbestos exposure. However, her former employers (Turner Brothers Asbestos) denied that asbestosis even existed because the medical condition was not officially recognised at the time. As a result, they accepted no liability for her injuries and paid no compensation, either to Kershaw during her final illness or to her bereaved family after she had died. Even so, the findings of the [[inquest]] into her death were highly influential insofar as they led to a parliamentary enquiry by the [[British Parliament]]. The enquiry formally acknowledged the existence of asbestosis, recognised that it was hazardous to health and concluded that it was irrefutably linked to the prolonged inhalation of asbestos dust. Having established the existence of asbestosis on a medical and judicial basis, the report resulted in the first Asbestos Industry Regulations being published in 1931, which came into effect on 1 March 1932.&lt;ref name="cooke"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.3317.147|author=Cooke WE |title=Fibrosis of the Lungs due to the Inhalation of Asbestos Dust |journal=[[BMJ|Br Med J]] |volume=2 |issue=3317 |pages=140–2, 147 |date=1924-07-26 |pmc=2304688|pmid=20771679}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="selikoff"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1001/jama.265.7.898|last1=Selikoff|first1=Irving J.|last2=Greenberg|first2=Morris|title=A Landmark Case in Asbestosis|journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]|volume=265|issue=7|pages =898–901 |date=1991-02-20 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/265/7/898.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=1825122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers occurred in 1929.  Since then, many lawsuits have been filed against  asbestos manufacturers and employers, for neglecting to implement safety measures after the link between asbestos, asbestosis and mesothelioma became known (some reports seem to place this [[Asbestos#Asbestosis and cancer|as early as 1898]] in modern times).  The liability resulting from the sheer number of lawsuits and people affected has reached billions of dollars.  The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Armley asbestos disaster]], [[Spodden Valley asbestos controversy]], [[Turner &amp; Newall]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, about 100 companies have declared bankruptcy at least partially due to asbestos-related liability. In accordance with Chapter 11 and  § 524(g) of the federal bankruptcy code, a company may transfer its liabilities and certain assets to an asbestos personal injury trust, which is then responsible for compensating present and future claimants. Since 1988, 60 trusts have been established to pay claims with about $37 billion in total assets. From 1988 through 2010, analysis from the United States Government Accountability Office indicates that trusts have paid about 3.3 million claims valued at about $17.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mesothelioma.guide/documents/asbestos-litigation-report.pdf Report to the Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives] Retrieved April 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benzo(e)pyrene.png|thumb|right|Chemical structure of benzo[e]pyrene|125px]]
A '''benzopyrene''' is an [[organic compound]] with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Structurally speaking, the colorless isomers of benzopyrene are pentacyclic hydrocarbons and are fusion products of [[pyrene]] and a [[phenylene|phenylene group]]. Two [[isomer]]ic species of benzopyrene are [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]] and the less common [[benzo(e)pyrene|benzo[''e'']pyrene]]. They belong to the chemical class of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.

==Overview==
Related compounds include [[cyclopentapyrenes]], [[dibenzopyrenes]], [[indenopyrenes]] and [[naphthopyrenes]]. Benzopyrene is a component of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and occurs together with other related pentacyclic [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] species such as [[picene]], benzo[[fluoranthene]]s, and [[perylene]].&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Betts "Tar and Pitch" in Kirk‑Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 1997, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. {{DOI| 10.1002/0471238961.20011802052020.a01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is naturally emitted by [[forest fire]]s and [[Volcano|volcanic eruptions]] and can also be found in [[coal tar]], [[cigarette smoke]], wood smoke, and burnt foods such as [[coffee]]. Fumes that develop from fat dripping on blistering charcoal are rich in benzopyrene, which can condense on grilled goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larsson |first=B. K. |year=1983 |title=Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in grilled food |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=867–873 |pmid=6352775 |doi=10.1021/jf00118a049 |last2=Sahlberg |first2=GP |last3=Eriksson |first3=AT |last4=Busk |first4=LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benzopyrenes are harmful because they form carcinogenic and mutagenic [[metabolite]]s (such as [[(+)-Benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide|(+)-benzo[''a'']pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide]] from benzo[''a'']pyrene) which [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalate]] into DNA, interfering with [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].  They are considered [[pollutants]] and carcinogens. The mechanism of action of benzo[a]pyrene-related DNA modification has been investigated extensively and relates to the activity of cytochrome P450 subclass 1A1 ([[Cytochrome P450, family 1, member A1|CYP1A1]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uno |first=S. |year=2006 |title=Oral Benzo[a]pyrene in Cyp1 knockout mouse lines: CYP1A1 important in detoxication, CYP1B1 metabolism required for immune damage independent of total-body burden and clearance rate|journal=Mol.

Evidence exists to link benzo[''a'']pyrene to the formation of [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5286.430 | title = Preferential Formation of Benzo[a]pyrene Adducts at Lung Cancer Mutational Hotspots in P53 | year = 1996 | last1 = Denissenko | first1 = M.

In February 2014, [[NASA]] announced a [http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/ greatly upgraded database] for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including benzopyrene, in the [[universe]]. According to scientists, more than 20% of the [[carbon]] in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible [[PAH world hypothesis|starting materials]] for the [[Abiogenesis#PAH world hypothesis|formation]] of [[Life#Extraterrestrial life|life]]. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the [[Big Bang]], are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with [[Star formation|new stars]] and [[exoplanets]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140221"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?

==Heredity==

{{Main|Cancer syndrome}}
Although there are over 50 identifiable hereditary forms of cancer, less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a cancer-related genetic mutation and these make up less than 3–10% of all cancer cases.&lt;ref name="Expert09" /&gt; The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary ("sporadic cancers"). [[Hereditary cancer]]s are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. A [[cancer syndrome]] or family cancer syndrome is a genetic disorder in which inherited genetic mutations in one or more genes predisposes the affected individuals to the development of cancers and may also cause the early onset of these cancers. Although cancer syndromes exhibit an increased risk of cancer, the risk varies. For some of these diseases, cancer is not the primary feature and is a rare consequence.

Many of these syndromes are caused by mutations in [[tumor suppressor genes]] that regulate cell growth. Other common mutations alter the function of [[DNA repair|DNA repair genes]], [[oncogenes]] and [[Angiogenesis|genes involved in the production of blood vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgson S | title = Mechanisms of inherited cancer susceptibility | journal = Journal of Zhejiang University.

Some [[hormone]]s play a role in the development of cancer by promoting [[cell growth|cell proliferation]].&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20759/|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|vauthors=Henderson BE, Bernstein L, Ross RK|publisher=B.C.

Hormones are important agents in sex-related cancers such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary, and testis, and also of [[thyroid cancer]] and [[bone cancer]].&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;  For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of [[testosterone]] than men of European ancestry, and have a correspondingly much higher level of [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating [[androstanediol glucuronide]], have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;

Other factors are also relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Women who take [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones, and lower risk of cancer.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; [[Osteosarcoma]] may be promoted by [[growth hormone]]s.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;

Some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers. Because steroid hormones are powerful drivers of gene expression in certain cancer cells, changing the levels or activity of certain hormones can cause certain cancers to cease growing or even undergo cell death.&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt; Perhaps the most familiar example of hormonal therapy in oncology is the use of the [[selective estrogen-receptor modulator]] [[tamoxifen]] for the treatment of breast cancer. Another class of hormonal agents, [[aromatase inhibitors]], now have an expanding role in the treatment of breast cancer.

== Infection and inflammation ==
{{Main|Infectious causes of cancer}}
Worldwide, approximately 18% of cancer cases are related to [[infectious disease]]s.&lt;ref name="Enviro2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-06-01|title=Global burden of cancers attributable to infections in 2008: a review and synthetic analysis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204512701377|journal=The Lancet Oncology|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=607–615|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(12)70137-7|issn=1470-2045}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proportion varies in different regions of the world from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world.&lt;ref name="Enviro2008" /&gt; [[Virus]]es are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but [[bacteria]] and [[parasites]] also contribute. Infectious organisms that increase the risk of cancer are frequently a source of DNA damage or genomic instability.

===  Viruses ===
[[File:HPV causing cervical cancer.jpg|thumb|HPV is the most common virus that infects the reproductive tract. Infection can lead to the development of cervical cancer in women.]]

== Radiation ==
{{main|Radiation-induced cancer}}
Up to 10% of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure, including both [[non-ionizing radiation|non-ionizing]] radiation and [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref name="Enviro2008" /&gt; Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, ionizing radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. If it happens to strike a [[chromosome]], it can break the chromosome, result in an [[aneuploidy|abnormal number of chromosomes]], inactivate one or more genes in the part of the chromosome that it hit, delete parts of the DNA sequence, cause [[chromosome translocation]]s, or cause other types of [[chromosome abnormality|chromosome abnormalities]].&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20793/|title=Cancer medicine|author=Little JB|publisher=B.C.

===  Non-ionizing radiation ===
[[File:Squamous cell carcinoma (3).jpg|thumb|Squamous cell carcinoma on the sun-exposed skin of the nose.]]Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic. Low-energy waves on the electromagnetic spectrum including radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light are thought not to be because they have insufficient energey to break [[chemical bonds]]. Non-ionizing [[radio frequency]] radiation from [[mobile phone]]s, [[electric power transmission]], and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf|title=IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans|work=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/latest_classif.php|title=IARC Monographs- Classifications|website=monographs.iarc.fr|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have not found a consistent link between cell phone radiation and cancer risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones|title=Cell Phones and Cancer Risk - National Cancer Institute|date=2013-05-08|publisher=Cancer.gov|access-date=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher-energy radiation, including [[ultraviolet radiation]] (present in sunlight), [[x-rays]], and [[gamma radiation]], generally is carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses. Prolonged exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the [[sun]] can lead to [[melanoma]] and other skin malignancies.&lt;ref name="Cleaver"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20854/|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|vauthors=Cleaver JE, Mitchell DL|publisher=B.C.

Ultraviolet Radiation Carcinogenesis|oclc=|access-date=31 January 2011|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma [[skin cancer]]s caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave [[UVB]], as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.&lt;ref name="Cleaver" /&gt;

===  Ionizing radiation ===
[[File:Meningioma.jpg|thumb|Cross section of a meningioma displacing the underlying brain.]]Sources of ionizing radiation include [[medical imaging]], and [[radon]] gas. Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Medical use of ionizing radiation is a growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced [[leukemia]]s typically require 2–10 years to appear.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation-induced [[meningiomas]] are an uncommon complication of cranial irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamanaka R, Hayano A, Kanayama T | title = Radiation-Induced Meningiomas: An Exhaustive Review of the Literature | journal = World Neurosurgery | volume = 97 | pages = 635–644.e8 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27713063 | doi = 10.1016/j.wneu.2016.09.094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, such as those with [[nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome]] or [[retinoblastoma]], are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

Ionizing radiation is also used in some kinds of [[medical imaging]]. In industrialized countries, medical imaging contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. [[Nuclear medicine]] techniques involve the injection of radioactive pharmaceuticals directly into the bloodstream. [[Radiation therapy|Radiotherapy]] deliberately deliver high doses of radiation to tumors and surrounding tissues as a form of disease treatment. It is estimated that 0.4% of cancers in 2007 in the United States are due to CTs performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5–2% with rates of CT usage during this same time period.&lt;ref name="pmid18046031"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner DJ, Hall EJ | title = Computed tomography--an increasing source of radiation exposure | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 22 | pages = 2277–84 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18046031 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra072149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Low-dose exposures, such as living near a [[nuclear power plant]], are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

==Rare causes==
*

===  Organ transplantation ===
[[File:Metastatic malignant melanoma, heart.jpg|thumb|Malignant melanoma metastases in a heart.]]
The development of donor-derived tumors from [[organ transplants]] is exceedingly rare. The main cause of organ transplant associated tumors seems to be [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], that was undetected at the time of organ harvest.&lt;ref name="pmid16957717"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dingli D, Nowak MA | title = Cancer biology: infectious tumour cells | journal = Nature | volume = 443 | issue = 7107 | pages = 35–6 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16957717 | pmc = 2711443 | doi = 10.1038/443035a | bibcode = 2006Natur.443...35D }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been reports of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] occurring after transplantation due to tumorous outgrowth of virus-infected donor cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barozzi P, Luppi M, Facchetti F, Mecucci C, Alù M, Sarid R, Rasini V, Ravazzini L, Rossi E, Festa S, Crescenzi B, Wolf DG, Schulz TF, Torelli G | title = Post-transplant Kaposi sarcoma originates from the seeding of donor-derived progenitors | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 554–61 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12692543 | doi = 10.1038/nm862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Trauma ===
Physical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20784/|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|vauthors=Gaeta JF|publisher=B.C.

It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by [[kanger]] and kairo heaters (charcoal [[hand warmer]]s), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; Frequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.

=== Maternal-fetal transmission ===
In the United States, approximately 3,500 pregnant women have a malignancy annually, and transplacental transmission of [[acute leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], [[melanoma]] and [[carcinoma]] from mother to fetus has been observed.&lt;ref name="Tolar"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tolar J, Neglia JP | title = Transplacental and other routes of cancer transmission between individuals | journal = Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 430–4 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12794519 | doi = 10.1097/00043426-200306000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and only a marginal few organ donors, cancer is generally not a [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible disease]]. The main reason for this is tissue graft rejection caused by [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] [[histocompatibility|incompatibility]].&lt;ref name="Tolar" /&gt; In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between "self" and "non-self" cells because these antigens are different from person to person. When non-self antigens are encountered, the immune system reacts against the appropriate cell. Such reactions may protect against tumor cell engraftment by eliminating implanted cells.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3677">'''Clarifying agents''' are used to remove suspended solids from liquids by inducing [[flocculation]] (the solids begin to aggregate forming flakes, which either precipitate to the bottom or float to the surface of the liquid, and then they can be removed or collected).

==Process==
Particles finer than 0.1&amp;nbsp;µm (10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;m) in water remains continuously in motion due to electrostatic charge (often negative) which causes them to repel each other. Once their electrostatic charge is neutralized by the use of a coagulant chemical, the finer particles start to collide and agglomerate (collect together) under the influence of [[van der Waals force|Van der Waals]]'s forces. These larger and heavier particles are called flocs.

Flocculants, or flocculating agents (also known as flocking agents), are chemicals that promote flocculation by causing [[colloid]]s and other suspended particles in liquids to aggregate, forming a floc. Flocculants are used in water treatment processes to improve the sedimentation or filterability of small particles. For example, a flocculant may be used in [[swimming pool]] or [[drinking water]] filtration to aid removal of microscopic particles which would otherwise cause the [[water]] to be [[Turbidity|turbid]] (cloudy) and which would be difficult or impossible to remove by filtration alone.

Many flocculants are multivalent [[cations]] such as [[aluminium]], [[iron]], [[calcium]] or [[magnesium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Global Health and Education Foundation | title = Conventional Coagulation-Flocculation-Sedimentation | work = Safe Drinking Water is Essential | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | year = 2007 | url = http://drinking-water.org/html/en/Treatment/Coagulation-Flocculation-technologies.html | accessdate = 2007-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These positively charged molecules interact with negatively charged particles and molecules to reduce the barriers to aggregation. In addition, many of these chemicals, under appropriate [[pH]] and other conditions such as temperature and [[salinity]], react with water to form insoluble [[hydroxide]]s which, upon precipitating, link together to form long chains or meshes, physically trapping small particles into the larger floc.

Long-chain polymer flocculants, such as modified [[polyacrylamide]]s, are manufactured and sold by the flocculant producing business. These can be supplied in dry or liquid form for use in the flocculation process. The most common liquid polyacrylamide is supplied as an emulsion with 10-40% actives and the rest is a non-aqueous carrier fluid, surfactants and [[latex]]. This form allows easy handling of viscous polymers at high concentrations. These emulsion polymers require "activation" - inversion of the emulsion so that the polymers molecules form an aqueous solution.

'''Compartmental models''' are a technique used to simplify the [[mathematical modelling of infectious disease]]. The population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics. Its origin is in the early 20th century, with an important early work being that of [[Kermack–McKendrick theory|Kermack and McKendrick in 1927]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kermack WO, McKendrick AG |title=A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Epidemics |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |volume=115 |issue=772 |pages=700–721 |date=August 1, 1927 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The models are usually investigated through ordinary differential equations (which are deterministic), but can also be viewed in a stochastic framework, which is more realistic but also more complicated to analyse.

Compartmental models may be used to predict properties of how a disease spreads, for example the prevalence (total number of infected) or the duration of an epidemic. Also, the model allows for understanding how different situations may affect the outcome of the epidemic, e.g., what the most efficient technique is for issuing a limited number of vaccines in a given population.

==The SIR model==

The '''SIR model''' is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivations of this basic form. The model consists of three compartments– '''S''' for the number '''s'''usceptible, '''I''' for the number of '''i'''nfectious, and '''R''' for the number '''r'''ecovered (or immune). This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human, and where recovery confers lasting resistance, such as [[measles]], [[mumps]] and [[rubella]].
[[File:SIR model simulated using python.gif|thumb|Spatial SIR model simulation. Each cell can infect its eight immediate neighbors.]]

These variables ('''S''', '''I''', and '''R''') represent the number of people in each compartment at a particular time. To represent that the number of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals may vary over time (even if the total population size remains constant), we make the precise numbers a function of ''t'' (time): '''S'''(''t''), '''I'''(''t'') and '''R'''(''t''). For a specific disease in a specific population, these functions may be worked out in order to predict possible outbreaks and bring them under control.

===The SIR model is dynamic in three senses===

As implied by the variable function of ''t'', the model is dynamic in that the numbers in each compartment may fluctuate over time. The importance of this dynamic aspect is most obvious in an [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] disease with a short infectious period, such as [[measles]] in the UK prior to the introduction of a [[vaccination|vaccine]] in 1968. Such diseases tend to occur in cycles of outbreaks due to the variation in number of susceptibles (S(''t'')) over time. During an [[epidemic]], the number of susceptible individuals falls rapidly as more of them are infected and thus enter the infectious and recovered compartments. The disease cannot break out again until the number of susceptibles has built back up as a result of offspring being born into the susceptible compartment.
[[File:Sirsys-p9.png|thumb|Blue=Susceptible, Green=Infected, and Red=Recovered]]
Each member of the population typically progresses from susceptible to infectious to recovered. This can be shown as a flow diagram in which the boxes represent the different compartments and the arrows the transition between compartments, i.e.
[[File:SIR.PNG|center|frameless|220x220px]]

===Transition rates===

For the full specification of the model, the arrows should be labeled with the transition rates between compartments. Between S and I, the transition rate is βI, where β is the contact rate, which takes into account the probability of getting the disease in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject.

Between I and R, the transition rate is γ (simply the rate of recovery or death). If the duration of the infection is denoted ''D'', then γ = 1/''D'', since an individual experiences one recovery in ''D'' units of time.

It's assumed that the permanence of each single subject in the epidemic states is a random variable with exponential distribution. More complex and realistic distributions (such as [[Erlang distribution]]) can be equally used with few modifications.

==Bio-mathematical deterministic treatment of the SIR model==

===The SIR model without vital dynamics===

The dynamics of an epidemic, for example the [[Influenza|flu]], are often much faster than the dynamics of birth and death, therefore, birth and death are often omitted in simple compartmental models.  The SIR system without so-called vital dynamics (birth and death, sometimes called demography) described above can be expressed by the following set of ordinary [[differential equations]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hethcote H |title=The Mathematics of Infectious Diseases |journal=SIAM Review |volume=42  |issue= 4|pages=599–653 |year=2000 |url=http://leonidzhukov.net/hse/2014/socialnetworks/papers/2000SiamRev.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta I S}{N} &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta I S}{N}- \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;.

This model was for the first time proposed by O. Kermack and [[Anderson Gray McKendrick]] as a special case of what we now call [[Kermack-McKendrick theory]], and followed work McKendrick had done with [[Ronald Ross]].

This system is [[non-linear]], and does not admit a generic [[analytic solution]]. Nevertheless, significant results can be derived analytically, and with Monte Carlo methods, such as the [[Gillespie algorithm]].

Firstly note that from:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} + \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{dR}{dt}  = 0  &lt;/math&gt;,

it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt; S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = \textrm{Constant} = N  &lt;/math&gt;,

expressing in mathematical terms the constancy of population &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;. Note that the above relationship implies that one need only study the equation for two of the three variables.

Secondly, we note that the dynamics of the infectious class depends on the following ratio:
:&lt;math&gt; R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;,
the so-called [[basic reproduction number]] (also called basic reproduction ratio). This ratio is derived as the expected number of new infections (these new infections are sometimes called secondary infections) from a single infection in a population where all subjects are susceptible.&lt;ref name=Bailey1975&gt;{{cite book |author=Bailey, Norman T. J. |title=The mathematical theory of infectious diseases and its applications |publisher=Griffin |location=London |year=1975 |isbn=0-85264-231-8 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nunn2006&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sonia Altizer |author2=Nunn, Charles |title=Infectious diseases in primates: behavior, ecology and evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-856585-2 |series=Oxford Series in Ecology and Evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea can probably be more readily seen if we say that the typical time between contacts is &lt;math&gt; T_{c} = \beta^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and the typical time until recovery is &lt;math&gt; T_{r} = \gamma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. From here it follows that, on average, the number of contacts by an infected individual with others ''before'' the infected has recovered is: &lt;math&gt; T_{r}/T_{c}. &lt;/math&gt;

By dividing the first differential equation by the third, [[Separation of variables|separating the variables]] and integrating we get
:&lt;math&gt; S(t) = S(0) e^{-R_0(R(t) - R(0))/N} &lt;/math&gt;,
(where &lt;math&gt;S(0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R(0)&lt;/math&gt; are the initial numbers of, respectively, susceptible and removed subjects). Thus, in the limit &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow +\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the proportion of recovered individuals obeys the following [[transcendental equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\infty} = N - S(0)e^{-R_0(R_{\infty} - R(0))/N} &lt;/math&gt;.
This equation shows that at the end of an epidemic, unless &lt;math&gt;S(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, not all individuals of the population have recovered, so some must remain susceptible. This means that the end of an epidemic is caused by the decline in the number of infected individuals rather than an absolute lack of susceptible subjects.
The role of the [[basic reproduction number]] is extremely important. In fact, upon rewriting the equation for infectious individuals as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = (R_0 S/N  - 1) \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;,
it yields that if:
:&lt;math&gt; R_{0} &gt; \frac{N}{S(0)} ,&lt;/math&gt;
then:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt}(0) &gt;0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e., there will be a proper epidemic outbreak with an increase of the number of the  infectious (which can reach a considerable fraction of the population). On the contrary, if
:&lt;math&gt; R_{0} &lt; \frac{N}{S(0)} ,&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt}(0) &lt;0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e., independently from the initial size of the susceptible population the disease can never cause a proper epidemic outbreak. As a consequence, it is clear that the [[basic reproduction number]]  is extremely important.

===The force of infection===

Note that in the above model the function:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \beta I ,&lt;/math&gt;

models the transition rate from the compartment of susceptible individuals to the compartment of infectious individuals, so that it is called the force of infection. However, for large classes of communicable diseases it is more realistic to consider a force of infection that does not depend on the absolute number of infectious subjects, but on their fraction (with respect to the total constant population &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt; F = \beta \frac{I}{N} .&lt;/math&gt;

Capasso and, afterwards, other authors have proposed nonlinear forces of infection to model more realistically the contagion process.

===Exact analytical solutions to the SIR model===
In 2014, Harko T. et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harko T., Lobo F.S.N., and Mak M.K. |title=Exact analytical solutions of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model and of the SIR model with equal death and birth rates. |journal=Applied Mathematics and Computation |volume=236 |pages=184–194 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived an exact analytical solution to the SIR model. In the without vital dynamics setup, for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(u)=S(t)&lt;/math&gt;, etc., it corresponds to the following time parametrization

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(u)= S(0)u &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(u)= N -R(0) + \rho \ln(u)-S(0)u &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(u)=R(0) -\rho \ln(u)&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;t= \int_u^1 \frac{N}{\beta s(N -R(0)+\rho \ln (s)-S(0)s)} ds&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\gamma N}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;, with initial conditions &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{S}(1),\mathcal{I}(1),\mathcal{R}(1))=(S(0),N -R(0)-S(0),R(0));&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;u_T&lt;u&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u_T&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(u_T)=0&lt;/math&gt;. By the transcendental equation for &lt;math&gt;R_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; above, it follows that &lt;math&gt;u_T=e^{-(R_{\infty}-R(0))/\rho}(=S_{\infty}/S(0)&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;S(0) \neq 0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_{\infty}=0&lt;/math&gt;.

An equivalent analytical solution was found by Miller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Miller, J.C. | title = A note on the derivation of epidemic final sizes | journal = Bulletin of Mathematical Biology | volume = 74 | year=2012 | at= section 4.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Miller, J.C. | title = Mathematical models of SIR disease spread with combined non-sexual and sexual transmission routes | journal = Infectious Disease Modelling | volume = 2 | year=2017 | at = section 2.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; yields

:&lt;math&gt; S(t) = S(0) e^{-\xi(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; I(t) = N-S(t)-R(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R(t) = R(0) + N\frac{\gamma}{\beta} \xi(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \xi(t) = \frac{\beta \int_0^t I(t^*) \, dt^*}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\xi(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the expected number of transmissions an individual has received by time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  The two solutions are related by &lt;math&gt;e^{-\xi(t)} = u&lt;/math&gt;.

Effectively the same result can be found in the original work by Kermack and McKendrick &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kermack WO, McKendrick AG |title=A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Epidemics |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |volume=115 |issue=772 |date=August 1, 1927 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0118 | at = pg 713}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
===The SIR model with vital dynamics and constant population===
Considering a population characterized by a death rate &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and birth rate &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and where a communicable disease is spreading. The model with mass-action transmission is:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \Lambda - \mu S - \beta I S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta I S - \gamma I -\mu I &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I  - \mu R &lt;/math&gt;

for which the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(S(t),I(t),R(t)\right) =\left(\frac{\Lambda}{\mu},0,0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, we can derive a [[basic reproduction number]] :
:&lt;math&gt; R_0 = \frac{ \beta\Lambda }{\mu(\mu+\gamma)}, &lt;/math&gt;
which has threshold properties. In fact, independently from biologically meaningful initial values, one can show that:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 \le 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \left(S(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = \textrm{DFE} = \left(\frac{\Lambda}{\mu},0,0\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 &gt; 1 , I(0)&gt; 0 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \left(S(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = \textrm{EE} = \left(\frac{\gamma+\mu}{\beta},\frac{\mu}{\beta}\left(R_0-1\right),\frac{\gamma}{\beta} \left(R_0-1\right)\right). &lt;/math&gt;

The point EE is called the Endemic Equilibrium. With heuristic arguments, one may show that &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt; may be read as the average number of infections caused by a single infectious subject in a wholly susceptible population, the above relationship biologically means that if this number is less or equal than one the disease goes extinct, whereas if this number is greater than one the disease will remain permanently endemic in the population.

==The SIS model==
[[File:Sissys.png|thumb|Susceptibles and infected get equilibrated.]]
Some infections, for example those from the [[common cold]] and [[influenza]], do not confer any long lasting immunity. Such infections do not give immunization upon recovery from infection, and individuals become susceptible again.

[[File:SIS.PNG|400px|center|SIS compartmental model]]

We have the model:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta S I}{N} + \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta S I}{N} - \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;

Note that denoting with N the total population it holds that:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dt} + \frac{dI}{dt} = 0 \Rightarrow S(t)+I(t) = N&lt;/math&gt;
it follows that:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \left( \beta N - \gamma\right)  I - \beta I^2 &lt;/math&gt;
i.e. the dynamics of infectious is ruled by a logistic equation, so that &lt;math&gt;\forall I(0) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;   \frac{\beta N}{\gamma} \le 1 \Rightarrow \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty}I(t)=0  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;   \frac{\beta N}{\gamma} &gt; 1 \Rightarrow \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty}I(t)=\frac{\beta N - \gamma}{\beta}  &lt;/math&gt;

Fortunately, it is possible to find an analytical solution to this model (by making a transformation of variables: &lt;math&gt;I = y^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and substituting this into the mean-field equations),&lt;ref name=Hethcote1989&gt;{{cite book |author=Hethcote, H. W. |title=in Three Basic Epidemiological Models, Applied Mathematical Ecology, Vol. 18 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that the basic reproduction rate is greater than unity. The solution is given as
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = \frac{I_\infty}{1+V e^{-\chi(t-t_0)}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_\infty = (\beta N -\gamma)/\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the endemic infected population, &lt;math&gt;\chi = \gamma-\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;V = I_\infty/I_0 - 1&lt;/math&gt;. As the system is assumed to be closed, the susceptible population is then &lt;math&gt;S(t) = N - I(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Elaborations on the basic SIR model==

===The MSIR model===

For many infections, including [[measles]], babies are not born into the susceptible compartment but are immune to the disease for the first few months of life due to protection from maternal antibodies (passed across the [[placenta]] and additionally through [[colostrum]]). This is called [[passive immunity]]. This added detail can be shown by including an M class (for maternally derived immunity) at the beginning of the model

[[File:MSIR.PNG|800px|center|MSIR compartmental model]]To indicate this mathematically, an additional compartment is added, M(t), which results in the following differential equations:
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dM}{dT} = B - \delta M - \mu M&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dS}{dT} = \delta M - \beta SI - \mu S&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dI}{dT} = \beta SI - \gamma I - \mu I&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dR}{dT} = \gamma I - \mu R&lt;/math&gt;

===Carrier state===

Some people who have had an infectious disease such as [[tuberculosis]] never completely recover and continue to [[asymptomatic carrier|carry]] the infection, whilst not suffering the disease themselves. They may then move back into the infectious compartment and suffer symptoms (as in tuberculosis) or they may continue to infect others in their carrier state, while not suffering symptoms. The most famous example of this is probably [[Mary Mallon]], who infected 22 people with [[typhoid fever]]. The carrier compartment is labelled C.

[[File:SIR model with carrier.PNG|500px|center|SIR compartmental model with carrier class, C]]

===The SEIR model===

For many important infections there is a significant incubation period during which the individual has been infected but is not yet infectious themselves. During this period the individual is in compartment E (for exposed).

[[File:SEIR.PNG|800px|center|SEIR compartmental model]]

Assuming that the incubation period is a random variable with exponential distribution with
parameter a (i.e. the average incubation period is &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;), and also assuming the presence of vital dynamics with birth rate equal to death rate, we have the model:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dE}{dt} = \beta \frac{I}{N} S - (\mu +a ) E &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = a E - (\gamma +\mu ) I &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I  - \mu R. &lt;/math&gt;

We have &lt;math&gt;S+E+I+R=N&lt;/math&gt;, but this is only constant because of the (degenerate) assumption that birth and death rates are equal; in general &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a variable.

For this model, the basic reproduction number is:

&lt;math&gt;R_0 = \frac{a}{\mu+a}\frac{\beta}{\mu+\gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly to the SIR model, also in this case we have a Disease-Free-Equilibrium (N,0,0,0) and an Endemic Equilibrium EE, and one can show that, independently form biologically meaningful initial conditions

:&lt;math&gt; \left(S(0),E(0),I(0),R(0)\right) \in \left\{(S,E,I,R)\in [0,N]^4 : S \ge 0, E \ge 0, I\ge 0, R\ge 0, S+E+I+R = N \right\}   &lt;/math&gt;

it holds that:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 \le 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),E(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = DFE = \left(N,0,0,0\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 &gt; 1 , I(0)&gt; 0 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),E(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = EE. &lt;/math&gt;

In case of periodically varying contact rate &lt;math&gt;\beta(t)&lt;/math&gt; the condition for the global attractiveness of DFE is that the following linear system with periodic coefficients:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dE_1}{dt} = \beta(t) I_1 - (\gamma +a ) E_1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI_1}{dt} = a E_1 - (\gamma +\mu ) I_1 &lt;/math&gt;
is stable (i.e. it has its Floquet's eigenvalues inside the unit circle in the complex plane).

=== The SEIS model ===
The SEIS model takes into consideration the exposed or latent period of the disease, giving an additional compartment, E(t).
:::&lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{\mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}}}&lt;/math&gt;
In this model an infection does not leave any immunity thus individuals that have recovered return to being susceptible again, moving back into the ''S''(''t'') compartment.  The following differential equations describe this model:
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dS}{dT} = B - \beta SI - \mu S + \gamma I&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dE}{dT} = \beta SI - (\epsilon + \mu)E&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dI}{dT} = \varepsilon E - (\gamma + \mu)I&lt;/math&gt;

=== The MSEIR model ===
For the case of a disease, with the factors of passive immunity, and a latency period there is the MSEIR model.
:::&lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}}}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dM}{dT} = B - \delta M - \mu M &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dS}{dT}  = \delta M - \beta SI - \mu S &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dE}{dT}  = \beta SI - (\varepsilon + \mu)E &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dI}{dT}  = \varepsilon E - (\gamma + \mu)I &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dR}{dT}  = \gamma I - \mu R&lt;/math&gt;

=== The MSEIRS model ===
An MSEIRS model is similar to the MSEIR, but the immunity in the R class would be temporary, so that individuals would regain their susceptibility when the temporary immunity ended.
:::&lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Variable contact rates and pluriannual or chaotic epidemics===
It is well known that the probability of getting a disease is not constant in the time. Some diseases are seasonal, such as the [[Coronavirus|common cold viruses]], which are more prevalent during winter.  With childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, there is a strong correlation with the school calendar, so that during the school holidays the probability of getting such a disease dramatically decreases.

As a consequence, for many classes of diseases one should consider a force of infection with periodically ('seasonal') varying contact rate
:&lt;math&gt; F = \beta(t) \frac{I}{N} , \beta(t+T)=\beta(t)&lt;/math&gt;
with period T equal to one year.

Thus, our model becomes

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N - \mu S - \beta(t) \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta(t) \frac{I}{N} S - (\gamma +\mu ) I &lt;/math&gt;

(the dynamics of recovered easily follows from &lt;math&gt;R=N-S-I&lt;/math&gt;), i.e. a nonlinear set of differential equations with periodically varying parameters. It is well known that this class of dynamical systems may undergo very interesting and complex phenomena of  nonlinear parametric resonance. It is easy to see that if:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T}\frac{\beta(t)}{\mu+\gamma}dt  &lt; 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),I(t)\right) = DFE = \left(N,0\right), &lt;/math&gt;

whereas if the integral is greater than one the disease will not die out and there may be such resonances. For example, considering the periodically varying contact rate as the 'input' of the system one has that the output is a periodic function whose period is a multiple of the period of the input.
This allowed to give a contribution to explain the poly-annual (typically biennial) epidemic outbreaks of some infectious diseases as interplay between the period of the contact rate oscillations and the pseudo-period of the damped oscillations near the endemic equilibrium.
Remarkably, in some cases the behavior may also be quasi-periodic or even chaotic.

==Modelling vaccination==
The SIR model can be modified to model vaccination. Typically these introduce an additional compartment to the SIR model, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, for vaccinated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chauhan|first=Sudipa|last2=Misra|first2=Om Prakash|last3=Dhar|first3=Joydip|date=2014|title=Stability Analysis of SIR Model with Vaccination|url=http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.ajcam.20140401.03.html#Sec3|journal=American Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=|issn=2165-8943|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some examples.

===Vaccinating newborns===
In presence of a communicable diseases, one of main tasks is that of eradicating it via  prevention measures and, if possible, via the establishment of a mass vaccination program. Let us consider a disease for which the newborn are vaccinated (with a vaccine giving lifelong immunity) at a rate &lt;math&gt;P \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N (1-P) - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta \frac{I}{N} S - (\mu+\gamma)  I &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = \mu N P - \mu V&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the class of vaccinated subjects. It is immediate to show that:

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} V(t)= N P,&lt;/math&gt;

thus we shall deal with the long term behavior of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, for which it holds that:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 (1-P) \le 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),I(t)\right) = DFE = \left(N \left(1-P\right),0\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 (1-P) &gt; 1 , I(0)&gt; 0 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),I(t)\right) = EE = \left(\frac{N}{R_0(1-P)},N \left(R_0 (1-P)-1\right)\right). &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if
:&lt;math&gt; P &lt; P^{*}= 1-\frac{1}{R_0}  &lt;/math&gt;
the vaccination program is not successful in eradicating the disease, on the contrary it will remain endemic, although at lower levels than the case of absence of vaccinations. This means that the mathematical model suggests that for a disease whose [[basic reproduction number]] may be as high as 18 one should have to vaccinate 94.4% of newborns in order to eradicate the disease.

===Vaccination and information===
Modern societies are facing the challenge of "rational" exemption, i.e. the family's decision to not vaccinate children as a consequence of a "rational" comparison between the perceived risk from infection and that from getting damages from the vaccine. In order to assess whether this behavior is really rational, i.e. if it can equally lead to the eradication of the disease,  one may simply assume that the vaccination rate is an increasing function of the number of infectious subjects:
:&lt;math&gt; P=P(I),P^{\prime}(I)&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;
In such a case the eradication condition becomes:
:&lt;math&gt; P(0) \ge P^{*},&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. the baseline vaccination rate should be greater than the "mandatory vaccination" threshold, which, in case of exemption, cannot hold. Thus, "rational" exemption might be myopic since it is based only on the current low incidence due to high vaccine coverage, instead taking into account future resurgence of infection due to coverage decline.

===Vaccination of non newborns===
In case there also are vaccinations of non newborn at a rate ρ the equation for the susceptible and vaccinated subject has to be modified as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N (1-P) - \mu S - \rho S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = \mu N P + \rho S - \mu V&lt;/math&gt;

leading to the following eradication condition:

:&lt;math&gt; P \ge 1- \left(1+\frac{\rho}{\mu}\right)\frac{1}{R_0}  &lt;/math&gt;

===Pulse vaccination strategy===
This strategy repeatedly vaccinates a defined age-cohort (such as young children or the elderly) in a susceptible population over time. Using this strategy, the block of susceptible individuals is then immediately removed, making it possible to eliminate an infectious disease, (such as measles), from the entire population. Every T time units a constant fraction p of susceptible subjects is vaccinated in a relatively short (with respect to the dynamics of the disease) time. This leads to the following impulsive differential equations for the susceptible and vaccinated subjects:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N  - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S, S(n T^+) = (1-p) S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = - \mu V,   V(n T^+) = V(n T^-) + p S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that by setting {{math|1=''I'' = 0}} one obtains that the dynamics of the susceptible subjects is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; S^*(t) = 1- \frac{p}{1-(1-p)E^{-\mu T}}E^{-\mu MOD(t,T)}  &lt;/math&gt;

and that the eradication condition is:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 \int_{0}^{T}{S^*(t)dt} &lt; 1  &lt;/math&gt;

==The influence of age: age-structured models==
Age has a deep influence on the disease spread rate in a population, especially the contact rate. This rate summarizes the effectiveness of contacts between susceptible and infectious subjects. Taking into account the ages of the epidemic classes &lt;math&gt;s(t,a),i(t,a),r(t,a)&lt;/math&gt; (to limit ourselves to the susceptible-infectious-removed scheme) such that:

:&lt;math&gt;S(t)=\int_0^{a_M}{s(t,a)da}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I(t)=\int_0^{a_M}{i(t,a)da}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R(t)=\int_0^{a_M}{r(t,a)da}&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;a_M \le +\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum admissible age)and their dynamics is not described, as one might think, by "simple" partial differential equations, but by [[integro-differential equation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t s(t,a) + \partial_a s(t,a) = -\mu(a) s(a,t) - s(a,t)\int_{0}^{a_M}{k(a,a_1;t)i(a_1,t)da_1} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t i(t,a) + \partial_a i(t,a) =  s(a,t)\int_{0}^{a_M}{k(a,a_1;t)i(a_1,t)da_1}  -\mu(a) i(a,t) - \gamma(a)i(a,t)  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t r(t,a) + \partial_a r(t,a) =   -\mu(a) r(a,t) + \gamma(a)i(a,t)  &lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;F(a,t,i(\cdot,\cdot))=\int_{0}^{a_M}{k(a,a_1;t)i(a_1,t)da_1}&lt;/math&gt;

is the force of infection, which, of course, will depend, though the contact kernel &lt;math&gt; k(a,a_1;t) &lt;/math&gt; on the interactions between the ages.

Complexity is added by the initial conditions for newborns (i.e. for a=0), that are straightforward for infectious and removed:

:&lt;math&gt;i(t,0)=r(t,0)=0&lt;/math&gt;

but that are nonlocal for the density of susceptible newborns:

:&lt;math&gt;s(t,0)= \int_{0}^{a_M}{\left(\varphi_s(a) s(a,t)+\varphi_i(a) i(a,t)+\varphi_r(a) r(a,t)\right) da} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varphi_j(a), j=s,i,r&lt;/math&gt; are the fertilities of the adults.

Moreover, defining now the density of the total population &lt;math&gt;n(t,a)=s(t,a)+i(t,a)+r(t,a)&lt;/math&gt;  one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t n(t,a) + \partial_a n(t,a) = -\mu(a) n(a,t) &lt;/math&gt;

In the simplest case of equal fertilities in the three epidemic classes, we have that in oder to have demographic equilibrium the following necessary and sufficient condition linking the fertility &lt;math&gt;\varphi(.)&lt;/math&gt; with the mortality &lt;math&gt;\mu(a)&lt;/math&gt; must hold:

:&lt;math&gt; 1 = \int_0^{a_M}{\varphi(a) \exp\left(- \int_0^a{\mu(q)dq} \right)da } &lt;/math&gt;

and the demographic equilibrium is

:&lt;math&gt;n^*(a)=C \exp\left(- \int_0^a{\mu(q)dq}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

automatically ensuring the existence of the disease-free solution:

:&lt;math&gt;DFS(a)= \left(n^*(a),0,0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

A basic reproduction number can be calculated as the spectral radius of an appropriate functional operator.

== Other considerations within compartmental epidemic models ==

=== Vertical transmission ===
In the case of some diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis B, it is possible for the offspring of infected parents to be born infected.  This transmission of the disease down from the mother is called Vertical Transmission.  The influx of additional members into the infected category can be considered within the model by including a fraction of the newborn members in the infected compartment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brauer, F. &amp; Castillo-Chávez, C. (2001).  ''Mathematical Models in Population Biology and Epidemiology.''  NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vector transmission ===
Diseases transmitted from human to human indirectly, i.e. malaria spread by way of mosquitoes, are transmitted through a vector.  In these cases, the infection transfers from human to insect and an epidemic model must include both species, generally requiring many more compartments than a model for direct transmission.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For more information on this type of model see the reference ''Population Dynamics of Infectious Diseases:  Theory and Applications'', by R. M. Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, R. M. ed. (1982)  ''Population Dynamics of Infectious Diseases:  Theory and Applications'', Chapman and Hall, London-New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
Other occurrences which may need to be considered when modeling an epidemic include things such as the following:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
:•	Nonhomogeneous mixing
:•	Variable infectivity
:•	Distributions that are spatially non-uniform
:•	Diseases caused by macroparasites

==Deterministic versus stochastic epidemic models==
It is important to stress that the deterministic models presented here are valid only in case of sufficiently large populations, and as such should be used cautiously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett MS |title=Measles periodicity and community size |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A |volume=120 |pages=48–70 |year=1957 |doi=10.2307/2342553 |issue=1 |jstor=2342553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be more precise, these models are only valid in the [[thermodynamic limit]], where the population is effectively infinite. In stochastic models, the long-time endemic equilibrium derived above, does not hold, as there is a finite probability that the number of infected individuals drops below one in a system. In a true system then, the pathogen may not propagate, as no host will be infected. But, in deterministic mean-field models, the number of infecteds can take on real, namely, non-integer values of infected hosts, and the pathogen may still persist in the system with a finite number of infected hosts, less than one but greater than zero.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In [[accounting]], '''cost sharing''' or matching means that portion of project or program costs not borne by the funding agency. It includes all contributions, including cash and in-kind, that a recipient makes to an award. If the award is federal, only acceptable non-federal costs qualify as cost sharing and must conform to other necessary and reasonable provisions to accomplish the program objectives. Cost sharing effort is included in the calculation of total committed effort. Effort is defined as the portion of time spent on a particular activity expressed as a percentage of the individual's total activity for the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Cost Sharing|url=http://accounting.ucdavis.edu/costshare/whatis.cfm|publisher=UC Davis Accounting and Financial Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cost sharing can be audited and must be allowable under cost principles and verifiable to records.

A '''[[cost-sharing mechanism]]''' is a [[truthful mechanism]] for deciding what agents should be served by a public project, and how much each of them should pay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8764">'''Doctorandus''' ({{IPA-nl|dɔktoːˈrɑndɵs}}; {{Lang-la|he who should become a [[Doctorate|doctor]]}}), abbreviated '''drs.''', is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[List of academic ranks|academic title]] according to the pre-[[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]]–[[Master's degree|Master]] system. The female form is 'doctoranda' (abbreviated '''dra.''', though this abbreviation is no longer used). The title is acquired by passing the ''doctoraalexamen'', the [[Final examination|exam]] which usually concludes university study. Some students will continue to do research under the supervision of a [[professor]], which eventually allows them to obtain the title of [[Doctorate|doctor]].

In Dutch, the words ''doctoraal'' and ''doctoraat'' have different meanings, the first referring to the doctorandus, the second word referring to the doctorate phase or title. The word 'doctorandus' is based on the traditional principle that this degree is a prerequisite and intermediate step for obtaining a doctorate title. However, in the twentieth century the doctorandi have become considered to be graduates and when they can choose a scientific career, the do usually as a paid ''[[promovendus]]'' and not as research students. An exception are medical students, where the doctoral exam is an intermediate step after which the students have to follow internships, in order to obtain the full medical degree of physician (''arts'' in Dutch).

== Netherlands ==
According to Dutch legislation, the Dutch doctorandus degree is equivalent to the [[Master of Arts|MA]] or [[MSc]] degree in English-speaking countries, with the difference that the coursework and comprehensive exams for a doctorate are included in the academic study. After being graduated to "drs.", the candidate can start with PhD-level research and writing the dissertation without any further exams.

The abbreviation is '''drs.''' This means that Dutch graduates who received the doctorandus title may sign like '''drs. A. Jansen'''. After the [[Bologna process]], the title doctorandus has been replaced by the degrees MA and MSc, and those who receive such Dutch degrees may choose: they may use MA/MSc behind their name, or continue to use drs., mr. or ir., reflecting the field in which they graduated. According to Art. 7.20 of the Dutch law on higher education and scientific research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005682/Hoofdstuk7597869/Titel1/Paragraaf4/Artikel720/geldigheidsdatum_25-08-2011 Art. 7.20 WHW]&lt;/ref&gt; a graduate of a master's degree granted through scientific education (i.e. by a Dutch research university) may sign as ir. (ir. stems from the dutch 'ingenieur' (engineer)) for those who graduated in an academic study of agriculture, natural environment or technical field, mr. (mr. stems from the dutch 'meester' (master) at law) for those who graduated in law and drs. by those who graduated in other fields. According to Art. 7.19a&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005682/Hoofdstuk7597869/Titel1/Paragraaf4/Artikel719a/geldigheidsdatum_25-08-2011 Art. 7.19a WHW]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dutch customs the degrees granted to such graduates are MSc for engineers, MA or MSc for doctoranduses and established by ministerial regulation for jurists (actually LLM). This means that two situations can be discerned:

# Those who received their doctorandus title before the Bologna process have the option of signing like '''A. Jansen, M''', since the old doctorandus title (from before the Bologna process) is similar to a [[Master's degree]], and the shortcut M may officially be used in order to render such title as an international title.&lt;ref name=nvao&gt;[http://www.nvao.net/titulatuur_nl Titulatuur Nederland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930061733/http://www.nvao.net/titulatuur_nl |date=September 30, 2011 }} Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Organization &amp;mdash; this source denies that one may bear a [[Bologna Process|Bologna-style]] bachelor's or master's degree instead of the old titles.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minocw.nl/bachelor/355/Titels.html Opleidingen en titels] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210184259/http://www.minocw.nl/bachelor/355/Titels.html |date=February 10, 2009 }} Dutch Department of Education, Culture and Science. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/titulatuur Titulatuur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304133509/http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/titulatuur |date=March 4, 2012 }} website of the government of the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royal2002&gt;[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/vraag-en-antwoord/welke-titel-mag-ik-voeren-als-ik-ben-afgestudeerd-of-gepromoveerd.html Vraag en antwoord.

# Those who received their master's degree from Dutch research universities after the Bologna process in other fields than agriculture, natural environment, technical field and law may also bear the title doctorandus and alternatively have the option of signing like '''A. Jansen, MA''' or '''A. Jansen, MSc''',&lt;ref&gt;Art. 7.19a, section 2, subsections f and g of the Dutch Law on higher education and scientific research.&lt;/ref&gt; but only as specified on their diploma. In this case, either a MA or a MSc is granted, which entitles one to bear the title doctorandus. This means that people who have graduated soon after 1 September 2002 have no (separate) bachelor's degree, but only a master's degree, which is their first degree.

== Belgium ==
In [[Belgium]] the title drs is only used for graduates working on a [[PhD]], which will then eventually change their title from Drs. to Dr. The title Lic (which stems from 'licentiaat') is used for those who have finished a masters' degree, but it is rarely used.

== Indonesia ==
The degree was also used in [[Indonesia]] until 1994 (because of Indonesia being a former colony of the Netherlands), where it was given to all bachelors except law, agriculture, natural environment, and engineering. The title ir. for academic engineers is still used in Indonesia by those who obtained their degree before 1994.

In Sweden and Estonia the term is used in the form: "doktorand", with the same etymology:  ''he who should become a [[Doctorate|doctor]]'' (but dropping the gender qualifier) to refer to a student reading for his or her doctorate. However, it is not a formal title and is never written abbreviated. Similarly, in Romania it is "doctorand", abbreviated "drd."

'''eHealth Ontario''' is the agency tasked with facilitating the development of [[Ontario]]'s proposed public [[Electronic Health Record]] system.     
[[Health Informatics]] in Canada is run provincially, with different provinces creating different systems, albeit sometimes under voluntary Pan-Canadian guidelines published by the federal body [[Canada Health Infoway]].
eHealth Ontario was created in September 2008 out of a merger between the Ontario Ministry of Health's electronic health program and the Smart Systems for Health Agency (SSHA), with a mandate to create electronic health records for all patients in the province by 2015. 
It has been plagued by delays and its CEO was fired over a multimillion-dollar contracts scandal in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/07/ehealth-kramer.html|title= Head of eHealth Ontario is fired amid contracts scandal, gets big package|accessdate=2009-08-26 | work=CBC News | date=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today eHealth employs approximately 700 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehealthontario.on.ca/pdfs/About/eHealthStrategy.pdf|title=eHealthStrategy|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug Profile Viewer System==
The Drug Profile Viewer System tracks the prescription drug claims information of 2.5 million [[Ontario Drug Benefit Program]] and [[Trillium Drug Program]] recipients. This system is in use in hospitals throughout Ontario and access is being expanded to health care providers outside of the hospital setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ehealthontario.on.ca/programs/dpv.asp |title=Drug Profile Viewer |author=eHealth Ontario |date=2011 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ePrescribing==
eHealth Ontario created a pilot project through which some doctors are now able to electronically send prescriptions to participating local pharmacies instead of having to manually write down the prescriptions on paper. That pilot project is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ehealthontario.on.ca/programs/ePrescribing.asp |title=ePrescribing |author=eHealth Ontario |date=2011 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media Attention over Consultant Use and Contracting Practices==
In May 2009, there were opposition calls for Ontario Health Minister [[David Caplan]]'s resignation after it was revealed that eHealth Ontario CEO Sarah Kramer had approved about $4.8 million in no-bid contracts during the first four months of the agency's operation, while also spending $50,000 to refurnish her office, and paying consultants up to $300 an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2009/05/28/ehealth-mcguinty-review028.html|title=ehealth-mcguinty-review|accessdate=2009-08-26 | work=CBC News | date=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; One consultant earned about $192,000 in five months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/03/ehealth-ontario-untendered-contracts.html|title=Another untendered contract surfaces at embattled eHealth Ontario|accessdate=2009-08-26 | work=CBC News | date=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, nine senior eHealth employees had been fired in a four-month period, some reportedly for challenging the agency's tendering practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/05/28/ehealth-mcguinty-review028.html|title=Opposition wants minister's resignation over eHealth spending|accessdate=2010-09-06 | work=CBC News | date=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramer was later forced to resign in June 2009, amid questions surrounding a $114,000 bonus paid to her. She received a $317,000 severance package with benefits for 10 months.&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/649032|title=eHealth scandal reaches Premier's inner circle|accessdate=2009-08-26 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | first=Tanya | last=Talaga | date=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

eHealth Ontario argued that the no-bid contracts were necessary due to the rapid transition process to eHealth from its predecessor Smart Systems for Health Agency, while Caplan defended Kramer's bonus as part of her move from another agency. The opposition argued that the government of [[Dalton McGuinty|Premier Dalton McGuinty]] spent five years and $647 million on the forerunner of eHealth Ontario: the Smart Systems for Health Agency, which used 15 per cent of its $225-million annual budget on consultants despite employing 166 people with annual salaries exceeding $100,000, before the project was shut down and restarted as eHealth Ontario.

In a public statement, Kramer argued that when she took over as CEO of eHealth Ontario, she "was charged with turning around a failing behemoth - SSHA - which had already run through more than $600 million dollars with hardly anything to show for it in terms of moving Ontario closer to the goal of eHealth, and modernizing and improving the quality and safety of health care for Ontarians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/August2009/13/c4908.html|title=Statement by Sarah Kramer (CNW)|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists have argued that Sarah Kramer received a "trial by media" and that the province of Ontario will be at a loss with her departure, as delivery of eHealth initiatives will be slowed.  Marcus Gee from the Globe and Mail writes, "what happened at eHealth may or may not qualify as scandalous.  What happened to Ms. Kramer certainly does.  This was media lynching.  A good woman and a first-rate civil servant has been hounded from public life, and all of us will suffer for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090611.GEE11ART2252/TPStory/TPComment/ |title=Scandal or not, there's no justice in Sarah Kramer's trial by media |accessdate=2009-08-27 |location=Toronto |work=The Globe and Mail |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011081830/http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090611.GEE11ART2252/TPStory/TPComment |archivedate=October 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists and former health policy advisors have noted that this media attention detracted from the organization’s mandate and ability to deliver on much needed eHealth initiatives and healthcare reform in the province of Ontario. One past policy director for a former Ontario Minister of Health, argued that the public’s focus should be on holding the government accountable for mitigating the problems that have resulted and demanding progress on eHealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theobserver.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&amp;e=1706107|title=Critics' scrutiny of eHealth needs new focus|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andre Picard, a Canadian public health reporter, argued that the public’s focus should be on the delivery of electronic health records and not "disingenuous tsk-tsking about the hiring of consultants."  He writes, "the true scandal in Ontario is the utter failure of the Ministry of Health to create electronic health records, which will ultimately lead to better and more efficient patient care."&lt;ref name="picard1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/the-real-ehealth-ontario-scandal-isnt-over-choco-bites/article1195611/|title=The real eHealth Ontario scandal isn't over Choco Bites|accessdate=2009-08-27 | location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail|first=Andre|last=Picard|date=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picard argued that Ministry of Health bureaucrats are powerless when it comes to making real change in healthcare, as their political boss’s only vision for healthcare is not irritating the public so they can be re-elected.  The result is change and innovation can, seemingly, only come from independent agencies or outside consultants.&lt;ref name="picard1"/&gt;

Two inquiries were launched, but in August 2009, the independent review of eHealth Ontario had been dropped, with Caplan saying it would duplicate the work of Ontario's auditor general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/mcguinty-quietly-drops-ehealth-review/article1227640/|title=McGuinty quietly drops eHealth review|accessdate=2009-08-26 | location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail|first=Keith|last=Leslie|date=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2009, David Caplan resigned, one day before the release of the report into spending scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/10/06/caplan-health-minister-resign641.html|title=Ontario health minister resigns|accessdate=2009-10-06 | work=CBC News | date=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It operated from 1839 to early 1982 and started out as a [[poor house]] and [[poor farm|farm]] but developed into an asylum and hospital.
In 1832 it was called the Wayne County Poorhouse; in 1872 it was the Wayne County Alms House; in 1886 it was referred to simply as the Wayne County House.  In 1913 there were three divisions: The Eloise Hospital (Mental Hospital), the Eloise Infirmary (Poorhouse) and the Eloise Sanitarium (T.B. Hospital) which were collectively called Eloise. In 1945 it was named Wayne County General Hospital and Infirmary at Eloise, Michigan.  In 1974 it had two divisions - the Wayne County General Hospital and the Wayne County Psychiatric Hospital.  The psychiatric division closed in 1977 and in 1979 it was officially called Wayne County General Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Alvin C.|title=A History of the Wayne County Infirmary, Psychiatric, and General Hospital Complex at Eloise, Michigan|year=1982 |publisher=Wayne County General Hospital |location=Detroit }}&lt;/ref&gt;   At its prime, Eloise consisted of 78 buildings and 902 acres of land. Now only ruins, sewer lids with ''Eloise Hospital'' engraved on them, 4 of the 78 buildings and the [[Eloise Cemetery]] remain.

==The history of Eloise==
The Wayne County Poor House was founded in 1832.  It was located at Gratiot and Mt. Elliott Avenues in Hamtramck Township two miles from the Detroit city limits. By 1834 the poorhouse was in bad condition and {{convert|280|acre}} in Nankin Township were purchased.  The Black Horse Tavern which served as a stagecoach stop between Detroit and Chicago was located on the property. In those days it was a two-day stagecoach ride from Hamtramck Township to Nankin Township. The register shows that on April 11, 1839 35 people were transferred from the poorhouse in [[Hamtramck Township, Michigan|Hamtramck Township]] to the new one in Nankin Township.  111 apparently refused to go to the "awful wilderness." Many were children and homes among the residents of the city may have been found for them.&lt;ref name="keenan"/&gt;  The log cabin which was formerly the Black Horse Tavern became the keeper's quarters and in 1838-9 a frame building was put up to house the inmates.  A frame cookhouse was erected in the back of the log building and was used for cooking by both inmates and the keeper's family.&lt;ref name="Ibbotson2002"/&gt;

The complex was almost self-sufficient. It had its own police and fire department, railroad and trolley stations, bakery, amusement hall, laundries, and a powerhouse.  It also had many farm buildings including a dairy herd and [[dairy barn]]s, a [[piggery]], a [[root cellar]], a [[Tobacco]] [[Curing of tobacco|curing building]], formed by Dr. Albarran.  Patients came from Detroit and other communities to have x-rays done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibbotson|first=Patricia|title=Detroit's Hospitals, Healers and Helpers|year=2004 |location=Charleston, SC |publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=0-7385-3223-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also housed the first kidney dialysis unit in the State of Michigan and pioneered in the field of Music Therapy.

As the years went on the institution grew larger and larger, a reflection in the increases in the population of the Detroit area.  From only 35 residents in 1839 the complex grew to about 10,000 residents at its peak during the Great Depression and then started to decrease.  The farm operations ceased in 1958 and some of the large psychiatric buildings were vacated in 1973.
The psychiatric division started closing in 1977 when the State of Michigan took over the psychiatric division.  The general hospital closed in 1986.

Inventor [[Elijah McCoy]] may be its most famous former resident.  He spent a year prior to his death as a patient in the Eloise Infirmary. There were other well-known people who died at Eloise including several baseball players.  Among them are Jul Kustus (died April 27, 1916), Larry LeJeune (died April 21, 1952), Charlie Krause (died March 30, 1948) and Marty Kavanagh (died 1960)  Musician [[Horace Flinders]] was also a patient, and received [[music therapy]].&lt;ref name="Pathe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/genius-in-an-asylum/query/michigan |title=Genius In An Asylum 1946 |type=Film |date=April 15, 1946 |publisher=[[British Pathé News]] |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pathe2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/allbufvc/search.php?q=Mental+health&amp;facet_media_type=documents&amp;sort=relevance |title=Genius In An Asylum 1946 |type=Film |date=April 15, 1946 |publisher=British Pathé News/[[British Universities Film &amp; Video Council]] |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eloise present day==
[[Image:Kay Beard Building Westland Michigan.JPG|thumb|right|Kay Beard Building]]
Today the land that once was Eloise has been developed into a strip mall, a golf course, and condominiums. There are only two buildings currently in use.  One is "D" Building or the Kay Beard Building.  At one time this was an administration building and it was also used for psychiatric admissions and apartments for some employees like the Catholic chaplain.  The old commissary building is currently being used as a family homeless shelter.

The old fire hall (former psychiatric facility laundry), and the power house are still standing in ruins.  The old bakery was lost due to arson in April 2016, with charred ruins still standing as of May 16, 2016 (however, there are plans to raze and remove the remainder).  The Eloise smokestack {{mdash}} emblazoned ''Eloise'' in brick {{mdash}} was deemed to be a hazard and was demolished in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usa.indettaglio.it/eng/panoramio/view_panoramio.html?url=http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/48678112.jpg&amp;titolo=Old%20Eloise%20Asylum%20Smokestack%20From%20Roof&amp;path_panoramio=https://www.panoramio.com/photo/48678112&amp;owner_name=nailhed&amp;owner_url=https://www.panoramio.com/user/5217064 |title=Old Eloise Asylum Smokestack From Roof |type=photograph |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

In 1979, the [[Walter Reuther|Walter P. Reuther]] Psychiatric Hospital, located near the northwest end of the former Eloise property, just southeast of the intersection of Merriman and Palmer Roads, was opened. The facility is currently operated by the [[Michigan Department of Community Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.michigan.gov/mdch/0,4612,7-132-2941_4868_4896-170501--,00.html |title=Walter P. Reuther Psychiatric Hospital |publisher=Michigan Department of Community Health |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Oakwood Health System]] opened an outpatient facility, the Adams Child &amp; Adolescent Health Center, on the corner of Merriman and Palmer near Reuther Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oakwood.org/Adams |title=Oakwood Adams Child &amp; Adolescent Health Center |publisher=Oakwood Health System |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both facilities have Palmer Road addresses.

Eloise is featured in the book ''Annie's Ghosts: A Journey Into a Family Secret'' by Steve Luxenberg, which is about Luxenberg's secret aunt who was committed to the Eloise psychiatric hospital in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;See photo in Eloise: Poorhouse, Farm, Asylum and Hospital, page 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |type=paperback |title=Annie's Ghosts: A Journey Into a Family Secret |first1=Steve |last1=Luxenberg |pages=432 |location=New York  |publisher=Hyperion |edition=Reprint |date=May 11, 2010 |isbn=978-1401310196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is marked by a Michigan Historic Marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michmarkers.com/startup.asp?startpage=S0699.htm |title=Eloise |work=Michigan Historical Markers Registered Site S0699 |date=2007 |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site and the adjoining [[Eloise Cemetery]] are reputed to be [[Haunted house|haunted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0REqAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=eloise+cemetery+haunted+westland+mi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y6Y9TLIaAs&amp;sig=mBCtbC6conrbuzSV0XJ0dWRGdHU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VlxmU_O6FZajyASO7YC4DQ&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=eloise%20cemetery%20haunted%20westland%20mi&amp;f=false |title=A Ghost Hunter's Field Guide

Eloise is featured in the book "Detroit Breakdown" part of D.E. Johnson's Detroit mysteries series, a fictional story about the murder of patients at Eloise.&lt;ref&gt;Minotaur Books (September 4, 2012) {{ISBN|1250006627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also inspired the direct-to-video thriller [[Eloise (2017 film)]].

[[File:Five Rites.jpg|frame|''The Eye of Revelation'' by Peter Kelder]]

The '''Five Tibetan Rites''' is a system of [[exercise]]s reported to be more than 2,500 years old&lt;ref name=Eye&gt;Kelder, Peter: ''The Eye of Revelation''. The New Era Press, Burbank, CA (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; which were first publicized by Peter Kelder in a 1939 publication titled ''The Eye of Revelation''.&lt;ref name=Kelder2&gt;Kelder, Peter: ''The Eye of Revelation'' (1946), ''The Eye of Revelation, edited by J. W. Watt.'' Booklocker.com, Inc., 1st reprint edition (January 10, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rites are said to be a form of [[Trul khor|Tibetan yoga]] similar to the [[yoga series]] that originated in [[India]]. However, the Five Rites and traditional Tibetan yoga both emphasize "a continuous sequence of movement" (Sanskrit: [[vinyasa]]), whereas Indian forms focus on "static positions". Although the Rites have circulated amongst yogis for decades, skeptics say that Tibetans have never recognized them as being authentic Tibetan practices.

The Five Tibetan Rites are also referred to as "The Five Rites", "The Five Tibetans" and "The Five Rites of Rejuvenation".

==Publication==

Although practically nothing is known about Kelder,&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt; one source reports that he was raised as an adopted child in the mid-western United States and left home while in his teens in search of adventure.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;Kelder, Peter &amp; Bernie S. Siegel, M.D.: ''Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth: Book 2''. DoubleDay (January 19, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, Kelder claims to have met, in southern California, a retired British army colonel who shared with him stories of travel and the subsequent discovery of the Rites.&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelder&gt;Kelder, Peter: ''The Eye of Revelation''. Peter Kelder (1939) (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=revised&gt;Revised publishings of ''The Eye of Revelation'':
* Kelder, Peter: '' Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth''. Harbor Press (1985,1989) Revised, modernized and expanded edition of ''The Eye of Revelation'', copyright 1939 by Peter Kelder.
* Kelder, Peter: ''Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth: Book 1''. Doubleday (January 20, 1998) Further revised, modernized and expanded edition of ''The Eye of Revelation'', copyright 1939 by Peter Kelder.
* Kelder, Peter &amp; Bernie S. Siegel, M.D.: ''Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth: Book 2''. DoubleDay (January 19, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
Originally written as a 32-page booklet,&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt; the publication is the result of Kelder's conversations with the colonel.&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revised"/&gt;

==Booklet==

In his booklet, Kelder claims that while stationed in India, British army officer Colonel Bradford (a pseudonym) heard a story about a group of [[lama]]s who had apparently discovered a "[[Fountain of youth|Fountain of Youth]]". The "wandering natives", as he called them, told him of old men who inexplicably became healthy, strong, and full of "vigor and virility" after entering a particular [[lamasery]]. After retiring, Kelder's Colonel Bradford went on to discover the [[lamasery]] and lived with the lamas, where they taught him five exercises, which they called "rites". According to the booklet, the lamas describe seven spinning, "psychic vortexes" within the body: two of these are in the brain, one at the base of the throat, one on the right side of the body in the vicinity of the liver, one in the reproductive anatomy, and one in each knee. As we grow older, the spin rate of the "vortexes" diminishes, resulting in "ill-health". However, the spin rate of these "vortexes" can be restored by performing the Five Rites daily, resulting in improved health.

Bradford was also instructed in how to perform a sixth rite, which the lamas recommended only for those willing to "lead a more or less continent (celibate) life". Additionally, Bradford reveals information on the importance of what foods one should eat, proper food combinations, and the correct method of eating.&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt;

==Disputed origins==

Although the origin of the Five Rites before the publication of ''The Eye of Revelation'' is disputed between practitioners and skeptics, a comparison of illustrations of the postures shows a remarkable similarity between the Rites and authentic Tibetan '''phrul 'khor'' exercises from a system rendered into English as Vajra Body Magical Wheel Sun and Moon Union ({{bo|t=རྡོ་རྗེ་ལུས་ཀྱི་འཕྲུལ་འཁོར་ཉི་ཟླ་ཁ་སྦྱོར|w=rdo rje lus kyi 'phrul 'khor nyi zla kha sbyor}}).&lt;ref name="Authentic1"/&gt; It has been noted, however, that even though these comparisons are compelling, a closer examination reveals that these similarities are misleading.&lt;ref name=Authentic2&gt;[http://jr-books.com/EoR-Article-090814-Misleading.html A Misleading Theory: Tibetan Yantra Yoga and the Five Rites]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Kilham]], whose 1994 book ''The Five Tibetans'' helped respark the Rites' popularity, says, "As the story has it, they were shared by Tibetan lamas; beyond that I know nothing of their history." Even though the historic lineage of the Rites before the publication of Kelder's booklet remains to be ascertained, the Rites have nevertheless been affirmed by a lama and scholar of the [[Sakya|Sa skya]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] as being "a genuine form of yoga and were originally taken from an authentic Indo-Tibetan tantric lineage, namely a cycle of yantra-yoga associated with the Sadnadapadadharma."&lt;ref name=Authentic1&gt;[http://people.tribe.net/sahajananda/blog/743ffcef-f30a-454e-8610-14dd8a45cd06 Are the "Five Tibetans" really Tibetan?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Authentic4&gt;[http://allyoga.tribe.net/thread/b7ecc195-67c5-48ef-a078-e9f7dc47b277 The Five Tibetans &amp; ‘phrul ‘khor (yantra)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that the Five Rites predate yoga as we know it today by as much as seven hundred years or more and, therefore, could not have derived from either Tibetan or Indian forms of yoga. Moreover, it has been suggested that the Rites are more likely to have originated from a system of [[Kum Nye]] which, like the Rites, date back 2,500 years.&lt;ref name=Authentic3&gt;[http://jr-books.com/EoR-Article-081203-Origins.html The Genesis of the Five Tibetan Rites: Part 1 - The Bon Tradition of Tibet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Authentic5&gt;[http://jr-books.com/EoR-Article-081231-Origins2.html The Genesis of the Five Tibetan Rites: Part 2 - The Non-Connection]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Kilham states that "[t]he issue at hand, though, is not the lineage of the Five Tibetans. The point is their immense potential value for those who will clear 10 minutes a day to practice."

==Performing the Rites==

In the original ''The Eye of Revelation'' booklet, Kelder suggests standing erect between each of the Five Rites with hands on hips and taking one or two deep breaths; he neither implies nor suggests that specific breathing patterns should be adopted while performing the movements.&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt; Nevertheless, subsequent publications pertaining to the Rites contain edits by others which recommend and detail specific instructions for breathing while performing the exercises.&lt;ref name="revised"/&gt; Some practitioners also recommend taking caution before performing the Rites due to the possibility of aggravating certain health conditions.

Kelder cautions that when performing the First Rite, spinning must always be performed in a clockwise direction. He also states that Bradford clearly recalled that the Maulawiyah, otherwise known as [[Mevlevi|"Whirling Dervishes"]], always spun from left to right, in a clockwise direction.&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revised"/&gt; No mention is made of the orientation of the palms, although the original illustration of the Rite in the 1939 edition of ''The Eye of Revelation'' clearly depicts both palms as facing toward the ground.&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt; Here arises a point of contention: the Whirling Dervishes spin in the ''counter''-clockwise direction, with the left palm facing down, towards the earth, and the right palm facing up, towards heaven.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/12/12/whirl.dervishes/index.html CNN article on Whirling Dervishes]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this discrepancy may find partial resolution in the fact that Tibetan Buddhist yoga regards clockwise rotation to be favorable, whereas counter-clockwise rotation is considered to be unfavorable.&lt;ref name="Authentic4"/&gt;

===First Rite===

[[File:Five tibetan rite 1.gif|thumb|Five Tibetan rite 1]]

"Stand erect with arms outstretched, horizontal with the shoulders. Now spin around until you become slightly dizzy. There is only one caution: you must turn from left to right if you are in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise if you are in the South hemisphere."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt; A tip for this is to look at the end of your right hand as a reference point .

===Second Rite===

[[File:Five tibetan rite 2.gif|thumb|Five Tibetan rite 2]]

"Lie full length on rug or bed. Place the hands flat down alongside of the hips. Fingers should be kept close together with the finger-tips of each hand turned slightly toward one another. Raise the feet until the legs are straight up. If possible, let the feet extend back a bit over the body toward the head, but do not let the knees bend. Hold this position for a moment or two and then slowly lower the feet to the floor, and for the next several moments allow all of the muscles in the entire body to relax completely. Then perform the Rite all over again."

"While the feet and legs are being raised it is a good idea also to raise the head, then while the feet and legs are being lowered to the floor lower the head at the same time."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;

===Third Rite===

[[File:Five tibetan rite 3.gif|thumb|Five Tibetan rite 3]]

"Kneel on a rug or mat with hands at sides, palms flat against the side of legs. Then lean forward as far as possible, bending at the waist, with head well forward—chin on chest. The second position of this Rite is to lean backward as far as possible. Cause the head to move still further backward. The toes will prevent you from falling over backward. The hands are always kept against the side of the legs. Next come to an erect (kneeling) position, relax as much as possible for a moment, and perform Rite all over again."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;

===Fourth Rite===

[[File:Five tibetan rite 4.gif|thumb|Five Tibetan rite 4]]

"Sit erect on rug or carpet with feet stretched out in front. The legs must be perfectly straight -- back of knees must be well down or close to the rug. Place the hands flat on the rug, fingers together, and the hands pointing outward slightly. Chin should be on chest -- head forward."

"Now gently raise the body, at the same time bend the knees so that the legs from the knees down are practically straight up and down. The arms, too, will also be vertical while the body from shoulders to knees will be horizontal. As the body is raised upward allow the head gently to fall backward so that the head hangs backward as far as possible when the body is fully horizontal. Hold this position for a few moments, return to first position, and RELAX for a few moments before performing the Rite again."

"When the body is pressed up to complete horizontal position, tense every muscle in the body."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;

===Fifth Rite===

[[File:Five tibetan rite 5.gif|thumb|Five Tibetan rite 5]]

"Place the hands on the floor about two feet apart. Then, with the legs stretched out to the rear with the feet also about two feet apart, push the body, and especially the hips, up as far as possible, rising on the toes and hands. At the same time the head should be brought so far down that the chin comes up against the chest. Next, allow the body to come slowly down to a ‘sagging’ position. Bring the head up, causing it to be drawn as far back as possible."

"The muscles should be tensed for a moment when the body is at the highest point, and again at the lowest point."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;

===Sixth Rite===

"It should be practiced only when you feel an excess of sexual energy..."
"Stand straight up and slowly let all of the air out of your lungs...bend over and put your hands on your knees...with the lungs empty, return to a straight up posture. Place your hands on your hips, and press down on them... As you do this, pull in the abdomen as much as possible, and at the same time raise the chest.&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
hold this position as long as you possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
take air into your empty lungs, let the air flow in through the nose. When the lungs are full, exhale through the mouth.
As you exhale, relax your arms... Then take several deep breaths through the mouth or nose, allowing them to escape through either the mouth or nose."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;

==Claimed benefits of performing the rites==

According to Kelder, Bradford's stay in the lamasery transformed him from a stooped, old gentleman with a cane to a tall and straight young man in the prime of his life. Additionally, he reported that Bradford's hair had grown back, without a trace of gray.&lt;ref name="revised"/&gt; The revised publications of ''The Eye of Revelation'' titled ''Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth'' also contain numerous testimonials by practitioners of the Rites, claiming that they yield positive medical effects such as improved eyesight, memory, potency, hair growth, restoration of full color to completely gray hair, and anti-aging.&lt;ref name="revised"/&gt; However, claims as to the benefits of the Rites are often exaggerated, resulting in unrealistic expectations.&lt;ref name=claims&gt;[http://www.t5t.com/article_info.php?articles_id=19 The Five Tibetan Rites' Benefits - The Truth versus the Claims]&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits most likely to be achieved are increased energy, stress reduction, and an enhanced sense of calm, clarity of thought, increased strength and flexibility, resulting in an overall improvement in health and well-being.&lt;ref name="claims"/&gt;

'''Food and dining in the Roman Empire''' reflect both the variety of foodstuffs available through the expanded trade networks of the [[Roman Empire]] and the traditions of conviviality from [[ancient Rome]]'s earliest times, inherited in part from the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]. In contrast to the Greek [[symposium]], which was primarily a drinking party, the equivalent social institution of the Roman ''convivium'' ([[party#dinner party|dinner party]]) was focused on food. Banqueting played a major role in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Rome's communal religion]].  Maintaining the food supply to the city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and continued to be one of the main ways the [[Roman emperor|emperor]] expressed his relationship to the Roman people and established his role as a benefactor. Roman food vendors and [[farmers' market]]s sold meats, fish, cheeses, produce, [[olive oil]] and spices and pubs, bars, inns and food stalls sold prepared food.

Bread was a meaty food for Romans, with more well-to-do people eating [[wheat]] bread and poorer people eating [[barley]] bread. Fresh [[produce]] such as vegetables and legumes were important to Romans, as farming was a valued activity. A variety of [[olive]]s and nuts were eaten. While there were prominent Romans who discouraged meat eating, a variety of meat products were prepared, including [[Black pudding|blood puddings]], sausages, cured ham and bacon. The milk of goats or sheep was thought superior to that of cows; milk was used to make many types of cheese, as this was a way of storing and trading milk products. While [[olive oil]] was fundamental to Roman cooking, [[butter]] was viewed as an undesirable Gallic foodstuff.  Sweet foods such as pastries typically used [[honey]] and [[must|wine-must]] syrup as a sweetener. A variety of [[dried fruit]]s (figs, dates and plums) and fresh berries were also eaten.

Salt–which in its pure form was an expensive commodity in Rome–was the fundamental seasoning and the most common salty [[condiment]] was a fermented [[fish sauce]] known as [[garum]]. Locally available seasonings included garden herbs, [[cumin]], [[coriander]], and [[juniper berries]]. Imported spices included [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[saffron]], [[cinnamon]], and [[ferula|fennel]].  While [[wine]] was an important beverage, Romans looked down on drinking to excess and drank their wine mixed with water; drinking wine "straight" was viewed as a [[barbarian]] custom.

==Food==
Five main Roman ingredients in dishes were: Wheat, wine, meat and fish, bread, and sauces and spices. The richer Romans had very luxurious lives, and sometimes hosted banquets or feasts.

==Grains and legumes==

[[File:Pompei - House of Julia Felix - 2 - MAN.jpg|thumb|upright|A bread stall, from a Pompeiian wall painting]]

Most people would have consumed at least 70 percent of their daily [[calorie]]s in the form of [[cereal]]s and [[legumes]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Garnsey, "The Land," in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt; Grains included several varieties of [[wheat]]—[[emmer]], [[Taxonomy of wheat#Early taxonomy|rivet wheat]], [[einkorn wheat|einkorn]], [[spelt]], and common wheat ''([[Triticum aestivum]])''&lt;ref&gt;"Foodstuffs," in ''Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World'' (Harvard University Press, 1999), pp. 453–454.&lt;/ref&gt;—as well as the less desirable [[barley]], [[millet]], and [[oats]].&lt;ref name="Garnsey p. 681"&gt;Garnsey, "The Land," ''CAH'' 11, p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legumes included the [[lentil]], [[chickpea]], [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]], [[broad bean]], [[garden pea]], and [[grass pea]]; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]  names varieties such as the [[Chickpea#History|Venus pea]],&lt;ref&gt;Flint-Hamilton, "Legumes in Ancient Greece and Rome," p. 373; Edwards, "Philology and Cuisine in ''De Re Coquinaria''," p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; and poets praise Egyptian lentils imported from [[Pelusium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vergil]], ''Georgics'' 1.228; [[Martial]] 13.9.1; [[Ausonius]]&lt;!--name of work needed--&gt; 12.9.9; H.H. Huxley, ''Virgil: Georgics I and IV'' (Fletcher and Sons, 1963, 1967), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Legumes were planted in rotation with cereals to [[Nitrogen fixation#Legume family|enrich the soil]],&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 18.134, 137; Flint-Hamilton, "Legumes in Ancient Greece and Rome," p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; and were stockpiled in case of famine. The agricultural writer [[Columella]] gives detailed instructions on curing lentils, and Pliny says they had health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Columella, ''De Re Rustica'' 2.10.5–16; Pliny, ''Natural History'' 22.142; Flint-Hamilton, "Legumes in Ancient Greece and Rome," pp. 374–376.&lt;/ref&gt; Although usually thought of as modest fare, legumes also appear among the dishes at banquets.&lt;ref&gt;Flint-Hamilton, "Legumes in Ancient Greece and Rome," p. 382; Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Puls'' ([[pottage]])&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=fish+sauce|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; was considered the aboriginal food of the Romans, and played a role in some archaic religious rituals that continued to be observed during the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' 19.83–84; Emily Gowers, ''The Loaded Table: Representation of Food in Roman Literature'' (Oxford University Press, 1993, 2003), p. 17; Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic grain pottage could be elaborated with chopped vegetables, bits of meat, cheese, or herbs to produce dishes similar to [[polenta]] or [[risotto]].&lt;ref&gt;Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; "Julian stew" ''(Pultes Iulianae)'' was made from spelt to which was added two kinds of [[ground meat]], [[Piper (genus)|pepper]], [[lovage]], [[fennel]], [[hard bread]], and a wine [[reduction (cooking)|reduction]]; according to tradition, it was eaten by the soldiers of Julius Caesar and was a "quintessential Roman dish."&lt;ref&gt;John Edwards, "Philology and Cuisine in ''De Re Coquinaria''," ''American Journal of Philology'' 122.2 (2001), pp. 258–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baeckerei pompeji kampanien italien.jpg|thumb|A mill and bakery complex at Pompeii]]

Urban populations and the military preferred to consume their grain in the form of bread.&lt;ref name="Garnsey p. 681"/&gt;  The lower classes ate coarse brown bread made from emmer or barley. Fine white loaves were leavened by [[yeast|wild yeasts]] and [[sourdough starter|sourdough cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly B. Flint-Hamilton, "Legumes in Ancient Greece and Rome: Food, Medicine, or Poison?" ''Hesperia'' 68.3 (1999), p. 371; Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt; The beer-drinking [[Celtiberians|Celts of Spain]] and Gaul were known for the quality of their breads risen with [[barm]] or [[brewers' yeast]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 18.68; Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem ''[[Moretum]]'' describes a "[[ploughman's lunch]]", a [[flatbread]] prepared on a griddle and topped with cheese and a [[pesto]]-like preparation, somewhat similar to [[pizza]] or [[focaccia]].&lt;ref&gt;Carol Field, ''The Italian Baker: The Classic Tastes of the Italian Countryside'' (Random House, 1985, 2011), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining a bread oven is labor-intensive and requires space, so apartment dwellers probably prepared their dough at home, then had it baked in a communal oven.&lt;ref name="Holleran, pp. 134"&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Mills and commercial ovens, usually combined in a bakery complex, were considered so vital to the wellbeing of Rome that several [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] honored the [[List of Roman deities|deities]] who furthered these processes—and even the donkeys who toiled in the mills. [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], the goddess of the hearth, was seen as complementary to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], the goddess of grain, and donkeys were garlanded and given a rest on the [[Vestalia|Festival of Vesta]]. The [[Fornacalia]] was the "Festival of Ovens". [[Lateranus]] was a deity of brick ovens.

===Other produce===
[[File:Pompejanischer Maler um 70 001.jpg|thumb|A wall painting from Pompeii (ca. 70 AD) depicting autumn produce: grapes, apples, and pomegranates overflowing a large glass bowl, next to a tilting [[amphora]] and a terracotta pot of preserved fruit]]

Because of the importance of landowning in the formation of the Roman cultural elite, Romans idealized farming and took a great deal of pride in serving [[produce]]. [[Leafy greens]] and [[herbs]] were eaten as [[salad]]s with [[vinaigrette|vinegar dressing]]s.&lt;ref name="Seo p. 198"&gt;Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooked vegetables such as [[beet]]s, [[leek]]s, and [[gourd]]s were prepared with sauces as first courses or served with bread as a simple meal.&lt;ref name="Seo p. 198"/&gt; The Romans had over 20 kind of vegetables and greens. Cured [[olive]]s were available in wide variety even to those on a limited budget.&lt;ref name="Seo p. 198"/&gt; [[Truffle]]s and [[edible mushroom|wild mushrooms]], while not everyday fare, were perhaps more commonly foraged than today.&lt;ref name="Faas"&gt; Faas, Patrick (2005). ''Around the Roman Table: Food and Feasting in Ancient Rome'', pp. 236-239. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provinces exported regional [[dried fruit]]s such as [[Caria]]n figs and Theban dates,&lt;ref name="Seo p. 198"/&gt; and fruit trees from the East were propagated throughout the Western empire: the cherry from [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] (present-day Turkey); peach ''(persica)'' from [[Persia]] (Iran), along with the lemon and other citrus; the apricot from [[Armenia (Roman province)|Armenia]]; the "[[Damascus|Damascan]]" or [[damson plum]] from [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]; and what the Romans called the "Punic apple", the [[pomegranate]] from North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Bowe, ''Gardens of the Roman World'' p. 49; Phyllis Pray Bober, ''Art, Culture, and Cuisine: Ancient and Medieval Gastronomy'' (University of Chicago Press, 1999), p. 337; C. Srinivasan, Isabel M.G. Padilla, and Ralph Scorza, "''Prunus spp.'' Almond, Apricot, Cherry, Nectarine, Peach and Plum," in ''Biotechnology of Fruit and Nut Crops'' (CABI Publishing, 2005), p. 512; [[Robert E.A. Palmer]], ''Rome and Carthage at Peace'' (Franz Steiner, 1997), pp. 40, 45–46 (on the pomegranate).&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans ate cherries, blackberries, currants, elderberries, dates, pomegranates, peaches, apricots, quinces, melons, plums, figs, grapes, apples and pears, Around the Roman Table, p. 239. 

Berries were cultivated or gathered wild. Familiar nuts included almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, pistachios, pine nuts, and chestnuts.&lt;ref&gt;Faas (2005), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Fruit and nut trees could be grafted with multiple varieties.&lt;ref&gt;According to Pliny, ''Natural History''; Bowe, ''Gardens of the Roman World,'' p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meat and dairy===
While there were prominent Romans who discouraged meat eating– the Emperors [[Didius Julianus]] and [[Septimius Severus]] disdained meat&lt;ref name="Montanari p. 166"&gt;Montanari, "Romans, Barbarians, Christians," p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;–Roman butchers sold a variety of fresh meats, including pork, beef, and [[Lamb and mutton|mutton or lamb]].&lt;ref name="Seo p. 199"&gt;Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of refrigeration, techniques of preservation for meat, fish, and dairy were developed. No portion of the animal was allowed to go to waste, resulting in [[Black pudding|blood pudding]]s, meatballs ''(isicia)'', sausages, and stews.&lt;ref name="Seo p. 199"/&gt; Rural people cured ham and bacon, and regional specialties such as the fine salted hams of Gaul were items of trade.&lt;ref name="Seo p. 199"/&gt; The sausages of [[Lucania]] were made from a mixture of ground meats, herbs, and nuts, with eggs as a binding ingredient, and then aged in a [[Smoking (cooking)|smoker]].&lt;ref name="Edwards p. 259"&gt;Edwards, "Philology and Cuisine in ''De Re Coquinaria''," p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh milk was used in medicinal and cosmetic preparations, or for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Joan P. Alcock, "Milk and Its Products in Ancient Rome," in ''Milk: Beyond the Dairy. Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 1999'' (Prospect Books, 2000) pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The milk of goats or sheep was thought superior to that of cows.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, "Milk and Its Products in Ancient Rome," pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Cheese was easier to store and transport to market, and literary sources describe cheesemaking in detail, including fresh and hard cheeses, regional specialties, and smoked cheeses.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, "Milk and Its Products in Ancient Rome," pp. 35–37; Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oils and fat===
[[File:Volubilis1.3.JPG|thumb|An olive mill from [[Volubilis]], present-day Morocco]]

Olive oil was fundamental not only to cooking, but to the Roman way of life, as it was used also in [[oil lamp|lamps]] and preparations for bathing and grooming.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dalby, entry on olive oil, ''Food in the Ancient World A to Z'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans invented the ''trapetum'' for extracting olive oil.&lt;ref name="Foodstuff p. 455"&gt;"Foodstuff," in ''Late Antiquity,'' p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; The olive orchards of [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]] attracted major investment and were highly productive, with trees larger than those of Mediterranean Europe; massive lever presses were developed for efficient extraction.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Mattingly, "Regional Variation in Roman Oleoculture: Some Problems of Comparability," in ''Landuse in the Roman Empire'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1994), pp. 91–93, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain was also a major exporter of olive oil, but the Romans regarded oil from central Italy as the finest.&lt;ref&gt;Dalby, ''Food in the Ancient World A to Z'' p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Specialty blends were created from Spanish olive oil; [[Liburnia]]n Oil ''(Oleum Liburnicum)'' was flavored with [[elecampane]], [[Cyperus esculentus|cyperus root]], [[bay laurel]] and salt.&lt;ref name="Edwards p. 259"/&gt;

[[Butter]] was mostly disdained by the Romans, but was a distinguishing feature of the Gallic diet.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, "Milk and Its Products in Ancient Rome," p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lard]] was used for baking pastries and seasoning some dishes.&lt;ref name="Seo p. 199"/&gt;

===Seasonings and sweeteners===
Salt was the fundamental seasoning: [[Pliny the Elder]] remarked that "Civilized life cannot proceed without salt: it is so necessary an ingredient that it has become a [[metaphor]] for intense mental pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 31.88, as cited by Gower, ''The Loaded Table,'' p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin literature, salt ''(sal)'' was a synonym for "wit".&lt;ref&gt;Gower, ''The Loaded Table'', p. 232, citing especially [[Horace]], ''Epistle'' 2.2.60.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an important item of trade, but pure salt was relatively expensive. The most common salty [[condiment]] was ''[[garum]],'' the fermented [[fish sauce]] that added the flavor dimension now called "[[umami]]". Major exporters of garum were located in the provinces of Spain.

[[File:Hoxne Hoard 26.jpg|thumb|Three silver-gilt Roman ''([[piperatorium|piperatoria]])'' or pepper pots from the [[Hoxne Hoard]] of [[Roman Britain]]]]
Locally available seasonings included garden herbs, [[cumin]], [[coriander]], and [[juniper berries]].&lt;ref name="Seo p. 199"/&gt; Pepper was so vital to the cuisine that ornamental pots ''([[piperatorium|piperatoria]])'' were created to hold it. ''[[Piper longum]]'' was imported from India, as was [[spikenard]], used to season [[game birds]] and [[sea urchin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, "Philology and Cuisine in ''De Re Coquinaria''," pp. 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other imported spices were [[saffron]], [[cinnamon]], and the [[silphium]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], a type of pungent [[ferula|fennel]] that was over-harvested into extinction during the reign of [[Nero]], after which time it was replaced with ''laserpicium'', [[asafoetida]] exported from present-day Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 19.39; Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] estimated that Romans spent 100 million [[sesterces]] a year on spices and perfumes from India, China, and the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref name="Seo p. 200"&gt;Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweeteners were limited mostly to [[honey]] and [[must|wine-must]] syrup ''([[defrutum]])''.&lt;ref name="Seo p. 199"/&gt; [[Cane sugar]] was an exotic ingredient used as a garnish or flavoring agent, or in medicines.&lt;ref name="Seo p. 199"/&gt;

==Agriculture and markets==
[[File:Mosaico di un giovane come mese di giugno, III secolo dc..JPG|thumb|A boy holding a platter of fruits and what may be a bucket of crabs, in a kitchen with fish and [[squid]], on the June panel from a mosaic depicting the months (3rd century)&lt;ref&gt;J. Carson Webster, ''The Labors of the Months in Antique and Mediaeval Art to the End of the Twelfth Century,'' Studies in the Humanities 4 (Northwestern University Press, 1938), p. 128. In the collections of the [[Hermitage Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Roman Empire#Central government|central government]] took an active interest in supporting [[Roman agriculture|agriculture]].&lt;ref name="Hopkins p. 191"&gt;Hopkins, "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Producing food was the top priority of land use.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Garnsey, "The Land," in ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 679.&lt;/ref&gt; Larger farms ''([[latifundium|latifundia]])'' achieved an [[economy of scale]] that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labor.&lt;ref name="Hopkins p. 191"/&gt; The Empire's transportation network of roads and shipping lines benefitted small farmers by opening up access to local and regional markets in towns and trade centers. Agricultural techniques such as [[crop rotation]] and [[selective breeding]] were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Food vendors are depicted in art throughout the Empire. In the city of Rome, the [[Forum Holitorium]] was an ancient [[farmers' market]], and the [[Vicus Tuscus]] was famous for its fresh [[produce]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Mira Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 198; [[Robert E.A. Palmer]], ''Rome and Carthage at Peace'' (Steiner, 1997), p. 115, citing [[Varro]], ''De Lingua Latina'' 5.146–147, on the Forum Holitorium as a ''[[macellum]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the city, meats, fish, cheeses, produce, [[olive oil]], spices, and the ubiquitous condiment ''[[garum]]'' ([[fish sauce]]) were sold at ''[[macellum|macella]]'', Roman indoor markets, and at marketplaces throughout the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome: The Retail Trade in the Late Republic and the Principate'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 207–208 ''et passim''; Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," p. 198, and "Cooks and Cookbooks," p. 299, in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Annona''==
Maintaining an affordable food supply to the city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole ''(annona)'' to citizens who registered for it.&lt;ref name="Hopkins p. 191"/&gt; About 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome received the dole, amounting to about 33&amp;nbsp;kg per month, for a per annum total of about 100,000 tonnes of wheat primarily from [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], Northern Africa, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," p. 191, reckoning that the surplus of wheat from the province of Egypt alone could meet and exceed the needs of the city of Rome and the provincial armies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dole cost at least 34 percent of state revenues,&lt;ref name="Hopkins p. 191"/&gt; but improved living conditions and family life among the lower classes,&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], "The Census in the First Century B.C.", ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 59 (1969), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on the estates of the landowning class.&lt;ref name="Hopkins p. 191"/&gt;

The grain dole also had symbolic value: it affirmed both the emperor's position as universal benefactor, and the right of all citizens to share in "the fruits of conquest".&lt;ref name="Hopkins p. 191"/&gt; The ''annona'', public facilities, and spectacular entertainments mitigated the otherwise dreary living conditions of lower-class Romans, and kept social unrest in check. The satirist [[Juvenal]], however, saw "[[bread and circuses]]" ''(panem et circenses)'' as emblematic of the loss of republican political liberty:&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Keane, ''Figuring Genre in Roman Satire'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 36; Eckhart Köhne, "Bread and Circuses: The Politics of Entertainment," in ''Gladiators and Caesars: The Power of Spectacle in Ancient Rome'' (University of California Press, 2000), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The public has long since cast off its cares: the people that once bestowed commands, consulships, legions and all else, now meddles no more and longs eagerly for just two things: bread and circuses.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''Satire'' 10.77–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Romans who received the dole took it to a mill to have it ground into flour.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; By the reign of [[Aurelian]], the state had begun to distribute the ''annona'' as a daily ration of bread baked in state factories, and added [[olive oil]], wine, and pork to the dole.&lt;ref&gt;Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City'', p. 146; Hopkins, "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," p. 191; Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial food preparation==
[[File:Ostia antica-13.jpg|thumb|A Pompeiian ''taberna'' for eating and drinking. The faded painting over the counter pictured eggs, olives, fruit and radishes.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' pp. 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Most people in the city of Rome lived in apartment buildings ''([[Insula (building)|insulae]])'' that lacked kitchens, though shared cooking facilities might be available in ground-level commons areas. A charcoal brazier could be used for rudimentary cookery such as grilling and stewing in a pot (''[[Olla (Roman pot)|olla]])'', but ventilation was poor and braziers were fire hazards.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988), pp. 144, 178; Kathryn Hinds, ''Everyday Life in the Roman Empire'' (Marshall Cavendish, 2010), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prepared food was sold at pubs and bars, inns, and food stalls ''([[taberna]]e, cauponae, [[popina]]e)''.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' p. 140ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some establishments had countertops fitted with openings for pots that may have kept food warm over a heat source ''([[thermopolium]])'' or simply served as storage vessels ''([[dolium|dolia]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' p. 136ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carryout]] and restaurant dining were for the lower classes. Frequenting taverns, where prostitutes sometimes worked, was among the moral failings that louche emperors and other public figures might be accused of.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' pp. 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Mills and commercial ovens were usually combined in a bakery complex.&lt;ref name="Holleran, pp. 134"/&gt;

==Dietary theories==
The importance of a good diet to health was recognized by medical writers such as [[Galen]] (2nd century AD), whose treatises included one ''On Barley Soup''. Views on nutrition were influenced by schools of thought such as [[humoral theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Grant, ''Galen on Food and Diet'' (Routledge, 2000), pp. 7, 11 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Digestion of food within the body was thought to be a process analogous to cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Galen on Food and Diet'', pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin expression for a full-course dinner was ''ab ovo usque mala'', "from the egg to the apples," equivalent to the English "[[from soup to nuts]]."&lt;ref&gt;John Donahue, ''The Roman Community at Table during the Principate'' (University of Michigan Press, 2004, 2007), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; A multicourse dinner began with the ''gustatio'' ("tasting" or "appetizer"), often a salad or other minimally cooked composed dish, with ingredients to promote good digestion. The ''[[cena]]'' proper centered on meat, a practice that evokes the tradition of communal banquets following animal sacrifice. A meal concluded with fruits and nuts, or with deliberately superfluous desserts ''(secundae mensae)''.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers, ''The Loaded Table,'' p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman literature focuses on the dining habits of the upper classes,&lt;ref&gt;Veronika E. Grimm, "On Food and the Body," in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire,'' p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; and the most famous description of a Roman meal is probably [[Cena Trimalchionis|Trimalchio's dinner party]] in the ''Satyricon'', a fictional extravaganza that bears little resemblance to reality even among the most wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, "On Food and the Body," p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet Martial describes serving a more plausible dinner, beginning with the ''gustatio'', which was a composed salad of [[Malvaceae|mallow leaves]], lettuce, chopped leeks, [[mentha|mint]], [[arugula]], [[mackerel]] garnished with [[rue]], sliced eggs, and marinated sow udder. The main course was succulent cuts of [[goat meat|kid]], beans, greens, a chicken, and leftover ham, followed by a dessert of fresh fruit and vintage wine.&lt;ref&gt;Joan P. Alcock, ''Food in the Ancient World'' (Greenwood Press, 2006), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman books on agriculture include a few recipes.&lt;ref&gt;Seo, "Cooks and Cookbooks," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; A book-length collection of Roman recipes is attributed to [[Apicius]], a name for several figures in antiquity that became synonymous with "[[gourmet]]":&lt;ref&gt;Cathy K. Kaufman, "Remembrance of Meals Past: Cooking by Apicius' Book," in ''Food and the Memory: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cooker p. 125ff.&lt;/ref&gt; "the recipes are written haphazardly, as if someone familiar with the workings of a kitchen was jotting down notes for a colleague."&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, "Remembrance of Meals Past," p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Although often imprecise, particularly with measurements, Apicius uses eight different verbs for techniques for incorporating eggs into a dish, including one that might produce a [[soufflé]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, "Remembrance of Meals Past," p. 125ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipes include regional specialties such as  ''Ofellas Ostiensis'', an [[hors d'oeuvre]] made from "choice squares of marinated pork cooked in a spicy sauce of typically Roman flavors: lovage, fennel, cumin, and anise."&lt;ref name="Edwards p. 258"&gt;Edwards, "Philology and Cuisine in ''De Re Coquinaria''," p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The signature dish ''Patina Apiciana'' required a complex [[forcemeat]] layered with egg and [[crepe]]s, to be presented on a silver platter.&lt;ref&gt;''De Re Coquinaria'' 4.141.; Seo, "Cooks and Cookbooks," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Still_life_with_eggs,_birds_and_bronze_dishes,_Pompeii.jpg|thumb|A wall painting from the house of Julia Felix at Pompeii]]

Roman "[[foodie]]s" indulged in [[wild game]], [[fowl]] such as [[peacock]] and [[flamingo]], large fish ([[mullet (fish)|mullet]] was especially prized), and [[shellfish]]. [[Oyster]]s were farmed at [[Baiae]], a resort town on the [[Campania]]n coast&lt;ref name="Seo p. 199"/&gt; known for a regional shellfish stew made from oysters, [[mussel]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[celery]] and coriander.&lt;ref name="Edwards p. 258"/&gt;

The favorite dish of the emperor [[Vitellius]] was supposed to be the "Shield of [[Minerva]]", composed of [[pike (fish)|pike]] liver, brains of [[pheasant]] and peacock, flamingo tongue, and [[lamprey]] [[milt]]. The description given by [[Suetonius]] emphasizes that these luxury ingredients were brought by the fleet from the far reaches of empire, from the [[Parthia]]n frontier to the [[Straits of Gibraltar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Vitellius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vitellius*.html#13.2 13.2]; Gowers, ''The Loaded Table,'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Augustan historian [[Livy]] explicitly links the development of gourmet cuisine to Roman territorial expansion, dating the introduction of the first chefs to 187 BC, following the [[Galatian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy 39.6; Seo, "Cooks and Cookbooks," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 298; Gowers, ''The Loaded Table,'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wine and fermented beverages==

[[File:Halage sur la Durance Amphores et tonneaux gallo-romains.jpg|thumb|A [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] relief depicting a river boat transporting wine barrels, an invention of the Gauls that came into widespread use during the 2nd century. Above, wine is stored in the traditional [[amphora]]e, some covered in wicker.&lt;ref&gt;Élise Marlière, "Le tonneua en Gaule romaine," ''Gallia'' 58 (2001) 181–210, especially p. 184; Corbier, "Coinage, Society, and Economy," in ''CAH'' 12, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although food shortages were a constant concern, Italian [[viticulture]] produced an abundance of cheap wine that was shipped to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Garnsey, "The Land," in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 695.&lt;/ref&gt; Most provinces were capable of producing wine, but regional varietals were desirable, and wine was a central item of trade. Shortages of ''[[vin ordinaire]]'' were rare.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mireille Corbier]], "Coinage, Society, and Economy," in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The Crisis of Empire, A.D. 193–337'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), vol. 12, p. 404; Harris, "Trade," in ''CAH'' 11, p. 719.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional varieties such as [[Alban wine|Alban]], [[Caecuban wine|Caecuban]], and [[Falernian wine|Falernian]] were prized.&lt;ref name="Seo p. 200"/&gt; Opimian was the most prestigious vintage.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 14.55; Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major suppliers for the city of Rome were the west coast of Italy, southern Gaul, the [[Hispania Tarraconensis|Tarraconensis region]] of Spain, and [[Creta et Cyrenaica|Crete]]. Alexandria, the second-largest city in the Empire, imported wine from [[Latakia|Laodicea in Syria]] and the Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, "Trade," in ''CAH'' 11, p. 720.&lt;/ref&gt; At the retail level, taverns or specialty wine shops ''(vinaria)'' sold wine by the jug for carryout and by the drink on premises, with price ranges reflecting quality.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to regular consumption with meals, wine was a part of everyday religious observances. Before a meal, a [[libation]] was offered to the household gods. When Romans made their regular visits to burial sites to [[Roman funerals and burial|care for the dead]], they poured a libation, facilitated at some tombs with a feeding tube into the grave.

Romans drank their wine mixed with water, or in "mixed drinks" with flavorings. ''Mulsum'' was a mulled sweet wine, and ''apsinthium'' was a wormwood-flavored forerunner of [[absinthe]].&lt;ref name="Seo p. 200"/&gt; Although wine was enjoyed regularly, and the Augustan poet [[Horace]] coined the expression "truth in wine" ''(in vino veritas)'', drunkenness was disparaged. It was a Roman stereotype that [[Gauls]] had an excessive love of wine, and drinking wine "straight" (''purum'' or ''merum'', unmixed) was a mark of the "barbarian". The Gauls also brewed various forms of beer.

==Dining at home==
[[File:Triclinium - Archäologische Staatssammlung München.JPG|thumb|A recreation of a [[triclinium]] at the [[Bavarian State Archaeological Collection|Archäologische Staatssammlung München]]]]

Since restaurants catered to the lower classes, [[fine dining]] could be sought only at private dinner parties in {{nowrap|well-to-do}} houses, or at banquets hosted by social clubs ''([[collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Faas (2005), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The private home ''([[domus]])'' of an elite family would have had a kitchen, a kitchen garden, and a trained staff with a [[chef]] ''(archimagirus)'', a [[sous chef]] ''(vicarius supra cocos)'', and kitchen assistants ''(coci'', singular ''cocus'' or ''coquus'', from which the English "cook" derives).&lt;ref&gt;Seo, "Cooks and Cookbooks," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

In upperclass households, the evening meal ''([[cena]])'' had important social functions.&lt;ref name="Grimm p. 356"&gt;Grimm, "On Food and the Body," p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;  Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room ''([[triclinium]])'', often with a view of the peristyle garden. Diners lounged on couches, leaning on the left elbow. The ideal number of guests for a dinner party ''([[Symposium|convivium]]'', "life-sharing" or "a living together") was nine.&lt;ref name="Grimm p. 356"/&gt;

By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew B. Roller, ''Dining Posture in Ancient Rome'' (Princeton University Press, 2006), p. 96ff.&lt;/ref&gt; On at least some occasions, children attended, so they could acquire social skills.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintilian]], ''Institution Oratoria'' 1.2.7–8, scolds parents for behaving improperly at dinner parties when their children are in attendance; Roller, ''Dining Posture in Ancient Rome'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Multicourse meals were served by the [[Slavery in ancient Rome|household slaves]], who appear prominently in the art of late antiquity as images of hospitality and luxury.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine M.D. Dunbabin, "The Waiting Servant in Later Roman Art," in ''Roman Dining'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), p. 115ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feeding the military==
{{Details|Military of ancient Rome}}
One of the chief [[military logistics|logistical]] concerns of the Roman military was feeding the men, cavalry horses, and pack animals, usually mules.  Wheat and barley were the primary food sources. Meat, olive oil, wine, and vinegar were also provided. An army of 40,000, including soldiers and other personnel such as slaves, would have about 4,000 horses and 3,500 pack animals. An army of this size would consume about 60 tonnes of grain and 240 amphorae of wine and olive oil each day.

Each man received a ration of about {{convert|830|g|lb|1}} of wheat per day in the form of unmilled grain, which is less perishable than flour. Handmills were used to grind it. The supply of all these foodstuffs depended on availability, and was hard to guarantee during times of war or other adverse conditions. The military attracted [[sutler]]s who sold various items, including foodstuffs with which the soldier might supplement his diet.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Erdkamp, "War and State Formation," in ''A Companion to the Roman Army'' (Blackwell, 2011), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the expansionism of the Republic, the army usually had combined [[living off the land]] and organized supply lines (the ''frumentatio'') to ensure its food supply.&lt;ref name="Erdkamp pp. 103"&gt;Erdkamp, "War and State Formation," pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Empire, provinces might pay in-kind taxes in the form of grain to provision the permanent garrisons.&lt;ref name="Erdkamp pp. 103"/&gt;

==Cultural values==
[[File:Repas champêtre Mosaïque romaine d'Ostie.jpg|thumb|An outdoor banquet on a fragmented 4th-century mosaic]]

Refined cuisine could be moralized as a sign of either civilized progress or decadent decline.&lt;ref&gt;Seo, "Food and Drink, Roman," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Imperial historian [[Tacitus]] contrasted the indulgent luxuries of the Roman table in his day with the simplicity of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] diet of fresh wild meat, foraged fruit, and cheese, unadulterated by imported seasonings and elaborate sauces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Germania'' 23; Gowers, ''The Loaded Table,'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, [[produce]]—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—was most often considered a more civilized form of food than meat. The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Musonius Rufus]], a [[vegetarian]], regarded meat-eaters as not only less civilized but "slower in intellect."&lt;ref&gt;Musonius 18; Grimm, "On Food and the Body," p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Barbarian]]s" might be stereotyped as ravenous carnivores.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Montanari, "Romans, Barbarians, Christians: The Dawn of European Food Culture," in ''Food: A Culinary History from Antiquity to the Present'' (Columbia University Press, 1999, originally published in French 1996), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' describes the emperors [[Didius Julianus]] and [[Septimius Severus]] as disdaining meat in favor of vegetables, while the first emperor born of two barbarian parents, [[Maximinus Thrax]], is said to have devoured mounds of meat.&lt;ref name="Montanari p. 166"/&gt;

For Pliny, the making of [[pastries]] was a sign of civilized countries at peace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' 18.105; Gowers, ''The Loaded Table,'' p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mediterranean diet|Mediterranean staples]] of [[Sacramental bread|bread]], [[Sacramental wine|wine]], and [[chrism|oil]] were [[sacralized]] by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of [[Germanic paganism|paganism]],&lt;ref name="Montanari p. 166"/&gt; as it might be the product of [[animal sacrifice]].

Some philosophers and Christians resisted the demands of the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted [[fasting]] as an ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, "On Food and the Body," pp. 365–366.&lt;/ref&gt; Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished, trade routes were disrupted,&lt;ref&gt;"Foodstuff," in ''Late Antiquity,'' p. 455; Montanari, "Romans, Barbarians, Christians," p. 165–167.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rich retreated to the more limited self-sufficiency of their country estates.&lt;ref name="Foodstuff p. 455"/&gt; As an urban lifestyle came to be associated with decadence, the Church formally discouraged [[gluttony]],&lt;ref name="Foodstuff p. 455"/&gt; and hunting and [[pastoralism]] were seen as simple but virtuous ways of life.&lt;ref&gt;Montanari, "Romans, Barbarians, Christians," p. 165–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fun''' is the enjoyment of pleasure, particularly in [[leisure]] activities. Fun is an experience often unexpected, informal or purposeless. It is an enjoyable distraction, diverting the mind and body from any serious task or contributing an extra dimension to it. Although particularly associated with [[recreation]] and [[Play (activity)|play]], fun may be encountered during work, social functions, and even seemingly mundane activities of daily living. It may often have little to no logical basis, and [[opinions]] on whether an activity is fun may differ from person to person. A distinction between enjoyment and fun is difficult but possible to articulate, fun being a more spontaneous, playful, or active event. There are psychological and physiological implications to the experience of fun.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word ''fun'' is associated with sports, sex, entertaining media, high merriment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Nathan|title=An universal etymological English dictionary: comprehending the derivations ...|year=1775|publisher=R. Ware, W. Innys|pages=FU-FU|isbn=978-1-234-36393-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amusement. Although its etymology is uncertain, it may be derived from ''fonne'' (fool) and ''fonnen'' (the one fooling the other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andreyev|first=Judith|title=Wondering about Words: D'où Viennent Les Mots Anglais ?|year=2005|publisher=Bréal; BREAL|isbn=978-2749503059|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its meaning in 1727 was "cheat, trick, hoax", a meaning still retained in the phrase "to make fun of".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cousineau|first=Phil|title=The Painted Word: A Treasure Chest of Remarkable Words and Their Origins|year=2012|publisher=Cleis Press|isbn=978-1-936740-25-3|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation| ''The landlady was going to reply, but was prevented by the peace-making sergeant, sorely to the displeasure of Partridge, who was a great lover of what is called '''fun''', and a great promoter of those harmless quarrels which tend rather to the production of comical than tragical incidents.'' &lt;br /&gt;[[Henry Fielding]], ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'' (1749)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fielding|first=Henry|title=The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|year= 1749|publisher=Penguin Books (1966)|pages=458 (Book 9, Ch.6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The way the word ''fun'' is used demonstrates its distinctive elusiveness and happiness. Expressions such as "Have fun!" and "That was fun!" indicate that fun is pleasant, personal, and to some extent unpredictable. Expressions such as "I was making fun of myself" convey the sense that fun is something that can be amusing and not to be taken seriously. The adjective "funny" has two meanings which often need to be clarified between a speaker and listener. One meaning is "amusing, jocular, droll" and the other meaning is "odd, quirky, peculiar". These differences indicate the evanescent and experiential nature of fun and the difficulty of distinguishing "fun" from "enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~dixa/papers/ECCE-fun-2004/ecce-alan-fun-panel.pdf |author=Alan Dix |title=Fun Systematically |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fun's evanescence can be seen when an activity regarded as fun becomes goal-oriented. Many physical activities and individual sports are regarded as fun until the participant seeks to win a competition, at which point, much of the fun may disappear as the individual's focus tightens. Surfing is an example. If you are a "mellow soul" (not in a competition or engaging in extreme sport) "once you're riding waves, you're guaranteed to be having ... fun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alderson|first=Alf|title=Surfing: A Beginner's Guide|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester, England|at=Preface|isbn=978-0-470-51654-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pleasure of fun can be seen by the numerous efforts to harness its positive associations. For example, there are many books on serious subjects, about skills such as music, mathematics and languages, normally quite difficult to master, which have "fun" added to the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matz|first=Carol|title=Famous &amp; Fun Classic Themes – 13 Appealing Arrangements for Early Elementary to Elementary Pianists|year=2003|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Guzmán|first=Miguel|title=The Countingbury Tales: Fun With Mathematics|year=2000|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company|location=River Edge, NJ, Covent Garden, London|isbn=981-02-4032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akiyama|first=Nobuo|title=Learn Japanese (Nihongo): The Fast and Fun Way|year=1999|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=0-7641-0623-6|author2=Carol Akiyama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Many physical activities provide opportunities to play and have fun. Not only can these activities be fun but can also improve physical and mental states.

It has been suggested that games, toys, and activities perceived as fun are often challenging in some way. When a person is challenged to think consciously, overcome challenge and learn something new, they are more likely to enjoy a new experience and view it as fun. A change from routine activities appears to be at the core of this perception, since people spend much of a typical day engaged in activities that are routine and require limited conscious thinking. Routine information is processed by the brain as a "chunked pattern": "We rarely look at the real world", according to game designer [[Raph Koster]], "we instead recognize something we have chunked, and leave it at that. [...] One might argue that the essence of much of art is in forcing us to see things as they really are rather than as we assume them to be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koster|first=Raph|authorlink=Raph Koster|title=Theory of Fun for Game Design|year=2010|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4493-1497-2|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it helps people to relax, fun is sometimes regarded as a "social lubricant", important in adding "to one's pleasure in life" and helping to "act as a buffer against stress".&lt;ref name=Urdang&gt;{{cite book|last=Urdang|first=Esther|title=Human Behavior in the Social Environment: Interweaving the Inner and Outer Worlds|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-7890-3417-5|pages=445|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For children, fun is strongly related to play and they have great capacity to extract the fun from it in a spontaneous and inventive way. Play "involves the capacity to have fun – to be able to return, at least for a little while, to [[Neverland|never-never land]] and enjoy it."&lt;ref name=Urdang /&gt;

== Physiology ==
Some scientists have identified areas of the brain associated with the perception of novelty, which are stimulated when faced with "unusual or surprising circumstances". Information is initially received in the [[hippocampus]], the site of long-term memory consolidation, where the brain attempts to match the new information with recognizable patterns stored in long-term memory. When it is unable to do this, the brain releases [[dopamine]], a chemical which stimulates the [[amygdala]], the site of emotion, and creates a pleasurable feeling that is associated with the new memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sprenger|first=Marilee B.|title=The Leadership Brain For Dummies|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-60005-4|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, fun is created by stimulating the brain with novelty.

== In popular culture ==
In the modern world, fun is sold as a consumer product in the form of games, novelties, television, toys and other amusements. [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist]] sociologists such as the [[Frankfurt School]] criticise mass-manufactured fun as too calculated and empty to be fully satisfying. [[Bill Griffith]] satirises this [[dysphoria]] when his cartoon character [[Zippy the Pinhead]] asks mechanically, "Are we having fun yet?" In the [[Beatles]] song "[[She's Leaving Home]]" fun is called "the one thing that money can't buy."&lt;ref name=Sem&gt;{{citation |chapter=The Semantics of Fun |author=Mark Blythe, Marc Hassnzahl |pages=91–100 |title=Funology |publisher=Springer |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4020-2966-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Girl, Interrupted''''' is a best-selling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981084,00.html The Unconfessional Confessionalist], [[Time Magazine]], July 11, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[1993 in literature|1993]] [[memoir]] by [[Americans|American]] author [[Susanna Kaysen]], relating her experiences as a young woman in a [[psychiatric hospital]] in the 1960s after being diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]]. The memoir's title is a reference to the [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] painting ''[[Girl Interrupted at Her Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117759846.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 Girl, Interrupted], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], December 10, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing the novel ''Far Afield'', Kaysen began to recall her almost two years at [[McLean Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5503309_ITM A teenager's interrupted life], [[Knight Ridder]] Newspapers, December 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; She obtained her file from the hospital with the help of a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-4491115_ITM |title=''Girl, Interrupted'' (Reel Life) |journal=Clinical Psychiatry News |date=August 1, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218150247/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-4491115_ITM |archivedate=February 18, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the memoir was adapted into a [[Girl, Interrupted (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Winona Ryder]], [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Brittany Murphy]]. It was directed by [[James Mangold]].

==Plot==
In April 1967, 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen is admitted to McLean Hospital, in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]], after attempting [[suicide]] by overdosing on pills. She denies that it was a suicide attempt to a psychiatrist, who suggests she take time to regroup in McLean, a private mental hospital. Susanna is diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]], and her stay extends to 18 months&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5486864_ITM Susanna Kaysen finds stability in examining youthful 'insanity'], [[Knight Ridder|Knight-Ridder Newspapers]], August 4, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the proposed couple of weeks.

Fellow patients Polly, Cynthia, Lisa Rowe, Lisa Cody, Georgina and Daisy contribute to Susanna's experiences at McLean as she describes their personal issues and how they come to cope with the time they must spend in the hospital. Susanna also introduces the reader to particular staff members, including Valerie, Dr. Wick and Mrs. McWeeney. Susanna and the other girls are eventually informed that the recently released Daisy committed [[suicide]] on her birthday. Daisy's death deeply saddens the girls and they hold a prolonged moment of silence in her memory.

Susanna reflects on the nature of her illness, including difficulty making sense of visual patterns, and suggests that [[sanity]] is a falsehood constructed to help the "healthy" feel "normal" in comparison. She also questions how doctors treat [[mental illness]], and whether they are treating the [[brain]] or the [[mind]]. During her stay in the ward, Susanna also undergoes a period of [[depersonalization]], where she bites open the flesh on her hand after she becomes terrified that she has "lost her bones". She develops a frantic obsession with the verification of this proposed reality and even insists on seeing an X-ray of herself to make sure. This hectic moment is described with shorter, choppy sentences that show Kaysen's state of mind and thought processes as she went through them. Also, during a trip to the dentist with Valerie, Susanna becomes frantic after she wakes from the general [[anesthesia]], when no one will tell her how long she was unconscious, and she fears that she has lost time. Like the incident with her bones, Kaysen here also rapidly spirals into a panicky and obsessive state that is only ultimately calmed with medication.

After leaving McLean, Susanna mentions that she kept in touch with Georgina and eventually saw Lisa, now a single mother who was about to board the subway with her toddler son and seemed, although quirky, to be sane.

===Structure===
''Girl, Interrupted'' does not follow a linear [[Narrative structure|storyline]], but instead the author provides personal stories through a series of short descriptions of events and personal reflections on why she was placed in the hospital. She begins by talking about the concept of a parallel universe and how easy it is to slip into one, comparing insanity to an alternate world. She discusses how some people fall into insanity gradually and others just snap. Kaysen also details the doctor's visit before first going to the hospital and the taxi ride there at the beginning of the book before launching into the chronicles of her time at the hospital.

==Characters==
There are two main groups of characters, the patients and the staff. In addition to those there are her parents, her boyfriend and various other minor characters such as her former boss.

===Patients===
;Susanna Kaysen
:The autobiographical main character, Susanna Kaysen is admitted to a psychiatric ward to be treated for [[borderline personality disorder]] following a suicide attempt. She voluntarily admits herself after a short consultation with a psychiatrist who is also an acquaintance of the family. She is told that she will only be staying there for a few weeks, but it turns out to be one and a half years instead. Throughout the book, she frequently contrasts the time of the consultation, twenty minutes, to the time she ended up spending there.
;Lisa Rowe
:Lisa is diagnosed as a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]], but whether she actually is one is left open to interpretation. Lisa periodically escapes from the hospital, only to be found a day or two later and re-admitted. She is usually happy enough to be back though she does put up a fight when restrained. She is an ex-junkie who never sleeps and barely eats, and enjoys making trouble for the staff. She apparently takes some pride in her diagnosis. Although she has a therapist assigned to her, she never actually sees him. Lisa is not in contact with her family except her brother, but the extent of their contact is not described. She also has a lawyer, though it appears he is mostly used to threaten the staff if she doesn't get what she wants. Her behavior is wildly unpredictable, and while she can be kind, she is also capable of cruelty towards the other patients. For example, Lisa has an ongoing rivalry with Lisa Cody that ends in Lisa Cody reverting to drugs.
;Polly Clark
:Polly is a disfigured patient who was hospitalised for [[schizophrenia]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Polly has severe scarring on her body, the result of setting herself on fire. According to Kaysen, because of the sheer guts it took to actually do it, Polly is highly respected for her courage, to the extent that none of the patients will ask why she did it. During her first year at the hospital, she appears calm and even cheerful: "Life was hellish, she knew that. But, her smile hinted, she'd burned all that out of her."&lt;ref name=Virago&gt;Susana Kaysen, ''Girl, Interrupted'' (Virago Press, 2000 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; But one day she suddenly breaks down and begins to scream inconsolably, as if realizing for the first time her appearance and the permanency of it. Kaysen then realizes that while the other patients might be released from the hospital, Polly is trapped forever in her scarred body.
;Georgina Tuskin
:Hospitalized for [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref name=Virago/&gt; Georgina is Susanna's roommate at the institution. The two of them are considered the healthiest patients on the ward and are good friends throughout the book. Georgina apparently experienced her first symptoms after an episode in a movie theatre where she suddenly felt as if the darkness had surrounded her completely. It is not clear what the immediate reason for her diagnosis is. She also has a boyfriend in the hospital named Wade. 
;Lisa Cody
:Lisa is admitted to the ward after Susanna, and from her first days there she looks up to Lisa Rowe. She, too, is diagnosed as a sociopath, though Rowe questions this and is clearly annoyed that she is no longer the only sociopath there. A former drug addict like Rowe, she tries hard to defend herself from Lisa Rowe's accusations that she isn't "real". She eventually escapes and is apparently found by Lisa Rowe during one of her escapes from the hospital. Lisa tells the other girls with pride that Lisa Cody has become a "real" drug addict. Her fate after her escape is not described any further.
;Daisy Randone
:Daisy is a thin girl who arrives before Thanksgiving each year, staying through Christmas. She has a single room, where she spends most of her time. The other girls think she is addicted to [[laxatives]]. She eats only chicken, and does so only in her room. However, after letting Lisa into her room, Lisa reports back to the rest of them that she only needs the laxatives because of all of the chicken. She peels off the meat and keeps the carcasses, saying that when she has 14 carcasses, it's time to leave the hospital, possibly due to [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]. Daisy's father visits her quite often, and it is implied he has [[incest]]uous feelings for her. Daisy eventually commits suicide on her birthday. Susanna describes her as "sexy" and says Daisy had a spark that the rest of the girls lack. Daisy is reclusive and often refuses to be social. She hates it when anyone goes near her and is hostile when people approach her. However, she does allow Lisa to enter her room. Sometimes they even share cigarettes, indicating that Daisy does respect Lisa out of all the other patients on the ward.
;Torrey
:Torrey is a former drug addict. She was put into the ward after her parents discovered her promiscuity. She is the best friend of all the fellow patients. Her parents take her out against her will, and take her back to [[Mexico]], where she believes she will become an [[amphetamine]] addict again. She describes Mexico, saying "being in Mexico means being dead and shooting speed to feel like you're not quite dead" (Kaysen, 97). The girls do try to help her with an escape plan and pool their money for her to help her, but eventually that plan is ruined, partly by Torrey herself, as she is too afraid to do it, and partly by Valerie after she gives Torrey a cup of [[thorazine]] just prior to her departure to calm her down. Though she only appears for a short time she is an important character. Kaysen distinguishes between those put there indefinitely by parents willing to pay without questioning the progress of their treatment and those whose parents are not willing to do so. Torrey is used as an example of the latter group.
;Alice Calais
:At first Alice seems quiet and, in Kaysen's words, "not too crazy"; but after about a month she breaks down and is taken to maximum security. When the girls go to visit her they find that she has painted herself and the walls in her seclusion room with her own feces. Most of the other patients believe she was "raised in a closet" because she is ignorant about the trivial things in life. For example, she has never tasted honey and doesn't know how it tastes. She is also completely unaware that her last name is a [[Calais|well-known location in France]] and is overwhelmed in awe when she hears of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. It is not explained what happens to her after the girls visit her.
;Wade
:Wade, Georgina's boyfriend, is also a patient. Wade entertains the female patients with stories about his father, who he claims to be a CIA agent. He is prone to violent outbursts, which eventually results in his being moved to the maximum-security ward.
;Cynthia Crowley
:A severely depressive patient who undergoes weekly [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name=Virago/&gt; There are only a few references to her in the book and she isn't a major character in it.

===Staff===
;Valerie
:The head nurse on  the ward. She works there during the day and though she can be strict she is generally liked by the patients and Kaysen in particular. She is described as down to earth and rarely uses the psychiatric terms used by the therapists, which is something that Susanna herself despises. Kaysen recalls her as honest and direct. 
;Mrs. McWeeney
:The evening nurse on the ward. Described as the exact opposite of Valerie and very much disliked by the patients. Kaysen recalls her as "clearly nuts". Valerie does not like her and tends to ignore her, although she does describe her as a professional when the patients complain to her. Although the patients don't like her, they recognize that she needs to earn a living and that she has to work somewhere for that to happen.
;Dr. Wick
:The [[consultant psychiatrist]]. She is described as very old-fashioned and easy to embarrass. Susanna purposely tries to embarrass her, deliberately saying things that she knows Dr. Wick will react to, during their sessions together. She has previously worked in Africa and her direct contact with the patients is very limited, talking to them for only a matter of minutes in a session.
;Melvin
:Kaysen's late therapist and analyst. Susanna says that the two of them used to be good friends and that she once enjoyed sessions with him. According to her, he was old, balding, and slightly unattractive. Susanna would go into his office sometimes and just sit there in silence because there wasn't very much silence in the hospital and she needed a break. However, this relationship was short-lived; Melvin rolled into the hospital parking lot, and, when greeted enthusiastically by Susanna, refused to entertain her. Her opinion of him spiraled downward from that point.

{{Chinese|t=衞生教育展覽及資料中心|p=Wèishēng Jiàoyù Zhǎnlǎn jí Zīliào Zhōngxīn}}
The '''Health Education Exhibition and Resources Centre''' opened on 17{{nbsp}}May 1997 in [[Kowloon Park]], Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. It is under the management of the [[Food and Environmental Hygiene Department]] of the Government of Hong Kong.

==History==
The Health Education Exhibition and Resource Centre is housed in a [[List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade I historic building]] (Block S4 of the former [[Whitfield Barracks]]) in Kowloon Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/Brief_Information_on_proposed_Grade_I_Items.pdf Brief Information on proposed Grade I Items] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013023413/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/Brief_Information_on_proposed_Grade_I_Items.pdf |date=2012-10-13 }}. Items #48&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1993 the former [[Urban Council]] endorsed a proposal to use the building to house an Urban Council Health Education Exhibition and Resource Centre.

==Floor plan==
The centre comprises an exhibition area on two floors and an outdoor [[health education]] garden. 

The exhibition on the ground floor introduce the general information of [[Food and Environmental Hygiene Department]] and then focuses on various aspects of food and environmental hygiene - high-risk foods, [[GM food]]s and [[food additive]]s. The topics are thoroughly explained through computer games, videos and photos, etc. 

The ground floor lecture room holds regular seminars and visitors can also enjoy a walk in the Health Education Garden while browsing the history and development of the [[Keep Hong Kong Clean Campaign]].

There is also a souvenir counter on the ground floor.

The first floor hosts temporary exhibitions in the centre of the hall and permanent exhibitions on environmental hygiene, kitchen hygiene, [[public toilet]]s and [[pest control]]. 

An additional resources center is located on the second floor. The resource center boasts a collection of over 6,000 publications, a lecture room and a small conference room. It is equipped with a great variety of books and audio-visual materials.

==Activities==
The centre organises extra-curricular programmes such as school and group visits, a volunteer scheme and a health troop membership scheme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2583">The health of the Scottish population is, and has been for many years, worse than that of the English. Life expectancy is the lowest in the UK, at 77.1 for men and 81.1 for women, and one of the lowest in the OECD. The gap between Scotland and England has grown since 1980. Some of this is clearly attributable to economic disadvantage, but the differences in health status are more pronounced that would be expected on that basis. It has often been suggested that the Scottish diet is to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Snacks, fags and booze: Scotland's triple health challenge|url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/inside-politics/snacks-fags-and-booze-scotlands-triple-health-challenge|accessdate=16 September 2017|publisher=Holyrood|date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is particularly so in [[Glasgow]] and the [[Glasgow effect]] has been the subject of some academic study.

==Obesity==
The [[Committees_of_the_Scottish_Parliament#Health_and_Sport|Health and Sport Committee]] has called for more action to tackle Scotland’s “obesogenic environment”.

==Smoking==
The tobacco control strategy has had a "positive impact".  Scottish smoking rates fell from 31% in 2003 to 21% in 2015. There is a socio-economic gradient with 35% of people living in the most deprived areas smoking compared to 10% in the most affluent areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scottish anti-smoking strategy shows 'positive impact'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-41095421|accessdate=16 September 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
There is some evidence that Scottish patients more often seek medical help with stress, anxiety and depression than English patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Depression levels high in Scotland|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1466882.stm|accessdate=2 February 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=31 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help combat this, Scotland has put in place a Mental Health Strategy. The strategy began in 2016 and will last for ten years. It aims to increase accessibility of mental healthcare towards children and adolescents, improve attitudes towards mental illness, and educate the community. The overall goal is to improve how people in Scotland live, grow, work, and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental health and wellbeing|url=http://www.healthscotland.scot/health-topics/mental-health-and-wellbeing|accessdate=16 September 2017|publisher=NHS Health Scotland|date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that the [[Bible]] prohibits ingesting [[blood]] and that Christians should not accept [[blood transfusion]]s or donate or store their own blood for transfusion.&lt;ref&gt;''Keep Yourself in God's Love'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 2008, page 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief is based on an interpretation of scripture that differs from that of other Christian denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-09/news/ct-met-jehovahs-witness-patients-bloodless-treatme-20121009_1_hospital-liaison-committee-blood-transfusions-dewald|first=Manya A.|last=Brachear|date=9 October 2012|title=More doctors honor religious objections to blood transfusions|website=Chicago Tribune|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103094136/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-09/news/ct-met-jehovahs-witness-patients-bloodless-treatme-20121009_1_hospital-liaison-committee-blood-transfusions-dewald|archivedate=3 November 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the doctrines for which Jehovah's Witnesses are best known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Evans| first = Allan S.|author2=Riley E.

Jehovah's Witnesses' literature teaches that their refusal of transfusions of whole blood or its four primary components—red cells, white cells, platelets and plasma—is a non-negotiable religious stand and that those who respect life as a gift from [[God in Christianity|God]] do not try to sustain life by taking in blood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Can Blood Save Your Life?|publisher=Watch Tower Society|pages=3&amp;ndash;7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;"Be Guided by the Living God", ''The Watchtower'', June 15, 2004, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; even in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;"Godly Respect for Blood", ''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1986, page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses are taught that the use of fractions such as [[albumin]], [[antibody|immunoglobulin]]s and [[hemophilia]]c preparations are "not absolutely prohibited", and are instead a matter of personal choice.&lt;ref name="Guide" /&gt;

The doctrine was introduced in 1945, and has undergone some changes since then.

The Watch Tower Society has established Hospital Information Services to provide education and facilitate [[bloodless surgery]]. This service also maintains Hospital Liaison Committees, whose function is to provide support to adherents.

==Doctrine==
On the basis of various biblical texts, including {{Bibleref|Genesis|9:4}}, {{Bibleref|Leviticus|17:10}}, and {{Bibleref|Acts|15:28-15:29}}, Jehovah's Witnesses believe:
* Blood represents life&lt;ref&gt;''How Can Blood Save Your Life'', published by Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 1990 p. 24, "God told all mankind that they must not eat blood. Why? Because blood represents life."&lt;/ref&gt; and is sacred to God.&lt;ref name=Awake06&gt;''Awake!'', August 2006 p. 11, "He also gave them his reason, equating blood with the soul, or life, of the creature. He later said: 'The soul [or life] is in the blood.' In the eyes of the Creator, blood is sacred. It represents the precious gift of life that each living soul possesses."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', June 15, 2004 p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; After it has been removed from a creature, the only use of blood that God has authorized is for the atonement of sins.&lt;ref name=WT97&gt;''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1997 p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; When a Christian abstains from blood, they are in effect expressing faith that only the shed blood of Jesus Christ can truly redeem them and save their life.&lt;ref name=Awake06 /&gt;
* Blood must not be eaten or transfused,&lt;ref name="JWpress2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', June 1, 1969 pp. 326, 327&lt;/ref&gt; even in the case of a medical emergency.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1986 p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blood leaving the body of a human or animal must be disposed of.&lt;ref name=WT97 /&gt;
* Certain medical procedures involving blood fractions or that use a patient's own blood during the course of a medical procedure, such as hemodilution or cell salvage, are a matter of personal choice, according to what a person's conscience permits.&lt;ref&gt;October 15, 2000 Watchtower, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
* A baptized Witness who unrepentantly accepts a blood transfusion is deemed to have disassociated himself from the group by abandoning its doctrines and is subsequently subject to organized shunning by other members.&lt;ref name="BMJOM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JWpress2000" /&gt;

Certain medical procedures involving blood are specifically prohibited by Jehovah's Witnesses' blood doctrine. This includes the use of [[red blood cells]], [[white blood cells]], [[platelets]] and [[blood plasma]]. Other fractions derived from blood are not prohibited. [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower]] publications state that some products derived from one of the four primary components may be so similar to the function of the whole component and carry on such a life-sustaining role in the body that "most Christians would find them objectionable".&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', June 15, 2004 P.24 par. 16&lt;/ref&gt; For procedures where there is no specific doctrinal prohibition, individuals are to obtain details from medical personnel and then make a personal decision.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1989, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibited procedures===

The following medical procedures are prohibited:
* Transfusion of [[allogeneic]] whole blood, or of its constituents of red cells, white cells, platelets or plasma.&lt;ref name=WT2000-06-15p29-31&gt;''The Watchtower'', June 15, 2000 pp. 29-31&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transfusions of pre-operative self-donated ([[Autotransplantation#Autologous blood donation|autologous]]) blood.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31&gt;''The Watchtower'', October 15, 2000 pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permitted procedures and products===

The following procedures and products are not prohibited, and are left to the decision of individual members:&lt;ref&gt;Our Kingdom Ministry, November 2006 pages 3,4 para.1-6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blood donation strictly for purpose of further fractionation of red cells, white cells, platelets or plasma for either allogeneic or autologous transfusion.&lt;ref name=WT2000-06-15p29-31 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jehovah's Witness letter to Cliff Roche, July 30, 2001 (Published in the book ''Three Dissertations on the Teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses'', by Greg Stafford, 2002 {{ISBN|0-9659814-2-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transfusions of autologous blood part of a "current therapy".&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* Hemodilution, a modified technique in which equipment is arranged in a circuit that is constantly linked to the patient's circulatory system.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* [[Intraoperative blood salvage]] (autologous) or ''cell-saver scavenging'', a method of picking up blood that has spilled from the circulatory system into an open wound, cleaning and re-infusing it.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* [[Life support|Heart-Lung Machine]], a method in which blood is diverted to an artificial heart-lung machine and directed back into the patient.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* [[Dialysis]], wherein blood circulates through a machine, is filtered and cleaned, then returned to the patient.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* [[Epidural blood patch|Epidural Blood Patch]], consisting of a small amount of the patient's blood injected into the membrane surrounding the spinal cord.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* [[Plasmapheresis]], wherein blood is withdrawn and filtered, having the plasma removed and substituted, and returned to the patient.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* Labeling or Tagging, blood is withdrawn, mixed with medicine, and then returned to the patient by transfusion.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Instructions for Filling in The Advance Decision Document'', published by Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 2005 p.1. This document specifically applies the term "transfusion" to a Jehovah's Witness patient having blood returned to their cardiovascular system after it was completely removed from their body.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Platelet]] Gel, blood is withdrawn and put into a solution rich in platelets and white blood cells.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* Fractions from red blood cells:
** [[Hemoglobin]], the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells.

==Bloodless surgery==
{{Main|Bloodless surgery}}
A variety of bloodless surgical techniques have been developed for use on patients who refuse blood transfusions for reasons that include concern about [[AIDS]], [[hepatitis]], and other blood-borne infections, or [[immune system#Disorders of human immunity|immune system reaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer S, Webb D, Your Body Your Choice: The Layman's Complete Guide to Bloodless Medicine and Surgery, 2000; pages 11, 14, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Many physicians have expressed a willingness to respect patients' preferences and provide bloodless treatment&lt;ref name=Ariga2003&gt;Ariga et al., Legal Medicine, 5 (2003) S72-S75&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=April 2010}} and about 200 hospitals offer bloodless medicine and surgery programs for patients who wish to avoid or limit blood transfusions.&lt;ref name=Ariga2003 /&gt; Bloodless surgery has been successfully performed in significant procedures including [[cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]] and total [[hip replacement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rwjuh.edu/medserv/bloodless.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828200449/http://www.rwjuh.edu/medserv/bloodless.html |archivedate=2005-08-28 |df= }}, {{cite web |url=http://www.theuniversityhospital.com/bloodless/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060406155101/http://www.theuniversityhospital.com/bloodless/ |archivedate=2006-04-06 |df= }}, {{cite web |url=http://www.theuniversityhospital.com/bloodless/html/aboutthecenter/casestudies.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502063014/http://www.theuniversityhospital.com/bloodless/html/aboutthecenter/casestudies.htm |archivedate=2006-05-02 |df= }}, and [http://www.noblood.org/forum/index.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405230240/http://www.noblood.org/forum/index.php |date=2004-04-05 }} - successful cases of bloodless surgery&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study in ''[[JAMA Internal Medicine]]'' concluded that "Witnesses do not appear to be at increased risk for surgical complications or long-term mortality when comparisons are properly made by transfusion status. Thus, current extreme blood management strategies do not appear to place patients at heightened risk for reduced long-term survival." The study also stated that "Survival estimates of Witnesses were 86%, 69%, 51%, and 34% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after surgery, respectively, vs 74%, 53%, 35%, and 23% among non-Witnesses who received transfusions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2012.2449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloodless medical and surgical techniques have limitations, and surgeons say the use of various allogeneic blood products and pre-operative autologous blood transfusion are appropriate standards of care for certain patient presentations.&lt;ref&gt;Spence et al., Transfusion May 2003; Vol. 43 p. 668&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transfusion-Free Medicine, edited by Dr Nicolas Jabbour, 2005 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The Watch Tower Society states that in [[medical emergency|medical emergencies]] where blood transfusions seem to be the only available way to save a life, Jehovah's Witnesses request that doctors provide the best alternative care possible under the circumstances with respect for their personal conviction.&lt;ref&gt;"Are You Ready to Face a Faith-Challenging Medical Situation?", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The Watch Tower Society has acknowledged that some members have died after refusing blood.&lt;ref&gt;"Youths Who Have Power Beyond What Is Normal", ''Awake!'', May 22, 1994, pages 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom, a parent or guardian's decision can be legally overruled by medical staff. In this case, medical staff may act without consent, by obtaining a [[court order]] in a non-emergency situation, or without such in an emergency.&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;{{cite web |last1=Richards |first1=Edward |last2=Rathbun |first2=Katharine |title=Medical Risk Management: Preventive Legal Strategies for Health Care Providers |url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Books/aspen/Aspen-THE-11.html |website=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Books/aspen/Aspen.html |publisher=Aspen Systems Corporation |accessdate=12 July 2014 |location=Chapter Nine, The Emergency Exception |year=1983 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182248/http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Books/aspen/Aspen-THE-11.html |archive-date=2014-07-14 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartman |first1=Kurt |last2=Liang |first2=Bryan |title=Exceptions to Informed Consent in Emergency Medicine |journal=Hospital Physician |date=March 1999 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=53–55 |url=http://www.turner-white.com/pdf/hp_mar99_emergmed.pdf |accessdate=13 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021094753/http://www.turner-white.com/pdf/hp_mar99_emergmed.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, a doctor must respect the wish of an adult but can override the wishes of a child and their parents if the child is under 15. If a child is aged 15 to 17, a doctor will not perform a transfusion if the parents and the child refuse the transfusion. If a child aged from 15 to 17 objects to a transfusion but the parents demand the transfusion, then a doctor can override the child's wish.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In the [[United States]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends that in cases of "an imminent threat to a child's life", physicians in some cases may "intervene over parental objections".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics | year = 1997 | title = Religious objections to medical care | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 99 | issue = 2| pages = 279–281 | doi=10.1542/peds.99.2.279 | pmid=9024462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospital Liaison Committees===

In 1988, the Watch Tower Society formed ''Hospital Information Services'', a department to help locate doctors or surgical teams who are willing to perform medical procedures on Witnesses without blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;''Our Kingdom Ministry'', September 1988, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The department was given oversight of each branch office's ''Hospital Information Desk'',&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses—1998 Yearbook Report", ''1998 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', ©1997 Watch Tower, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses—1996 Yearbook Report", ''1996 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', ©1997 Watch Tower, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Bridging the Gap Between Doctors and Witness Patients", ''Awake!'', November 22, 1990, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; and of one hundred ''Hospital Liaison Committees'' established throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Are You Ready to Face a Faith-Challenging Medical Situation?", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', November 1990, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=recognition&gt;{{cite web|date=September 2002|title=Certificate of Recognition issued by Society for the Advancement of Blood Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013045/http://www.jw-media.org/gbl/20021118.htm|archive-date=March 6, 2012|url=http://www.jw-media.org/gbl/20021118.htm|publisher=Watch Tower Society|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, about 200 hospitals worldwide provide bloodless medical programs.&lt;ref name=Ariga2003 /&gt; As of 2006, there are 1,535 Hospital Liaison Committees worldwide coordinating communication between 110,000 physicians.&lt;ref name=recognition /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;January 3, 2006 Letter from Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses; To all Congregations&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient Visitation Groups===
Annually since 2004, Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States have been informed that "with your consent, the law allows for the [[Elder (Christianity)#Jehovah's Witnesses|elders]] to learn of your admission [to hospital] and provide spiritual encouragement",&lt;ref&gt;"Announcements", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', November 2005, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; but that "elders serving on a ''Patient Visitation Group'' [could] have access to your name" only if patients made their wishes known according to the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).&lt;ref&gt;"Announcements", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', October 2004, page 7, emphasis added to quote&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses' branch offices communicate directly with congregations regarding "ways to benefit from the activities of the Hospital Liaison Committee (HLC) and the Patient Visitation Group (PVG)."&lt;ref&gt;"Service Meeting Schedule", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', January 2006, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; A Jehovah's Witnesses publication in 2000 reported that Argentina had fewer than a hundred HLC committeemen "giving vital information to the medical community", adding that "their work is complemented by hundreds of other self-sacrificing elders who make up Patient Visitation Groups that call on Witness patients to help and encourage them".&lt;ref&gt;"Argentina", ''2001 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', ©2000 Watch Tower, page 212&lt;/ref&gt; Each branch office appoints PVG committeemen, who serve as volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;""Follow Me Continually"", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', May 2006, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"No One Has Love Greater Than This", ''Come Be My Follower'', ©2007 Watch Tower, pages 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance among Jehovah's Witnesses==

In 1958, ''[[The Watchtower]]'' reported on a particular member of Jehovah's Witnesses who voluntarily accepted blood transfusion, contrary to Watchtower doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower August 1, 1958 p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; The organization confirms that members have accepted blood transfusions, despite the imposition in 1961 of a communal shunning policy for willful acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower January 15, 1961 p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower October 15, 1987 p. 14, "Three areas for attention were mentioned: secretly accepting a blood transfusion, masturbation, and alcohol abuse. After considering that material, quite a number of readers wrote letters of appreciation; they admitted that they had had those faults, but they had been moved to repent and change."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, a peer-reviewed case study of a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses was undertaken by Drs. Larry J. Findley and Paul M. Redstone to evaluate individual belief in respect to blood among Jehovah's Witnesses. The study showed that 12% were willing to accept transfusion therapy forbidden by Jehovah's Witness doctrine.&lt;ref name=Findley82&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Findley LJ, Redstone PM |title=Blood transfusion in adult Jehovah's Witnesses.

Of the 59, 7 stipulated they would accept plasma transfusion (Table 1 on page 607). This result compelled Findley and Redstone to comment, "there is either some lack of understanding or refusal to follow doctrine among some members". Whether from misunderstanding or refusal to follow doctrine, at no point did Findley and Redstone question whether these responders had honestly expressed their personal conviction. Findley and Redstone also stipulated their methodology may have skewed the results towards official Jehovah's Witness doctrine. (Local elders provided the names to be surveyed, and those surveyed knew local elders would see the results of the study.) The authors also admit that this study may not describe the beliefs of "less religious Jehovah's Witnesses".&lt;/ref&gt; One peer-reviewed study examining medical records indicated a similar percentage of Jehovah's Witnesses willing to accept blood transfusions for their children. Young adults also showed a willingness to accept blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;Kaaron Benson, [[H.

Watch Tower publications have noted that within religions, the personal beliefs of members often differ from official doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;"Where Are the Faithful?", ''Awake!'', April 8, 1996, p. 4, "Nowadays official church dogma may bear scant resemblance to the personal beliefs of those who profess that particular religion."&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Jehovah's Witnesses acceptance of the organization's official position on blood, Drs Cynthia Gyamfi and Richard Berkowitz state, "It is naïve to assume that all people in any religious group share the exact same beliefs, regardless of doctrine. It is well known that Muslims, Jews and Christians have significant individual variations in their beliefs. Why should that not also be true of Jehovah's Witnesses?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas JM |title=Responses by pregnant Jehovah's Witnesses on health care proxies |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=441; author reply 442–3 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15684182 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000149842.31312.e4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambivalence and rejection of the blood doctrine dates back to at least the 1940s. After the Watch Tower Society established the doctrine, teaching that blood should not be eaten (circa 1927-31), Margaret Buber, who was never a member of the denomination, offered a firsthand eyewitness account of Jehovah's Witnesses in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]]. She relates that an overwhelming majority were willing to eat [[blood sausage]] despite having alternate food to choose from, and specifically after considering biblical statements regarding blood.&lt;ref&gt;Buber, M., Under Two Dictators, 1949 pp. 222, 235-237. Buber states the Jehovah's Witness prisoners all ate blood sausage, until around 1943. At that time she relates that 25 of the 275 Jehovah's Witness prisoners refused to eat blood sausage. She underlines the fact that this occurred in the presence of knowledge of Biblical statements regarding blood.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of doctrine ==
From 1931, when the name "Jehovah's witnesses" was adopted, Watch Tower Society publications maintained the view of Society founder [[Charles Taze Russell]] that the reference to abstaining from the eating of blood in the [[Council of Jerusalem|Apostolic Decree]] of Acts 15:19–29 was a "suggestion" to be given to [[Gentile]] converts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watch Tower'', November 15, 1892 p. 351, "It will be noticed that nothing is said about keeping the ten commandments, nor any part of the Jewish law. It was evidently taken for granted that having received the spirit of Christ the new law of love would be a general regulation for them. The things mentioned were merely to guard against stumbling themselves or becoming stumbling blocks to others."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watch Tower'', April 15, 1909 pp. 116-117, "These prohibitions had never come to the Gentiles, because they had never been under the Law Covenant; but so deeply rooted were the Jewish ideas on this subject that it was necessary to the peace of the Church that the Gentiles should observe this matter also ... these items thus superadded to the Law of Love should be observed by all spiritual Israelites as representing the Divine will."&lt;/ref&gt; Watch Tower publications during the presidency of [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]] commended the commercial and emergency uses of blood.&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age'', October 15, 1919 p. 47, "A serious difficulty which has been overcome in the use of plywood for airplanes construction was the making from blood of a glue that will stand any quantity of moisture without letting go…. In this plywood, stronger than steel, we have an illustration of how the Lord can take characters, weak in themselves, and surround them with such influence and so fortify them by his promises as to make them "mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds" of error and sin.—2 Cor. 10:4"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age'', December 17, 1924 p. 163, "Remarkable Tale of Womanly Heroism…. Fearing the death of the child, the woman deliberately cut her arms and breast with glass from the windshield to provide blood to keep the child alive during the cold nights. The child will recover, but the heroine is expected to die."&lt;/ref&gt; A 1925 issue of ''The Golden Age'' commended a man for donating blood 45 times without payment.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, July 29, 1925 p. 683&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, ''The Watchtower'' noted, without elaboration, that in Genesis 9, God decreed that [[Noah]] and his offspring "must not eat the blood, because the life is in the blood".&lt;ref&gt;"One Reason for God's Vengeance", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1927, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 ''Consolation'' magazine reported on a woman who accidentally shot herself with a revolver in her heart and survived a major surgical procedure during which an attending physician donated a quart of his own blood for transfusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Consolation|date=December 25, 1940|page=19|quote=one of the attending physicians in the great emergency gave a quart of his own blood for transfusion, and today the woman lives and smiles gaily over what happened to her in the busiest 23 minutes of her life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, with the Watch Tower Society under the administration of president [[Nathan Homer Knorr]], ''The Watchtower'' asserted that the decrees contained in Genesis 9:4 and Leviticus 17:10–14 forbade the eating or drinking of blood in biblical times "whether by transfusion or by the mouth" and that this applied "in a spiritual way to the consecrated persons of good-will today, otherwise known as '[[Jehonadab|Jonadabs]]' of the Lord's 'other sheep'."&lt;ref&gt;"The Stranger's Right Maintained", ''The Watchtower'', December 1, 1944, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1945, representatives of the Watch Tower Society in the [[Netherlands]] commented on blood transfusion in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] edition of ''[[Awake!|Consolation]]''. A translation of their comments into English reads: {{quote|When we lose our life because we refuse inoculations, that does not bear witness as a justification of Jehovah's name. God never issued regulations which prohibit the use of drugs, inoculations or blood transfusions. It is an invention of people, who, like the Pharisees, leave Jehovah's mercy and love aside.&lt;ref&gt;''Vertroosting'' (''Consolation''), September 1945 p. 29, "Wanneer wij ons leven verliezen, doordat wij weigeren, inspuitingen te laten maken, dient zulks niet tot een getuigenis ter rechtvaardiging van Jehova's Naam. God heeft nooit bepalingen uitgevaardigd die het gebruik van medicijnen, inspuitingen of bloedtransfusie verbiedt. Het is een ultvinding van menschen, die gelijk de Farizeën Jehova's barmhartigheid laten."&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to sociologist Richard Singelenbreg, the statement appearing in the Dutch edition of ''Consolation'' may have been published without knowledge of the doctrinal position published in the English July 1945 issue of ''Consolation'' by the Watch Tower Society's headquarters in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''The Blood Transfusion Taboo of Jehovah's Witnesses: Origin, Development and Function of a Controversial Doctrine'', Social Science Medicine, Singelenbreg, R., 1990, Vol. 31, No. 4, p. 516.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, the application of the doctrine on blood was expanded to prohibit blood transfusions of whole blood, whether allogeneic or autologous.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, July 1, 1945, p. 198-201&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition did not specify any punitive measures for accepting a transfusion, but by January 1961&amp;mdash;in what was later described as an application of "increased strictness"&lt;ref&gt;"Assume Your Christian Obligations", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1966, p. 142, "In the counsel from the pages of this magazine there has been a note of increased strictness with regard to pure worship, the placing of additional obligations on each one individually, strict counsel on morals, honesty, neutrality and such requirements as showing respect for the sanctity of blood."&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;it was ruled that it was a disfellowshipping offense to conscientiously accept a blood transfusion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', January 15, 1961, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Watch Tower publications warned that accepting a blood transfusion could prevent Witnesses from living eternally in God's new world, the hope held by members: "It may result in the immediate and very temporary prolongation of life, but that at the cost of eternal life for a dedicated Christian."&lt;ref&gt;''Blood, Medicine, and the Law of God'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 1961, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1956, ''Awake!'' stated, "certain blood fractions ... also come under the Scriptural ban".&lt;ref&gt;Awake!, September 8, 1956 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; A position against "the various blood fractions" was reiterated in September 1961.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, September 15, 1961, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; In November of the same year, the doctrine was modified to allow individual members to decide whether they could conscientiously accept fractions used from blood for purposes such as vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, November 1, 1961, p. 670&lt;/ref&gt; This position has been expanded on since; the pre-formatted Durable Power of Attorney form provided by the Watch Tower Society includes an option for Jehovah's Witnesses to "accept all fractions derived from any primary component of blood."&lt;ref&gt;Durable Power of Attorney form, published by Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, January 2001 p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Jehovah's Witnesses were prohibited from obtaining transfusions for [[pet]]s, from using fertilizer containing blood, and were even advised (if their conscience troubled them) to write to dog food manufacturers to verify that their products were blood-free.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, February 15, 1964, p. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, it was stated that doctors or nurses who are Jehovah's Witness would not administer blood transfusions to fellow dedicated members. As to administering transfusions to non-members, ''The Watchtower'' stated that such a decision is "left to the Christian doctor's own conscience."&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, November 15, 1964, p. 680-683&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, a ''Watchtower'' article declared that it would be wrong for a Witness to allow a leech to feed on his/her blood as part of a medical procedure, due to the sacredness of blood.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, June 15, 1982, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 ''The Watchtower'' stated, "Each individual must decide" whether to accept hemodilution and autologous blood salvage (cell saver) procedures.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, March 1, 1989 p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, a brochure entitled ''How Can Blood Save Your Life?'' was released, outlining Jehovah's Witnesses' general doctrine on blood.

In 2000, the Watch Tower Society's stand on blood fractions was clearly stated.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, June 15, 2000, p. 29-31&lt;/ref&gt; Members were instructed to personally decide if accepting a fraction would violate the doctrine on blood. In a later article, members were reminded that Jehovah's Witnesses do not donate blood or store their own blood prior to surgery.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, October 15, 2000, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, the Watch Tower Society revised its medical directives and identity cards addressing its doctrinal position on blood; the revised materials were distributed from May 3, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to All Presiding Overseers and Secretaries in the United States, Watchtower May 3, 2001, and Enclosure&lt;/ref&gt; These revised documents specified that "allogeneic blood transfusions" were unacceptable whereas the former document (dated 1999) stated that "blood transfusions" were unacceptable. The revised 2001 documents were active until December 20, 2001. The Watch Tower Society then rescinded the revised document, stating, "After further review, it has been determined that the cards dated "md-E 6/01" and "ic-E 6/01" should not be used. Please destroy these items and make sure that they are not distributed to the publishers." Elders were instructed to revert to the older 1999 edition of the medical directives and identity cards.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to All Presiding Overseers and Secretaries in the United States, Watchtower December 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Watch Tower Society publications frequently claim negative consequences of blood transfusions:
*A 1951 ''Watchtower'' declared: "And let the transfusion enthusiasts with a savior-complex ponder the fact that on many occasions transfusions do harm, spread disease, and frequently cause deaths, which, of course, are not publicized."&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, July 1, 1951, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 1961 ''Watchtower'' quoted Brazilian surgeon Dr Américo Valério as saying transfusions were often followed by "moral insanity, sexual perversions, repression, inferiority complexes, petty crimes" and Dr Alonzo Jay Shadman claiming that a person's blood "contains all the peculiarities of the individual ... [including] hereditary taints, disease susceptibilities, poisons due to personal living, eating and drinking habits ... The poisons that produce the impulse to commit suicide, murder, or steal are in the blood."&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, September 15, 1961, p. 563-564&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 1969 ''Awake!'' reported on a man named Robert Khoury, who, after receiving a blood transfusion said, "When I recovered I found I had a terrible desire to steal."&lt;ref&gt;Awake!, July 8, 1969, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 1974 ''Awake!'' cited a [[Centers for Disease Control]] report that as many as 35,000 deaths and 500,000 illnesses a year might be due to the presence of serum hepatitis in blood for transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;''Awake!'', May 22, 1974, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2006 ''Awake!'' highlighted dangers from transfusion-related acute lung injury ([[TRALI]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Awake!'', August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical views ==

Opposition to the Watch Tower doctrines on blood transfusions has come from both members and non-members. A group of dissident Witnesses known as Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood (AJWRB) states that there is no biblical basis for the prohibition of blood transfusions and seeks to have some policies changed.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Elder, "Why some Jehovah's Witnesses accept blood and conscientiously reject official Watchtower Society blood policy", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', 2000, Vol.26, pages 375-380.&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of articles in the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]'' US neurologist Osamu Muramoto, who is a medical adviser to the AJWRB, has raised issues including what he claims is coercion to refuse transfusions, doctrinal inconsistency, selective use of information by the Watch Tower Society to exaggerate the dangers of transfusions and the use of outdated medical beliefs.

Dissident Witnesses say the Society's use of Leviticus 17:12 to support its opposition to blood transfusions&lt;ref&gt;"Rightly Value Your Gift of Life," ''The Watchtower'', June 15, 2004, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''United in Worshop of the Only True God'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1983, page 160.&lt;/ref&gt; conflicts with its own teachings that Christians are not under the Mosaic law.&lt;ref&gt;"What Does Jehovah Ask of Us Today?"

Lenski, ''The Interpretation of the Acts of the Apostles'', Wartburg Press, Columbus, Ohio, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; who support his view that the direction at Acts 15 to abstain from blood was intended not as an everlasting covenant but a means of maintaining a peaceful relationship between Jewish and Gentile Christians.

===Coercion===

Osamu Muramoto has argued that the refusal by Jehovah's Witnesses of "life-saving" blood treatment&lt;ref name="Bio3"&gt;{{cite journal |pages= 463–8 | pmc=479294 | pmid=10635499 | volume=25 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 3.

He has criticized the "controlling intervention" of the Watch Tower Society by means of what he claims is information control and its policy of penalising members who accept blood transfusions or advocate freedom to choose blood-based treatment.&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio3" /&gt; He says the threat of being classified as a disassociated Witness and subsequently shunned by friends and relatives who are members coerces Jehovah's Witnesses to accept and obey the prohibition on blood transfusions.&lt;ref name="BMJOM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377601 | pmid=9800583 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 2.

It noted: "On the contrary, it appears that many Jehovah's Witnesses have made a deliberate choice to refuse blood transfusions in advance, free from time constraints of an emergency situation." The court said: "The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide ... not to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=869647&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |title=ECHR Point number 136, 139 |access-date=2010-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526123653/http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=869647&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |archive-date=2011-05-26 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muramoto has claimed the intervention of Hospital Liaison Committees can add to "organisational pressure" applied by family members, friends and congregation members on Witness patients to refuse blood-based treatment. He notes that while HLC members, who are church elders, "may give the patient 'moral support', the influence of their presence on the patient is known to be tremendous. Case reports reveal JW patients have changed their earlier decision to accept blood treatment after a visit from the elders." He claims such organizational pressure compromises the autonomy of Witness patients and interferes with their privacy and confidentiality. He has advocated a policy in which the Watch Tower organization and congregation elders would not question patients on the details of their medical care and patients would not disclose such information. He says the Society adopted such a policy in 1983 regarding details of sexual activity between married couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 479294 | pmid=10635499 | volume=25 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 3.

Watch Tower spokesman Donald T. Ridley says neither elders nor HLC members are instructed or encouraged to probe into the health care decisions of Witness patients and do not involve themselves in patient hospitalisations unless patients request their assistance. Yet Watchtower HLC representative David Malyon says he would respond to "sin" of Witnesses he is privy to by effectively saying "Are you going to tell them or shall I!"&lt;ref name="Malyon2"&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=479136 | pmid=9873976 | volume=24 | title=Transfusion-free treatment of Jehovah's Witnesses: respecting the autonomous patient's motives | journal=J Med Ethics | pages=376–81 | last1 = Malyon | first1 = D | doi=10.1136/jme.24.6.376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless Ridley says Muramoto's suggestion that Witnesses should be free to disregard Watch Tower scriptural teachings and standards is preposterous. He says loving God means obeying commandments, not disobeying them and hiding one's disobedience from others.&lt;ref name="irish" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?artid=1388640 Donald T. Ridley, "Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal of blood: obedience to scripture and religious conscience", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', 1999, Vol. 25, page 471.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716113512/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?artid=1388640 |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muramoto recommends doctors have a private meeting with patients to discuss their wishes, and that church elders and family members not be present, enabling patients to feel free of church pressure. He suggests doctors question patients on (a) whether they have considered that the Watch Tower Society might soon approve some medical practices they currently find objectionable, in the same manner that it has previously abandoned its opposition to vaccination and organ transplants; (b) whether Witness patients know which blood components are allowed and which are prohibited, and whether they acknowledge that those rulings are organizational policy rather than biblical teachings; and (c) whether they realize that although some Bible scriptures proscribe the eating of blood, eating and transfusing blood have entirely different effects on the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377601 | pmid=9800583 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 2.

===Selective use of information===

Muramoto has claimed many Watch Tower Society publications employ exaggeration and emotionalism to emphasize the dangers of transfusions and the advantages of alternative treatments, but present a distorted picture by failing to report any benefits of blood-based treatment. Nor do its publications acknowledge that in some situations, including rapid and massive [[haemorrhage]], there are no alternatives to blood transfusions.&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | page= 301 | pmc=1377601 | pmid=9800583 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 2.

[[Douglas E. Cowan]], an academic in the sociology of religion, has claimed that members of the [[Christian countercult movement]] who criticize the Watch Tower Society, make selective use of information themselves. For example, [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] Richard Abanes wrote that their ban on blood transfusions, "has led to countless Witness deaths over the years, including many children."&lt;ref&gt;''Cults, New Religious Movements, and Your Family: A Guide to Ten Non-Christian Groups Out to Convert Your Loved Ones'' p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Cowan wrote: "When the careful reader checks [Abanes' footnote], however, looking perhaps for some statistical substantiation, he or she finds only a statistical conjecture based on 1980 Red Cross blood use figures."&lt;!--"the careful reader"? Do we have a less weaselly example??--&gt; Cowan also says Abanes omits "critical issues" in an attempt to "present the most negative face possible." Cowan wrote that "the reader is left with the impression that the Watchtower Society knowingly presides over a substantial number of preventable deaths each year."&lt;!--Does Cowan go on to say that is not actually the case? Otherwise, what is the point of including the statement?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bearing False Witness? An Introduction to the Christian Countercult'' p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdated medical beliefs===

Osamu Muramoto says the Watch Tower Society relies on discarded, centuries-old medical beliefs to support its assertion that blood transfusions are the same as eating blood.&lt;ref name="eatblood"&gt;''Reasoning From the Scriptures,'' Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1989, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1990 Watch Tower brochure on blood quoted a 17th-century anatomist to support its view.&lt;ref&gt;''How Can Blood Save Your Life?'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1990, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Muramoto says the view that blood is nourishment—still espoused in Watch Tower publications&lt;ref&gt;''Reasoning From the Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1989, page 70.&lt;/ref&gt;—was abandoned by modern medicine many decades ago.&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt; He has criticized an analogy commonly used by the Society&lt;ref&gt;The analogy is used in ''The Watchtower'', June 1, 1969, page 326, ''The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life'', (1981, pg 167), ''Reasoning From the Scriptures'' (1989, pg 73), ''You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth'' (1989, pg 216), ''Yearbook'' (1989, pg 57), ''What Does the Bible Teach'' (2005, pg 130) and ''Awake!'', August 2006, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; in which it states: "Consider a man who is told by the doctor that he must abstain from alcohol. Would he be obedient if he quit drinking alcohol but had it put directly into his veins?"&lt;ref name="eatblood" /&gt; Muramoto says the analogy is false, explaining: "Orally ingested alcohol is absorbed as alcohol and circulated as such in the blood, whereas orally eaten blood is digested and does not enter the circulation as blood. Blood introduced directly into the veins circulates and functions as blood, not as nutrition. Hence, blood transfusion is a form of cellular organ transplantation. And ... organ transplants are now permitted by the WTS."&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt; He says the objection to blood transfusions on the basis of biblical proscriptions against eating blood is similar to the refusal of a heart transplant on the basis that a doctor warned a patient to abstain from eating meat because of his high cholesterol level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377601 | pmid=9800583 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 2. A novel approach based on rational non-interventional paternalism | journal=J Med Ethics | page=299 | vauthors=Muramoto O | doi=10.1136/jme.24.5.295 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Malyon, chairman of the English Hospital Liaison Committee in [[Luton]], [[England]], has claimed that Muramoto's discussion of the differences between consuming blood and alcohol is pedantic and says blood laws in the Bible are based upon the reverence for life and its association with blood, and that laws should be kept in the spirit as much as in the letter.&lt;ref name="Malyon2"/&gt;

===Inconsistency===
{{See also|Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses#Blood}}

Muramoto has described as peculiar and inconsistent the Watch Tower policy of acceptance of all the individual components of blood plasma as long as they are not taken at the same time.&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt; He says the Society offers no biblical explanation for differentiating between prohibited treatments and those considered a "matter of conscience", explaining the distinction is based entirely on arbitrary decisions of the [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses|Governing Body]], to which Witnesses must adhere strictly on the premise of them being Bible-based "truth".&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt; He has questioned why white blood cells (1 per cent of blood volume) and platelets (0.17 per cent) are forbidden, yet albumin (2.2 per cent of blood volume) is permitted.&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt; He has questioned why donating blood and storing blood for autologous transfusion is deemed wrong, but the Watch Tower Society permits the use of blood components that must be donated and stored before Witnesses use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377601 | pmid=9800583 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 2. A novel approach based on rational non-interventional paternalism | journal=J Med Ethics | page=300 | vauthors=Muramoto O | doi=10.1136/jme.24.5.295 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has questioned why Witnesses, although viewing blood as sacred and symbolizing life, are prepared to let a person die by placing more importance on the symbol than the reality it symbolizes.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

Kerry Louderback-Wood alleges that by labeling the currently acceptable blood fractions as "minute" in relation to whole blood, the Watch Tower organization causes followers to misunderstand the scope and extent of allowed fractions.&lt;ref name="Kerry" /&gt;

Witnesses respond that the real issue is not of the fluid ''per se'', but of respect and obedience to God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' November 1, 1961 p. 669 Questions From Readers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''What Does The Bible Really Teach?'' 2005 P.128&lt;/ref&gt; They say their principle of abstaining from blood as a display of respect is demonstrated by the fact that members are allowed to eat [[meat]] that still contains some blood. As soon as blood is drained from an animal, the ''respect'' has been shown to God, and then a person can eat the meat even though it may contain a small amount of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|date=1 November 1961|page=669|title=Questions From Readers|quote=The important thing is that respect has been shown for the sanctity of blood, regard has been shown for the principle of the sacredness of life. What God's law requires is that the blood be drained from the animal when it is killed, not that the meat be soaked in some special preparation to draw out every trace of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses' view of meat and blood is different from that of kosher Jewish adherents, who go to great lengths to remove minor traces of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=122 |title=OK Kosher Certification — Salting of Meat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520171638/http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=122 |archive-date=2007-05-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/Kashrut/Overview_Kosher_Food/Kosher_Meat/Making_Meat_Kosher.htm My Jewish Learning: Making Meat Kosher&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225165156/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/Kashrut/Overview_Kosher_Food/Kosher_Meat/Making_Meat_Kosher.htm |date=2009-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lactational amenorrhea''' is the temporary [[postnatal]] infertility that occurs when a woman is [[Amenorrhea|amenorrheic]] (not menstruating) and fully [[breastfeeding]].

==Breastfeeding infertility==
For women who follow the suggestions and meet the criteria (listed below), LAM is &gt;98% effective during the first six months postpartum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.01.021 |pmid=21477680 |pmc=3638209 |title=Contraceptive failure in the United States |journal=Contraception |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=397–404 |year=2011 |last1=Trussell |first1=James }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trussell|first=James|date=November 2011|chapter=Contraceptive efficacy|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S. |title=Contraceptive technology|edition=20th revised|location=New York|publisher=Ardent Media|pages=779–863|isbn=978-1-59708-004-0|issn=0091-9721|oclc=781956734}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Breastfeeding must be the infant's only (or almost only) source of nutrition. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing,&lt;ref&gt;ReproLine ''The Reading Room''. [http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/6read/6multi/tgwg/Tgla__e.htm Lactational Amenorrhea Method], which cites:&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zinaman M, Hughes V, Queenan J, Labbok M, Albertson B |title=Acute prolactin and oxytocin responses and milk yield to infant suckling and artificial methods of expression in lactating women. |journal=Pediatrics |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=437–40 |year=1992 |pmid=1741218}}&lt;/ref&gt; and feeding solids all reduce the effectiveness of LAM.
* The infant must breastfeed at least every four hours during the day and at least every six hours at night.
* The infant must be less than six months old.
* The mother must not have had a period after 56 days post-partum (when determining fertility, bleeding prior to 56 days post-partum can be ignored).
* And to take full advantage of LAM, it is best that the baby's face not be covered when feeding. Routinely covering the baby reduces the baby's access to oxygen and visual contact with the mother, which trains the baby to speed up the suckling process and thus reduces the time period, rendering LAM less effective.

If not combined with barrier contraceptives, spermicides, hormonal contraceptives, or intrauterine devices, '''lactational amenorrhea method''' ('''LAM''') may be considered [[natural family planning]] by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].

== Physiology ==
Breastfeeding delays the resumption of normal ovarian cycles by disrupting the pattern of pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus and hence LH from the pituitary.&lt;ref name="McNeilly 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1994.tb30394.x |title=Physiological Mechanisms Underlying Lactational Amenorrhea |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=709 |pages=145–155 |year=1994 |last1=McNeilly |first1=Alan S. |last2=Tay |first2=Clem C. K. |last3=Glasier |first3=Anna }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plasma concentrations of FSH during lactation are sufficient to induce follicle growth, but the inadequate pulsatile LH signal results in a reduced estradiol production by these follicles.&lt;ref name="McNeilly 1994"/&gt; When follicle growth and estradiol secretion does increase to normal, the suckling stimulus prevents the generation of a normal preovulatory LH surge and follicles either fail to rupture, or become atretic or cystic. Only when the suckling stimulus declines sufficiently to allow generation of a normal preovulatory LH surge to occur will ovulation take place with the formation of a corpus luteum of variable normality. Thus suckling delays the resumption of normal ovarian cyclicity by disrupting but not totally inhibiting, the normal pattern of release of GnRH by the hypothalamus. The mechanism of suckling-induced disruption of GnRH release remains unknown.&lt;ref name="McNeilly 1994"/&gt; 

In women, hyperprolactinemia is often associated with amenorrhea, a condition that resembles the physiological situation during lactation (lactational amenorrhea). Mechanical detection of suckling increases prolactin levels in the body to increase milk synthesis. Excess prolactin may inhibit the menstrual cycle directly, by a suppressive effect on the ovary, or indirectly, by decreasing the release of GnRH.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

== Return of fertility ==
Return of menstruation following childbirth varies widely among individuals. A strong relationship has been observed between the amount of suckling and the contraceptive effect, such that the combination of feeding on demand rather than on a schedule and feeding only breast milk rather than supplementing the diet with other foods will greatly extend the period of effective contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10453245 |year=1999 |last1=Taylor |first1=H. W. |title=Continuously recorded suckling behaviour and its effect on lactational amenorrhoea |journal=Journal of Biosocial Science |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=289–310 |last2=Vázquez-Geffroy |first2=M. |last3=Samuels |first3=S. J. |last4=Taylor |first4=D. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The closer a woman's behavior is to the Seven Standards of ecological breastfeeding, the later (on average) her cycles will return. Average return of menses for women following all seven criteria is 14 months after childbirth, with some reports being as soon as 2 months while others are as late as 42 months.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Couples who desire [[Birth spacing|spacing]] of 18 to 30 months between children can often achieve this through breastfeeding alone,&lt;ref&gt;Kippley, S. K. (2008). The seven standards of ecological breastfeeding: The frequency factor. Stillwater, MN: Lulu.{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is not a foolproof method as return of menses is unpredictable and conception can occur in the weeks preceding the first menses.  

Although the first post-partum cycle is sometimes anovulatory (reducing the likelihood of becoming pregnant again before having a post-partum period), subsequent cycles are almost always ovulatory and therefore must be considered fertile. For women exclusive breastfeeding ovulation tends to return after their first menses after the 56 days postpartum time period. Supplementing nutritional intake can lead to an earlier return of menses and ovulation then exclusive breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/grf.0000000000000154 |pmid=26457855 |title=Postpartum Sexuality and the Lactational Amenorrhea Method for Contraception |journal=Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=915–927 |year=2015 |last1=Labbok |first1=Miriam H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing more frequently for a shorter amount of time was shown to be more successful in prolonging amenorrhea then nursing longer but less frequently. The continuing of breastfeeding, while introducing solids after 6 months, to 12 months were shown to have an efficiency rate of 92.6 – 96.3 percent in pregnancy prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0015-0282(99)00274-5 |title=The World Health Organization multinational study of breast-feeding and lactational amenorrhea.

The Seven Standards: Phase 1 of Ecological Breastfeeding

# Breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of life; don’t use other liquids and solids, not even water.
# Pacify or comfort your baby at your breasts.
# Don’t use bottles and don’t use pacifiers.
# Sleep with your baby for night feedings.
# Sleep with your baby for a daily-nap feeding.
# Nurse frequently day and night, and avoid schedules.
# Avoid any practice that restricts nursing or separates you from your baby.

Phase 1 is the time of exclusive breastfeeding and thus usually lasts six to eight months.&lt;ref&gt;Kippley, S. K. (2008). The seven standards of ecological breastfeeding: The frequency factor. Stillwater, MN: Lulu.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maternal death''' or '''maternal mortality''' is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of [[pregnancy]], irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes."&lt;ref name="WHO_definition_2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/indmaternalmortality/en/|title=Health statistics and information systems: Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births)|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancet_Khan_2006"/&gt;

There are two performance indicators that are sometimes used interchangeably: [[maternal mortality ratio]] and maternal mortality rate, which confusingly both are abbreviated "MMR".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pop.org/content/definitions-maternal-mortality Maternal Mortality Ratio vs Maternal Mortality Rate] on Population Research Institute website&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, the world maternal mortality rate had declined 44% since 1990, but still every day 830 women die from pregnancy or childbirth related causes.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/maternal-health|title=Maternal health|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) 2017 report, this is equivalent to "about one woman every two minutes and for every woman who dies, 20 or 30 encounter complications with serious or long-lasting consequences. Most of these deaths and injuries are entirely preventable."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;

UNFPA estimated that 303,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2015.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; These causes range from severe bleeding to obstructed labour,&lt;ref name="GDB2013" /&gt; all of which have highly effective interventions {{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}. As women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendance with backup emergency obstetric care, the global maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 385 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 216 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015, and many countries halved their maternal death rates in the last 10 years.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;

Although attempts have been made in reducing maternal mortality, there is much room for improvement, particularly in impoverished regions. Over 85% of maternal deaths are from impoverished communities in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; The effect of a mother's death results in vulnerable families. Their infants, if they survive childbirth, are more likely to die before reaching their second birthday.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;

==Definition==
According to a 2003 article in the  ''[[British Medical Bulletin]]'',&lt;ref name="OUP_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = AbouZahr C | title = Global burden of maternal death and disability | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | date = December 1, 2003 | pmid = 14711750 | doi = 10.1093/bmb/ldg015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; maternal death was first defined as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes " in the [[ICD-10|tenth revision]] of the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD-10) which was completed in 1992. It is the definition still in use by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which defines maternal mortality as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of [[pregnancy]], irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes."&lt;ref name="WHO_definition_2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maternal Mortality Estimates developed by WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 article "Global burden of maternal death and disability" noted that the definition leaves out a segment of the population. According to the Centers for Disease Control, during the period 1974-75 in Georgia, US, 29% of maternal deaths "occurred after 42 days of pregnancy termination and 6% occurred after 90 days post-partum."&lt;ref name="OUP_2003"/&gt; This may explain the CDC’s definition, extending the period of consideration “within 1 year of the end of pregnancy.” Adding to the WHO definition, the CDC also mentions that this death can be irrespective of the outcome of the pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Severe maternal morbidity (SMM)===
Severe maternal morbidity or SMM, is an unanticipated acute or chronic health outcome after labor and delivery that detrimentally affects a woman's health. Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) includes any unexpected outcomes from labor or delivery that cause both short and long-term consequences to the mother’s overall health.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/severematernalmorbidity.html|title=Severe Maternal Morbidity in the United States|last=|first=|date=2017-11-27|website=CDC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are nineteen total indicators used by the CDC to help identify SMM, with the most prevalent indicator being a blood transfusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/severematernalmorbidity.html|title=Severe Maternal Morbidity in the United States {{!}} Pregnancy {{!}} Reproductive Health {{!}}CDC|date=2017-11-27|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other indicators include an acute myocardial infarction ("heart attack"), aneurysm, and kidney failure. All of this identification is done by using ICD-10 codes, which are disease identification codes found in hospital discharge data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/smm/severe-morbidity-ICD.htm|title=Severe Maternal Morbidity Indicators and Corresponding ICD Codes during Delivery Hospitalizations|date=2018-08-21|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using these definitions that rely on these codes should be used with careful consideration since some may miss some cases, have a low predictive value, or may be difficult for different facilities to operationalize.&lt;ref name="ACOG_SMFM_2016" /&gt; There are certain screening criteria that may be helpful and are recommended through the American ''College'' of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as well as the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM). These screening criteria for SMM are for transfusions of four or more units of blood and admission of a pregnant woman or a postpartum woman to an ICU facility or unit.&lt;ref name="ACOG_SMFM_2016" /&gt;

The greatest proportion of women with SMM are those who require a blood transfusion during delivery, mostly due to excessive bleeding. Blood transfusions given during delivery due to excessive bleeding has increased the rate of mothers with SMM.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The rate of SMM has increased almost 200% between 1993 (49.5 per 100,000 live births) and 2014 (144.0 per 100,000 live births). This can be seen with the increased rate of blood transfusions given during delivery, which increased from 1993 (24.5 per 100,000 live births) to 2014 (122.3 per 100,000 live births).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the United States, severe maternal morbidity has increased over the last several years, impacting greater than 50,000 women in 2014 alone. There is no conclusive reason for this dramatic increase. It is thought that the overall state of health for pregnant women is impacting these rates. For example, complications can derive from underlying chronic medical conditions like diabetes, obesity, HIV/AIDs, and high blood pressure. These underlying conditions are also thought to lead to increased risk of maternal mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell KH, Savitz D, Werner EF, Pettker CM, Goffman D, Chazotte C, Lipkind HS | title = Maternal morbidity and risk of death at delivery hospitalization | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 122 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–33 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23921870 | doi = 10.1097/aog.0b013e3182a06f4e }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased rate for SMM can also be indicative of potentially increased rates for maternal mortality, since without identification and treatment of SMM, these conditions would lead to increased maternal death rates. Therefore, diagnosis of SMM can be considered a “near miss” for maternal mortality.&lt;ref name="ACOG_SMFM_2016" /&gt; With this consideration, several different expert groups have urged obstetric hospitals to review SMM cases for opportunities that can lead to improved care, which in turn would lead to improvements with maternal health and a decrease in the number of maternal deaths.

==Causes==
Factors that increase maternal death can be direct or indirect. In a 2009 article on maternal morbidity, the authors said, that generally, there is a distinction between a direct maternal death that is the result of a complication of the [[pregnancy]], delivery, or management of the two, and an indirect maternal death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khlat M, Ronsmans C | title = Deaths attributable to childbearing in Matlab, Bangladesh: indirect causes of maternal mortality questioned | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 151 | issue = 3 | pages = 300–6 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10670555 | url = http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/151/3/300.full.pdf+html }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is a pregnancy-related death in a patient with a preexisting or newly developed health problem unrelated to pregnancy. Fatalities during but unrelated to a pregnancy are termed ''accidental'', ''incidental'', or nonobstetrical maternal deaths.

According to a study published in the ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' which covered the period from 1990 to 2013, the most common causes are [[postpartum bleeding]] (15%), complications from unsafe [[abortion]] (15%), [[hypertensive disorders of pregnancy]] (10%), [[postpartum infections]] (8%), and [[obstructed labour]] (6%).&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 | journal = Lancet | volume = 385 | issue = 9963 | pages = 117–71 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25530442 | pmc = 4340604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes include [[embolism|blood clots]] (3%) and pre-existing conditions (28%).&lt;ref name="WHO Fact Sheet 2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal mortality: Fact sheet N°348|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|access-date=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maternal mortality caused by severe bleeding and infections are mostly after childbirth. Indirect causes are [[malaria]], [[anemia|anaemia]],&lt;ref&gt;The most common causes of anemia/anaemia are poor nutrition, iron, and other micronutrient deficiencies, which are in addition to malaria, hookworm, and schistosomiasis (2005 WHO report p45).&lt;/ref&gt; [[HIV/AIDS]], and [[cardiovascular disease]], all of which may complicate pregnancy or be aggravated by it {{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}. Risk factors associated with increased maternal death include the age of the mother, obesity before becoming pregnant, other pre-existing chronic medical conditions, and cesarean delivery.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Molina RL, Pace LE | title = A Renewed Focus on Maternal Health in the United States | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 377 | issue = 18 | pages = 1705–1707 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29091560 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1709473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACOG_SMFM_2016" /&gt;

Pregnancy-related deaths between 2011 and 2014 in the United States have been shown to have major contributions from non-communicable diseases and conditions, and the following are some of the more common causes related to maternal death&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;: cardiovascular diseases (15.2%.), non-cardiovascular diseases (14.7%), infection or sepsis (12.8%), hemorrhage (11.5%), cardiomyopathy (10.3%), thrombotic pulmonary embolism (9.1%), cerebrovascular accidents (7.4%), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (6.8%), amniotic fluid embolism (5.5%), and anesthesia complications (0.3%).

According to a 2004 [[WHO]] publication, sociodemographic factors such as age, access to resources and income level are significant indicators of maternal outcomes. Young mothers face higher risks of complications and death during pregnancy than older mothers,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|title=Maternal mortality|publisher=World Health Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially adolescents aged 15 years or younger.&lt;ref name="Conde-Agudelo A 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conde-Agudelo A, Belizán JM, Lammers C | title = Maternal-perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with adolescent pregnancy in Latin America: Cross-sectional study | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 192 | issue = 2 | pages = 342–9 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15695970 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2004.10.593 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents have higher risks for postpartum hemorrhage, puerperal endometritis, operative vaginal delivery, episiotomy, low [[birth weight]], [[preterm delivery]], and small-for-gestational-age infants, all of which can lead to maternal death.&lt;ref name="Conde-Agudelo A 2004" /&gt; The leading cause of death for girls at the age of 15 in developing countries is complication through pregnancy and childbirth. They have more pregnancies, on average, than women in developed countries and it has been shown that 1 in 180 fifteen year old girls in developing countries who become pregnant will die due to complications during pregnancy or childbirth. This is compared to women in developed countries, where the likelihood is 1 in 4900 live births.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, in the United States, as many women of older age continue to have children, trends have seen the maternal mortality rate to rise in some states, especially among women over 40 years old.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Structural support and family support influences maternal outcomes {{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}. Furthermore, social disadvantage and social isolation adversely affects maternal health which can lead to increases in maternal death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morgan KJ, Eastwood JG | title = Social determinants of maternal self-rated health in South Western Sydney, Australia | journal = BMC Research Notes | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 51 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24447371 | pmc = 3899616 | doi = 10.1186/1756-0500-7-51 | lastauthoramp = y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, lack of access to [[birth attendant|skilled medical care during childbirth]], the travel distance to the nearest clinic to receive proper care,  number of prior births, barriers to accessing prenatal medical care and poor infrastructure all increase maternal deaths.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Unsafe [[abortion]] is another major cause of maternal death. According to the World Health Organization in 2009, every eight minutes a woman died from complications arising from unsafe abortions. Complications include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis and genital trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haddad LB, Nour NM | title = Unsafe abortion: unnecessary maternal mortality | journal = Reviews in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 122–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19609407 | pmc = 2709326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, globally, preventable deaths from improperly performed procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality, and 25% or more in some countries where maternal mortality from other causes is relatively low, making unsafe abortion the leading single cause of maternal mortality worldwide.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dixon-Mueller R, Germain A | title = Fertility regulation and reproductive health in the Millennium Development Goals: the search for a perfect indicator | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–51 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 16571693 | pmc = 1716248 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2005.068056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unsafe Abortion ==
Abortions are more common in developed regions than developing regions of the world. It is estimated that 26% of all pregnancies that occur in the world are terminated by induced abortions. Out of these, 41% occur in developed regions and 23% of them occur in developing regions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Unsafe abortion practices are defined by the WHO as procedures that are “carried out by persons either lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization,Unsafe Abortion: Global and Regional Estimates of the Incidence of Unsafe Abortion and Associated Mortality in 2000, 4th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this definition, the WHO estimates that out of the 45 million abortions that are performed each year globally, 19 million of these are considered unsafe. Also, 97% of these unsafe abortions occur in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Souto SL, Ferreira JD, Ramalho NM, de Lima CL, Ferreira TM, Maciel GM, de Lima SA, do Nascimento Oliveira DM, dos Santos JC, Braga LS, de Lima LF| display-authors = 6 |date=2017-07-04|title=Nursing Care For Women In Situation Of Unsafe Abortion |journal= International Archives of Medicine |volume=10|doi=10.3823/2484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal deaths caused by improperly performed procedures are preventable and contribute 13% to the maternal mortality rate worldwide. This number is increased to 25% in countries where other causes of maternal mortality are low, such as in Eastern European and South American countries. This makes unsafe abortion practices the leading cause of maternal death worldwide.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Risks for Unsafe Abortion ===
Social factors impact a woman’s decision to seek abortion services, and these can include fear of abandonment from the partner, family rejection and lack of employment. Social factors such as these can lead to the consequence of undergoing an abortion that is considered unsafe.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Measuring Rates for Unsafe Abortion ===
One proposal for measuring trends and variations in risks to maternal death associated with maternal death is to measure the percentage of induced abortions that are defined unsafe (by the WHO) and by the ratio of deaths per 100,000 procedures, which would be defined as the abortion mortality ratio.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

There are four primary types of data sources that are used to collect abortion-related maternal mortality rates. These four sources are confidential enquiries, registration data, verbal autopsy, and facility-based data sources. A verbal autopsy is a systematic tool that is used to collect information on the cause of death from lay-people and not medical professionals.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerdts C, Tunçalp O, Johnston H, Ganatra B | title = Measuring abortion-related mortality: challenges and opportunities | language = En | journal = Reproductive Health | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 87 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26377189 | pmc = 4572614 | doi = 10.1186/s12978-015-0064-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confidential enquires for maternal deaths do not occur very often on a national level in most countries. Registration systems are usually considered the “gold-standard” method for mortality measurements. However, they have been shown to miss anywhere between 30-50% of all maternal deaths.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Another concern for registration systems is that 75% of all global births occur in countries where vital registration systems do not exist, meaning that many maternal deaths occurring during these pregnancies and deliveries may not be properly record through these methods. There are also issues with using verbal autopsies and other forms of survey in recording maternal death rates. For example, the family’s willingness to participate after the loss of a loved one, misclassification of the cause of death, and under-reporting all present obstacles to the proper reporting of maternal mortality causes. Finally, an potential issue with facility-based data collection on maternal mortality is the likelihood that women who experience abortion-related complications to seek care in medical facilities. This is due to fear of social repercussions or legal activity in countries where unsafe abortion is common since it is more likely to be legally restrictive and/or more highly stigmatizing.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Another concern for issues related to errors in proper reporting for accurate understanding of maternal mortality is the fact that global estimates of maternal deaths related to a specific cause present those related to abortion as a proportion of the total mortality rate. Therefore, any change, whether positive or negative, in the abortion-related mortality rate is only compared relative to other causes, and this does not allow for proper implications of whether abortions are becoming more safe or less safe with respect to the overall mortality of women.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Prevention for Unsafe Abortion ===
Providing safe services for pregnant women within family planning facilities is applicable to all regions. This is an important fact to consider since abortion is legal in some way in 189 out of 193 countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Promoting effective contraceptive use and information distributed to a wider population, with access to high-quality care, can significantly make strides towards reducing the number of unsafe abortions. However, this alone will not eliminate the demand for safe services.&lt;ref name="pmid11020931"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bongaarts J, Westoff CF | title = The potential role of contraception in reducing abortion | journal = Studies in Family Planning | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 193–202 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11020931 | doi = 10.1111/j.1728-4465.2000.00193.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==

The four measures of maternal death are the [[maternal mortality ratio]] (MMR), maternal mortality rate, lifetime risk of maternal death and proportion of maternal deaths among deaths of women of reproductive years (PM).

Maternal mortality ratio (MMR): the ratio of the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time-period.&lt;ref name="maternalmortalitydata.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maternalmortalitydata.org/Definitions.html|title=MME Info|publisher=maternalmortalitydata.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014105625/http://maternalmortalitydata.org/Definitions.html|archive-date=October 14, 2013|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MMR is used as a measure of the quality of a health care system.

Maternal mortality rate (MMRate): the number of maternal deaths in a population divided by the number of women of reproductive age, usually expressed per 1,000 women.&lt;ref name="maternalmortalitydata.org" /&gt;
 
Lifetime risk of maternal death: refers to the probability that a 15-year-old female will die eventually from a maternal cause if she experiences throughout her lifetime the risks of maternal death and the overall levels of fertility and mortality that are observed for a given population. The adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality can be derived using either the maternal mortality ratio (MMR), or the maternal mortality rate (MMRate). 
&lt;ref name="maternalmortalitydata.org" /&gt;

Proportion of maternal deaths among deaths of women of reproductive age (PM):
the number of maternal deaths in a given time period divided by the total deaths among 
women aged 15–49 years.&lt;ref name="UNICEF, W. 2012"/&gt;

Approaches to measuring maternal mortality includes civil registration system, household surveys, [[census]], reproductive age mortality studies (RAMOS) and verbal autopsies.&lt;ref name="UNICEF, W. 2012"&gt;[UNICEF, W. (2012). UNFPA, World Bank (2012) [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44874/1/9789241503631_eng.pdf Trends in maternal mortality: 1990 to 2010]. WHO, UNICEF.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trends===
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA; formerly known as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities) have established programs that support efforts in reducing maternal death. These efforts include education and training for midwives, supporting access to emergency services in obstetric and newborn care networks, and providing essential drugs and family planning services to pregnant women or those planning to become pregnant.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt; They also support efforts for review and response systems regarding maternal deaths.

According to the 2010 [[United Nations Population Fund]] report, developing nations account for ninety-nine percent of maternal deaths with the majority of those deaths occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia.&lt;ref name="UNICEF, W. 2012" /&gt; 
Globally, high and middle income countries experience lower maternal deaths than low income countries. The [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) accounts for between 82 and 85 percent of the maternal mortality rates among countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee KS, Park SC, Khoshnood B, Hsieh HL, Mittendorf R | title = Human development index as a predictor of infant and maternal mortality rates | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 131 | issue = 3 | pages = 430–3 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9329421 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3476(97)80070-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, high rates of maternal deaths occur in the same countries that have high rates of [[infant mortality]]. These trends are a reflection that higher income countries have stronger healthcare infrastructure, medical and healthcare personnel, use more advanced medical technologies and have fewer barriers to accessing care than low income countries. Therefore, in low income countries, the most common cause of maternal death is [[obstetrical hemorrhage]], followed by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, in contrast to high income countries, for which the most common cause is [[Thrombosis|thromboembolism]].&lt;ref name="uppsala"&gt;Venös tromboembolism (VTE) - Guidelines for treatment in C counties. Bengt Wahlström, Emergency department, Uppsala Academic Hospital. January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio has decreased from 385 deaths per 100,000 live births to 216 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt; Some factors that have attributed to the decreased maternal deaths seen between this period are in part to the access that women have gained to family planning services and skilled birth attendance, meaning a midwife, doctor, or trained nurse), with back-up obstetric care for emergency situations that may occur during the process of labor.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt; This can be examined further by looking at statistics in some areas of the world where inequities in women’s access to health care services reflect an increased number of maternal deaths. The high maternal death rates also reflect access to health services between the poor communities compared to women who are rich.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

At a country level, [[India]] (19% or 56,000) and [[Nigeria]] (14% or 40,000) accounted for roughly one third of the maternal deaths in 2010 {{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}. [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sudan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[United Republic of Tanzania]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Afghanistan]] accounted for between 3 and 5 percent of maternal deaths each.&lt;ref name="UNICEF, W. 2012"/&gt; These ten countries combined accounted for 60% of all the maternal deaths in 2010 according to the United Nations Population Fund report. Countries with the lowest maternal deaths were [[Health care in Greece|Greece]], [[Healthcare in Iceland|Iceland]], [[Healthcare in Poland|Poland]], and [[Healthcare in Finland|Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html|title=Comparison: Maternal Mortality Rate|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of progress has been made since the United Nations made the reduction of maternal mortality part of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) in 2000.&lt;ref name="Lancet_Khan_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan KS, Wojdyla D, Say L, Gülmezoglu AM, Van Look PF | title = WHO analysis of causes of maternal death: a systematic review | journal = Lancet | volume = 367 | issue = 9516 | pages = 1066–1074 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16581405 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06) | url = http://www.hpc4.go.th/director/data/region/WHO_MMR.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1066}} Bangladesh, for example, cut the number of deaths per live births by almost two thirds from 1990 to 2015. However, the MDG was to reduce it by 75%. According to government data, the figure for 2015 was 181 maternal deaths per 100,000 births. The MDG mark was 143 per 100,000.&lt;ref name=D+C&gt;{{cite news |title=Why paramedics and midwives matter|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/gk-non-governmental-health-service-provider-bangladesh-knows-how-reduce-maternal-mortality|author=Manzur Kadir Ahmed|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=3 September 2017 |access-date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further reduction of maternal mortality is now part of the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development. The United Nations has more recently developed a list of goals termed the Sustainable Development Goals. The target of the third [[Sustainable Development Goal]] (SDG) is to reduce the global maternal mortality rate (MMR) to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/|title=Health - United Nations Sustainable Development|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the specific aims of the Sustainable Development Goals are to prevent unintended pregnancies by ensuring more women have access to contraceptives, as well as providing women who become pregnant with a safe environment for delivery with respectful and skilled care during delivery. This also includes providing women with complications during delivery timely access to emergency services through obstetric care.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

The WHO has also developed a global strategy and goal to end preventable death related to maternal mortality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A major goal of this strategy is to identify and address the causes of maternal and reproductive morbidities and mortalities, as well as disabilities related to maternal health outcomes. The collaborations that this strategy introduces are to address the inequalities that are shown with access to reproductive, maternal, and newborn services, as well as the quality of that care. They also ensure that universal health coverage is essential for comprehensive health care services related to maternal and newborn health. The WHO strategy also implements strengthening health care systems to ensure quality data collection to better respond to the needs of women and girls, as well as ensuring responsibility and accountability to improve the equity and quality of care provided to women.

==== Variation within countries====
There are significant maternal mortality intracountry variations, especially in nations with large equality gaps in income and education and high healthcare disparities. Women living in rural areas experience higher maternal mortality than women living in urban and sub-urban centers because&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|title=WHO Maternal Health|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; those living in wealthier households, having higher education, or living in urban areas, have higher use of healthcare services than their poorer, less-educated, or rural counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Wang W, Alva S, Wang S, Fort A|title=Levels and trends in the use of maternal health services in developing countries|location=Calverton, MD|publisher=ICF Macro|year=2011|p=85|id=(DHS Comparative Reports 26)|url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/CR26/CR26.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also racial and ethnic [[Social inequality|disparities]] in maternal health outcomes which increases maternal mortality in marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu MC, Halfon N | title = Racial and ethnic disparities in birth outcomes: a life-course perspective | journal = Maternal and Child Health Journal | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–30 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12710797 | doi = 10.1023/A:1022537516969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maternal mortality in the United States====
{{main|Maternal mortality in the United States}}
The US has the "highest rate of maternal mortality in the industrialized world."&lt;ref name="ProPublica_Ellison_2017"/&gt; In the [[United States]], the [[Maternal mortality in the United States|maternal death rate]] averaged 9.1 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births during the years 1979&amp;ndash;1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Atrash HK, Koonin LM, Lawson HW, Franks AL, Smith JC | title = Maternal mortality in the United States, 1979-1986 | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 76 | issue = 6 | pages = 1055–60 | date = December 1990 | pmid = 2234713 | url = http://ukpmc.ac.uk/abstract/MED/2234713 | publisher = Centers for Disease Control }}&lt;/ref&gt; but then rose rapidly to 14 per 100,000 in 2000 and 17.8 per 100,000 in 2009.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/MaternalInfantHealth/PMSS.html|title=Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System - Pregnancy - Reproductive Health|publisher=CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the rate was 18.5 deaths per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/maternal-deaths-in-childbirth-rise-in-the-us/2014/05/02/abf7df96-d229-11e3-9e25-188ebe1fa93b_story.html|title=Maternal deaths in childbirth rise in the U.S.|work=Washington Post|date= May 2, 2014|first=Carol|last=Morello}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the rise in maternal death in the United States may be due to improved identification and misclassification resulting in false positives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cdcgrandrounds/pdf/archives/2017/November2017.pdf|title=CDC Public Health Grand Rounds|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate has steadily increased to 18.0 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2014.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Between 2011 and 2014, there were 7,208 deaths that were reported to the CDC that occurred for women within a year of the end of their pregnancy. Out of this there were 2,726 that were found to be pregnancy-related deaths.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Since 2016, [[ProPublica]] and [[NPR]] investigated factors that led to the increase in maternal mortality in the United States. They reported that the "rate of life-threatening complications for new mothers in the U.S. has more than doubled in two decades due to pre-existing conditions, medical errors and unequal access to care."&lt;ref name="ProPublica_Ellison_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/severe-complications-for-women-during-childbirth-are-skyrocketing-and-could-often-be-prevented |title=Severe Complications for Women During Childbirth Are Skyrocketing — and Could Often Be Prevented |series=Lost mothers |date=December 22, 2017 |access-date=December 22, 2017 |publisher=[[ProPublica]] |first1=Katherine |last1=Ellison |first2=Nina |last2=Martin | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, c. 4 million women who give birth in the US annually, over 50,000 a year, experience "dangerous and even life-threatening complications."&lt;ref name="ProPublica_Ellison_2017"/&gt;

According to a report by the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], in 1993 the rate of Severe Maternal Morbidity, rose from 49.5 to 144 "per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations" in 2014, an increase of almost 200 percent. Blood transfusions also increased during the same period with "from 24.5 in 1993 to 122.3 in 2014 and are considered to be the major driver of the increase in SMM. After excluding blood transfusions, the rate of SMM increased by about 20% over time, from 28.6 in 1993 to 35.0 in 2014."&lt;ref name="CDC_SMM_2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Severe Maternal Morbidity in the United States|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/severematernalmorbidity.html|agency=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|date=November 27, 2017 |access-date=December 21, 2017  |location=Atlanta, Georgia }} Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt;

The past 60 years have consistently shown considerable racial disparities in pregnancy-related deaths. Between 2011 and 2014, the mortality ratio for different racial populations based on pregnancy-related deaths were as follows: 12.4 deaths per 100,000 live births for white women, 40,0 for black women, and 17.8 for women of other races.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mhtf.org/topics/maternal-health-in-the-united-states/|title=Maternal Health in the United States|last=|first=|date=2015-08-14|website=Maternal Health Task Force |access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that black women have between three and four times greater chance of dying from pregnancy-related issues. It has also been shown that one of the major contributors to maternal health disparities within the United States is the growing rate of non-communicable diseases.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

It is unclear why pregnancy-related deaths in the United States have increased. It seems that the use of computerized data servers by the states and changes in the way deaths are coded, with a pregnancy checkbox added to death certificates in many states, have been shown to improve the identification of these pregnancy-related deaths. However, this does not contribute to decreasing the actual number of deaths. Also, errors in reporting of pregnancy status have been seen, which most likely leads to overestimation of the number of pregnancy-related deaths.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Again, this does not contribute to explaining why the death rate has increased, but does show complications between reporting and actual contributions to the overall rate of maternal mortality.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Even though 99% of births in the United States are attended by some form of skilled health professional, the maternal mortality ratio in 215 was 14 deaths per 100,000 live births&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt; and it has been shown that the maternal mortality rate has been increasing. Also, the United States is not as efficient at preventing pregnancy-related deaths when compared to most of the other developed nations.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The United States took part in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set forth from the United Nations. The MDGs ended in 2015 but were followed-up in the form of the Sustainable Development Goals starting in 2016. The MDGs had several tasks, one of which was to improve maternal mortality rates globally. Despite their participation in this program as well as spending more than any other country on hospital-based maternal care, however, the United States has still seen increased rates of maternal mortality. This increased maternal mortality rate was especially pronounced in relation to other countries who participated in the program, where during the same period, the global maternal mortality rate decreased by 44%.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Also, the United States is not currently on track to meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of decreasing maternal mortality by 10% by the year 2020, and continues to fail in meeting national goals in maternal death reduction.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Only 23 states have some form of policy that establishes review boards specific to maternal mortality as of the year 2010.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In an effort to respond to the maternal mortality rate in the United States, the CDC requests that the 52 reporting regions (all states and New York City and Washington DC) to send death certificates for all those women who have died and may fit their definition of a pregnancy-related death, as well as copies of the matching birth or death records for the infant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, this request is voluntary and some states may not have the ability to abide by this effort.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided additional access to maternity care by expanding opportunities to obtain health insurance for the uninsured and mandating that certain health benefits have coverage. It also expanded the coverage for women who have private insurance. This expansion allowed them better access to primary and preventative health care services, including for screening and management of chronic diseases. An additional benefit for family planning services was the requirement that most insurance plans cover contraception without cost sharing. However, more employers are able to claim exemptions for religious or moral reasons under the current administration. Also under the current administration, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has decreased funding for pregnancy prevention programs for adolescent girls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Those women covered under Medicaid are covered when they receive prenatal care, care received during childbirth, and postpartum care. These services are provided to nearly half of the women who give birth in the United States. Currently, Medicaid is required to provide coverage for women whose incomes are at 133% of the federal poverty level in the United States.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Prevention==
The death rate for women giving birth plummeted in the twentieth century. The historical level of maternal deaths is probably around 1 in 100 births.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, mortality rates at the Dublin Maternity Hospital [[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Yearly patient mortality rates at the Dublin Maternity Hospital 1784-1849|1784–1849]].&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates reached very high levels in maternity institutions in the 1800s, sometimes climbing to 40 percent of patients (see [[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever]]). At the beginning of the 1900s, maternal death rates were around 1 in 100 for [[live birth (human)|live birth]]s. Currently, there are an estimated 275,000 maternal deaths each year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Public health, technological and policy approaches are steps that can be taken to drastically reduce the global maternal death burden. For developing regions, where it has been shown that maternal mortality is greater than in developed nations, antenatal care has increased from 65% in 1990 to 83% in 2012.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

It was estimated that in 2015, a total of 303,000 women died due to causes related to pregnancy or childbirth.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt; The majority of these causes were either severe bleeding, sepsis, eclampsia, labor that had some type of obstruction, and consequences from unsafe abortions. All of these causes are either preventable or have highly effective interventions.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt; Another factor that contributes to the maternal mortality rate that have opportunities for prevention are access to prenatal care for women who are pregnant. Women who do not receive prenatal care are between three and four times more likely to die from complications resulting from pregnancy or delivery than those who receive prenatal care. For women in the United States, 25% do not receive the recommended number of prenatal visits, and this number increases for women among specific demographic populations: 32% for African American women and 41% for American Indian and Alaska Native women.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Four elements are essential to maternal death prevention, according to [[UNFPA]].&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt; First, [[prenatal care]]. It is recommended that expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and [[fetus]]. Second, skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors, nurses and [[midwives]] who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications. Third, emergency [[obstetric]] care to address the major causes of maternal death which are [[hemorrhage]], [[sepsis]], unsafe abortion, [[hypertensive]] disorders and [[obstructed labour]]. Lastly, postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery. During this time, bleeding, sepsis and [[hypertensive]] disorders can occur, and newborns are extremely vulnerable in the immediate aftermath of birth. Therefore, follow-up visits by a health worker to assess the health of both mother and child in the postnatal period is strongly recommended.

Women who have unwanted pregnancies who have access to reliable information as well as compassionate counseling and quality services for the management of any issues that arise from abortions (whether safe or unsafe) can be beneficial in reducing the number of maternal deaths.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Also, in regions where abortion is not against the law, then abortion practices need to be safe in order to effectively reduce the number of maternal deaths related to abortion.

Maternal Death Surveillance and Response is another strategy that has been used to prevent maternal death. This is one of the interventions proposed to reduce maternal  mortality where maternal deaths are continuously reviewed to learn the causes and factors that led to the death. The information from the reviews is used to make recommendations for action to prevent future similar deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/maternal_death_surveillance/en/|title=Maternal death surveillance and response: technical guidance. Information for action to prevent maternal death|last1=World Health Organization and partner organizations|date=2013|publisher=WHO press|isbn=978 92 4 150608 3|location=World Health Organization, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland|page=128|access-date=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maternal and perinatal death reviews have been in practice for a long time worldwide, and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) introduced the Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) with a guideline in 2013. Studies have shown that acting on recommendations from MPDSR can reduce maternal and perinatal mortality by improving quality of care in the community and health facilities.

===Medical technologies===
The decline in maternal deaths has been due largely to improved [[asepsis]], fluid management and [[blood transfusion]], and better [[prenatal care]].

Technologies have been designed for resource poor settings that have been effective in reducing maternal deaths as well. The [[non-pneumatic anti-shock garment]] is a low-technology pressure device that decreases blood loss, restores vital signs and helps buy time in delay of women receiving adequate emergency care during [[obstetric hemorrhage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller S, Turan JM, Dau K, Fathalla M, Mourad M, Sutherland T, Hamza S, Lester F, Gibson EB, Gipson R, Nada K, Hensleigh P | display-authors = 6  | title = Use of the non-pneumatic anti-shock garment (NASG) to reduce blood loss and time to recovery from shock for women with obstetric haemorrhage in Egypt | journal = Global Public Health | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 110–24 | year = 2007 | pmid = 19280394 | doi = 10.1080/17441690601012536 }} (NASG)&lt;/ref&gt; It has proven to be a valuable resource. [[Condoms]] used as uterine tamponades have also been effective in stopping post-partum hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akhter S, Begum MR, Kabir Z, Rashid M, Laila TR, Zabeen F | title = Use of a condom to control massive postpartum hemorrhage | journal = MedGenMed | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 38 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14600674 | url = http://mnhtech.org/uploads/Use%20of%20a%20Condom%20to%20Control%20Massive%20Postpartum%20Hemorrhage.pdf  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public health===
[[File:Maternal health (4798750001).jpg|thumb|On 27 April 2010 Sierra Leone launched free healthcare for pregnant and breastfeeding women]]
A public health approach to addressing maternal mortality includes gathering information on the scope of the problem, identifying key causes, and implementing interventions, both prior to pregnancy and during pregnancy, to combat those causes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rai SK, Anand K, Misra P, Kant S, Upadhyay RP | title = Public health approach to address maternal mortality | journal = Indian Journal of Public Health | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 196–203 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23229211 | doi = 10.4103/0019-557x.104231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public health has a role to play in the analysis of maternal death. One important aspect in the review of maternal death and its causes are Maternal Mortality Review Committees or Boards. The goal of these review committees are to analyze each maternal death and determine its cause. After this analysis, the information can be combined in order to determine specific interventions that could lead to preventing future maternal deaths. These review boards are generally comprehensive in their analysis of maternal deaths, examining details that include mental health factors, public transportation, chronic illnesses, and substance use disorders. All of this information can be combined to give a detailed picture of what is causing maternal mortality and help to determine recommendations to reduce their impact. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reviewtoaction.org/Report_from_Nine_MMRCs|title=Review to Action|website=reviewtoaction.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states within the US are taking Maternal Mortality Review Committees a step further and are collaborating with various professional organizations to improve quality of perinatal care. These teams of organizations form a "perinatal quality collaborative," or PQC, and include state health departments, the state hospital association and clinical professionals such as doctors and nurses. These PQCs can also involve community health organizations, Medicaid representatives, Maternal Mortality Review Committees and patient advocacy groups. By involving all of these major players within maternal health, the goal is to collaborate and determine opportunities to improve quality of care. Through this collaborative effort, PQCs can aim to make impacts on quality both at the direct patient care level and through larger system devices like policy. It is thought that the institution of PQCs in California was the main contributor to the maternal mortality rate decreasing by 50% in the years following. The PQC developed review guides and quality improvement initiatives aimed at the most preventable and prevalent maternal deaths: those due to bleeding and high blood pressure. Success has also been observed with PQCs in Illinois and Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Main EK | title = Reducing Maternal Mortality and Severe Maternal Morbidity Through State-based Quality Improvement Initiatives | journal = Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 319–331 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29505420 | doi = 10.1097/grf.0000000000000361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several interventions prior to pregnancy have been recommended in efforts to reduce maternal mortality. Increasing access to reproductive healthcare services, such as family planning services and safe abortion practices, is recommended in order to prevent unintended pregnancies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several countries, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, have seen some success in efforts to promote the use of reproductive healthcare services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = GBD 2015 Maternal Mortality Collaborators | title = Global, regional, and national levels of maternal mortality, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 | journal = Lancet | volume = 388 | issue = 10053 | pages = 1775–1812 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27733286 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31470-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other interventions include high quality sex education, which includes pregnancy prevention and sexually-transmitted infection (STI) prevention and treatment. By addressing STIs, this not only reduces perinatal infections, but can also help reduce ectopic pregnancy caused by STIs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Berg C, Danel I, Atrash H, Zane S, Bartlett L | title = Strategies to reduce pregnancy-related deaths: from identification and review to action. | location = Atlanta | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents are between two and five times more likely to suffer from maternal mortality than a female twenty years or older. Access to reproductive services and sex education could make a large impact, specifically on adolescents, who are generally uneducated in regards to carrying a healthy pregnancy. Education level is a strong predictor of maternal health as it gives women the knowledge to seek care when it is needed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Public health efforts can also intervene during pregnancy to improve maternal outcomes. Areas for intervention have been identified in access to care, public knowledge about signs and symptoms of pregnancy complications, and improving relationships between healthcare professionals and expecting mothers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Access to care during pregnancy is a significant issue in the face of maternal mortality. "Access" encompasses a wide range of potential difficulties including costs, location of healthcare services, availability of appointments, transportation services, and cultural or language barriers that could inhibit a woman from receiving proper care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For women carrying a pregnancy to term, access to necessary antenatal (prior to delivery) healthcare visits is crucial to ensuring healthy outcomes. These antenatal visits allow for early recognition and treatment of complications, treatment of infections and the opportunity to educate the expecting mother on how to manage her current pregnancy and the health advantages of spacing pregnancies apart. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Access to birth at a facility with a skilled healthcare provider present has been associated with safer deliveries and better outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The two areas bearing the largest burden of maternal mortality, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, also had the lowest percentage of births attended by a skilled provider, at just 45% and 41% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The State of the World's Children 2009: Maternal and newborn health. | publisher = United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) | date = December 2008 | url = http://www.unicef.org/sowc09/docs/SOWC09-FullReport-EN.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency obstetric care is also crucial in preventing maternal mortality by offering services like emergency cesarean sections, blood transfusions, antibiotics for infections and assisted vaginal delivery with forceps or vacuum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to physical barriers that restrict access to healthcare, financial barriers also exist. Close to one out of seven women of child-bearing age have no health insurance. This lack of insurance impacts access to pregnancy prevention, treatment of complications, as well as perinatal care visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu MC | title = Reducing Maternal Mortality in the United States | journal = Jama | volume = 320 | issue = 12 | pages = 1237–1238 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30208484 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2018.11652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

By increasing public knowledge about pregnancy, including signs of complications that need addressed by a healthcare provider, this will increase the likelihood of an expecting mother to seek help when it is necessary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Higher levels of education have been associated with increased use of contraception and family planning services as well as antenatal care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weitzman A | title = The effects of women's education on maternal health: Evidence from Peru | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 180 | pages = 1–9 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28301806 | pmc = 5423409 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.03.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing complications at the earliest sign of a problem can improve outcomes for expecting mothers, which makes it extremely important for a pregnant woman to be knowledgeable enough to seek healthcare for potential complications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Improving the relationships between patients and the healthcare system as a whole will make it easier for a pregnant woman to feel comfortable seeking help. Good communication between patients and providers, as well as cultural competence of the providers, could also assist in increasing compliance with recommended treatments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Policy===

The biggest global policy initiative for maternal health came from the United Nations' Millennium Declaration which created the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. In 2012, this evolved at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to become the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with a target year of 2030. The SDGs are 17 goals that call for global collaboration to tackle a wide variety of recognized problems. Goal 3 is focused on ensuring health and well-being for people of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300|title=Sustainable Development Goals .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific target is to achieve a global maternal mortality ratio of less than 70 per 100,000 live births. So far, specific progress has been made in births attended by a skilled provider, now at 80% of births worldwide compared with 62% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg3|title=Goal 3 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries and local governments have taken political steps in reducing maternal deaths. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] studied maternal health systems in four apparently similar countries: [[Rwanda]], [[Malawi]], [[Niger]], and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| vauthors = Chambers V, Booth D |year=2012|title=Delivering maternal health: why is Rwanda doing better than Malawi, Niger and Uganda?|type=Briefing Paper|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/6614-maternal-health-maternal-mortality-health-services-local-goverance-health-providers-malawi-uganda-niger-rwanda-local-problem-solving-accountability-sub-saharan-africa-institutions-mdg5-pregnancy-childbirth-delivery-bottlenecks-imihigo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to the other three countries, Rwanda has an excellent recent record of improving maternal death rates. Based on their investigation of these varying country case studies, the researchers conclude that improving maternal health depends on three key factors: 1. reviewing all maternal health-related policies frequently to ensure that they are internally coherent; 2. enforcing standards on providers of maternal health services; 3. any local solutions to problems discovered should be promoted, not discouraged.

In terms of aid policy, proportionally, aid given to improve maternal mortality rates has shrunken as other public health issues, such as [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], have become major international concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/tools/data-visualization/development-assistance-health-health-focus-area-global-1990-2009-interactiv#/overview/terms|title=Development assistance for health by health focus area (Global), 1990-2009, interactive treemap|publisher=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317021516/http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/tools/data-visualization/development-assistance-health-health-focus-area-global-1990-2009-interactiv|archive-date=2014-03-17|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maternal health aid contributions tend to be lumped together with newborn and child health, so it is difficult to assess how much aid is given directly to maternal health to help lower the rates of maternal mortality. Regardless, there has been progress in reducing maternal mortality rates internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/tools/data-visualization/progress-maternal-and-child-mortality-country-age-and-year-global-1990-2011#/overview/explore|title=Progress in maternal and child mortality by country, age, and year (Global), 1990-2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317022301/http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/tools/data-visualization/progress-maternal-and-child-mortality-country-age-and-year-global-1990-2011|archive-date=2014-03-17|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries where abortion practices are not considered legal, it is necessary to look at the access that women have to high-quality family planning services, since some of the restrictive policies around abortion could impede access to these services. These policies may also affect the proper collection of information for monitoring maternal health around the world.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==

Maternal deaths and disabilities are leading contributors in women's disease burden with an estimated 275,000 women killed each year in childbirth and pregnancy worldwide.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koblinsky M, Chowdhury ME, Moran A, Ronsmans C | title = Maternal morbidity and disability and their consequences: neglected agenda in maternal health | journal = Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 124–30 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22838155 | pmc = 3397324 | doi = 10.3329/jhpn.v30i2.11294 | jstor = 23500057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, there were approximately 273,500 maternal deaths (uncertainty range, 256,300 to 291,700).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhutta ZA, Black RE | title = Global maternal, newborn, and child health--so near and yet so far | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 23 | pages = 2226–35 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24304052 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1111853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-five percent of postpartum deaths occur within 24 hours.&lt;ref name=nour&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nour NM | title = An introduction to maternal mortality | journal = Reviews in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 77–81 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18769668 | pmc = 2505173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-nine percent of maternal deaths occur in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="WHO Fact Sheet 2014" /&gt;

{{Meals}}
[[File:Jean-Baptiste de Saive (circle) Kitchen interior with maid 1563.jpg|thumb|Meals have been traditionally prepared by women in a home kitchen (Painting from the circle of Jean-Baptiste de Saive, 1563)]]
A '''meal''' is an [[eating]] occasion that takes place at a certain time and includes prepared [[food]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/meal_1?q=meal meal noun (FOOD) - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/meal meal - Definition from Longman English Dictionary Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The names used for specific meals in [[English (language)|English]] vary greatly, depending on the speaker's [[culture]], the [[time]] of day, or the size of the meal.

Meals occur primarily at [[home]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[cafeteria]]s, but may occur anywhere. Regular meals occur on a daily basis, typically several times a day. Special meals are usually held in conjunction with such occasions as [[birthday]]s, [[wedding]]s, [[Wedding anniversary|anniversaries]], events and [[religious holiday|holidays]]. A meal is different from a [[snack]] in that meals are generally larger, more varied, and more filling than snacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wansink | first1 = B. | last2 = Payne | first2 = C. R. | last3 = Shimizu | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1016/j.appet.2009.09.016 | title = "Is this a meal or snack?" Situational cues that drive perceptions | journal = Appetite | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 214–216 | year = 2010 | pmid =  19808071| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of meal served or eaten at any given time varies by custom and location. In most modern cultures, three main meals are eaten: in the morning, early afternoon, and evening. Further, the names of meals are often interchangeable by custom as well. Some serve [[dinner]] as the main meal at midday, with [[supper]] as the late afternoon/early evening meal; while others may call their midday meal [[lunch]] and their early evening meal supper. Except for "breakfast", these names can vary from region to region or even from family to family.

A study in 2016 by Toluna found that 47% of parents in the United States share fewer meals with their families than when growing up, and 58% wished they could do it more frequently, including 66% of dads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refrigeratedfrozenfood.com/articles/90952-study-shows-trends-in-family-mealtimes "Study shows trends in family mealtimes"], Refrigerated &amp; Frozen Foods magazine. May 26, 2016. Retrieved 7 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breakfast ==
{{Main article|Breakfast}}

[[Breakfast]] is the first meal of a day, most often eaten in the early morning before undertaking the day's work. Some believe it to be the most important meal of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/breakfast |title=breakfast – definition of breakfast by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''breakfast'' literally refers to breaking the [[fasting]] period of the prior night.&lt;ref name="Anderson-2013"&gt;Anderson, Heather Arndt (2013). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5LghYCqDJw8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Breakfast: A History'']. AltaMira Press. {{ISBN|0759121656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breakfast foods vary widely from place to place, but often include a [[carbohydrate]] such as [[Food grain|grains]] or cereals, fruit, vegetables, a [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] food such as [[egg (food)|eggs]], meat or fish, and a beverage such as [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[milk]], or [[fruit juice]]. Coffee, milk, tea, juice, [[breakfast cereal]]s, [[pancake]]s, [[waffle]]s, [[sausage]]s, [[French toast]], [[bacon]], [[:Category:Sweet breads|sweetened breads]], fresh fruits, vegetables, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[baked beans]], [[muffin]]s, [[crumpet]]s and [[toast]] with [[butter]], [[margarine]], [[jam]] or [[marmalade]] are common examples of Western breakfast foods, though a large range of preparations and ingredients are associated with breakfast globally.&lt;ref name="hob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakfastpanel.org/history-of-breakfast/|title=History of breakfast|accessdate=21 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123043206/http://breakfastpanel.org/history-of-breakfast|archive-date=23 January 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variations of breakfast ===

==== Full breakfast ====
{{Main article|Full breakfast}}

A [[full breakfast]] is a [[breakfast]] meal, usually including [[bacon]], [[Sausage#United Kingdom|sausages]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], and a variety of other cooked foods, with a beverage such as coffee or tea. It is especially popular in the UK and Ireland, to the extent that many [[café]]s and [[pub]]s offer the meal at any time of day as an "all-day breakfast". It is also popular in other English-speaking countries.

In England it is usually referred to as a 'full English breakfast' (often shortened to 'full English') or 'fry-up'.&lt;ref name="full English"&gt;{{cite web|title=The full English|url=http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pork-recipes/the-full-english|publisher=Jamieoliver.com|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other regional names and variants include the 'full Scottish', 'full Welsh', 'full Irish' and the 'Ulster fry'.&lt;ref name="full Scottish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional Scottish Food|url=http://www.visitscotland.com/about/food-drink/traditional|publisher=Visit Scotland|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="full Welsh"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowland |first=Paul |title=So what is a 'full Welsh breakfast'? |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/what-full-welsh-breakfast-2374227 |accessdate=26 February 2014 |newspaper=Wales Online |date=25 October 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004835/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/what-full-welsh-breakfast-2374227 |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell|first=James|title=How to...

The full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]], along with such staples as [[bangers &amp; mash]], [[shepherd's pie]], [[fish and chips]] and the [[Christmas dinner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History |first=Colin|last= Spencer|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full breakfast became popular in the British Isles during the Victorian era, and appeared as one among many suggested breakfasts in the home economist [[Isabella Beeton]]'s ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management|The Book of Household Management]]'' (1861). A full breakfast is often contrasted (e.g. on hotel menus) with the lighter alternative of a [[Continental breakfast]], traditionally consisting of tea, milk or coffee and [[fruit juice]]s with bread, [[croissant]]s, or [[pastry|pastries]].

==== Instant breakfast ====
{{Main article|Instant breakfast}}

"[[Instant breakfast]]" typically refers to breakfast food products that are manufactured in a [[Drying (food)|powdered]] form, which are generally prepared with the addition of [[milk]] and then consumed as a [[beverage]].&lt;ref name=Sengupta&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KtVdGFjYuxsC&amp;pg=PA5 Brand Positioning: Strategies for Competitive Advantage - Subroto Sengupta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lantos/&gt; Some instant breakfasts are produced and marketed in liquid form, being pre-mixed. The target market for instant breakfast products includes consumers who tend to be busy, such as working adults.&lt;ref name=Lantos&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JemkYebV5NYC&amp;pg=PA45 Consumer Behavior in Action: Real-Life Applications for Marketing Managers - Geoffrey P. Lantos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Champagne breakfast ====
{{Main article|Champagne breakfast}}

A [[champagne breakfast]] is a [[breakfast]] served with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] or [[sparkling wine]]. It is a new concept in some countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050103/asp/calcutta/story_3634736.asp |title=The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=2005-01-03 |accessdate=2011-03-04 |location=Calcutta, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not typical of the role of a breakfast.

It may be part of any day or outing considered particularly [[luxurious]] or [[indulgent]]. The accompanying breakfast is sometimes of a similarly high standard &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icseftonandwestlancs.icnetwork.co.uk/crosbyherald/news/tm_headline=grand-national-thrills-for-crosby-couple&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=20740586&amp;siteid=60252-name_page.html |title=icseftonandwestlancs - Grand National thrills for Crosby couple |publisher=Icseftonandwestlancs.icnetwork.co.uk |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2011-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include rich foods such as [[salmon]], [[caviar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/oct/24/theairlineindustry.travelnews |title=Concorde makes final landing &amp;#124; Business |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date= 2003-10-24|accessdate=2011-03-04 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chocolate]] or [[pastries]], which would not ordinarily be eaten at [[breakfast]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mnweekly.ru/travel/20080410/55322252.html Moscow News - Travel - Swissц╢tel Krasnye Holmy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420060007/http://mnweekly.ru/travel/20080410/55322252.html |date=20 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or more courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2007/08/19/stories/2007081950200700.htm |title=Magazine / Travel : Weekend getaway |publisher=The Hindu |date=2007-08-19 |accessdate=2011-03-04 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Instead of as a formal meal the breakfast can be given to the recipient in a basket or hamper.

==Lunch==
{{Main article|Lunch}}

[[Lunch]], the abbreviation for ''luncheon'', is a light meal typically eaten at midday.&lt;ref name="Davidson2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Davidson|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA478|date=August 21, 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-104072-6|page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the words ''lunch'' and ''luncheon'' relate to a small snack originally eaten at any time of the day or night. During the 20th century the meaning gradually narrowed to a small or mid-sized meal eaten at midday. Lunch is commonly the second meal of the day after [[breakfast]]. The meal varies in size depending on the culture, and significant variations exist in different areas of the world.

=== Variations of lunch ===
{{Main article|Packed lunch}}

A [[packed lunch]] (also called '''pack lunch''', '''sack lunch''' or '''bag lunch''' in [[North America]], or '''packed lunch''' in the [[United Kingdom]], as well as the regional variations: '''bagging''' in [[Lancashire]], [[Merseyside]] and [[Yorkshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/lancashire/voices2005/game.shtml |title = BBC: Lancashire &gt; Voices &gt; Wordly Wise? |publisher = BBC |date = 31 May 2005 |accessdate= 1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[lunch]] prepared at [[home]] and carried to be [[eat]]en somewhere else, such as [[school]], a [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], or at an [[excursion|outing]]. The food is usually wrapped in [[plastic wrap|plastic]], [[aluminum foil]], or [[paper]] and can be carried ("[[wikt:packed|packed]]") in a [[lunch box]], [[paper bag]] (a "[[Bag|sack]]"), or [[plastic bag]]. While packed lunches are usually taken from home by the people who are going to eat them, in [[Mumbai, India]], [[tiffin]] boxes are most often picked up from the home and brought to workplaces later in the day by so-called [[dabbawalla]]s. It is also possible to buy packed lunches from stores in several countries. [[Lunch box]]es made out of [[metal]], [[plastic]] or [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] are now popular with today's youth. Lunch boxes provide a way to take heavier lunches in a sturdier box or bag. It is also [[environmentally friendly]].

== Dinner ==
{{Main article|Dinner}}

Dinner usually refers to the most significant and important meal of the day, which can be the [[noon]] or the [[evening]] meal. However, the term "dinner" can have many different meanings depending on the culture; it may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olver|first=Lynne|title=Meal times|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodfaq7.html#mealtimes|publisher=Lynne Olver|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McMillan|2001}} Historically, it referred to the first meal of the day, eaten around noon, and is still sometimes used for a noon-time meal, particularly if it is a large or main meal. The meaning as the evening meal, generally the largest of the day, is becoming a standard in many parts of the [[English-speaking world]].

=== Variations of dinner===

==== Full course dinner====
{{Main article|Full course dinner}}

A full course dinner is a dinner consisting of multiple dishes, or courses. In its simplest form, it can consist of three to five courses, such as appetizers, fish course, entrée, main course and dessert.

== Meals at other times of the day ==
{{Main article|Outline of meals#Types of meals, in the order served throughout the day}}

== Meal preparation ==
{{Main article|Meal preparation}}

[[Meal preparation]], sometimes called "meal prep," is the process of planning and preparing meals. It generally involves food preparation, including cooking.

=== Food preparation ===
{{Main article|Food preparation}}

[[Food preparation|Preparing food]] for eating generally requires selection, measurement and combination of ingredients in an ordered procedure so as to achieve desired results. Food preparation includes but is not limited to cooking.

==== Cooking ====
{{Main article|Cooking}}

[[Cooking]] or ''cookery'' is the [[art]], [[technology]] and [[craft]] of preparing [[food]] for consumption with the use of heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the [[Earth|world]], from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends. The ways or types of cooking also depend on the skill and type of training an individual cook has. Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat, most notably with [[ceviche]], a traditional [[South American]] dish where [[fish]] is cooked with the acids in [[lemon]] or lime juice.

==Safety and legal issues==
''[[The Guardian]]'' has described MMS as "extremely nasty stuff, and the medical advice given is that anyone who has this product should stop using it immediately and throw it away. In Canada it was banned after causing a life-threatening reaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Martin | last = Robbins | title = The man who encourages the sick and dying to drink industrial bleach | date = 2010-09-15 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/sep/15/miracle-mineral-solutions-mms-bleach | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, a Mexican woman travelling with her American husband on their yacht in [[Vanuatu]] took MMS as a preventative for malaria. Within 15 minutes she was ill, and within twelve hours she was dead. The island nation's public prosecutor, Kayleen Tavoa, did not press any charges as there were no specific laws banning the importation of MMS, but advised, "While every case is assessed on its own merits, I advise that any person who misuses MMS in Vanuatu in the future would be likely to face prosecution for potentially serious criminal offences. No person should ever give MMS to another person to drink without advising them of what it is they are drinking and of the serious risks to health that may arise if they decide to drink the mixture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Gibson |first= Joel |publication-date= January 9, 2010 |title= Death in paradise |newspaper= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issn= 0312-6315 |url= http://www.smh.com.au/national/death-in-paradise-20100108-lyxv.html |accessdate= February 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214180619/http://www.smh.com.au/national/death-in-paradise-20100108-lyxv.html |archivedate=December 14, 2013 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the [[Food Standards Agency]] has also released a warning, following the initial warning from Health Canada and a similar warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in which they stated that "MMS is a 28% sodium chlorite solution which is equivalent to industrial-strength bleach. When taken as directed it could cause severe [[nausea]], vomiting and [[diarrhea]], potentially leading to [[dehydration]] and [[hypotension|reduced blood pressure]]. If the solution is diluted less than instructed, it could cause damage to the gut and red blood cells, potentially resulting in [[respiratory failure]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Food Standards Agency has since reiterated their warning on MMS and extended it to include CDS.&lt;ref name="FSAcds" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/04/government-warning-internet-remedies|title=Bleach-based cure-all online remedies could kill, warns government|first=Rebecca|last=Smithers|date=4 July 2012|publisher=|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sellers attribute the vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea to the product working, but it is simply the product's toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://moh.gov.ms/?p=803 |title= Product Warning: Miracle Mineral Solution |publisher= Ministry of Health |location= Montserrat |accessdate= December 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, an alert was issued by the Belgian Poison Control Centre to the [[European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists]]. In response, an evaluation was performed by the French "Comité de coordination de toxicovigilance" in March 2010, warning about a dose dependent irritation and possible toxic effects. They also warned that patients affected by serious diseases could be tempted to stop their treatments in favour of this alternative treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

A similar notice was released in July 2010 by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] warning that the instructions for preparing the solution by mixing it with an acidic solution, or even orange juice, would produce [[chlorine dioxide]], "a potent bleach used for stripping textiles and industrial water treatment." Because of reports including nausea, vomiting, and dangerously [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] as a result of dehydration following instructed use, the FDA has advised consumers to dispose of the product immediately.&lt;ref name="fda.gov" /&gt;

MMS is not approved for the treatment of any disease and according to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], chronic exposure to small doses of chlorine dioxide could cause reproductive and neurodevelopmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Investigations==
In 2015, BBC London conducted an undercover investigation into MMS, with a reporter posing as a family member of a person with [[autism]].  The BBC reporter was sold two bottles containing [[sodium chlorite]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] by a self-styled "reverend" named Leon Edwards linked to the Genesis II Church in the United States.  Edwards told the reporter that the solutions would cure nearly all illnesses and conditions, including cancer, HIV, malaria, autism and Alzheimer's.  He recommended 27 drops per day for a baby.  Laboratory analysis later showed that the concentration of both bottled solutions was stronger than advertised.  Edwards told the reporter:

: "I put it in my eyes, my nose, my ears, bathe in it, drunk it, breathed it in my lungs. I got injected in my butt with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-33079776|title='Miracle autism cure' seller exposed by BBC investigation|date=11 June 2015|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyewitness News and ABC News investigated the MMS phenomenon in 2016, and uncovered an "underground network" centred around southern California which was promoting the substance as a cure for conditions including cancer, [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and childhood autism.&lt;ref name=ne&amp;ya&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/parents-making-children-drink-bleach-160057178.html|title=Parents Are Making Their Children Drink Bleach to 'Cure' Them of Autism|date=28 January 2018|publisher=Newsweek/Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in January 2018 that at least six police forces have investigated the use of MMS in the UK, where it continues to be available.  Spokespersons for the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the [[Food Standards Agency]] have repeatedly warned of the dangers of using such a product.&lt;ref name=ne&amp;ya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brit-kids-forced-drink-bleach-11924623|title=Desperate parents forcing kids to drink bleach as autistic children become victims of sick US cult|date=27 January 2018|publisher=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgments==
Former Chicagoan Kerri Rivera, who now resides in Mexico, was required by the [[Illinois Attorney General]] to sign a document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assurance of Voluntary Compliance - Kerri Rivera|url=http://media.nbcchicago.com/documents/Rivera+Fully+Executed+AVC.pdf|website=[[NBC Chicago]]|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that she would no longer promote the use of toxic chlorine dioxide, or "CD," in the state of Illinois. The agreement, which Rivera signed, says, "Respondent [Rivera] makes unsubstantiated health and medical claims regarding the use of chlorine dioxide in the treatment of autism. In truth and fact, Respondent lacks competent and reliable scientific evidence to support her claims that chlorine dioxide can treat autism. Respondent's act of promoting unsubstantiated health and medical claims regarding the use of chlorine dioxide in the treatment of autism constitutes a violation of Section 2 of the Consumer Fraud Act." The agreement continued to bar Rivera from speaking at seminars and selling chlorine dioxide or similar substances for the treatment of autism.

MMS was a cure touted by an Australian couple targeting the Seattle area.

On May 28, 2015, a US federal jury found Louis Daniel Smith guilty of conspiracy, smuggling, selling misbranded drugs and defrauding the United States in relation to the sale of MMS.

'''Nutrition International''', formerly the '''Micronutrient Initiative''' ('''MI'''), is an international [[not for profit]] agency based in [[Canada]] that works to eliminate vitamin and mineral deficiencies in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Plus 5 Review of the 2002 Special Session on Children and World Fit for Children Plan of Action: Response by Canada, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although often only required by the body in very small amounts, vitamin and minerals – also known as [[micronutrients]] – support an array of critical biological functions including growth, immune function and eye function, as well as [[foetal development]] of the brain, the nervous system, and the skeletal system. [[Micronutrient deficiency]] is a form of [[malnutrition]] and is a recognized health problem in many developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1079/BJN2001315 |title=Micronutrient deficiency in children |year=2007 |last1=Bhan |first1=Maharaj K |last2=Sommerfelt |first2=Halvor |last3=Strand |first3=Tor |journal=British Journal of Nutrition |volume=85 |pages=S199–203 |pmid=11509111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, more than two billion people live with vitamin and mineral deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;Flour Fortification Initiative, GAIN, Micronutrient Initiative, USAID, The World Bank, UNICEF, Investing in the Future: A United Call to Action on Vitamin and Mineral Deficiencies, 2009, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1990, leaders attending the [[World Summit for Children]] set the goal of virtually eliminating micronutrient deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, Plan of Action for Implementing the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children in the 1990s, #13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, ''Micronutrient Initiative'' was established as a secretariat within the [[International Development Research Centre]] (IDRC), based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to support progress toward that goal. In 1993 IDRC recruited an [[executive director]] for the secretariat and transferred 2–3 of its staff to the new organization.&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi T, Ross J, Heymann H., "Why is reducing vitamin and mineral deficiencies critical for development?" Food and Nutrition Bulletin, 2007, 28(1S), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Venkatesh Mannar took over in June 1994 as the executive director. Until 2000, MI was governed by a steering committee composed of the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA), the [[International Development Research Centre]], [[UNICEF]], [[The World Bank]], and [[USAID]]. In 2000, MI became an independent not-for-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Canada, Global Child Survival and Health: A 50-year Progress Report from UNICEF Canada, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20140415082136/http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=113 Joel Spicer] became President in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=113# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415082136/http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=113# |archive-date=2014-04-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the organization formally rebranded to Nutrition International to more accurately reflect their expanding scope, reach and impact.&lt;ref&gt;http://finance.yahoo.com/news/micronutrient-initiative-now-nutrition-international-130000591.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The organization advocates for, and provides funding and technical assistance for [[Iodised salt|salt iodisation]], the distribution of multi-micronutrient powders, the fortification of staple foods such as wheat flour with [[vitamin A]], [[iron]] and [[folic acid]], and dietary supplementation with vitamin A, iron, [[zinc]] and folic acid. Since 1997, with funding support from the Government of Canada, Nutrition International has provided more than [https://web.archive.org/web/20141218234730/http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=128 eight billion doses] of vitamin A for use by UNICEF and national governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=128# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218234730/http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=128# |archive-date=2014-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutrition International is credited with playing a pioneering role in engaging corporations and trade associations at both the global and national level in partnerships to improve nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University - John F. Kennedy School of Management, The Conference Board, International Business Leaders Forum, Business as a Partner in Overcoming Malnutrition: An Agenda for Action, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The staff of Nutrition International includes scientists, [[nutritionist]]s, and policy and development experts. In addition to its headquarters in Ottawa, the organization has offices in [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[the Philippines]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nutritionintl.org/in-the-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6236">'''Partner notification''' is the practice of notifying the sexual partners of a person, known as the "index case", who has been newly diagnosed with a [[sexually transmitted infection]] that they may have been exposed to the infection. It is a kind of [[contact tracing]] and is considered a [[Partner services|partner service]].

==Practice==

In the UK, partner notification has not played a significant part in HIV prevention and testing efforts despite proving to be highly effective in diagnosing people with HIV. Some [http://www.nat.org.uk/media/Files/Publications/May-2012-HIV-Partner-Notification.pdf audits] show up to 37% of partners traced and tested through partner notification were newly diagnosed HIV positive as a result. Notifying sexual partners of people diagnosed with HIV is usually voluntary but a healthcare worker may decide to contact partners without consent if they feel there is a risk of HIV transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nat.org.uk/media/Files/Publications/Confidentiality-July-2014_FINAL-2.pdf|title=Publications - National AIDS Trust - NAT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is permitted under General Medical Council guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/confidentiality.asp|title=Confidentiality (2009)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2002 survey in the United States showed that with regards to STIs, healthcare providers conduct screenings with less frequency than recommended by health department guidelines.  Furthermore, when a person was found to have a sexually transmitted infection, it was much more common for the physician to ask the person to notify their partners rather than for the physician to arrange for this to be done on behalf of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=St. Lawrence |first1=Janet S. |last2=Montaño |first2=Daniel E. |last3=Kasprzyk |first3=Danuta |last4=Phillips |first4=William R. |year=2002 |title=STD Screening, Testing, Case Reporting, and Clinical and Partner Notification Practices: A National Survey of US Physicians |journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]] |volume=92 |issue=11 |pages=1784–1788 |publisher= |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.92.11.1784|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/92/11/1784 |accessdate=4 July 2011 |pmc=1447329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in [[San Francisco]] conducted between 2004–6 showed that many new diagnoses of HIV infection were made as a result of one person getting HIV tested, and then contacting that person's partner if the test was positive.  It was sometimes the case that a positive person also had a positive partner.  Patients rarely refused partner services, and their partners rarely refused to present themselves for healthcare when asked by the clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ahrens | first1 = K. | last2 = Kent | first2 = C.

==Involuntary partner notification==
In the past, the CDC has recommended that physicians and health departments should inform the sexual partners of people known to be infected with HIV of their risk for contracting the disease when the diagnosed individual refused to do so.&lt;ref name=adler_bmj&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adler|first=Michael W|author2=Anne M Johnson|title=Contact tracing for HIV infection|journal=British Medical Journal|date=May 21, 1988|volume=296|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2545884/pdf/bmj00286-0003.pdf|accessdate=14 January 2012|pmc=2545884|pmid=3132272|issue=6634|pages=1420–1|doi=10.1136/bmj.296.6634.1420}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the CDC currently recommends that all partner services, including partner notification, should be "voluntary and non-coercive" for both the individual initially diagnosed with the STD and his or her sexual partners.&lt;ref name=cdc_fact&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr57e1030a1.htm |title=Recommendations for Partner Services Programs for HIV Infection, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, and Chlamydial Infection |first=Samuel W. |last=Dooley |work=cdc.gov |date=30 October 2008 |publisher=[[DAIDS]] |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the change, as of 1998, several states in the US have laws that codify involuntary or coercive partner notification.&lt;ref name=aclu_hiv&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Partner Notification: Why Coercion Won't Work|url=https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/hiv-partner-notification-why-coercion-wont-work|accessdate=14 January 2012|date=March 1, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Michigan and Indiana, individuals who test positive for HIV are legally obligated to notify past sexual contacts.&lt;ref name=aclu_hiv /&gt; In Texas and other states, doctors and public health officials are either required or authorized to inform known sexual contacts of patients who have tested positive for HIV.&lt;ref name=aclu_hiv /&gt;

In [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], if a health worker believes that the behavior of the index case poses a risk to the health of the public, then the worker is obligated to inform the Director-General of NSW health, who has the sole authority to inform partners of the index case without his or her consent.&lt;ref name=NSW_contact_tracing&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact Tracing Guidelines for the Sexually Transmissible Diseases and Blood Borne Viruses|url=http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/policies/PD/2005/pdf/PD2005_184.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2012|pages=5–6|date=27 Jan 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent explanation in present literature draws upon "Intemporal discounting, task averseness and certain personality traits such as indecisiveness and distractibility" as the common causes of procrastination.

A study of behavioural patterns of pigeons through delayed reward suggests that procrastination is not unique to humans, but can also be observed in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazur|first=James|date=1998|title=Procrastination by Pigeons with Fixed-Interval Response Requirements|journal=Experimental Analysis Behav|volume=69|pages=|via=|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1284653/pdf/9540230.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Latin: ''procrastinare'', ''pro-'', 'forward', with ''-crastinus'', 'till next day' from "''cras''", 'tomorrow'

== Prevalence ==
In a study of academic procrastination from the [[University of Vermont]], published in 1984, 46% of the subjects reported that they "always" or "nearly always" procrastinate writing papers, while approximately 30% reported procrastinating studying for exams and reading weekly assignments (by 28% and 30% respectively). Nearly a quarter of the subjects reported that procrastination was a problem for them regarding the same tasks. However, as many as 65% indicated that they would like to reduce their procrastination when writing papers, and approximately 62% indicated the same for studying for exams and 55% for reading weekly assignments.&lt;ref name="Solomon1984"&gt;{{cite web |author= Solomon, LJ |author2=Rothblum |url= http://rothblum.sdsu.edu/doc_pdf/procrastination/AcademicProcrastinationFrequency.pdf|date=1984|title=Academic Procrastination: Frequency and Cognitive-Behavioural Correlates|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729211829/http://rothblum.sdsu.edu/doc_pdf/procrastination/AcademicProcrastinationFrequency.pdf|archivedate=2016-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 study showed that "52% of surveyed students indicated having a moderate to high need for help concerning procrastination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gallagher |first1=Robert P. |last2=Golin |first2=Anne |last3=Kelleher |first3=Kathleen |journal=Journal of College Student Development |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=301–10|date=1992 |title=The Personal, Career, and Learning Skills Needs of College Students|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-03494-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 80–95% of college students engage in procrastination, and approximately 75% consider themselves procrastinators.

In a study performed on university students, procrastination was shown to be greater on tasks that were perceived as [[unpleasant]] or as impositions than on tasks for which the student believed they lacked the required skills for accomplishing the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Norman A. Milgram |author2=Barry Sroloff |author3=Michael Rosenbaum |title=The Procrastination of Everyday Life|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=22|number=2|date=June 1988|pages=197–212|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(88)90015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral criteria of academic procrastination ==
Gregory Schraw, Theresa Wadkins, and Lori Olafson in 2007 proposed three criteria for a behavior to be classified as academic procrastination: it must be counterproductive, needless, and delaying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.99.1.12 |title=Doing the Things We Do: A Grounded Theory of Academic Procrastination |year=2007 |last1=Schraw |first1=Gregory |last2=Wadkins |first2=Theresa |last3=Olafson |first3=Lori |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=99 |pages=12–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel reviewed all previous attempts to define procrastination, and concluded in a 2007 study that procrastination is "to voluntarily delay an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse off for the delay."&lt;ref name="Steel2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65 |url=http://studiemetro.au.dk/fileadmin/www.studiemetro.au.dk/Procrastination_2.pdf |title=The Nature of Procrastination: A Meta-Analytic and Theoretical Review of Quintessential Self-Regulatory Failure |year=2007 |last1=Steel |first1=Piers |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=133 |pages=65–94 |pmid=17201571 |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401132716/http://studiemetro.au.dk/fileadmin/www.studiemetro.au.dk/Procrastination_2.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-01 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.335.2796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabini &amp; Silver argued that postponement and irrationality are the two key features of procrastination. Delaying a task is not deemed as procrastination, they argue, if there are rational reasons behind the delay.

An approach that integrates several core theories of motivation as well as meta-analytic research on procrastination is the [[temporal motivation theory]]. It summarizes key predictors of procrastination (expectancy, value, and impulsiveness) into a mathematical equation.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

== Psychological perspective==
The [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] may be responsible for procrastination; one may prefer to avoid negative emotions by delaying stressful tasks. As the deadline for their target of procrastination grows closer, they are more stressed and may, thus, decide to procrastinate more to avoid this stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pychyl, T.|date=20 February 2012|accessdate=20 February 2012|title=The real reasons you procrastinate — and how to stop|publisher=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/27/why-you-cant-help-read-this-article-about-procrastination-instead-of-doing-your-job/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[psychologist]]s cite such behavior as a [[coping mechanism|mechanism for coping]] with the [[anxiety]] associated with starting or completing any task or decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Penguin Group| isbn = 978-1-58542-552-5| last = Fiore| first = Neil A| title = The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play| location = New York| year = 2006| page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Piers Steel indicated in 2010 that anxiety is just as likely to induce people to start working early as late, and that the focus of studies on procrastination should be [[impulsiveness]]. That is, anxiety will cause people to delay only if they are impulsive.&lt;ref name=Steel2010&gt;{{cite book |last=Steel |first=Piers |title=The Procrastination Equation: How to Stop Putting Things Off and Start Getting Stuff Done |year=2010 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-170361-4}}{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coping responses ===
Negative coping responses of procrastination tend to be avoidant or emotional rather than task-oriented or focused on problem-solving. Emotional and avoidant coping is employed to reduce stress (and [[cognitive dissonance]]) associated with delaying intended and important personal goals. This option provides immediate pleasure and is consequently very attractive to impulsive procrastinators, at the point of discovery of the achievable goals at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1520-8583.2007.00127.x |title=Self-Deception As Pretense |year=2007 |last1=Gendler |first1=Tamar Szabó |journal=Philosophical Perspectives |volume=21 |pages=231–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosling|first=J.|title=Weakness of the Will|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several emotion-oriented strategies, similar to Freudian [[defense mechanisms]], [[Coping (psychology)|coping styles]] and [[self-handicapping]].  
 
Coping responses of procrastinators include the following.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

*[[Avoidance coping|Avoidance]]: Avoiding the location or situation where the task takes place (e.g. a graduate student avoiding driving into the university).
*[[Denial]] and [[trivialization (psychology)|trivialization]]: Pretending that procrastinatory behavior is not actually procrastinating, but rather a task which is more important than the avoided one, or that the essential task that should be done is not of immediate importance.
*[[Distraction]]: Engaging or immersing in other behaviors or actions to prevent awareness of the task (e.g. [[Cyberslacking|intensive video game playing or web browsing]]). The subject is very sensitive to instant gratification and becomes absorbed in coping behaviors beyond self-restraint.
* Descending [[Counterfactual thinking|counterfactuality]]: Comparing consequences of one's procrastinatory behavior with others' worse situations (e.g. "Yes, I procrastinated and got a B− in the course, but I didn't fail like one other student did.")
*Valorisation: Pointing in satisfaction to what one achieved in the meantime while one should have been doing something else.
* Blaming: Delusional attributions to external factors, such as rationalizing that the procrastination is due to external forces beyond one's control (e.g. "I'm not procrastinating, but this assignment is tough.")
* Mocking: Using [[humor]] to validate one's procrastination. The person uses [[slapstick]] or slipshod methods to criticize and ridicule others' striving towards the goal.

Task- or problem-solving measures are taxing from a procrastinator's outlook. If such measures are pursued, it is less likely the procrastinator would remain a procrastinator. However, pursuing such measures requires actively changing one's behavior or situation to prevent and minimize the re-occurrence of procrastination.

In 2006, it was suggested that neuroticism has no direct links to procrastination and that any relationship is fully mediated by [[conscientiousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.05.010 |title=A Closer Look at the Relationships Among Trait Procrastination, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness |year=2006 |last1=Lee |first1=Dong-gwi |last2=Kelly |first2=Kevin R. |last3=Edwards |first3=Jodie K. |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=40 |pages=27–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, it had been suggested that irrationality was an inherent feature of procrastination. "Putting things off even until the last moment isn't procrastination if there is a reason to believe that they will take only that moment".&lt;ref name="Sabini &amp; Silver."&gt;Sabini, J. &amp; Silver, M. (1982) Moralities of everyday life, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Steel ''et al.'' explained in 2001, "actions must be postponed and this postponement must represent poor, inadequate, or inefficient planning".&lt;ref name="Steel2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steel | first1 = P. | last2 = Brothen | first2 = T. | last3 = Wambach | first3 = C. | year = 2001 | title = Procrastination and Personality, Performance and Mood | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900000131 | journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 30| issue = | pages = 95–106| doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health perspective ==
To a certain degree it is [[normality (behavior)|normal]] to procrastinate and it can be regarded as a useful way to prioritize between tasks, due to a lower tendency of procrastination on truly valued tasks (for most people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavlina|first=Steve|title=How to Fall in Love with Procrastination|url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2010/06/how-to-fall-in-love-with-procrastination/|accessdate=18 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419055057/http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2010/06/how-to-fall-in-love-with-procrastination/|archivedate=19 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, excessive procrastination can become a problem and impede normal functioning. When this happens, procrastination has been found to result in health problems, [[stress (medicine)|stress]],&lt;ref name="Tice1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tice | first1 = DM | last2 = Baumeister | first2 = RF | year = 1997 | title = Longitudinal Study of Procrastination, Performance, Stress, and Health: The Costs and Benefits of Dawdling | jstor = 40063233 | journal = Psychological Science| volume = 8| issue = 6| page = | pages=454–58 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00460.x| citeseerx = 10.1.1.461.1149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anxiety]], sense of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[crisis]] as well as loss of personal [[productivity]] and social disapproval for not meeting responsibilities or commitments. Together these feelings may promote further procrastination and for some individuals procrastination becomes almost [[chronic condition|chronic]]. Such procrastinators may have difficulties seeking support due to procrastination itself, but also [[social stigma]] and the belief that task-aversion is caused by laziness, lack of [[Self discipline|willpower]] or low ambition. In some cases problematic procrastination might be a sign of some underlying [[mental illness|psychological disorder]], but not necessarily.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

Research on the [[physiological]] roots of procrastination have been concerned with the role of the [[prefrontal cortex]],&lt;ref name="Evans2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James R.|title=Handbook of Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20oUOtjs9DkC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=8 August 2007|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7890-3360-4|page=293|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601195833/http://books.google.com/books?id=20oUOtjs9DkC&amp;pg=PA293|archivedate=1 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the area of the brain that is responsible for [[executive functions|executive brain functions]] such as [[impulse control]], [[attention]] and planning. This is consistent with the notion that procrastination is strongly related to such functions, or a [[Executive dysfunction|lack thereof]]. The prefrontal cortex also acts as a filter, decreasing distracting stimuli from other brain regions. Damage or low activation in this area can reduce one's ability to avert diversions, which results in poorer organization, a loss of attention, and increased procrastination. This is similar to the prefrontal lobe's role in [[ADHD|attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], where it is commonly underactivated.&lt;ref name="strub"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2775008 |year=1989 |last1=Strub |first1=RL |title=Frontal Lobe Syndrome in a Patient with Bilateral Globus Pallidus Lesions |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=1024–27 |journal=Archives of Neurology |doi=10.1001/archneur.1989.00520450096027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 U.S. study surveying procrastination and impulsiveness in [[twin#Dizygotic (fraternal) twins|fraternal-]] and [[twin#Monozygotic (identical) twins|identical twin]] pairs, both traits were found to be "moderately heritable". The two traits were not separable at the genetic level (r&lt;sub&gt;genetic&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.0), meaning no unique genetic influences of either trait alone was found.&lt;ref name="gustav"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gustavson|first=Daniel E|author2=Miyake A|author3=Hewitt JK|author4=Friedman NP|title=Genetic Relations Among Procrastination, Impulsivity, and Goal-Management Ability Implications for the Evolutionary Origin of Procrastination|journal=Psychological Science|date=4 April 2014|volume=25|doi= 10.1177/0956797614526260|pmid=24705635|issue=6|pages=1178–88|pmc=4185275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors confirmed three constructs developed from the evolutionary hypothesis that procrastination arose as a by-product of impulsivity: "(a) Procrastination is heritable, (b) the two traits share considerable genetic variation, and (c) goal-management ability is an important component of this shared variation."&lt;ref name="gustav" /&gt;

== Management ==
[[Psychologist]] William J. Knaus estimated that more than 90% of college students procrastinate.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis and Knaus, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Of these students, 25% are chronic procrastinators and typically abandon higher education (college dropouts).

Perfectionism is a prime cause for procrastination&lt;ref&gt;Hillary Rettig (2011). ''The 7 Secrets of the Prolific: The Definitive Guide to Overcoming Procrastination, Perfectionism, and Writer's Block''&lt;/ref&gt; because pursuing unattainable goals (perfection) usually results in failure. Unrealistic expectations destroy [[self-esteem]] and lead to self-repudiation, self-contempt, and widespread unhappiness. To overcome procrastination, it is essential to recognize and accept the power of failure without condemning,&lt;ref&gt;James Prochaska, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Principles of ACT|date=October 2015}} to stop focusing on faults and flaws and to set goals that are easier to achieve.

Behaviors and practices that reduce procrastination:{{citation needed|reason=post the paraphrased guideline/Rx protocol|date=October 2015}}

* Awareness of habits and thoughts that lead to procrastinating.
* Seeking help for self-defeating problems such as fear, anxiety, difficulty in concentrating, poor time management, indecisiveness, and perfectionism.
* Fair evaluation of personal goals, strengths, weaknesses, and priorities.
* Realistic goals and personal positive links between the tasks and the concrete, meaningful goals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macan|first=Therese Hoff|date=1994|title=Time management: Test of a process model|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|language=en|volume=79|issue=3|pages=381–391|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.79.3.381|issn=0021-9010|citeseerx=10.1.1.455.4283}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Structuring and organization of daily activities. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Modification of one's environment for that newly gained perspective: the elimination or minimization of noise or distraction; investing effort into relevant matters; and ceasing day-dreaming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Disciplining oneself to set priorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Motivation with enjoyable activities, socializing and constructive hobbies.
* Approaching issues in small blocks of time, instead of attempting whole problems at once and risking intimidation.
* To prevent relapse, reinforce pre-set goals based on needs and allow yourself to be rewarded in a balanced way for accomplished tasks.
 
Making a plan to complete tasks in a rigid schedule format might not work for everyone. There is no hard-and-fast rule to follow such a process if it turns out to be counter-productive. Instead of scheduling, it may be better to execute tasks in a flexible, unstructured schedule which has time slots for only necessary activities.&lt;ref&gt;Burka &amp; Yuen (1990). ''Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It''&lt;/ref&gt;

Piers Steel suggests&lt;ref&gt;The Procrastination Equation, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; that better [[time management]] is a key to overcoming procrastination, including being aware of and using one's "power hours" (being a "morning person" or "night owl"). A good approach is to creatively utilize one's internal [[circadian rhythms]] that are best suited for the most challenging and productive work. Steel states that it is essential to have realistic goals, to tackle one problem at a time and to cherish the "small successes". Brian O'Leary supports that "finding a work-life balance...may actually help us find ways to be more productive", suggesting that dedicating leisure activities as motivation can increase one's efficiency at handling tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/work-life-is-productivity-in-the-balance|title=Work-Life: Is Productivity in the Balance?|date=2004-07-05|work=HBS Working Knowledge|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After contemplating his own procrastination habits, philosopher [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] authored an essay entitled "Structured Procrastination",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|title=How to Procrastinate and Still Get Things Done|last=Perry|first=John|authorlink=John Perry (philosopher)|date=February 23, 1996|website=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218090944/http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|archive-date=February 18, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he proposes a "cheat" method as a safer approach for tackling procrastination: using a [[pyramid scheme]] to reinforce the unpleasant tasks needed to be completed in a quasi-prioritized order. In other words, the procrastinator should postpone tasks with a mental note that one feels to do while engaged in a work that requires their current attentional focus.

== Severe and negative impact ==
For some people, procrastination can be persistent and tremendously disruptive to everyday life. For these individuals, procrastination may be symptomatic of a psychological disorder. Procrastination has been linked to a number of negative associations, such as [[clinical depression|depression]], irrational behaviour, low [[self-esteem]], [[anxiety]] and neurological disorders such as [[ADHD]]. Others have found relationships with [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]]&lt;ref name="Pychyl2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pychyl | first1 = TA | last2 = Lee | first2 = JM | last3 = Thibodeau | first3 = R | last4 = Blunt | first4 = A | year = 2000 | title = Five Days of Emotion: An Experience Sampling Study of Undergraduate Student Procrastination (special issue) | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=2002-10572-019 | journal = Journal of Social Behavior and Personality | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 239–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stress.&lt;ref name="Tice1997" /&gt; Therefore, it is important for people whose procrastination has become chronic and is perceived to be debilitating to seek out a trained [[psychotherapy|therapist]] or [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] to investigate whether an underlying mental health issue may be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schouwenburg|first=H.C.|year=1993|title=Trait procrastination, time management, and academic behavior|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21344492853&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=8922AD549640D5B2BACA406E901F44B5.wsnAw8kcdt7IPYLO0V48gA%3a1|journal=Trait Procrastination, Time Management, and Academic Behavior|volume=8|pages=647–62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a distant deadline, procrastinators report significantly less stress and physical illness than do non-procrastinators. However, as the deadline approaches, this relationship is reversed. Procrastinators report more stress, more symptoms of physical illness, and more medical visits,&lt;ref name="Tice1997" /&gt; to the extent that, overall, procrastinators suffer more stress and health problems.

== Correlates ==
Procrastination has been linked to the complex arrangement of [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[Behavior|behavioral]] relationships from task desirability to low self esteem and [[anxiety]] to [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Solomon1984" /&gt; A study found that procrastinators were less future-oriented than their non-procrastinator counterparts. This result was hypothesized to be in association with [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] perspectives on the present; instead it was found procrastination was better predicted by a fatalistic and hopeless attitude towards life.&lt;ref name="Jackson2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = T. | last2 = Fritch | first2 = A. | last3 = Nagasaka | first3 = T. | last4 = Pope | first4 = L. | year = 2003 | title = Procrastination and Perceptions of Past, Present, and Future | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=2004-15383-003 | journal = Individual Differences Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 17–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A correlation between procrastination and [[Morningness–eveningness questionnaire|eveningness]] was observed where individuals who had later sleeping and waking patterns were more likely to procrastinate{{Fact|date=August 2018}}. It has been shown that [[Morningness–eveningness questionnaire|Morningness]] increases across lifespan and procrastination decreases with age.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;,&lt;ref name="Duffy2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duffy | first1 = JF | last2 = Czeisler | first2 = CA | year = 2002 | title = Age-Related Change in the Relationship Between Circadian Period, Circadian Phase, and Diurnal Preference in Humans | url =https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394001024272 | journal = | volume = | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Perfectionism ===
{{Main|Perfectionism (psychology)}}
Traditionally, procrastination has been associated with perfectionism: a tendency to negatively evaluate outcomes and one's own performance, intense fear and avoidance of evaluation of one's abilities by others, heightened social self-consciousness and anxiety, recurrent low mood, and "[[workaholic|workaholism]]". However, adaptive perfectionists—[[egosyntonic]] perfectionism—were ''less'' likely to procrastinate than non-perfectionists, while maladaptive perfectionists, who saw their perfectionism as a problem—[[egodystonic]] perfectionism—had high levels of procrastination and anxiety.&lt;ref name="McGarvey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.psu.edu/sep96/almost.html|title=The Almost Perfect Definition|author=McGarvey, Jason A.|year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313153133/http://www.rps.psu.edu/sep96/almost.html|archivedate=2006-03-13|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a regression analysis study of Steel, from 2007, it is found that mild to moderate perfectionists typically procrastinate slightly less than others, with "the exception being perfectionists who were also seeking clinical counseling".&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

=== Academic ===
According to an Educational Science Professor, Hatice Odaci, academic procrastination is a significant problem during college years in part because many college students lack efficient [[time management]] skills in using the Internet. Also, Odaci notes that most colleges provide free and fast twenty-four-hour Internet service which some students are not usually accustomed to, and as a result of irresponsible use or lack of firewalls these students become engulfed in distractions, and thus in procrastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odaci|first1=Hatice|title=Academic Self-Efficacy and Academic Procrastination as Predictors of Problematic Internet Use in University Students|date=August 1, 2011|url=https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=5624d9855cd9e38cd78b456e&amp;assetKey=AS%3A286236704034819%401445255556988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Student syndrome]]" refers to the phenomenon where a student will begin to fully apply themself to a task only immediately before a deadline. This negates the usefulness of any buffers built into individual task [[duration (project management)|duration]] [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]]. Results from a 2002 study indicate that many students are aware of procrastination and accordingly set binding deadlines long before the date for which a task is due. These self-imposed binding deadlines are correlated with a better performance than without binding deadlines though performance is best for evenly spaced external binding deadlines. Finally, students have difficulties optimally setting self-imposed deadlines, with results suggesting a lack of spacing before the date at which results are due.&lt;ref&gt;

In one experiment, participation in online exercises was found to be five times higher in the final week before a deadline than in the summed total of the first three weeks for which the exercises were available. Procrastinators end up being the ones doing most of the work in the final week before a deadline.&lt;ref name="Steel2001"/&gt;

Other reasons cited on why students procrastinate include fear of failure and success, perfectionist expectations, as well as legitimate activities that may take precedence over school work, such as a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://writingcenter.unc.edu/resources/handouts-demos/writing-the-paper/procrastination |title=Procrastination |publisher=The Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill |website=writingcenter.unc.edu |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318150005/http://writingcenter.unc.edu/resources/handouts-demos/writing-the-paper/procrastination |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Procrastinators have been found to receive worse grades than non-procrastinators. Tice et al. (1997) report that more than one-third of the variation in final exam scores could be attributed to procrastination. The negative association between procrastination and academic performance is recurring and consistent. Howell et al. (2006) found that, though scores on two widely used procrastination scales&lt;ref name="Solomon1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuckman1991"&gt;Tuckman, BW (1991). The Development and Concurrent Validity of the Procrastination Scale [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;UID=1991-32090-001]&lt;/ref&gt; were not significantly associated with the grade received for an assignment, self-report measures of procrastination on the assessment itself were negatively associated with grade.&lt;ref name="Howell2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howell | first1 = AJ | last2 = Watson | first2 = DC | last3 = Powell | first3 = RA | last4 = Buro | first4 = K | year = 2006 | title = Academic Procrastination: The Pattern and Correlates of Behavioral Postponement | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886906000055 | journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 40| issue = 8| pages = 1519–30| doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.11.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a study conducted by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi and published in the ''[[Journal of Social Psychology]]'' intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis &amp; Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsin Chun Chu|first=Angela|last2=Nam Choi|first2=Jin|title=Rethinking Procrastination: Positive Effects of "Active" Procrastination Behavior on Attitudes and Performance|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=145|issue=3|pages=245–64|doi=10.3200/socp.145.3.245-264|pmid=15959999|year=2005|citeseerx=10.1.1.502.2444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different findings emerge when observed and self-reported procrastination are compared. Steel et al. constructed their own scales based on Silver and Sabini’s "irrational" and "postponement" criteria. They also sought to measure this behavior objectively.&lt;ref name="Steel2001"/&gt; During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised class time could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the times at which each chapter quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified with the number of practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = −0.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = −0.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = −0.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of the literature is based, may not be the most appropriate measure to use in all cases. It was also found that procrastination itself may not have contributed significantly to poorer grades. Steel et al. noted that those students who completed all of the practice exercises "tended to perform well on the final exam no matter how much they delayed."

Procrastination is considerably more widespread in students than in the general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting procrastination for assignments at some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/media-spotlight/201307/getting-around-procrastination|title=Getting Around to Procrastination|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 panel study from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic procrastination increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrzek | first1 = J. | last2 = Sattler | first2 = S. | last3 = van Veen | first3 = F. | last4 = Grunschel | first4 = C. | last5 = Fries | first5 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Investigating the Effect of Academic Procrastination on the Frequency and Variety of Academic Misconduct: A Panel Study | url = | journal = Studies in Higher Education | volume = 40| issue = 6| pages = 1–16| doi = 10.1080/03075079.2013.854765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study argues that academic misconduct can be seen as a means to cope with the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as performance impairment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">A '''quad helix''' (or quadhelix) is an [[orthodontic]] appliance for the upper [[human teeth|teeth]] that is cemented in the [[human mouth|mouth]]. It is attached to the [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s by 2 bands and has two or four active [[helix]] [[spring (device)|springs]] that widen the arch of the mouth to make room for crowded teeth, or correct a posterior cross-bite, where lower teeth are buccal (outer) than upper teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Laura|title=An Introduction to Orthodontics|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198568124}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually made from 38 mil stainless steel wire and is primarily indicated in mixed dentition, cleft patients and those that have performed the act of thumbsucking. A variety of this appliance is inserted into attachments that are welded to the bands. In this way the orthodontist can adjust the appliance without removing the bands.

The precursor to the quad-helix was the [[coffin spring]]. Similar devices known as tri-helices and bi-helices were later developed, with three and two helix springs, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurkeerat|title=Textbook of Orthodontics|edition=2nd|date=December 31, 2007|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|location=[[New Delhi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expander works by gently pushing the teeth outwards to eventually widen the upper arch. A quad helix expander is usually given to those who have a narrow top jaw, a cross bite and/or crowded teeth.

[[Image:Big Spring Missouri 1-02Aug08.jpg|thumb|right|On an average day nearly {{convert|303|e6USgal|m3}} of water flow from [[Big Spring (Missouri)|Big Spring]] in [[Missouri]] at a rate of {{convert|469|cuft/s|m3/s}}.]]

A '''spring ''' is a point at which water flows from an [[aquifer]] to the Earth's surface. It is a component of the [[hydrosphere]].

== Formation ==
[[Image:Nacentemackinac.jpg|thumb|upright|A natural spring on [[Mackinac Island]] in [[Michigan]]]]

A spring may be the result of [[karst topography]] where surface water has infiltrated the [[Earth]]'s surface (recharge area), becoming part of the area [[groundwater]]. The groundwater then travels through a network of cracks and fissure—openings ranging from intergranular spaces to large [[cave|caves]]. The water eventually emerges from below the surface, in the form of a [[karst spring]].

The forcing of the spring to the surface can be the result of a confined [[aquifer]] in which the recharge area of the spring water table rests at a higher elevation than that of the outlet. Spring water forced to the surface by elevated sources are [[Artesian aquifer|artesian wells]]. This is possible even if the outlet is in the form of a {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} cave. In this case the cave is used like a hose by the higher elevated recharge area of groundwater to exit through the lower elevation opening.

Non-artesian springs may simply flow from a higher elevation through the earth to a lower elevation and exit in the form of a spring, using the ground like a drainage pipe.

Still other springs are the result of pressure from an underground source in the earth, in the form of [[volcanic]] activity. The result can be water at elevated temperature such as a [[hot spring]].

[[Image:MiddleSpring.JPG|thumb|Sunrise at Middle Spring, [[Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge]], Utah]]
The action of the groundwater continually dissolves permeable bedrock such as [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]], creating vast cave systems.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesprings.html|title=Springs - The Water Cycle, from USGS Water-Science School|website=ga.water.usgs.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509022203/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesprings.html|archivedate=9 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types ===
* [[Seep (hydrology)|Seepage]] or filtration spring. The term seep refers to springs with small flow rates in which the source water has filtered through permeable earth.
* Fracture springs, discharge from faults, joints, or fissures in the earth, in which springs have followed a natural course of voids or weaknesses in the bedrock.
* Tubular springs, in which the water flows from underground caverns.

== Flow ==
Spring discharge, or '''resurgence''', is determined by the spring's recharge basin. Factors that affect the recharge include the size of the area in which groundwater is captured, the amount of precipitation, the size of capture points, and the size of the spring outlet.  Water may leak into the underground system from many sources including permeable earth, sinkholes, and [[losing stream]]s.  In some cases entire [[Stream|creek]]s seemingly disappear as the water sinks into the ground via the stream bed. [[Grand Gulf State Park (Missouri)|Grand Gulf State Park]] in [[Missouri]] is an example of an entire creek vanishing into the groundwater system.  The water emerges {{convert|9|mi|km}} away, forming some of the discharge of [[Mammoth Spring]] in [[Arkansas]]. Human activity may also affect a spring's discharge—withdrawal of groundwater reduces the water pressure in an aquifer, decreasing the volume of flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterdata.usgs.gov/mo/nwis/sw|title=USGS Surface-Water Data for Missouri|website=waterdata.usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification ===
[[Image:La Sorgue, Fontaine-de-Vaucluse.JPG|thumb|[[Fontaine de Vaucluse (spring)|Fontaine de Vaucluse]] or Spring of Vaucluse in France discharges about {{convert|470|e6USgal|m3}} of water per day at a rate of 727 cubic feet (21 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) per second.]]
Springs are often classified by the volume of the water they discharge. The largest springs are called "first-magnitude", defined as springs that discharge water at a rate of at least 2800 liters or {{convert|100|cuft|m3}} of water per second.  Some locations contain many first-magnitude springs, such as [[Florida]] where there are at least 27 known to be that size; the [[Missouri]] and [[Arkansas]] [[Ozarks]], which contain 10&lt;ref&gt;Vineyard and Fender, 1982. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterdata.usgs.gov/mo/nwis/sw|title=USGS Surface-Water Data for Missouri|website=waterdata.usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  known of first-magnitude; and 11&lt;ref name=ui&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.if.uidaho.edu/~johnson/ifiwrri/1000spgs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121212171529/http://www.if.uidaho.edu/~johnson/ifiwrri/1000spgs.html |archivedate=12 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; more in the [[Thousand Springs State Park|Thousand Springs]] area along the [[Snake River]] in [[Idaho]].

==Water content==
{{Main|Mineral spring}}
[[File:PruessLake.JPG|thumb|[[Pruess Lake]] is spring-fed in the arid [[Snake Valley (Great Basin)|Snake Valley]] of [[Utah]].]]
[[Mineral]]s become dissolved in the water as it moves through the underground [[rock (geology)|rocks]]. This may give the water flavor and even [[carbon dioxide]] bubbles, depending on the nature of the [[geology]] through which it passes. This is why spring water is often bottled and sold as [[mineral water]], although the term is often the subject of [[deception|deceptive]] [[advertising]]. Springs that contain significant amounts of minerals are sometimes called '[[mineral springs]]'. (Springs without such mineral content, meanwhile, are sometimes distinguished as 'sweet springs'.) Springs that contain large amounts of dissolved [[sodium]] [[salts]], mostly [[sodium carbonate]], are called 'soda springs'.  Many resorts have developed around mineral springs and are known as [[spa towns]].

Water from springs is usually clear. However some springs may be colored by the minerals that are dissolved in the water. For instance, water heavy with iron or [[tannins]] will have an orange color.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; 

In parts of the United States a [[stream]] carrying the outflow of a spring to a nearby primary stream may be called a '''spring branch''' or run.  Groundwater tends to maintain a relatively long-term average temperature of its aquifer; so flow from a spring may be cooler than a summer day, but remain unfrozen in the winter.  The cool water of a spring and its branch may harbor species such as certain [[trout]] that are otherwise ill-suited to a warmer local [[climate]].

== Uses ==

{{Expand section|date=October 2010}}
Springs have been used for a variety of human needs including drinking water, domestic water supply, irrigation, [[Watermill|mill]]s, navigation, and [[hydroelectricity|electricity generation]].  Other modern uses include recreational activities such as fishing, swimming, and floating; [[hot springs|therapy]]; water for livestock; fish hatcheries; and supply for bottled [[mineral water]].

=== Sacred springs ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
{{main article|Holy well}}
A sacred spring, or holy well, is a small body of water emerging from underground and revered either in a [[Christian]], [[Paganism|pagan]] or other religious context, sometimes both.{{cn|date=February 2016}} The lore and mythology of [[ancient Greece]] was replete with sacred and storied springs—notably, the [[Corycian nymphs|Corycian]], [[Pierian Spring|Pierian]] and [[Castalian Spring|Castalian]]. In medieval Europe, holy wells were frequently pagan sacred sites that later became [[Christianization|Christianized]]. The term "holy well" is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in local [[folklore]]. This can take the form of a particular name, an associated [[legend]], the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the [[numen|numinous]] presence of its guardian spirit or Christian saint, or a ceremony or ritual centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the spring water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the [[hagiography]] of Celtic saints.

A '''statistical hypothesis''', sometimes called '''confirmatory data analysis''', is an [[hypothesis]] that is testable on the basis of [[Observable variable|observing]] a process that is [[statistical model|modeled]] via a set of [[random variable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart A., Ord K., Arnold S. (1999), ''Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics: Volume&amp;nbsp;2A&amp;mdash;Classical Inference &amp; the Linear Model'' ([[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Arnold]]) &amp;sect;20.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  A '''statistical hypothesis test''' is a method of [[statistical inference]]. Commonly, two statistical data sets are compared, or a data set obtained by sampling is compared against a synthetic data set from an idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, and this is compared as an [[alternative hypothesis|alternative]] to an idealized null hypothesis that proposes no relationship between two data sets. The comparison is deemed ''[[statistically significant]]'' if the relationship between the data sets would be an unlikely realization of the [[null hypothesis]] according to a threshold probability&amp;mdash;the significance level. Hypothesis tests are used in determining what outcomes of a study would lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis for a pre-specified level of significance. The process of distinguishing between the null hypothesis and the [[alternative hypothesis]] is aided by identifying two conceptual types of errors. The first type occurs when the null hypothesis is falsely rejected. The second type of error occurs when the null hypothesis is falsely assumed to be true ([[Type I and type II errors|type 1 and type 2 errors]]). By specifying a threshold probability ('alpha') on, e.g., the admissible risk of making a type 1 error, the statistical decision process can be controlled.

An alternative framework for statistical hypothesis testing is to specify a set of [[statistical model]]s, one for each candidate hypothesis, and then use [[model selection]] techniques to choose the most appropriate model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Burnham |first=K. P. |last2=Anderson |first2=D. R. |year=2002 |title=Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach |edition=2nd |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=0-387-95364-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common selection techniques are based on either [[Akaike information criterion]] or [[Bayes factor]].

Confirmatory data analysis can be contrasted with [[exploratory data analysis]], which may not have pre-specified hypotheses.

== Variations and sub-classes ==

Statistical hypothesis testing is a key technique of both [[frequentist inference]] and [[Bayesian inference]], although the two types of inference have notable differences. Statistical hypothesis tests define a procedure that controls (fixes) the probability of incorrectly ''deciding'' that a default position ([[null hypothesis]]) is incorrect. The procedure is based on how likely it would be for a set of observations to occur if the null hypothesis were true. Note that this probability of making an incorrect decision is ''not'' the probability that the null hypothesis is true, nor whether any specific alternative hypothesis is true. This contrasts with other possible techniques of [[decision theory]] in which the null and [[alternative hypothesis]] are treated on a more equal basis.

One naïve [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] approach to hypothesis testing is to base decisions on the [[posterior probability]],&lt;ref&gt;Schervish, M (1996) ''Theory of Statistics'', p. 218. Springer {{isbn|0-387-94546-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence|publisher=West National Academies Press|chapter=Reference Guide on Statistics|first1=David H.|last1=Kaye|first2=David A.|last2=Freedman|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13163&amp;page=211|location=Eagan, MN Washington, D.C|year=2011|edition=3rd|page=259|isbn=978-0-309-21421-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this fails when comparing point and continuous hypotheses. Other approaches to decision making, such as [[Bayesian decision theory]], attempt to balance the consequences of incorrect decisions across all possibilities, rather than concentrating on a single null hypothesis. A number of other approaches to reaching a decision based on data are available via [[decision theory]] and [[optimal decision]]s, some of which have desirable properties. Hypothesis testing, though, is a dominant approach to data analysis in many fields of science. Extensions to the theory of hypothesis testing include the study of the [[statistical power|power]] of tests, i.e. the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is false. Such considerations can be used for the purpose of [[sample size determination]] prior to the collection of data.

==The testing process==
In the statistics literature, statistical hypothesis testing plays a fundamental role.&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; The usual line of reasoning is as follows:
# There is an initial research hypothesis of which the truth is unknown.
# The first step is to state the relevant '''null''' and '''alternative hypotheses'''. This is important, as mis-stating the hypotheses will muddy the rest of the process. 
# The second step is to consider the [[statistical assumption]]s being made about the sample in doing the test; for example, assumptions about the [[statistical independence]] or about the form of the distributions of the observations. This is equally important as invalid assumptions will mean that the results of the test are invalid.
# Decide which test is appropriate, and state the relevant '''[[test statistic]]''' &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt;.
# Derive the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis from the assumptions. In standard cases this will be a well-known result. For example, the test statistic might follow a [[Student's t distribution]] or a [[normal distribution]].
# Select a significance level (''α''), a probability threshold below which the null hypothesis will be rejected. Common values are 5% and 1%.
# The distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis partitions the possible values of &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; into those for which the null hypothesis is rejected&amp;mdash;the so-called ''critical region''&amp;mdash;and those for which it is not. The probability of the critical region is ''α''.
# Compute from the observations the observed value &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; of the test statistic &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt;.
# Decide to either reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative or not reject it. The decision rule is to reject the null hypothesis &lt;var&gt;H&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if the observed value &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; is in the critical region, and to accept or "fail to reject" the hypothesis otherwise.

An alternative process is commonly used:
# Compute from the observations the observed value &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; of the test statistic &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt;.
# Calculate the [[p-value]]. This is the probability, under the null hypothesis, of sampling a test statistic at least as extreme as that which was observed.
# Reject the null hypothesis, in favor of the alternative hypothesis, if and only if the p-value is less than the significance level (the selected probability) threshold.

The two processes are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Triola|first=Mario|title=Elementary statistics|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston|year=2001|isbn=0-201-61477-4|edition=8|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former process was advantageous in the past when only tables of test statistics at common probability thresholds were available. It allowed a decision to be made without the calculation of a probability. It was adequate for classwork and for operational use, but it was deficient for reporting results.

The latter process relied on extensive tables or on computational support not always available. The explicit calculation of a
probability is useful for reporting. The calculations are now trivially performed with appropriate software.

The difference in the two processes applied to the Radioactive suitcase example (below):
* "The Geiger-counter reading is 10. The limit is 9. Check the suitcase."
* "The Geiger-counter reading is high; 97% of safe suitcases have lower readings. The limit is 95%. Check the suitcase."
The former report is adequate, the latter gives a more detailed explanation of the data and the reason why the suitcase is being checked.

It is important to note the difference between accepting the null hypothesis and simply failing to reject it. The "fail to reject" terminology highlights the fact that the null hypothesis is assumed to be true from the start of the test; if there is a lack of evidence against it, it simply continues to be assumed true. The phrase "accept the null hypothesis" may suggest it has been proved simply because it has not been disproved, a logical [[fallacy]] known as the [[argument from ignorance]]. Unless a test with particularly high [[Statistical power|power]] is used, the idea of "accepting" the null hypothesis may be dangerous. Nonetheless the terminology is prevalent throughout statistics, where the meaning actually intended is well understood.

The processes described here are perfectly adequate for computation. They seriously neglect the [[design of experiments]] considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hinkelmann, Klaus and [[Oscar Kempthorne|Kempthorne, Oscar]]|year=2008|title=Design and Analysis of Experiments|volume=I and II|edition=Second|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-38551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montgomery|first=Douglas|title=Design and analysis of experiments|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|year=2009|isbn=978-0-470-12866-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is particularly critical that appropriate sample sizes be estimated before conducting the experiment.

The phrase "test of significance" was coined by statistician [[Ronald Fisher]].&lt;ref name="Fisher1925"&gt;R. A. Fisher (1925).''Statistical Methods for Research Workers'', Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, 1925, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===
The ''p''-value is the probability that a given result (or a more significant result) would occur under the null hypothesis. For example, say that a fair coin is tested for fairness (the null hypothesis). At a significance level of 0.05, the fair coin would be expected to (incorrectly) reject the null hypothesis in about 1 out of every 20 tests. The ''p''-value does not provide the probability that either hypothesis is correct (a common source of confusion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nuzzo|first=Regina|date=2014|title=Scientific method: Statistical errors|url=|journal=Nature|volume=506|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the ''p''-value is less than the chosen significance threshold (equivalently, if the observed test statistic is in the
critical region), then we say the null hypothesis is rejected at the chosen level of significance. Rejection of the null hypothesis is a conclusion. This is like a "guilty" verdict in a criminal trial: the evidence is sufficient to reject innocence, thus proving guilt. We might accept the alternative hypothesis (and the research hypothesis).

If the ''p''-value is ''not'' less than the chosen significance threshold (equivalently, if the observed test statistic is outside the critical region), then the evidence is insufficient to support a conclusion. (This is similar to a "not guilty" verdict.) The researcher typically gives extra consideration to those cases where the ''p''-value is close to the significance level.

Some people find it helpful to think of the hypothesis testing framework as analogous to a mathematical [[proof by contradiction]].&lt;ref name="Siegrist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegrist|first1=Kyle|title=Hypothesis Testing - Introduction|url=http://www.randomservices.org/random/hypothesis/Introduction.html|website=www.randomservices.org|accessdate=8 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Lady tasting tea example (below), Fisher required the Lady to properly categorize all of the cups of tea to justify the conclusion that the result was unlikely to result from chance. His test revealed that if the lady was effectively guessing at random (the null hypothesis), there was a 1.4% chance that the observed results (perfectly ordered tea) would occur.

Whether rejection of the null hypothesis truly justifies acceptance of the research hypothesis depends on the structure of the hypotheses. Rejecting the hypothesis that a large paw print originated from a bear does not immediately prove the existence of [[Bigfoot]]. Hypothesis testing emphasizes the rejection, which is based on a probability, rather than the acceptance, which requires extra steps of logic.

"The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is a function of five factors: whether the test is one- or two tailed, the level of significance, the standard deviation, the amount of deviation from the null hypothesis, and the number of observations."&lt;ref name=bakan66&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors are a source of criticism; factors under the control of the experimenter/analyst give the results an appearance of subjectivity.

===Use and importance===
Statistics are helpful in analyzing most collections of data. This is equally true of hypothesis testing which can justify conclusions even when no scientific theory exists. In the Lady tasting tea example, it was "obvious" that no difference existed between (milk poured into tea) and (tea poured into milk). The data contradicted the "obvious".

Real world applications of hypothesis testing include:&lt;ref name=larsen&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard J. Larsen |author2=Donna Fox Stroup |title=Statistics in the Real World: a book of examples|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0023677205|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Testing whether more men than women suffer from nightmares
* Establishing authorship of documents
* Evaluating the effect of the full moon on behavior
* Determining the range at which a bat can detect an insect by echo
* Deciding whether hospital carpeting results in more infections
* Selecting the best means to stop smoking
* Checking whether bumper stickers reflect car owner behavior
* Testing the claims of handwriting analysts

Statistical hypothesis testing plays an important role in the whole of statistics and in [[statistical inference]]. For example, Lehmann (1992) in a review of the fundamental paper by Neyman and Pearson (1933) says: "Nevertheless, despite their shortcomings, the new paradigm formulated in the 1933 paper, and the many developments carried out within its framework continue to play a central role in both the theory and practice of statistics and can be expected to do so in the foreseeable future".

Significance testing has been the favored statistical tool in some experimental social sciences (over 90% of articles in the ''Journal of Applied Psychology'' during the early 1990s).&lt;ref name=hubbard&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hubbard, R. |author2=Parsa, A. R. |author3=Luthy, M. R. |title=The Spread of Statistical Significance Testing in Psychology: The Case of the Journal of Applied Psychology |journal=Theory and Psychology |volume=7 |pages=545–554 |year=1997|doi=10.1177/0959354397074006 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fields have favored the estimation of parameters (e.g., [[effect size]]). Significance testing is used as a substitute for the traditional comparison of predicted value and experimental result at the core of the [[scientific method]]. When theory is only capable of predicting the sign of a relationship, a directional (one-sided) hypothesis test can be configured so that only a statistically significant result supports theory. This form of theory appraisal is the most heavily criticized application of hypothesis testing.

===Cautions===
"If the government required statistical procedures to carry warning labels like those on drugs, most inference methods would have long labels indeed."&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=David|title=Introduction to the Practice of Statistics|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Co|location=New York|year=2003|page=426|isbn=9780716796572}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caution applies to hypothesis tests and alternatives to them.

The successful hypothesis test is associated with a probability and a type-I error rate. The conclusion ''might'' be wrong.

The conclusion of the test is only as solid as the sample upon which it is based. The design of the experiment is critical. A number of unexpected effects have been observed including:
* The [[clever Hans effect]]. A horse appeared to be capable of doing simple arithmetic.
* The [[Hawthorne effect]]. Industrial workers were more productive in better illumination, and most productive in worse.
* The [[placebo effect]]. Pills with no medically active ingredients were remarkably effective.
A statistical analysis of misleading data produces misleading conclusions. The issue of data quality can be more subtle. In [[forecasting]] for example, there is no agreement on a measure of forecast accuracy. In the absence of a consensus measurement, no decision based on measurements will be without controversy.

testing, but its cautions are applicable, including: Many claims are made on the basis of samples too small to convince. If a report does not mention sample size, be doubtful.

Hypothesis testing acts as a filter of statistical conclusions; only those results meeting a probability threshold are publishable. Economics also acts as a publication filter; only those results favorable to the author and funding source may be submitted for publication. The impact of filtering on publication is termed [[publication bias]]. A related problem is that of [[multiple testing]] (sometimes linked to [[data mining]]), in which a variety of tests for a variety of possible effects are applied to a single data set and only those yielding a significant result are reported. These are often dealt with by using multiplicity correction procedures that control the [[family wise error rate]] (FWER) or the [[false discovery rate]] (FDR).

Those making critical decisions based on the results of a hypothesis test are prudent to look at the details rather than the conclusion alone. In the physical sciences most results are fully accepted only when independently confirmed. The general advice concerning statistics is, "Figures never lie, but liars figure" (anonymous).

===Human sex ratio===
{{main|Human sex ratio}}
The earliest use of statistical hypothesis testing is generally credited to the question of whether male and female births are equally likely (null hypothesis), which was addressed in the 1700s by [[John Arbuthnot]] (1710),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John Arbuthnot |title=An argument for Divine Providence, taken from the constant regularity observed in the births of both sexes|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] | volume=27| pages=186–190 | year=1710 | url=http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/arbuthnot.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1098/rstl.1710.0011|issue=325–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1770s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Descent of Human Sex Ratio at Birth |first1=Éric |last1=Brian |first2=Marie |last2=Jaisson |chapter=Physico-Theology and Mathematics (1710–1794) |pages=1–25 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer Science &amp;amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-6036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbuthnot examined birth records in London for each of the 82 years from 1629 to 1710, and applied the [[sign test]], a simple [[non-parametric test]].&lt;ref name="Conover1999"&gt;{{Citation

===Lady tasting tea===
{{main|Lady tasting tea}}

In a famous example of hypothesis testing, known as the ''Lady tasting tea'',&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;{{cite book|first=Sir Ronald A.|last=Fisher|authorlink=Ronald Fisher|chapter=Mathematics of a Lady Tasting Tea|origyear=1935|year=1956|title=The World of Mathematics, volume 3|editor=James Roy Newman|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oKZwtLQTmNAC&amp;pg=PA1512&amp;dq=%22mathematics+of+a+lady+tasting+tea%22|trans-title=Design of Experiments|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-41151-4}} Originally from Fisher's book ''Design of Experiments''.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Muriel Bristol]], a female colleague of Fisher claimed to be able to tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance. The null hypothesis was that the Lady had no such ability. The test statistic was a simple count of the number of successes in selecting the 4 cups. The critical region was the single case of 4 successes of 4 possible based on a conventional probability criterion (&lt;&amp;nbsp;5%). A pattern of 4 successes corresponds to 1 out of 70 possible combinations (p≈&amp;nbsp;1.4%). Fisher asserted that no alternative hypothesis was (ever) required. The lady correctly identified every cup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Box|first=Joan Fisher|title=R.A. Fisher, The Life of a Scientist|year=1978|location=New York|publisher=Wiley|page=134|isbn=0-471-09300-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be considered a statistically significant result.

===Courtroom trial===
A statistical test procedure is comparable to a criminal [[trial (law)|trial]]; a defendant is considered not guilty as long as his or her guilt is not proven. The prosecutor tries to prove the guilt of the defendant. Only when there is enough evidence for the prosecution is the defendant convicted.

In the start of the procedure, there are two hypotheses &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;: "the defendant is not guilty", and &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;: "the defendant is guilty". The first one, &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, is called the ''[[null hypothesis]]'', and is for the time being accepted. The second one, &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;, is called the ''alternative hypothesis''. It is the alternative hypothesis that one hopes to support.

The hypothesis of innocence is only rejected when an error is very unlikely, because one doesn't want to convict an innocent defendant. Such an error is called ''[[error of the first kind]]'' (i.e., the conviction of an innocent person), and the occurrence of this error is controlled to be rare. As a consequence of this asymmetric behaviour, an ''[[error of the second kind]]'' (acquitting a person who committed the crime), is more common.

A criminal trial can be regarded as either or both of two decision processes: guilty vs not guilty or evidence vs a threshold ("beyond a reasonable doubt"). In one view, the defendant is judged; in the other view the performance of the prosecution (which bears the burden of proof) is judged. A hypothesis test can be regarded as either a judgment of a hypothesis or as a judgment of evidence.

===Philosopher's beans===
The following example was produced by a philosopher describing scientific methods generations before hypothesis testing was
formalized and popularized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. S. Peirce|date=August 1878|title=Illustrations of the Logic of Science VI: Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis|journal=Popular Science Monthly|volume=13|accessdate=March 30, 2012|url=http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?oldid=3592335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Few beans of this handful are white.&lt;br /&gt;
Most beans in this bag are white.&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore: Probably, these beans were taken from another bag.&lt;br /&gt;
This is an hypothetical inference.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The beans in the bag are the population. The handful are the sample. The null hypothesis is that the sample originated from the population. The criterion for rejecting the null-hypothesis is the "obvious" difference in appearance (an informal difference in the mean). The interesting result is that consideration of a real population and a real sample produced an imaginary bag. The philosopher was considering logic rather than probability. To be a real statistical hypothesis test, this example requires the formalities of a probability calculation and a comparison of that probability to a standard.

A simple generalization of the example considers a mixed bag of beans and a handful that contain either very few or very many white beans. The generalization considers both extremes. It requires more calculations and more comparisons to arrive at a formal answer, but the core philosophy is unchanged; If the composition of the handful is greatly different from that of the bag, then the sample probably originated from another bag. The original example is termed a one-sided or a one-tailed test while the generalization is termed a two-sided or two-tailed test.

The statement also relies on the inference that the sampling was random.  If someone had been picking through the bag to find white beans, then it would explain why the handful had so many white beans, and also explain why the number of white beans in the bag was depleted (although the bag is probably intended to be assumed much larger than one's hand).

===Clairvoyant card game===
A person (the subject) is tested for [[clairvoyance]]. They are shown the reverse of a randomly chosen playing card 25 times and asked which of the four [[Suit (cards)|suits]] it belongs to. The number of hits, or correct answers, is called ''X''.

As we try to find evidence of their clairvoyance, for the time being the null hypothesis is that the person is not clairvoyant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaynes|first1=E. T.|title=Probability theory : the logic of science|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-521-59271-0|edition=5. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative is: the person is (more or less) clairvoyant.

If the null hypothesis is valid, the only thing the test person can do is guess. For every card, the probability (relative frequency) of any single suit appearing is 1/4. If the alternative is valid, the test subject will predict the suit correctly with probability greater than 1/4. We will call the probability of guessing correctly ''p''. The hypotheses, then, are:
* null hypothesis &lt;math&gt;\text{:} \qquad H_0: p = \tfrac 14&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(just guessing)
and
* alternative hypothesis &lt;math&gt;\text{:} H_1: p &gt; \tfrac 14&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(true clairvoyant).

When the test subject correctly predicts all 25 cards, we will consider them clairvoyant, and reject the null hypothesis. Thus also with 24 or 23 hits. With only 5 or 6 hits, on the other hand, there is no cause to consider them so. But what about 12 hits, or 17 hits? What is the critical number, ''c'', of hits, at which point we consider the subject to be clairvoyant? How do we determine the critical value ''c''? With the choice ''c''=25 (i.e. we only accept clairvoyance when all cards are predicted correctly) we're more critical than with ''c''=10. In the first case almost no test subjects will be recognized to be clairvoyant, in the second case, a certain number will pass the test. In practice, one decides how critical one will be. That is, one decides how often one accepts an error of the first kind – a [[false positive]], or Type I error. With ''c'' = 25 the probability of such an error is:

:&lt;math&gt;P(\text{reject }H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ is valid}) = P(X = 25\mid p=\tfrac 14)=\left(\tfrac 14\right)^{25}\approx10^{-15},&lt;/math&gt;

and hence, very small. The probability of a false positive is the probability of randomly guessing correctly all 25 times.

Being less critical, with ''c''=10, gives:

:&lt;math&gt;P(\text{reject }H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ is valid}) = P(X \ge 10|p=\tfrac 14) =\sum_{k=10}^{25}P(X=k\mid p=\tfrac 14)\approx 0{.}07.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, ''c'' = 10 yields a much greater probability of false positive.

Before the test is actually performed, the maximum acceptable probability of a Type I error (''α'') is determined. Typically, values in the range of 1% to 5% are selected. (If the maximum acceptable error rate is zero, an infinite number of correct guesses is required.) Depending on this Type 1 error rate, the critical value ''c'' is calculated. For example, if we select an error rate of 1%, ''c'' is calculated thus:

:&lt;math&gt;P(\text{reject }H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ is valid}) = P(X \ge c\mid p=\tfrac 14) \le 0{.}01.&lt;/math&gt;

From all the numbers c, with this property, we choose the smallest, in order to minimize the probability of a Type II error, a [[false negative]]. For the above example, we select: &lt;math&gt;c=13&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--
But what if the subject did not guess any cards at all? Having zero correct answers is clearly an oddity too. Without any clairvoyant skills the probability.

:&lt;math&gt;P(X=0 \mid H_0 \text{ is valid}) = P(X = 0\mid p=\tfrac 14) =(1-\tfrac 14)^{25} \approx 0{.}00075.&lt;/math&gt;

This is highly unlikely (less than 1 in a 1000 chance). While the subject can't guess the cards correctly, dismissing H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in favour of H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would be an error. In fact, the result would suggest a trait on the subject's part of avoiding calling the correct card. A test of this could be formulated: for a selected 1% error rate the subject would have to answer correctly at least twice, for us to believe that card calling is based purely on guessing. --&gt;

===Radioactive suitcase===
As an example, consider determining whether a suitcase contains some radioactive material. Placed under a [[Geiger counter]], it produces 10 counts per minute. The null hypothesis is that no radioactive material is in the suitcase and that all measured counts are due to ambient radioactivity typical of the surrounding air and harmless objects. We can then calculate how likely it is that we would observe 10 counts per minute if the null hypothesis were true. If the null hypothesis predicts (say) on average 9 counts per minute, then according to the [[Poisson distribution]] typical for [[radioactive decay]] there is about 41% chance of recording 10 or more counts. Thus we can say that the suitcase is compatible with the null hypothesis (this does not guarantee that there is no radioactive material, just that we don't have enough evidence to suggest there is). On the other hand, if the null hypothesis predicts 3 counts per minute (for which the Poisson distribution predicts only 0.1% chance of recording 10 or more counts) then the suitcase is not compatible with the null hypothesis, and there are likely other factors responsible to produce the measurements.

The test does not directly assert the presence of radioactive material. A ''successful'' test asserts that the claim of no radioactive material present is unlikely given the reading (and therefore ...). The double negative (disproving the null hypothesis) of the method is confusing, but using a counter-example to disprove is standard mathematical practice. The attraction of the method is its practicality. We know (from experience) the expected range of counts with only ambient radioactivity present, so we can say that a measurement is ''unusually'' large. Statistics just formalizes the intuitive by using numbers instead of adjectives. We probably do not know the characteristics of the radioactive suitcases; We just assume
that they produce larger readings.

To slightly formalize intuition: radioactivity is suspected if the Geiger-count with the suitcase is among or exceeds the greatest (5% or 1%) of the Geiger-counts made with ambient radiation alone. This makes no assumptions about the distribution of counts. Many ambient radiation observations are required to obtain good probability estimates for rare events.

The test described here is more fully the null-hypothesis statistical significance test. The null hypothesis represents what we would believe by default, before seeing any evidence. [[Statistical significance]] is a possible finding of the test, declared when the observed [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] is unlikely to have occurred by chance if the null hypothesis were true. The name of the test describes its formulation and its possible outcome. One characteristic of the test is its crisp decision: to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. A calculated value is compared to a threshold, which is determined from the tolerable risk of error.

==Definition of terms==
The following definitions are mainly based on the exposition in the book by Lehmann and Romano:&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite book|title=Testing Statistical Hypotheses|edition=3E|isbn=0-387-98864-5|last1=Lehmann|first1=E.

; Statistical hypothesis : A statement about the parameters describing a population (not a sample).
; Statistic : A value calculated from a sample, often to summarize the sample for comparison purposes.
; Simple hypothesis : Any hypothesis which specifies the population distribution completely.
; Composite hypothesis : Any hypothesis which does ''not'' specify the population distribution completely.
; [[Null hypothesis]] (H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) : A hypothesis associated with a contradiction to a theory one would like to prove.
; [[Alternative hypothesis]] (H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) : A hypothesis (often composite) associated with a theory one would like to prove.
; Statistical test : A procedure whose inputs are samples and whose result is a hypothesis.
; Region of acceptance : The set of values of the test statistic for which we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
; Region of rejection / Critical region: The set of values of the test statistic for which the null hypothesis is rejected.
; [[Critical value#Statistics|Critical value]]: The threshold value delimiting the regions of acceptance and rejection for the test statistic.
; [[statistical power|Power of a test]] (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''β''): The test's probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis. The complement of the [[false negative]] rate, ''β''. Power is termed '''sensitivity''' in [[biostatistics]]. ("This is a sensitive test. Because the result is negative, we can confidently say that the patient does not have the condition.") See [[sensitivity and specificity]] and [[Type I and type II errors]] for exhaustive definitions.
; [[Size (statistics)|Size]]: For simple hypotheses, this is the test's probability of ''incorrectly'' rejecting the null hypothesis. The [[false positive]] rate. For composite hypotheses this is the supremum of the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis over all cases covered by the null hypothesis. The complement of the false positive rate is termed '''specificity''' in [[biostatistics]]. ("This is a specific test. Because the result is positive, we can confidently say that the patient has the condition.") See [[sensitivity and specificity]] and [[Type I and type II errors]] for exhaustive definitions.
; Significance level of a test (''α''): It is the upper bound imposed on the size of a test. Its value is chosen by the statistician prior to looking at the data or choosing any particular test to be used. It is the maximum exposure to erroneously rejecting H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; he/she is ready to accept. Testing H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; at significance level ''α'' means testing H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with a test whose size does not exceed ''α''. In most cases, one uses tests whose size is equal to the significance level. 
; [[p-value]]: The probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic.
; [[Statistical significance]] test : A predecessor to the statistical hypothesis test (see the Origins section). An experimental result was said to be statistically significant if a sample was sufficiently inconsistent with the (null) hypothesis. This was variously considered common sense, a pragmatic heuristic for identifying meaningful experimental results, a convention establishing a threshold of statistical evidence or a method for drawing conclusions from data. The statistical hypothesis test added mathematical rigor and philosophical consistency to the concept by making the alternative hypothesis explicit. The term is loosely used to describe the modern version which is now part of statistical hypothesis testing.
; Conservative test : A test is conservative if, when constructed for a given nominal significance level, the true probability of ''incorrectly'' rejecting the null hypothesis is never greater than the nominal level.
; [[Exact test]]: A test in which the significance level or critical value can be computed exactly, i.e., without any approximation. In some contexts this term is restricted to tests applied to [[categorical data]] and to [[permutation tests]], in which computations are carried out by complete enumeration of all possible outcomes and their probabilities.

A statistical hypothesis test compares a test statistic (''z'' or ''t'' for examples) to a threshold. The test statistic (the formula found in the table below) is based on optimality. For a fixed level of Type I error rate, use of these statistics minimizes Type II error rates (equivalent to maximizing power). The following terms describe tests in terms of such optimality:

; Most powerful test: For a given ''size'' or ''significance level'', the test with the greatest power (probability of rejection) for a given value of the parameter(s) being tested, contained in the alternative hypothesis.
; [[Uniformly most powerful test]] (UMP): A test with the greatest ''power'' for all values of the parameter(s) being tested, contained in the alternative hypothesis.

===Early use===
While hypothesis testing was popularized early in the 20th century, early forms were used in the 1700s. The first use is credited to [[John Arbuthnot]] (1710),&lt;ref name="Bellhouse2001"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1770s), in analyzing the [[human sex ratio]] at birth; see {{slink||Human sex ratio}}.

===Modern origins and early controversy===
Modern significance testing is largely the product of [[Karl Pearson]] ([[p-value]], [[Pearson's chi-squared test]]), [[William Sealy Gosset]] ([[Student's t-distribution]]), and [[Ronald Fisher]] ("[[null hypothesis]]", [[analysis of variance]], "[[statistical significance|significance test]]"), while hypothesis testing was developed by [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]] (son of Karl). Ronald Fisher began his life in statistics as a Bayesian (Zabell 1992), but Fisher soon grew disenchanted with the subjectivity involved (namely use of the [[principle of indifference]] when determining prior probabilities), and sought to provide a more "objective" approach to inductive inference.&lt;ref name="ftp.isds.duke"&gt;Raymond Hubbard, [[M. J. Bayarri]], ''[http://ftp.isds.duke.edu/WorkingPapers/03-26.pdf P Values are not Error Probabilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904000350/http://ftp.isds.duke.edu/WorkingPapers/03-26.pdf |date=September 4, 2013 }}''. A working paper that explains the difference between Fisher's evidential p-value and the Neyman–Pearson Type I error rate &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher was an agricultural statistician who emphasized rigorous experimental design and methods to extract a result from few samples assuming Gaussian distributions. Neyman (who teamed with the younger Pearson) emphasized mathematical rigor and methods to obtain more results from many samples and a wider range of distributions. Modern hypothesis testing is an inconsistent hybrid of the Fisher vs Neyman/Pearson formulation, methods and terminology developed in the early 20th century.

Fisher popularized the "significance test". He required a null-hypothesis (corresponding to a population frequency distribution) and a sample. His (now familiar) calculations determined whether to reject the null-hypothesis or not. Significance testing did not utilize an alternative hypothesis so there was no concept of a Type II error.

The p-value was devised as an informal, but objective, index meant to help a researcher determine (based on other knowledge) whether to modify future experiments or strengthen one's [[Fiducial inference|faith]] in the null hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Fisher 1955 69–78"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=R|title=Statistical Methods and Scientific Induction|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B|year=1955 |volume=17|issue=1|pages=69–78|url=http://www.phil.vt.edu/dmayo/PhilStatistics/Triad/Fisher%201955.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypothesis testing (and Type I/II errors) was devised by Neyman and Pearson as a more objective alternative to Fisher's p-value, also meant to determine researcher behaviour, but without requiring any inductive inference by the researcher.&lt;ref name="Neyman 289–337"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neyman|first=J|title=On the Problem of the most Efficient Tests of Statistical Hypotheses|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]]|date=January 1, 1933|volume=231|issue=694–706|pages=289–337|doi=10.1098/rsta.1933.0009|last2=Pearson|first2=E.

Neyman &amp; Pearson considered a different problem (which they called "hypothesis testing"). They initially considered two simple hypotheses (both with frequency distributions). They calculated two probabilities and typically selected the hypothesis associated with the higher probability (the hypothesis more likely to have generated the sample). Their method always selected a hypothesis. It also allowed the calculation of both types of error probabilities.

Fisher and Neyman/Pearson clashed bitterly. Neyman/Pearson considered their formulation to be an improved generalization of significance testing.(The defining paper&lt;ref name="Neyman 289–337"/&gt; was [[Neyman–Pearson lemma|abstract]]. Mathematicians have generalized and refined the theory for decades.&lt;ref name="Lehmann93" /&gt;) Fisher thought that it was not applicable to scientific research because often, during the course of the experiment, it is discovered that the initial assumptions about the null hypothesis are questionable due to unexpected sources of error. He believed that the use of rigid reject/accept decisions based on models formulated before data is collected was incompatible with this common scenario faced by scientists and attempts to apply this method to scientific research would lead to mass confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=R N|title=The Nature of Probability|journal=Centennial Review|year=1958|volume=2|pages=261–274|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/fisher272.pdf}}"We are quite in danger of sending highly trained and highly intelligent young men out into the world with tables of erroneous numbers under their arms, and with a dense fog in the place where their brains ought to be. In this century, of course, they will be working on guided missiles and advising the medical profession on the control of disease, and there is no limit to the extent to which they could impede every sort of national effort."
&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute between Fisher and Neyman–Pearson was waged on philosophical grounds, characterized by a philosopher as a dispute over the proper role of models in statistical inference.&lt;ref name=Lenhard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lenhard|first=Johannes|title=Models and Statistical Inference: The Controversy between Fisher and Neyman–Pearson|journal=Br. J. Philos. Sci.|volume=57|pages=69–91|year=2006|doi=10.1093/bjps/axi152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events intervened: Neyman accepted a position in the western hemisphere, breaking his partnership with Pearson and separating disputants (who had occupied the same building) by much of the planetary diameter. World War II provided an intermission in the debate. The dispute between Fisher and Neyman terminated (unresolved after 27 years) with Fisher's death in 1962. Neyman wrote a well-regarded eulogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neyman|first1=Jerzy|title=RA Fisher (1890—1962): An Appreciation.|journal=Science|volume=156.3781|pages=1456–1460|year=1967|doi=10.1126/science.156.3781.1456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Neyman's later publications reported p-values and significance levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Losavich|first1=J.

The modern version of hypothesis testing is a hybrid of the two approaches that resulted from confusion by writers of statistical textbooks (as predicted by Fisher) beginning in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Halpin 625–653"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halpin|first=P F|title=Inductive Inference or Inductive Behavior: Fisher and Neyman: Pearson Approaches to Statistical Testing in Psychological Research (1940–1960)|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|date=Winter 2006 |volume=119|issue=4|pages=625–653|jstor=20445367|doi=10.2307/20445367|pmid=17286092|last2=Stam|first2=HJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; (But [[Detection theory|signal detection]], for example, still uses the Neyman/Pearson formulation.) Great conceptual differences and many caveats in addition to those mentioned above were ignored. Neyman and Pearson provided the stronger terminology, the more rigorous mathematics and the more consistent philosophy, but the subject taught today in introductory statistics has more similarities with Fisher's method than theirs.&lt;ref name=Gigerenzer&gt;{{cite book|title=The Empire of Chance: How Probability Changed Science and Everyday Life|last=Gigerenzer|first=Gerd|author2=Zeno Swijtink |author3=Theodore Porter |author4=Lorraine Daston |author5=John Beatty |author6=Lorenz Kruger |year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter=Part 3: The Inference Experts|isbn=978-0-521-39838-1|pages=70–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; This history explains the inconsistent terminology (example: the null hypothesis is never accepted, but there is a region of acceptance).

Sometime around 1940,&lt;ref name="Halpin 625–653" /&gt; in an apparent effort to provide researchers with a "non-controversial"&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer 587–606"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gigerenzer|first=G|title=Mindless statistics|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|date=November 2004|volume=33|issue=5|pages=587–606|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2004.09.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; way to [[Have one's cake and eat it too|have their cake and eat it too]], the authors of statistical text books began anonymously combining these two strategies by using the p-value in place of the [[test statistic]] (or data) to test against the Neyman–Pearson "significance level".&lt;ref name="Halpin 625–653"/&gt; Thus, researchers were encouraged to infer the strength of their data against some [[null hypothesis]] using p-values, while also thinking they are retaining the post-data collection [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] provided by hypothesis testing. It then became customary for the null hypothesis, which was originally some realistic research hypothesis, to be used almost solely as a [[strawman]] "nil" hypothesis (one where a treatment has no effect, regardless of the context).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loftus|first=G R|title=On the Tyranny of Hypothesis Testing in the Social Sciences|journal=Contemporary Psychology|year= 1991 |volume=36|issue=2|pages=102–105|url=https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sternh/courses/210/loftus91_tyranny.pdf|doi=10.1037/029395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early choices of null hypothesis===
[[Paul Meehl]] has argued that the [[epistemological]] importance of the choice of null hypothesis has gone largely unacknowledged. When the null hypothesis is predicted by theory, a more precise experiment will be a more severe test of the underlying theory. When the null hypothesis defaults to "no difference" or "no effect", a more precise experiment is a less severe test of the theory that motivated performing the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Meehl| first=P| title=Appraising and Amending Theories: The Strategy of Lakatosian Defense and Two Principles That Warrant It|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=1990| volume=1| issue=2| pages=108–141| url=http://rhowell.ba.ttu.edu/meehl1.pdf| doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0102_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An examination of the origins of the latter practice may therefore be useful:

'''1778:''' [[Pierre Laplace]] compares the birthrates of boys and girls in multiple European cities. He states: "it is natural to conclude that these possibilities are very nearly in the same ratio". Thus Laplace's null hypothesis that the birthrates of boys and girls should be equal given "conventional wisdom".&lt;ref name="Laplace 1778"/&gt;

'''1900:''' [[Karl Pearson]] develops the [[chi squared test]] to determine "whether a given form of frequency curve will effectively describe the samples drawn from a given population." Thus the null hypothesis is that a population is described by some distribution predicted by theory. He uses as an example the numbers of five and sixes in the [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Weldon dice throw data]].&lt;ref name="Pearson 1900"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Pearson| first=K| title= On the criterion that a given system of deviations from the probable in the case of a correlated system of variables is such that it can be reasonably supposed to have arisen from random sampling|year=1900| journal= Philosophical Magazine Series| volume=5| issue=50| pages=157–175| url=http://www.economics.soton.ac.uk/staff/aldrich/1900.pdf | doi=10.1080/14786440009463897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1904:''' [[Karl Pearson]] develops the concept of "[[contingency table|contingency]]" in order to determine whether outcomes are [[statistical independence|independent]] of a given categorical factor. Here the null hypothesis is by default that two things are unrelated (e.g. scar formation and death rates from smallpox).&lt;ref name="Pearson 1904"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Pearson| first=K| title= On the Theory of Contingency and Its Relation to Association and Normal Correlation|year=1904| journal= Drapers' Company Research Memoirs Biometric Series| volume=1| pages=1–35| url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924003064833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The null hypothesis in this case is no longer predicted by theory or conventional wisdom, but is instead the [[principle of indifference]] that led [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]] and others to dismiss the use of "inverse probabilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Zabell| first=S| title= R. A. Fisher on the History of Inverse Probability|year=1989| journal= Statistical Science| volume=4| issue=3| pages=247–256| jstor=2245634| doi=10.1214/ss/1177012488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Null hypothesis statistical significance testing==
An example of Neyman–Pearson hypothesis testing can be made by a change to the radioactive suitcase example. If the "suitcase" is actually a shielded container for the transportation of radioactive material, then a test might be used to select among three hypotheses: no radioactive source present, one present, two (all) present. The test could be required for safety, with actions required in each case. The [[Neyman–Pearson lemma]] of hypothesis testing says that a good criterion for the selection of hypotheses is the ratio of their probabilities (a [[likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio]]). A simple method of solution is to select the hypothesis with the highest probability for the Geiger counts observed. The typical result matches intuition: few counts imply no source, many counts imply two sources and intermediate counts imply one source. Notice also that usually there are problems for [[Philosophic burden of proof#Proving a negative|proving a negative]]. Null hypotheses should be at least [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]].

Neyman–Pearson theory can accommodate both prior probabilities and the costs of actions resulting from decisions.&lt;ref name="Ash"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ash | first = Robert | title = Basic probability theory | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1970 | isbn = 978-0471034506 }}Section 8.2&lt;/ref&gt; The former allows each test to consider the results of earlier tests (unlike Fisher's significance tests). The latter allows the consideration of economic issues (for example) as well as probabilities. A likelihood ratio remains a good criterion for selecting among hypotheses.

The two forms of hypothesis testing are based on different problem formulations. The original test is analogous to a true/false question; the Neyman–Pearson test is more like multiple choice. In the view of [[John Tukey|Tukey]]&lt;ref name="Tukey60" /&gt; the former produces a conclusion on the basis of only strong evidence while the latter produces a decision on the basis of available evidence. While the two tests seem quite different both mathematically and philosophically, later developments lead to the opposite claim. Consider many tiny radioactive sources. The hypotheses become 0,1,2,3... grains of radioactive sand. There is little distinction between none or some radiation (Fisher) and 0 grains of radioactive sand versus all of the alternatives (Neyman–Pearson). The major Neyman–Pearson paper of 1933&lt;ref name="Neyman 289–337" /&gt; also considered composite hypotheses (ones whose distribution includes an unknown parameter). An example proved the optimality of the (Student's) ''t''-test, "there can be no better test for the hypothesis under consideration" (p 321). Neyman–Pearson theory was proving the optimality of Fisherian methods from its inception.

Fisher's significance testing has proven a popular flexible statistical tool in application with little mathematical growth potential. Neyman–Pearson hypothesis testing is claimed as a pillar of mathematical statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It also stimulated new applications in [[statistical process control]], [[detection theory]], [[decision theory]] and [[game theory]]. Both formulations have been successful, but the successes have been of a different character.

The dispute over formulations is unresolved. Science primarily uses Fisher's (slightly modified) formulation as taught in introductory statistics. Statisticians study Neyman–Pearson theory in graduate school. Mathematicians are proud of uniting the formulations. Philosophers consider them separately. Learned opinions deem the formulations variously competitive (Fisher vs Neyman), incompatible&lt;ref name="ftp.isds.duke" /&gt; or complementary.&lt;ref name="Lehmann93" /&gt; The dispute has become more complex since Bayesian inference has achieved respectability.

The terminology is inconsistent. Hypothesis testing can mean any mixture of two formulations that both changed with time. Any discussion of significance testing vs hypothesis testing is doubly vulnerable to confusion.

Fisher thought that hypothesis testing was a useful strategy for performing industrial quality control, however, he strongly disagreed that hypothesis testing could be useful for scientists.&lt;ref name="Fisher 1955 69–78"/&gt;
Hypothesis testing provides a means of finding test statistics used in significance testing.&lt;ref name="Lehmann93" /&gt; The concept of power is useful in explaining the consequences of adjusting the significance level and is heavily used in [[sample size determination]]. The two methods remain philosophically distinct.&lt;ref name=Lenhard/&gt; They usually (but ''not always'') produce the same mathematical answer.

Much of the criticism can
be summarized by the following issues:
* The interpretation of a ''p''-value is dependent upon stopping rule and definition of multiple comparison. The former often changes during the course of a study and the latter is unavoidably ambiguous. (i.e. "p values depend on both the (data) observed and on the other possible (data) that might have been observed but weren't").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornfield|first=Jerome|title=Recent Methodological Contributions to Clinical Trials| journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=104|issue=4|pages=408–421|year=1976|url=http://www.epidemiology.ch/history/PDF%20bg/Cornfield%20J%201976%20recent%20methodological%20contributions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Confusion resulting (in part) from combining the methods of Fisher and Neyman–Pearson which are conceptually distinct.&lt;ref name="Tukey60"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tukey|first=John W.|title=Conclusions vs decisions|journal=Technometrics|volume=26|issue=4|pages=423–433|year=1960|doi=10.1080/00401706.1960.10489909}} "Until we go through the accounts of testing hypotheses, separating [Neyman–Pearson] decision elements from [Fisher] conclusion elements, the intimate mixture of disparate elements will be a continual source of confusion." ... "There is a place for both "doing one's best" and "saying only what is certain," but it is important to know, in each instance, both which one is being done, and which one ought to be done."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Emphasis on statistical significance to the exclusion of estimation and confirmation by repeated experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yates|first=Frank|title=The Influence of Statistical Methods for Research Workers on the Development of the Science of Statistics|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=46|pages=19–34|year=1951|doi=10.1080/01621459.1951.10500764}} "The emphasis given to formal tests of significance throughout [R.A.

"The emphasis on tests of significance and the consideration of the results of each experiment in isolation, have had the unfortunate consequence that scientific workers have often regarded the execution of a test of significance on an experiment as the ultimate objective."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rigidly requiring statistical significance as a criterion for publication, resulting in [[publication bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Begg|first1=Colin B.|last2=Berlin|first2=Jesse A.|title=Publication bias: a problem in interpreting medical data|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A|pages=419–463|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the criticism is indirect. Rather than being wrong, statistical hypothesis testing is misunderstood, overused and misused.
* When used to detect whether a difference exists between groups, a paradox arises. As improvements are made to experimental design (e.g., increased precision of measurement and sample size), the test becomes more lenient. Unless one accepts the absurd assumption that all sources of noise in the data cancel out completely, the chance of finding statistical significance in either direction approaches 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meehl|first=Paul E.|title=Theory-Testing in Psychology and Physics: A Methodological Paradox|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=34|issue=2|pages=103–115|year=1967|url=http://mres.gmu.edu/pmwiki/uploads/Main/Meehl1967.pdf|doi=10.1086/288135|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010657/http://mres.gmu.edu/pmwiki/uploads/Main/Meehl1967.pdf|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}} Thirty years later, Meehl acknowledged statistical significance theory to be mathematically sound while continuing to question the default choice of null hypothesis, blaming instead the "social scientists' poor understanding of the logical relation between theory and fact" in "The Problem Is Epistemology, Not Statistics: Replace Significance Tests by Confidence Intervals and Quantify Accuracy of Risky Numerical Predictions" (Chapter 14 in Harlow (1997)).&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics and supporters are largely in factual agreement regarding the characteristics of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST): While it can provide critical information, it is ''inadequate as the sole tool for statistical analysis''. ''Successfully rejecting the null hypothesis may offer no support for the research hypothesis.'' The continuing controversy concerns the selection of the best statistical practices for the near-term future given the (often poor) existing practices. Critics would prefer to ban NHST completely, forcing a complete departure from those practices, while supporters suggest a less absolute change.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Controversy over significance testing, and its effects on publication bias in particular, has produced several results. The American Psychological Association has strengthened its statistical reporting requirements after review,&lt;ref name=wilkinson&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilkinson, Leland|title=Statistical Methods in Psychology Journals; Guidelines and Explanations|journal=American Psychologist|volume=54|issue=8|pages=594–604|year=1999|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.8.594}} "Hypothesis tests. It is hard to imagine a situation in which a dichotomous accept-reject decision is better than reporting an actual p value or, better still, a confidence interval." (p 599).

Major organizations have not abandoned use of significance tests although some have discussed doing so.&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt;

==Alternatives==
{{main|Estimation statistics}}
{{See also|Confidence interval#Statistical hypothesis testing}}

The numerous criticisms of significance testing do not lead to a single alternative. A unifying position of critics is that statistics should not lead to a conclusion or a decision but to a probability or to an estimated value with a [[confidence interval]] rather than to an accept-reject decision regarding a particular hypothesis. It is unlikely that the controversy surrounding significance testing will be resolved in the near future. Its supposed flaws and unpopularity do not eliminate the need for an objective and transparent means of reaching conclusions regarding studies that produce statistical results. Critics have not unified around an alternative. Other forms of reporting confidence or uncertainty could probably grow in popularity. One strong critic of significance testing suggested a list of reporting alternatives:&lt;ref name=Armstrong1&gt;{{cite journal|author=Armstrong, J. Scott|title=Significance tests harm progress in forecasting|journal=International Journal of Forecasting|volume=23|pages=321–327|year=2007|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1104&amp;context=marketing_papers|doi=10.1016/j.ijforecast.2007.03.004|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; effect sizes for importance, prediction intervals for confidence, replications and extensions for replicability, meta-analyses for generality. None of these suggested alternatives produces a conclusion/decision. Lehmann said that hypothesis testing theory can be presented in terms of conclusions/decisions, probabilities, or confidence intervals. "The distinction between the ... approaches is largely one of reporting and interpretation."&lt;ref name=Lehmann97&gt;{{cite journal|author=E. L.

On one "alternative" there is no disagreement: Fisher himself said,&lt;ref name=fisher /&gt; "In relation to the test of significance, we may say that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when we know how to conduct an experiment which will rarely fail to give us a statistically significant result." Cohen, an influential critic of significance testing, concurred,&lt;ref name=cohen94&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacob Cohen|title=The Earth Is Round (p &lt; .05)|journal=American Psychologist|volume=49|issue=12|pages=997–1003|date=December 1994|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.49.12.997}} This paper lead to the review of statistical practices by the APA. Cohen was a member of the Task Force that did the review.&lt;/ref&gt; "... don't look for a magic alternative to NHST ''[null hypothesis significance testing]'' ... It doesn't exist." "... given the problems of statistical induction, we must finally rely, as have the older sciences, on replication." The "alternative" to significance testing is repeated testing. The easiest way to decrease statistical uncertainty is by obtaining more data, whether by increased sample size or by repeated tests. Nickerson claimed to have never seen the publication of a literally replicated experiment in psychology.&lt;ref name=nickerson /&gt; An indirect approach to replication is [[meta-analysis]].

[[Bayesian inference]] is one proposed alternative to significance testing. (Nickerson cited 10 sources suggesting it, including Rozeboom (1960)).&lt;ref name="nickerson"/&gt; For example, Bayesian [[parameter estimation]] can provide rich information about the data from which researchers can draw inferences, while using uncertain [[priors]] that exert only minimal influence on the results when enough data is available. Psychologist John K. Kruschke has suggested Bayesian estimation as an alternative for the [[Student's t-test|''t''-test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kruschke|first=J K|title=Bayesian Estimation Supersedes the T Test|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=July 9, 2012 |volume=142|issue=|pages=573–603|doi=10.1037/a0029146|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2012JEPG.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively two competing models/hypothesis can be compared using [[Bayes factors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kass |first=R. E. |title=Bayes factors and model uncertainty |year=1993|url=http://www.stat.washington.edu/research/reports/1993/tr254.pdf |publisher=Department of Statistics, University of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayesian methods could be criticized for requiring information that is seldom available in the cases where significance testing is most heavily used. Neither the prior probabilities nor the probability distribution of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis are often available in the social sciences.&lt;ref name="nickerson"/&gt;

Advocates of a Bayesian approach sometimes claim that the goal of a researcher is most often to [[objectivity (science)|objectively]] assess the [[probability]] that a [[hypothesis]] is true based on the data they have collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rozeboom | first = William W

The author expressed the view that this goal "is not attainable".&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]]'s significance testing, nor [[Neyman–Pearson lemma|Neyman–Pearson]] hypothesis testing can provide this information, and do not claim to. The probability a hypothesis is true can only be derived from use of [[Bayes' Theorem]], which was unsatisfactory to both the Fisher and Neyman–Pearson camps due to the explicit use of [[subjectivity]] in the form of the [[prior probability]].&lt;ref name="Neyman 289–337"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aldrich|first=J|title=R.

==Philosophy==
Hypothesis testing and philosophy intersect. [[Inferential statistics]], which includes hypothesis testing, is applied probability. Both probability and its application are intertwined with philosophy. Philosopher [[David Hume]] wrote, "All knowledge degenerates into probability." Competing practical definitions of [[Probability#Interpretations|probability]] reflect philosophical differences. The most common application of hypothesis testing is in the scientific interpretation of experimental data, which is naturally studied by the [[philosophy of science]].

Fisher and Neyman opposed the subjectivity of probability. Their views contributed to the objective definitions. The core of their historical disagreement was philosophical.

Many of the philosophical criticisms of hypothesis testing are discussed by statisticians in other contexts, particularly [[correlation does not imply causation]] and the [[design of experiments]].
Hypothesis testing is of continuing interest to philosophers.&lt;ref name=Lenhard/&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1093/bjps/axl003"&gt;

==Education==
{{main|Statistics education}}
Statistics is increasingly being taught in schools with hypothesis testing being one of the elements taught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corestandards.org/the-standards/mathematics/hs-statistics-and-probability/introduction/ Mathematics &gt; High School: Statistics &amp; Probability &gt; Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728122912/http://www.corestandards.org/the-standards/mathematics/hs-statistics-and-probability/introduction/ |date=July 28, 2012 }} Common Core State Standards Initiative (relates to USA students)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_stats.html College Board Tests &gt; AP: Subjects &gt; Statistics] The College Board (relates to USA students)&lt;/ref&gt; Many conclusions reported in the popular press (political opinion polls to medical studies) are based on statistics. Some writers have stated that statistical analysis of this kind allows for thinking clearly about problems involving mass data, as well as the effective reporting of trends and inferences from said data, but caution that writers for a broad public should have a solid understanding of the field in order to use the terms and concepts correctly.&lt;ref name=Huff8&gt;{{cite book|last=Huff|first=Darrell|title=How to lie with statistics|publisher=Norton|location=New York|year=1993|isbn=0-393-31072-8|page=8}}'Statistical methods and statistical terms are necessary in reporting the mass data of social and economic trends, business conditions, "opinion" polls, the census.

Such fields as literature and divinity now include findings based on statistical analysis (see the [[Bible Analyzer]]). An introductory statistics class teaches hypothesis testing as a cookbook process. Hypothesis testing is also taught at the postgraduate level. Statisticians learn how to create good statistical test procedures (like ''z'', Student's ''t'', ''F'' and chi-squared). Statistical hypothesis testing is considered a mature area within statistics,&lt;ref name=Lehmann97/&gt; but a limited amount of development continues.

An academic study states that the cookbook method of teaching introductory statistics leaves no time for history, philosophy or controversy. Hypothesis testing has been taught as received unified method. Surveys showed that graduates of the class were filled with philosophical misconceptions (on all aspects of statistical inference) that persisted among instructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sotos|first1=Ana Elisa Castro|last2=Vanhoof|first2=Stijn|last3=Noortgate|first3=Wim Van den|last4=Onghena|first4=Patrick|title=Students' Misconceptions of Statistical Inference: A Review of the Empirical Evidence from Research on Statistics Education|journal=Educational Research Review|volume=2|pages=98–113|year=2007|doi=10.1016/j.edurev.2007.04.001|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/136347/1/CastroSotos.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the problem was addressed more than a decade ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=David S.|title=New Pedagogy and New Content: The Case of Statistics|journal=International Statistical Review|volume=65|pages=123–165|year=1997|doi=10.2307/1403333|url=http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~iase/publications/isr/97.Moore.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and calls for educational reform continue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hubbard |first1=Raymond |last2=Armstrong |first2=J.

'''Stomatitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the mouth and lips.&lt;ref name="Zaoutis 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaoutis|first=[edited by] Jeffrey M. Bergelson, Samir S. Shah, Theoklis E.|title=Pediatric infectious diseases|year=2008|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780323076333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9rT3TcDYNAC&amp;pg=PT361&amp;dq=stomatitis+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=stomatitis%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to any inflammatory process affecting the [[mucous membrane]]s of the mouth and lips, with or without [[oral ulceration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael G. Stewart, Samuel Selesnick (editors)|title=Differential diagnosis in otolaryngology – head and neck surgery|publisher=Thieme|location=New York|isbn=9781604062793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-rSREngtBUC&amp;pg=PT151&amp;dq=stomatitis+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=stomatitis%20definition&amp;f=false|chapter=35|date=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its widest meaning, stomatitis can have a multitude of different causes and appearances. Common causes include infections, nutritional deficiencies, allergic reactions, radiotherapy, and many others.

When inflammation of the gums and the mouth generally presents itself, sometimes the term ''gingivostomatitis'' is used, though this is also sometimes used as a synonym for [[herpetic gingivostomatitis]].

The term is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''stoma'' ({{lang|grc|στόμα}}), meaning "mouth", and the suffix ''-itis'' ({{lang|grc|-ῖτις}}), meaning "inflammation".

==Causes==

===Nutritional deficiency===
[[Malnutrition]] (improper dietary intake) or [[malabsorption]] (poor absorption of nutrients into the body) can lead to [[nutrition disorder|nutritional deficiency states]], several of which can lead to stomatitis. For example, deficiencies of [[iron deficiency|iron]], [[vitamin B2]] (riboflavin),&lt;ref name=Yamada2009 /&gt;{{rp|490}} [[vitamin B3]] (niacin), [[vitamin B6]] (pyridoxine), [[vitamin B9]] (folic acid) or [[vitamin B12]] (cobalamine) may all manifest as stomatitis. Iron is necessary for the upregulation of transcriptional elements for cell replication and repair. Lack of iron can cause genetic downregulation of these elements, leading to ineffective repair and regeneration of epithelial cells, especially in the mouth and lips. Many disorders which cause malabsorption can cause deficiencies, which in turn causes stomatitis. Examples include [[tropical sprue]].&lt;ref name=Yamada2009 &gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Yamada T, Alpers DH |title=Textbook of gastroenterology|year=2009|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-1-4051-6911-0|edition=5th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}}

===Aphthous stomatitis===
{{main article|Aphthous stomatitis}}
Aphthous stomatitis (canker sores) is the recurrent appearance of mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals. The cause is not completely understood, but it is thought that the condition represents a [[T cell]] mediated immune response which is triggered by a variety of factors. The individual ulcers (aphthae) recur periodically and heal completely, although in the more severe forms new ulcers may appear in other parts of the mouth before the old ones have finished healing. Aphthous stomatitis is one of the most common diseases of the oral mucosa, and is thought to affect about 20% of the general population to some degree.&lt;ref name="Neville 2002"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Neville BW, Damm DD, Allen CM, Bouquot JE |title=Oral &amp; maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0721690033|pages=253–284|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms range from a minor nuisance to being disabling in their impact on eating, swallowing and talking, and the severe forms can cause people to lose weight. There is no cure for aphthous stomatitis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brocklehurst|first=P|author2=Tickle, M |author3=Glenny, AM |author4=Lewis, MA |author5=Pemberton, MN |author6=Taylor, J |author7=Walsh, T |author8=Riley, P |author9= Yates, JM  |editor1-last=Brocklehurst|editor1-first=Paul|title=Systemic interventions for recurrent aphthous stomatitis (mouth ulcers).|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Sep 12, 2012|volume=9|pages=CD005411|pmid=22972085|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005411.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therapies are aimed at alleviating the pain, reducing the inflammation and promoting healing of the ulcers, but there is little evidence of efficacy for any treatment that has been used.

=== Angular stomatitis ===

{{main article|Angular cheilitis}}

Inflammation of the corners (angles) of the lips is termed angular stomatitis or angular cheilitis. In children a frequent cause is repeated lip-licking, and in adults it may be a sign of underlying [[iron deficiency anemia]], or [[vitamin B]] deficiencies (''e.g.'', B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-[[riboflavin]], B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;-[[folate]], or [[vitamin B12|B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]]-[[cobalamin]], which in turn may be evidence of poor diets or malnutrition such as [[celiac disease]]).

Also, angular cheilitis can be caused by a patient's jaws at rest being 'overclosed' due to [[edentulous]]ness or [[tooth wear]], causing the jaws to come to rest closer together than if the complete/unaffected [[dentition]] were present. This causes skin folds around the angle of the mouth which are kept moist by saliva, which in turn favours infection; mostly by ''Candida albicans'' or similar species. Treatment usually involves the administration of topical [[nystatin]] or similar [[antifungal medication|antifungal]] agents. Another treatment can be to correct the jaw relationship with dental treatment (''e.g.'', [[denture]]s or [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] adjustment).

===Denture-related stomatitis===
{{main article|Denture-related stomatitis}}
This is a common condition present in [[denture]] wearers. It appears as reddened but painless mucosa beneath the denture. 90% of cases are associated with [[Candida (fungus)|''Candida'' species]], and it is the most common form of [[oral candidiasis]]. Treatment is by [[antifungal medication]] and improved dental hygiene, such as not wearing the denture during sleep.

===Allergic contact stomatitis===
Allergic contact stomatitis (also termed "allergic gingivostomatitis" or "allergic contact gingivostomatitis")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanerva|first=L.|author2=Alanko, K. |author3=Estlander, T. |title=Allergic contact gingivostomatitis from a temporary crown made of methacrylates and epoxy diacrylates|journal=Allergy|date=1 December 1999|volume=54|issue=12|pages=1316–1321|doi=10.1034/j.1398-9995.1999.00074.x|pmid=10688437}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[type IV hypersensitivity|type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity]] reaction that occurs in susceptible [[atopy|atopic]] individuals when [[allergen]]s penetrate the skin or [[mucosa]].&lt;ref name=Glick2003&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Greenberg MS, Glick M |title=Burket's oral medicine diagnosis &amp; treatment|year=2003|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton, Ont.|isbn=1550091867|pages=60, 61|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allergens, which may be different for different individuals, combine with [[epithelial]]-derived [[protein]]s, forming [[hapten]]s which bind with [[Langerhans cell]]s in the mucosa, which in turn present the antigen on their surface to [[T lymphocyte]]s, sensitizing them to that antigen and causing them to produce many specific [[clone (cell biology)|clone]]s. The second time that specific antigen is encountered, an inflammatory reaction is triggered at the site of exposure.&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt; Allergic contact stomatitis is less common than [[allergic contact dermatitis]] because the mouth is coated in saliva, which washes away antigens and acts as a barrier.&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt; The oral mucosa is also more vascular (has a better blood supply) than skin, meaning that any antigens are more quickly removed from the area by the circulation.&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt; Finally, there is substantially less [[keratin]] in [[oral mucosa]], meaning that there is less likelihood that haptens will form.&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt;

===Migratory stomatitis===

{{main article|Geographic tongue}}

Migratory stomatitis (or geographic stomatitis) is an atypical presentation of a condition which normally presents on the tongue, termed geographic tongue. Geographic tongue is so named because there are [[atrophy|atrophic]], [[erythema]]tous areas of [[depapillation]] that migrate over time, giving a map-like appearance.

In migratory stomatitis, other mucosal sites in the mouth, such as the ventral surface (undersurface) of the tongue, buccal mucosa, labial mucosa, soft palate, or floor of mouth may be afflicted with identical lesions, usually in addition to the tongue.&lt;ref name="Bruch 2010"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Treister NS, Bruch JM |title=Clinical oral medicine and pathology|year=2010|publisher=Humana Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60327-519-4|pages=20, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from not being restricted to the tongue, migratory stomatitis is an identical condition in every regard to geographic tongue. Another synonym for geographic tongue which uses the term stomatitis is "stomatitis areata migrans".

===Herpetic gingivostomatitis===
[[File:Stomatitis herpetica.jpg|thumbnail|right|Herpetic stomatitis (herpetic gingivostomatitis)]]
{{main article|Herpetic gingivostomatitis}}
This is inflammation of the mouth caused by [[herpes simplex virus]].

===Irradiation and chemotherapy===
Stomatitis may also be caused by chemotherapy, or radiation therapy of the oropharyngeal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LngD6RFXY_AC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=cause+%22stomatitis%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TQQrU9jUEJCvkAfAjoGwBw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cause%20%22stomatitis%22&amp;f=false |title=Principles and Practice of Palliative Care and Supportive Oncology |publisher= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[mucositis]]'' is sometimes used synonymously with stomatitis, however the former usually refers to mucosal reactions to [[radiotherapy]] or [[chemotherapy]], and may occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and not just in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zeppetella|first=Giovambattista|title=Palliative care in clinical practice|publisher=Springer|location=London|isbn=9781447128434|page=132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S8mJLlnuNcMC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=stomatitis+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=stomatitis%20definition&amp;f=false|date=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necrotizing ulcerative gingivostomatitis===
{{Hatnote|See [[Necrotizing periodontal diseases]]}}
The term ''necrotizing ulcerative gingivostomatitis'' is sometimes used as a synonym of the necrotizing periodontal disease more commonly termed [[necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis]], or a more severe form (also termed necrotizing stomatitis). The term ''necrotizing gingivostomatitis'' is also sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horning|first=GM|title=Necotizing gingivostomatitis: NUG to noma.|journal=Compendium of continuing education in dentistry (Jamesburg, N.J. : 1995)|date=October 1996|volume=17|issue=10|pages=951–4, 956, 957–8 passim; quiz 964|pmid=9533316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palate appears dry and cracked, and white from [[keratosis]]. The minor [[salivary gland]]s appear as small, red and swollen bumps. It is not a [[premalignant condition]], and the appearance reverses if the smoking is stopped.&lt;ref name="Coulthard2008"/&gt;{{rp|176}}

===Chronic ulcerative stomatitis===
Chronic ulcerative stomatitis is a recently discovered condition with specific immunopathologic features.&lt;ref name="Solomon 2008" /&gt; It is characterized by [[Mouth ulcer#Definition|erosions]] and [[oral ulceration|ulceration]]s which relapse and remit. Lesions are located on the buccal mucosa (inside of the cheeks) or on the [[gingiva]] (gums).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scully|first=Crispian|title=Oral and maxillofacial medicine : the basis of diagnosis and treatment|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780443068188|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fourie 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fourie J, van Heerden WF, McEachen SC, van Zyl A |title=Chronic ulcerative stomatitis: a distinct clinical entity?|journal=SADJ : journal of the South African Dental Association = tydskrif van die Suid-Afrikaanse Tandheelkundige Vereniging|date=April 2011|volume=66|issue=3|pages=119–21|pmid=21874892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition resembles [[Lichen planus#Oral lichen planus|Oral lichen planus]] when biopsied.

The diagnosis is made with [[Immunofluorescence]] techniques, which shows circulating and tissue-bound [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] (particulate stratified squamous-epithelium-specific antinuclear antibody) to DeltaNp63alpha protein, a normal component of the [[epithelium]].

[[File:Timer cartoon.png|thumb|right|250px|Timer in "Quickie Breakfast"]]
'''''Time for Timer''''' is a title for a short series of [[public service announcements]] [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on Saturday mornings on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television network]] starting in the early 1970s. The animated spots featured Timer, a tiny [[cartoon character]] who represents the sense of "time" in the human body. Timer is in charge of when a person felt it was time to eat, time to sleep, etc. He carries a large pocket watch inside of him, which would often set off an alarm whenever something was about to happen. 

Usually wearing a [[bow tie]] and [[top hat]], Timer looks somewhat like a little yellow blob with long arms and legs, and a face. Timer also has limited magical powers, such as instant transportation, which he often uses to exit his host body from time to time if things got too exhausting. A wise-cracker as well as a song-and-dance man, Timer promotes healthy eating and personal [[hygiene]] for children, using clever songs and animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/time_for_timer_saturday_morning_cartoon_psas_from_the_70s|title=‘Time for Timer!’: Saturday morning cartoon PSAs from the 70s|date=January 15, 2013|publisher=Dangerous Minds|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like ABC's ''[[The Bod Squad]]'' series, the segments never carried official titles, but are referred to by memorable catch phrases in the songs' lyrics. Perhaps most memorable was "I Hanker for a Hunk of Cheese" in which Timer, recast as a cowboy with a thick Western accent, suggests "wagon wheels," sandwiches made with cheese slices and crackers as an easy and nutritious snack. (When Timer prepares one on a kitchen counter, he rolls it down the counter on its edge and tells us, "Look! A wagon wheel!")  Others included "You Are What You Eat" (a simplified explanation of nutrients and how the body uses them), "Quickie Breakfast" (leftovers and other premade foods as an alternative for kids who do not have time, or are unable, to cook breakfast), and "Sunshine on a Stick" (how to make [[ice pop]]s with fruit juice, an ice tray, and toothpicks).

''Time for Timer'' ran concurrently and interchangeably for many years with ABC's other educational spots, primarily ''The Bod Squad'' and ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]''. They generally appeared between [[Saturday morning cartoon|cartoon programs]] on the hour and half hour marks interspersed with regular [[commercials]].

Timer's voice was provided by actor [[Lennie Weinrib]]. The spots themselves were produced by the cartoon studio [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]]. During the final five seconds or so of each segment (sometimes the first 5 seconds), the following end credit appeared on the bottom of the screen:

:''An ABC Presentation
:''Consultant: Dr. Roslyn B. Alfin-Slater
:''UCLA School of Public Health''

Timer first appeared in the 1973 ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]''  "The Incredible, Indelible, Magical, Physical Mystery Trip", where he was voiced by Len Maxwell. Timer also appeared in the 1974 ''ABC Afterschool Special'' "The Magical Mystery Trip Through Little Red's Head" (now voiced by Lennie Weinrib). In Mystery Trip, he was working inside the body of a man named "Uncle Carl". In Little Red, he was working inside the (Teenaged) Red Riding Hood.

It is an approach for use in resource limited settings and is widely used in Africa and Asia and has been a useful research tool in studies of progression to symptomatic [[HIV]] [[disease]]. Most of these conditions are opportunistic infections that can be easily treated in healthy people. The staging system is different for adults and adolescents and children.

'''Stage I:''' HIV disease is asymptomatic and not categorized as [[AIDS]].

'''Stage II:''' include minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.

'''Stage III:''' includes unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections and pulmonary tuberculosis.

'''Stage IV:''' includes toxoplasmosis of the brain, candidiasis of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi or lungs and Kaposi's sarcoma; these diseases are used as indicators of AIDS.

Being organized by [[World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action|WABA]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]], ''WBW'' came up with the goal to promote [[Breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|exclusive breastfeeding]] for the first six months of life which yields tremendous health benefits, providing critical [[nutrient]]s, protection from deadly [[disease]]s such as [[pneumonia]] and fostering growth and development for the first time in 1991.{{r|LLLI}}

==History==
World Breastfeeding Week was first celebrated in 1992 by [[World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action]] (WABA) and is now observed in over 120 [[countries]] by [[UNICEF]]{{r|UNICEF}}, [[World Health Organization|WHO]]{{r|WHO}} and their partners including individuals, organizations, and governments. WABA itself have been formed on 14 February 1991{{r|Fdate}} with the goal to re-establish a global breastfeeding culture and provide support for [[breastfeeding]] everywhere.{{r|AllSands}}

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) emphasize the value of breastfeeding for mothers as well as children. Both recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and then supplemented breastfeeding for at least one year and up to two years or more.{{r|WHO2003|Gartner_2005}} WBW commemorates the [[Innocenti Declaration]] made by WHO and UNICEF in August 1990 to protect and support breastfeeding.{{r|WHO}}
