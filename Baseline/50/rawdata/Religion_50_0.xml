[[File:ARO Plate 2 (Title page alternate).jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|One of two known impressions of the title page from ''All Religions are One'', printed ''c''1795]]
'''''All Religions are One''''' is a series of philosophical [[aphorism]]s by [[William Blake]], written in 1788. Following on from his initial experiments with [[William Blake#Relief etching|relief etching]] in the non-textual ''[[The Approach of Doom]]'' (1787), ''All Religions are One'' and ''[[There is No Natural Religion]]'' represent Blake's first successful attempt to combine image and text via relief etching, and are thus the earliest of his [[illuminated manuscript]]s. As such, they serve as a significant milestone in Blake's career; as [[Peter Ackroyd]] points out, "his newly invented form now changed the nature of his expression. It had enlarged his range; with relief etching, the words [[Epigraphy|inscribed]] like those of God upon the tables of law, Blake could acquire a new role."&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd (1995: 115–16)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relief etching==
[[File:The Ghost of Abel (page 2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|left|Page 2 of ''The Ghost of Abel'' (1822); note the writing in the colophon at bottom right.]]
In 1822, Blake completed a short two-page dramatic piece which would prove to be the last of his illuminated manuscripts, entitled ''[[The Ghost of Abel|The Ghost of Abel A Revelation In the Visions of Jehovah Seen by William Blake]]''. Inscribed in the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] of this text is "W Blakes Original [[Stereotype (printing)|Stereotype]] was 1788". It is almost universally agreed amongst Blakean scholars, that the "Original Stereotype" to which he here refers was ''All Religions are One'' and/or ''There is No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Bindman (1978: 468), Erdman (1982: 790); Ackroyd (1995: 115)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1770s, Blake had come to feel that one of the major problems with reproducing artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would [[Engraving|engrave]] it (the engraver), another [[Printing|print]] it (the printer) and another [[Publishing|publish]] it (the publisher).&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 10)&lt;/ref&gt; It was unusual for artists to engrave their own designs, due primarily to the [[social status]] attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded as nothing more than mechanical reproduction.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"/&gt; Artists like [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] and [[John Hamilton Mortimer]] were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended to engrave their own material.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"/&gt; A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]], whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 41)&lt;/ref&gt;

During Blake's training as a professional copy engraver with [[James Basire]] during the 1770s, the most common method of engraving was [[stippling]], which was thought to give a more accurate impression of the original picture than the previously dominant method, [[line engraving]]. [[Etching]] was also commonly used for layering in such aspects as landscape and background.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman (1978: 12)&lt;/ref&gt; All traditional methods of engraving and etching were [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]], which meant that the design's outline was traced with a needle through an acid-resistant 'ground' which had been poured over the copperplate. The plate was then covered with acid, and the engraver went over the incised lines with a [[burin (engraving)|burin]] to allow the acid to bite into the furrows and eat into the copper itself. The acid would then be poured off, leaving the design incised on the plate. The engraver would then engrave the plate's entire surface with a web of [[Hatching|crosshatched lines]], before pouring the ink onto the plate and transferring it to the [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 37)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated with this method, Blake seems to have begun thinking about a new method of publishing at least as early as 1784, as in that year a rough description of what would become relief etching appears in his unpublished satire, ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''. Around the same time, [[George Cumberland]] had been experimenting with a method to allow him to reproduce handwriting via an etched plate, and Blake incorporated Cumberland's method into his own relief etching; treating the text as handwritten script rather than mechanical letterpress, and thus allowing him to make it a component of the image.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 13)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's great innovation in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, parts of the plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid about a quarter of an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern [[rubber stamp]]. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;The exact method is described in great detail in Joseph Viscomi, ''Blake and the Idea of the Book'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), chapters 4 and 18&lt;/ref&gt; This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio.&lt;ref&gt;See Bindman (1978), Bindman (2000) and Viscomi (2003) for more specific information.&lt;/ref&gt; The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he [[Mirror writing|wrote in reverse]].&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 43)&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 13)"/&gt;

Blake could also colour the plates themselves in coloured inks before pressing them or tint them with [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] after printing. Because of this aspect, a major component of relief etching was that every page of every book was a unique piece of art; no two copies of any page in Blake's entire ''oeuvre'' are identical. Variations in the actual print, different colouring choices, repainted plates, accidents during the acid bath etc., all led to multiple examples of the same plate.

Blake himself referred to relief etching as "printing in the infernal method, by means of corrosives [...] melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid."&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1790); Plate 6&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary description of the method was provided by Blake's friend, [[John Thomas Smith (engraver)|J.T. Smith]]; "writing his poetry, and drawing his marginal subjects of embellishments in outline upon the copper-plate with an impervious liquid, and then eating the plain parts or lights away with [[Nitric acid|aquafortis]] considerably below them so that the outlines were left as Stereotype."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bindman (1978: 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief etching was the same basic method used for [[woodcut]]ting, and copper relief etching had been practised in the early eighteenth century by [[Elisha Kirkall]], but Blake was the first to use such a method to create both words and designs mixed together on the same plate.&lt;ref name="Bindman 1978: 14"&gt;Bindman (1978: 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the unique aesthetic effects possible, a major advantage of relief etching was that Blake could print the material himself. Because the text was in relief, the pressure needed for printing was constant, unlike in intaglio printing, where different pressures were needed to force the paper into the furrows, depending on size. Additionally, intaglio etchings and engravings were printed with great pressure, but in relief etching, because the printed material was a raised surface rather than incised lines, considerably less pressure was required.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman (2000: 7)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, relief etching tackled the problem of the division of labour of publishing. Blake's new method was autographic; "it permitted – indeed promoted – a seamless relationship between conception and execution rather than the usual divisions between invention and production embedded in eighteenth-century print technology, and its economic and social distinctions among authors, printers, artists and engravers. Like drawings and manuscripts, Blake's relief etchings were created by the direct and positive action of the author/artist's hand without intervening processes."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 9)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake served as artist, engraver, printer ''and'' publisher.

==Copy==
Although ''All Religions are One'' was etched in 1788, the only surviving copy (known as Copy A) was not printed until 1795; a large paper copy printed as part of a deluxe edition of Blake's collected illuminated manuscripts. Whether he had printed ''All Religions'' prior to 1795 is unknown. However, the fact that it is not mentioned in his 'To the Public' address of October 1793, where he listed all of his extant manuscripts up to that time except ''All Religions'' and ''No Natural Religion'', would suggest he had not.&lt;ref name="ARO Intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=aro&amp;java=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003052150/http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=aro&amp;java=yes |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 October 2006 |title=Introduction |author= |date= |work=All Religions are One |publisher=[[William Blake Archive]] |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copy A is located in [[Huntington Library|The Huntington Library]], except Plate 2 (title page), which exists in two impressions. The copy of the title page which goes with Copy A is located in the [[Geoffrey Keynes]] Collection in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]. The title page from another copy (colour printed in brown ink), the additional plates of which are unrecorded, is in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

''All Religions are One'' comprises ten plates, each of which is roughly 5.4 X 4&amp;nbsp;cm.,&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 21)&lt;/ref&gt; with each paragraph on a separate plate, except Plate 10, which contains both Principal 7&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; and a short paragraph which functions as a conclusion to the series. In numerous cases, it seems as if the acid has eaten away too much of the relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and [[Wash (painting)|wash]], often touching the text and design outlines with pen.&lt;ref name="Bindman 1978: 14"/&gt; Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of [[Woodcut#White-line woodcut|white line engraving]], a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.

The black ink framing lines drawn around each design are thought to have been added at a later date, possibly in 1818, just prior to Blake giving the plates to [[John Linnell]]. The ink and wash work in the designs themselves may also have been executed at that time, although this cannot be ascertained for certain.&lt;ref name="ARO Intro" /&gt; It has been suggested that the framing lines may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates and the size of the paper (each sheet is 37.8 x 27&amp;nbsp;cm.).&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt;
 
Plates 1 and 3–10 of the Huntington copy were acquired by John Linnell some time after 1818, with the missing title page replaced by an impression of the title page from ''There is No Natural Religion''. The plates were sold from the Linnell estate on 15 March 1918 to [[Henry E. Huntington]]. Plate 2 was acquired by [[George A. Smith]] in 1853. It may have subsequently been owned by [[William Muir]], but was ultimately sold at [[Sotheby's]] by Sir [[Hickman Bacon]] on 21 July 1953, to Geoffrey Keynes, who donated it to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/copy/aro.a |title=Copy Information |author= |date= |work=All Religions are One |publisher=The William Blake Archive |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the original 1795 printing, the text of ''All Religions'' was not published again until 1893, in ''The Works of William Blake, Poetic, Symbolic and Critical'', edited by [[W. B. Yeats|W.B. Yeats]] and [[Edwin Ellis (poet)|E.J. Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1966: 886)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
Until 1971, most editors tended to consider ''All Religions are One'' as later than ''There is No Natural Religion''. For example, in his 1905 book ''The poetical works of William Blake; a new and verbatim text from the manuscript engraved and letterpress originals'', [[John Sampson (linguist)|John Sampson]] places ''No Natural Religion'' prior to ''All Religions'' in his 'Appendix to the Prophetic Books'. However, in 1971, Geoffrey Keynes argued that ''All Religions are One'' was the earlier of the two, based on what he saw as its "greater technical imperfection."&lt;ref name="Erdman (1982: 789)"&gt;Erdman (1982: 789)&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1978 book, ''The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake'', David Bindman initially disagreed with Keynes, arguing that the imperfections in ''All Religions'' are not because of an earlier date of composition, but because of the increased complexity of the plates, with such complexity demonstrating Blake growing in confidence from the more rudimentary plates for ''No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 468)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 468)&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars however support Keynes, and ''All Religions are One'' precedes ''There is No Natural Religion'' in almost all modern anthologies of Blake's work; for example, [[Alicia Ostriker]]'s ''William Blake: The Complete Poems'' (1977), [[David V. Erdman]]'s 2nd edition of ''The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake'' (1982), Morris Eaves', Robert N. Essick's and Joseph Viscomi's ''Blake's Illuminated Books, Volume 3: The Early Illuminated Books'' (1993), even Bindman's own ''The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake'' (2003), and W.H. Stevenson's 3rd edition of ''Blake: The Complete Poems'' (2007).

Further evidence for Keynes hypothesis is discussed by Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, who, in counterpoint to Bindman, see the style of ''No Natural Religion'' as more confident than that of ''All Religions''. They especially cite the use of upright [[Latin alphabet|roman lettering]] in ''All Religions'' contrasted with the [[Italic script|italic]], [[cursive]] writing on several plates of ''No Natural Religion''; "this style was easier to execute since it required fewer independent strokes. And since the resulting dense matrix of lines provided better support for the inking dabber, italic permitted a shallower etch."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 12)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake introduced italic script on plate a3 of ''No Natural Religion'', a script which he would use throughout the 1790s.&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt; Other evidence for an earlier dating of ''All Religions'' is that many of the individual letters themselves lean to the left, unlike in ''No Natural Religion''. This was a common problem in mirror writing, and its presence in ''All Religions'' but not ''No Natural Religion'' suggests Blake was only learning how to overcome it as he worked.

==Content==
When analysing ''All Religions are One'' it is important to remember that the images are not necessarily literal depictions of the text; "the philosophical propositions [...] offer little visual imagery or even named objects. These qualities may have determined the relative independence of many of the designs from the accompanying text. The links are thematic and metaphoric, not direct and literal."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake would go on to criticise the ten commandments in later work such as ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1790), ''[[The Book of Urizen]]'' (1794), ''[[The Book of Los]]'' (1795) and ''[[The Song of Los]]'' (1795), and that same critical inclination seems present here as he quite literally effaces the content of the original tablets, replacing it with his own doctrine. However, it is also worth noting that the angel embraces the man with his left hand and the tablets with his right, thus suggesting a spiritual union between the man of prophecy (Blake himself) and the foundational text of orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 34)"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
The central concern in ''All Religions are One'' is the notion of the "Poetic Genius", which is roughly analogous to the imagination. Blake argues that the Poetic Genius is greater than all else and "is the true man." The Poetic Genius thus replaces traditional concepts of divinity insofar as "The body or outward form of Man is derived from the Poetic Genius [...] the forms of all things are derived from their Genius. which by the Ancients was call'd an Angel &amp; Spirit &amp; Demon." Thus, the Poetic Genius supplants theological belief. This Poetic Genius is universal, common to all Mankind; "as all men are alike in outward form [...] all men are alike in the Poetic Genius." Similarly, all philosophies are derived from the Poetic Genius; "all sects of Philosophies are from the Poetic Genius adapted to the weaknesses of every individual", and so too are all religions, which are merely expressions of the Poetic Genius; "the Religions of all Nations are derived from each Nations different reception of the Poetic Genius which is everywhere call'd the Spirit of Prophecy," again emphasising the theological character of the Poetic Genius. Even the Bible originates with the Poetic Genius; "The Jewish &amp; Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius." Thus, as all Men are alike in their Poetic Genius, and as all religions originate with the Poetic Genius, so too must all religions be alike, thus all religions are one.

David Bindman classifies ''All Religions are One'' as "a rather abstract dialogue with conventional [[theology]],"&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 7)&lt;/ref&gt;  and in this sense, it is often interpreted as Blake's earliest engagement with [[deism]] and [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Ostriker (1977: 877), Bindman (1978: 468), Harold Bloom, "Commentary" in Erdman (1982: 894) or Damon (1988: 16)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Northrop Frye]] argues that Blake's theory that all religions are one is a "visionary tolerance" at odds with the "rational tolerance" of deism "which holds that all religions are equally an attempt to solve an insoluble mystery."&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1947: 345)&lt;/ref&gt; Working along the same lines, Florence Sandler argues that in these texts Blake "set himself to the task of separating true religion from its perversions in his own age and in the Bible itself."&lt;ref&gt;Sandler (1990: 43)&lt;/ref&gt; Also concentrating on the refutation of deism, Alicia Ostriker refers to the series as a "mockery of [[rationalism]] and an insistence on Man's potential infinitude."&lt;ref&gt;Ostriker (1977: 877)&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. Foster Damon]] suggests that what Blake has done in ''All Religions are One'' is "dethroned [[reason]] from its ancient place as the supreme faculty of man, replacing it with the Imagination."&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 343)&lt;/ref&gt; Damon also argues that "Blake had completed his revolutionary theory of the nature of Man and proclaimed the unity of all true religions."&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 16)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Bloom]] reaches much the same conclusion, suggesting that Blake is arguing for the "primacy of the poetic imagination over all [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and moral systems."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, "Commentary" in Erdman (1982: 894)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar conclusion is reached by Denise Vultee, who argues that "the two tractates are part of Blake's lifelong quarrel with the philosophy of Bacon, Newton, and Locke. Rejecting the rational empiricism of eighteenth-century deism or "[[Natural theology|natural religion]]", which looked to the material world for evidence of God's existence, Blake offers as an alternative the imaginative faculty or "Poetic Genius"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/staticpage/biography?p=biography |title= Illuminated Printing and other Illustrated Books, 1789-1792 |author= Denise Vultee  |date= |work=William Blake (1757-1827) |publisher=The William Blake Archive |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of influences on Blake, in 1787 [[Henry Fuseli]] was working on a translation of [[Johann Kaspar Lavater|J.C. Lavater]]'s ''[[Aphorisms on Man]]'' for the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], when he hired Blake to engrave the frontispiece. Blake became so enamoured of Lavater's work that on the inside cover of his own copy of the book, he inscribed both his name and Lavater's, and drew a heart encompassing them.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd (1995: 107)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake also extensively annotated his own copy of ''Aphorisms'', and a number of critics have noted parallels between the Lavater annotations and Blake's own aphorisms in both ''All Religions'' and ''No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Hilton (2003: 195)&lt;/ref&gt; S. Foster Damon specifically points to Lavater's first two aphorisms as having a strong influence on Blake;&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 16–17)&lt;/ref&gt;

# Know, in the first place, that mankind agree in essence, as they do in their limbs and senses.
# Mankind differ as much in essence as they do in form, limbs, and senses – and only so, and not more".

To these points Blake has annotated "This is true Christian philosophy far above all abstraction."

Another work which may also have influenced him is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1758). In his annotations to Swedenborg, Blake twice connects the word "Lord" with "Poetic Genius". During Swedenborg's discussion of the connection between the spiritual world and the natural world, Blake writes "He who Loves feels love descend into him &amp; if he has wisdom may perceive it is from the Poetic Genius which is the Lord." Shortly thereafter, to Swedenborg's "the negation of God constitutes Hell", Blake annotates "the negation of the Poetic Genius."&lt;ref&gt;Both quotations taken from Erdman (1982: 603)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Lavater and Swedenborg influences are somewhat speculative, the importance of Bacon, Newton and Locke is not, as it is known that Blake despised empiricism from an early age. In 1808, as he annotated ''The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds'', Blake wrote

{{quote|[[Edmund Burke|Burke's]] [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Treatise on the Sublime &amp; Beautiful]] is founded on the Opinions of Newton &amp; Locke on this Treatise Reynolds has grounded many of his assertions. in all his Discourses I read Burkes Treatise when very Young at the same time I read Locke on [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Human Understanding]] &amp; Bacons [[The Advancement of Learning|Advancement of Learning]] on Every one of these Books I wrote my Opinions &amp; on looking them over find that my Notes on Reynolds in this Book are exactly Similar. I felt the Same Contempt &amp; Abhorrence then; that I do now. They mock Inspiration &amp; Vision Inspiration &amp; Vision was then &amp; now is &amp; I hope will always Remain my Element my Eternal Dwelling place. how can I then hear it Contemnd without returning Scorn for Scorn}}

Harold Bloom also cites the work of [[Anthony Collins]], [[Matthew Tindal]] and [[John Toland]] as having an influence on Blake's thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Blake's Apocalypse'' (Garden City: Doubleday,  1963), 25&lt;/ref&gt; In a more general sense, "Blake sees the school of Bacon and Locke as the foundation of natural religion, the deistic attempt to prove the existence of God on the basis of sensate experience and its rational investigation."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 27)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 27)&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, Blake "manipulates the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] mythology of [[Jacob Bryant]], [[Paul Henri Mallet]], and perhaps other founders of what has become the comparative study of religion, to argue for the existence of a universal and supra-rational 'Poetic Genius' that expresses itself through the shared (though ever various) forms of all religions."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 27)"/&gt;

In relation to his later work, Northrop Frye sees ''All Religions are One'' and ''There is No Natural Religion'' as forming a fundamental statement of intent for Blake, a kind of pre-emptive outline of his future work, "a summarised statement of the doctrines of the engraved canon."&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1947: 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi state that they "contain some of Blake's most fundamental principles and reveal the foundation for later development in his thought and art."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt; W.H. Stevenson calls them "a very early statement of fundamental opinions [Blake] held all his life."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (2007: 55)&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of how Blake returned to the specific themes of ''All Religions'', in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' (1790), he writes "the Poetic Genius was the first principle and all the others merely derivative" (12:22–24).

H.|title=The A to Z of Sikhism|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810863446|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or before the [[dawn]]ing of the morning sun&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Dharma|title=Meditation As Medicine: Activate the Power of Your Natural Healing Force|date=2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9781439117538|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is used for daily [[meditation]] and recitation of [[Gurbani]] hymns. [[Guru Nanak]] in the [[Japji Sahib]] (4th Pauri) says, "In amrit velā meditate on the grandeur of the one true Name."&lt;ref name="McLeod" /&gt; The importance of Amrit Vela is found throughout the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. The Guru Granth Sahib states that "those who consider themselves a Sikh must wake up daily at Amrit vela and be in tune with the [[Nam japna|''Naam'']] (the Lord's Name)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Guru Granth Sahib|page=Ang 305|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=305&amp;g=1&amp;h=1&amp;r=1&amp;t=1&amp;p=0&amp;k=0&amp;fb=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sikh Rehat Maryada]] it is written to arise Amrit Velā, bath, and meditate on the divine ''Naam'' (through [[Simran]] and [[Nam Japo|Naam Japna]]). Sikhs recite their morning ''[[Nitnem]]'' during Amrit vela. Traditionally after ''Nitnem'' Sikhs meet with the [[Sangat (term)|Sangat]] (congregation) to recite [[Asa di Var]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duggal|first=Kartar|title=The Prescribed Sikh Prayers (Nitnem)|date=1980|publisher=Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788170173779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apotheosis''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀποθέωσις from ἀποθεοῦν, ''apotheoun'' "to deify"; in Latin ''deificatio'' "making divine"; also called '''divinization''' and '''deification''') is the glorification of a subject to [[divinity|divine]] level. The term has meanings in [[theology]], where it refers to a [[belief]], and in [[art]], where it refers to a [[genre]].

In theology, ''apotheosis'' refers to the idea that an individual has been raised to godlike stature. In art, the term refers to the treatment of any subject (a figure, group, locale, motif, convention or melody) in a particularly grand or exalted manner.

==Antiquity==
{{further information|imperial cult|divine king}}
Before the Hellenistic period, [[imperial cult]]s were known in [[Ancient Egypt]] ([[pharaoh]]s) and [[Mesopotamia]] (since [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]). From the [[New Kingdom]], all deceased pharaohs were deified as the god [[Osiris]].

==Ancient Greece==
{{Main article|Greek hero cult}}
From at least the [[Geometric art|Geometric]] period of the ninth century BC, the long-deceased heroes linked with [[founding myth]]s of Greek sites were accorded [[chthonic]] rites in their ''[[heroon]]'', or "hero-temple".

In the Greek world, the first leader who accorded himself divine honours was [[Philip II of Macedon]]. At his wedding to his sixth wife, Philip's enthroned image was carried in procession among the [[Olympian gods]]; "his example at [[Vergina|Aigai]] became a custom, passing to the Macedonian kings who were later worshipped in [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek Asia]], from them to [[Julius Caesar]] and so to the emperors of Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'' (1973:20)&lt;/ref&gt; Such Hellenistic state leaders might be raised to a status equal to the gods before death (e.g., [[Alexander the Great]]) or afterwards (e.g., members of the
[[Ptolemaic dynasty]]). A heroic cult status similar to apotheosis was also an honour given to a few revered artists of the distant past, notably [[Homer]].

Archaic and Classical Greek hero-cults became primarily civic, extended from their familial origins, in the sixth century; by the fifth century none of the worshipers based their authority by tracing descent back to the hero, with the exception of some families who inherited particular priestly cults, such as the [[Eumolpides]] (descended from [[Eumolpus]]) of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]], and some inherited priesthoods at [[oracle|oracle site]]s. The Greek hero cults can be distinguished on the other hand from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|cult of dead emperors]], because the hero was not thought of as having ascended to Olympus or become a god: he was beneath the earth, and his power purely local.  For this reason hero cults were [[chthonic]] in nature, and their rituals more closely resembled those for [[Hecate]] and [[Persephone]] than those for [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo]]. Two exceptions were [[Heracles]] and [[Asclepius]], who might be honoured as either gods or heroes, sometimes by chthonic night-time rites and sacrifice on the following day.

==Ancient Rome==
{{main article|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}
Up to the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], Romans accepted only one official apotheosis: the god [[Quirinus]], whatever his original meaning, having been identified with [[Romulus]].{{sfn|Garnett|Mackintosh|1911}} Subsequently, apotheosis in [[ancient Rome]] was a process whereby a deceased ruler was recognized as having been divine by his successor, usually also by a [[S.P.Q.R.|decree of the Senate and popular consent]]. In addition to showing respect, often the present ruler deified a popular predecessor to legitimize himself and gain popularity with the people. The upper-class did not always take part in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]],{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} and some privately ridiculed the apotheosis of inept and feeble emperors, as in the satire ''[[The Pumpkinification of Claudius|The Pumpkinification of (the Divine) Claudius]]'', usually attributed to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].

At the height of the imperial cult during the [[Roman Empire]], sometimes the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]'s deceased loved ones—heirs, empresses, or lovers, as Hadrian's [[Antinous]]—were deified as well. Deified people were awarded posthumously the title ''Divus'' (''Diva'' if women) to their names to signify their divinity. [[Religion in ancient Rome|Traditional Roman religion]] distinguished between a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#deus, dea, di, dii|deus]]'' (god) and a ''[[divus]]'' (a mortal who became divine or deified), though not consistently. Temples and columns were erected to provide a space for worship.

==Ancient China==
The [[Ming dynasty]] epic ''[[Fengshen Yanyi|Investiture of the Gods]]'' deals heavily with deification legends. Numerous mortals have been deified into the [[Daoism|Daoist]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], such as [[Guan Yu]], [[Iron-crutch Li]] and [[Fan Kuai]]. [[Song Dynasty]] General [[Yue Fei]] was deified during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and is considered by some practitioners to be one of the three highest ranking heavenly generals.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, James T. C. "Yueh Fei (1103-41) and China's Heritage of Loyalty." ''The Journal of Asian Studies''. Vol. 31, No. 2 (Feb., 1972), pp. 291-297, pg. 296

==Southeast Asia and North Korea==
Various Hindu and Buddhist rulers in the past have been represented as deities, especially after death, from [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thailand]] to [[Indonesia]].  Even several [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Sultans of Yogyakarta]] were semi-deified{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, posthumously.

Deceased North Korean leader [[Kim Il-Sung]] is the principal object of the [[North Korean cult of personality]] in which he is treated similarly to an explicitly apotheosized leader, with statues of and monuments dedicated to the "[[Eternal President]]", the annual commemoration of his birth, the paying of respects by newlyweds to his nearest statue,&lt;ref name="North Korean newlywed couples in their best attire bow before the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang"&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/domain/nimg.sulekha.com/search?q=North+Korean+newlywed+couples+in+their+best+attire+bow+before+the+statues+of+Kim+Il+Sung+and+Kim+Jong+Il+in+Pyongyang], Photograph of North Korean newlywed couples in their best attire bowing before the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang, from Reddit.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[North Korean calendar]] being a [[Juche]] calendar based on Kim Il-sung's date of birth.

==Christianity==

===Generally===
{{main article|Divinization (Christian)}}
Instead of the word "apotheosis", Christian theology uses in English the words "deification" or "divinization" or the Greek word "''theosis''". Traditional mainstream theology, both East and West, views [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] as the preexisting God who undertook mortal existence, not as a mortal being who attained divinity. It holds that he has made it possible for human beings to be raised to the level of sharing the divine nature: he became one of us to make us "partakers of the divine nature"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; "For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son of God.''"&lt;ref&gt;[[Irenaeus of Lyon]], ''Adversus haereses'', 3.19.1&lt;/ref&gt; "For He was made man that we might be made God."&lt;ref name="AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3"&gt;St. Athanasius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html ''On the Incarnation of the Word'' 54.3] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QWCtlc7G?url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html |date=2007-07-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas]], Opusc. 57, 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology contains the following in an article titled "Deification":

:''Deification (Greek theosis) is for Orthodoxy the goal of every Christian. Man, according to the Bible, is 'made in the image and likeness of God.'. . . It is possible for man to become like God, to become deified, to become god by grace. This doctrine is based on many passages of both OT and NT (e.g. Ps. 82 (81).6; II Peter 1.4), and it is essentially the teaching both of St Paul, though he tends to use the language of filial adoption (cf. Rom. 8.9—17; Gal. 4.5—7), and the Fourth Gospel (cf. 17.21—23).''

:''The language of II Peter is taken up by St Irenaeus, in his famous phrase, 'if the Word has been made man, it is so that men may be made gods' (Adv. Haer V, Pref.), and becomes the standard in Greek theology. In the fourth century, St. Athanasius repeats Irenaeus almost word for word, and in the fifth century St Cyril of Alexandria says that we shall become sons 'by participation' (Greek methexis). Deification is the central idea in the spirituality of St. Maximus the Confessor, for whom the doctrine is the corollary of the Incarnation: 'Deification, briefly, is the encompassing and fulfillment of all times and ages,' . . . and St. Symeon the New Theologian at the end of the tenth century writes, 'He who is God by nature converses with those whom he has made gods by grace, as a friend converses with his friends, face to face.' . . .''

===Eastern Christianity===
Eastern Christian theology does not use the term "apotheosis".{{cn|date=September 2018}}

===Roman Catholic Church===
The Roman Catholic Church also does not use the term "apotheosis".

Corresponding to the Greek word ''theosis'' are the [[Latin]]-derived words "divinization" and "deification" used in the parts of the [[Catholic Church]] that are of Latin tradition. The concept has been given less prominence in Western theology than in that of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], but is present in the [[Latin Church]]'s liturgical prayers, such as that of the deacon or priest when pouring wine and a little water into the chalice: "By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article "deification"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] quotes with approval [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius's]] saying, "The Son of God became man so that we might become God."&lt;ref name="AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 460] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201419/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM |date=February 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic theology stresses the concept of supernatural life, "a new creation and elevation, a rebirth, it is a participation in and partaking of the divine nature"&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Fries, ''[http://www.google.com/search?q=Fries+Catholic+%22partaking+of+the+divine+nature%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 Bultmann-Barth and Catholic theology]'' (Duquesne University Press 1967), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. {{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|ESV}}). In Catholic teaching there is a vital distinction between natural life and supernatural life, the latter being "the life that God, in an act of love, freely gives to human beings to elevate them above their natural lives" and which they receive through prayer and the sacraments; indeed the Catholic Church sees human existence as having as its whole purpose the acquisition, preservation and intensification of this supernatural life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?q=%22stephen+m.+o%27brien%22+%22supernatural+life%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 Stephen M. O'Brien, ''God and the Devil Are Fighting''] (City University of New York 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-549-61137-0}}), pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Exaltation (Mormonism)|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)}}
{{see also|Mormon cosmology|King Follett discourse}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church or [[Mormons]]) believes in apotheosis along the lines of the Christian tradition of [[divinization (Christian)|divinization]] or deification but refers to it as [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]], or eternal life, and considers it to be accomplished by "sanctification." It believes that people may live with God throughout eternity in families and eventually become gods themselves but remain subordinate to God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit. While the primary focus of the LDS Church is on [[Jesus of Nazareth]] and His atoning sacrifice for man,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Smith]] declared, "The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it" (See ''Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith'', sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 121).&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that one purpose for Christ's mission and for His atonement is the exaltation or [[Divinization (Christian)|Christian deification]] of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.lds.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng | title = Gospel Topics: Becoming Like God | work = LDS.org | publisher = LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third Article of Faith of Mormon Christianity states that all men may be saved from sin by the atonement of Jesus Christ, and LDS Gospel Doctrine (as published) states that all men will be saved and will be resurrected from death. However, only those who are sufficiently obedient and accept the atonement and the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ before the resurrection and final judgment will be "exalted" and receive a literal Christian [[Divinization (Christian)|deification]].

Mormons believe that the original Christian belief in man's divine potential gradually lost its meaning and importance in the centuries after the death of the apostles, as doctrinal changes by post-apostolic theologians caused Christians to lose sight of the true nature of God and His purpose for creating humanity. The concept of God's nature that was eventually accepted as Christian doctrine in the 4th century set divinity apart from humanity by defining the [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]] as three persons sharing a common divine substance. That classification of God in terms of a substance is not found in scripture&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mozley The creed or a philosophy 1893 p303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925052330/http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |archivedate=2014-09-25 |df= }} (the wording of the [[Council of Constantinople (360)]] prohibited use of the terms "substance," "essence," and "ousia" since they were not included in the scriptures)&lt;/ref&gt; but, in many aspects, mirrored the Greek metaphysical philosophies that are known to have influenced the thinking of Church Fathers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/trinity-history.html#Aug|title=Trinity &gt; History of Trinitarian Doctrines (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], and [[Augustine]]. Mormons teach that by modern revelation, God restored the knowledge that He is the literal father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9) and that the Biblical references to God creating mankind in His image and likeness are in no way allegorical. As such, Mormons assert that as the literal offspring of God the Father (Acts 17:28-29), humans have the potential to be heirs of His glory and co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:16-17). The glory, Mormons believe, lies not in God's substance but in His intelligence: in other words, light and truth (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 93|author=|date=|website=www.lds.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205003752/http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng|archivedate=2013-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus, the purpose of humans is to grow and progress to become like the Father in Heaven. Mortality is seen as a crucial step in the process in which God's spirit children gain a body, which, though formed in the image of the Father's body, is subject to pain, illness, temptation, and death. The purpose of this earth life is to learn to choose the right in the face of that opposition, thereby gaining essential experience and wisdom. The level of intelligence we attain in this life will rise in the Resurrection (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19). Bodies will then be immortal like those of the Father and the Son (Philippians 3:21), but the degree of glory to which each person will resurrect is contingent upon the Final Judgment (Revelation 20:13, 1 Corinthians 15:40-41). Those who are worthy to return to God's presence can continue to progress towards a fullness of God's glory, which Mormons refer to as eternal life, or [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] (Doctrine and Covenants 76).

The LDS concept of apotheosis/exaltation is expressed in LDS scriptures (Mosiah 3:19, Alma 13:12, D&amp;C 78:7, D&amp;C 78:22, D&amp;C 84:4, D&amp;C 84:23, D&amp;C 88:68, D&amp;C 93:28) and is expressed by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: "Though stretched by our challenges, by living righteously and enduring well we can eventually become sufficiently more like Jesus in our traits and attributes, that one day we can dwell in the Father's presence forever and ever" (Neal Maxwell, October 1997).

In early 2014, the LDS church published an essay on the official church website specifically addressing the foundations, history, and official beliefs regarding apotheosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng|title=Becoming Like God|first=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day|last=Saints|date=|website=www.lds.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129065539/https://www.lds.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng|archivedate=2014-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay addresses the scriptural foundations of this belief, teachings of the early Church Fathers on the subject of deificiation, and the teachings of LDS church leaders, starting with Joseph Smith.

==In art==
In art the matter is practical: the elevation of a figure to divine level entails certain conventions. So it is that the apotheosis genre exists in Christian art as in other art. The features of the apotheosis genre may be seen in subjects that emphasize Christ's divinity ([[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], Christ [[Pantocrator]]) and that depict holy persons "in glory"—that is, in their roles as "God revealed" (Assumption, Ascension, etc.).

[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of French soldiers fallen in the Napoleonic Wars, [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], beginning of 19th century.]] [[File:Apotheosis of George Washington.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of George Washington]]

[[File:Allegory of Gdańsk trade.jpg|thumb|right|''Apotheosis of Gdańsk'' by [[Isaak van den Blocke]].]]

Later artists have used the concept for motives ranging from genuine respect for the deceased ([[Constantino Brumidi]]'s fresco ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'' on the dome of the [[United States Capitol]] Building in [[Washington, D.C.]]), to artistic comment ([[Salvador Dalí]]'s or [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s ''[[The Apotheosis of Homer (Ingres)|The Apotheosis of Homer]]''), to [[mock-heroic]] and [[burlesque]] apotheoses for comedic effect.

Many modern leaders have exploited the artistic imagery if not the theology of apotheosis. Examples include [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s depictions of [[James I of England]] at the [[Banqueting House]] (an expression of the [[Divine Right of Kings]]) or [[Henry IV of France]], or Appiani's apotheosis of [[Napoleon]]. The [[Charles Henry Niehaus|C. H. Niehaus]]-designed ''[[Apotheosis of St. Louis]]'' ([[Louis IX of France]]) became a symbol for St. Louis MO. The term has come to be used figuratively to refer to the elevation of a dead leader (often one who was assassinated and/or martyred) to a kind of superhuman charismatic figure and an effective erasing of all faults and controversies which were connected with his name in life - for example, [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[US]], [[Lenin]] in the [[USSR]], [[Yitzchak Rabin]] in [[Israel]], or [[Kim Jong-il]] in [[North Korea]].

==In music==
''Apotheosis'' in music refers to the appearance of a theme in grand or exalted form. It represents the musical equivalent of the apotheosis genre in visual art, especially where the theme is connected in some way with historical persons or dramatic characters. When crowning the end of a large-scale work the apotheosis functions as a [[peroration]], following an analogy with the art of [[rhetoric]].

Apotheosis moments abound in music, and the word itself appears in some cases. In the [[List of compositions by François Couperin]] there are 3 suites entitled "Apotheoses" (1724), [[Hector Berlioz]] used "Apotheose" as the title of the final movement of his ''Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale'', a work composed in 1846 for the dedication of a monument to France's war dead. Two of  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballets, ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', contain apotheoses as finales; the same is true of [[Ludwig Minkus]]'s ''[[La Bayadère]]''. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s composed [[Orpheus (ballet)]] and [[Apollo (ballet)]] for [[choreographer]] [[George Balanchine]] which both contain episodes entitled "Apotheose". The concluding tableau of [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Ma mère l'Oye]]'' is also titled  "Apotheose." Czech composer [[Karel Husa]], concerned in 1970 about arms proliferation and environmental deterioration, named his musical response ''Apotheosis for This Earth''. [[Aram Khachaturian]] entitled a segment of his ballet ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]'' "Sunrise and Apotheosis." [[Richard Wagner]], referring to the lively [[rhythm]]s which permeate [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 7]], called it the "apotheosis of the dance".&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{cite book |title= Beethoven and his nine symphonies |last= Grove |first= Sir George |authorlink= George Grove |year= 1962 |publisher= [[Dover Publications]] |location= [[New York City|New York]] |edition= 3rd |oclc= 705665 |pages= 228–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alexander Glazunov]]'s ballet ''[[The Seasons (ballet)|The Seasons]]'', Op.67 has as the concluding movement:-  Autumn: Scene and Apotheosis.

American [[technical death metal]] band [[The Faceless]] explored the idea of Apotheosis in the first three tracks of their 2012 album ''Autotheism''. The first three tracks are one song broken into three parts called "The Autotheism Movement".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110620">'''Bahá'í studies''' refers to the scholarly study of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], its [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]], [[History of the Bahá'í Faith|history]] and [[Bahá'í literature|literature]].  Bahá'í studies are currently conducted in a variety of venues, including institutes of the [[Bahá'í administration]] as well as non-affiliated universities.  Some scholars study some aspect of the Bahá'í Faith as part of research on related matters while others engage in Bahá'í studies as a primary focus of their research. Scholars' comments on the religion and its predecessor [[Bábism]] date back to the at least 1845, the year after its founding. Initially they were often [[Orientalism|Orientalist]]s or [[Christian missionaries]] but through time both Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'í researchers have addressed the religion especially in tune with the [[Growth of religion#Bahá'í Faith|growth of the religion]], which has been called significant.

==Bahá'í review==
{{main|Bahá'í review}}
Bahá'í scholars who are also members of the faith must submit their work for [[Bahá'í review|review]] by the [[Bahá'í administration]] and obtain prior approval. According to the administration of the religion, the purpose of the review is threefold:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lights of Guidance|page=101|url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance.html&amp;chapter=2|editor=Helen Hornby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* To ensure the accuracy of the presentation of the teachings of the religion
* To protect the religion from misrepresentation by its own followers
* To ensure dignity of the form

[[Juan Cole]], a former Bahá'í who had disagreements with the Bahá'í administration on account of the [[Bahá'í review|review]] describes it as "a system of in-house censorship" which "has provoked many conflicts between Bahá'í officials and writers over the years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first= Juan R.I. | authorlink = Juan Cole | last2= |first2= |date= June 1998 |title= The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963-1997 | url= http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/1999/jssr/bhjssr.htm |journal= The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |publisher= |volume= 37 |issue= 2 |pages= |doi= |access-date= September 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several conflicts originating from the practice of review, and a number of prominent academics, including [[Juan Cole]], [[Denis MacEoin]] and [[Abbas Amanat]], have either been excommunicated or forced to resign due to academic disagreements with the religious hierarchy.

{{Seventh-day Adventism}}
'''Criticism of the Seventh-day Adventist Church''' includes observations made about its teachings, structure, and practices or theological disagreements from various individuals and groups. 

==Major critics==
One of the most prominent early critics of the church was [[D. M. Canright]], an early leader in the movement in the late 19th century who apostatized and recanted but later left and became a Baptist pastor.

In the middle of the 20th century, evangelical [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] and the [[Christian Research Institute]] concluded that the Seventh-day Adventist church is a legitimate Christian body with some [[heterodox]] doctrines and stated, "They are sound on the great New Testament doctrines including grace and redemption through the vicarious offering of Jesus Christ 'once for all'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1993/June/adventists-and-evangelicals-another-viewpoint  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008062819/http://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1993/June/adventists-and-evangelicals-another-viewpoint |date=October 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]]|title=The Truth About Seventh-Day Adventism|publisher=Zondervan|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars such as Calvinist [[Anthony A. Hoekema]], who did not agree with the Adventist views from Arminius's as Adventism holds a Wesleyan/Arminian stream of theology, grouped Seventh-day Adventism with [[Mormonism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Christian Science]] in his book ''The Four Major Cults''.&lt;ref name="Hoekema"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Four Major Cults: Christian Science, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism, Seventh-day Adventism|author=[[Anthony A. Hoekema]]|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1963|isbn=0-85364-094-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary critics include former Adventist pastor and academy teacher Dale Ratzlaff, who left the church in the 1980s and later founded Life Assurance Ministries.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.lifeassuranceministries.com/ LAM Publications, LLC].&lt;/ref&gt;

In debates regarding the [[inspiration of Ellen White]] during the 1970s, Adventists Walter T. Rea{{sfn|Rea|1983}} and [[Ronald Numbers]]{{sfn|Numbers|1976}} wrote material that some felt was critical of Ellen White.

==Church doctrine==

===Trinitarian views===
Some Christian critics of Adventism contend that the current Adventist view of the [[Trinity]] is not orthodox and/or constitutes [[Tritheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Colleen|last1=Tinker|first2=Richard|last2=Tinker|editor=Paul Carden|title=10 Questions &amp; Answers on Seventh-day Adventism|publisher=Rose Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-1-59636-422-6|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratzlaff|first=Dale|title=Truth about Adventist "Truth"|publisher=LAM Publications, LLC|year=2007|isbn=0-9747679-4-8|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiebe|first=Elmer|title=Who Is the Adventist Jesus?|publisher=Xulon Press|year=2006|isbn=1-59781-328-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Several Seventh-day Adventist scholars have acknowledged that the Adventist view of the Trinity tends to differ in some aspects from the inherited traditional Christian view of the doctrine. According to Dr. Jerry Moon{{Who|date=October 2012}}, Ellen White, the co-founder of the church, taught that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct individuals yet are united as one in the Godhead.&lt;ref&gt;From SDA Seminary professor Dr. Jerry Moon's presentation at the Adventist Theological Society’s 2006 "Trinity Symposium." http://atsjats.org/site/1/podcast/06_Trinity_Moon_Quest_Biblical_Trinity.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

Moon asserts that Ellen White was raised trinitarian but adopted a different view from the traditional one and contends that White's later writings on the Trinity is not the same as the view rejected by the early Adventists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Critic A. Leroy Moore contends Adventists reject the orthodox view, and contends that the view probably would have been branded as Arian by the orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;SDA scholar and author A. LeRoy Moore, at the panel Q&amp;A Session at the ATS 2006 "Trinity Symposium." http://atsjats.org/site/1/podcast/06_Trinity_Participants_Panel_Discussion.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

:"What James [SDA co-founder James White, husband of Ellen White] and the other men were opposed to, we are just as opposed to as they were. Now, their solution to that, at that time, they didn't see any solution by retaining the Trinity concept, and getting rid of its distortions. But, in reality, we have been faithful to their commitment, and I know of nothing that they were objecting to, in objecting to Trinitarianism, that we have not also objected to."&lt;ref&gt;From a Q&amp;A session at the ATS 2006 "Trinity Symposium." http://atsjats.org/site/1/podcast/06_Trinity_Burt_Historical_Adventist_Views.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, James White discussed the differences between Seventh Day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists, he observed, "The S. D. Adventists hold the divinity of Christ so nearly with the trinitarian, that we apprehend no trial here." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = White  | first = James  | title = The Two Bodies: the relation which the S.

:"A major development [in Adventism] since 1972 has been the quest to articulate biblical presuppositions grounding a biblical doctrine of the Trinity, clearly differentiated from the dualistic presuppositions that undergird the traditional creedal statements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Woodrow|last1=Whidden|first2=Jerry|last2=Moon|first3=John W.|last3=Reeve|title=The Trinity: Understanding God's Love, His Plan of Salvation, and Christian Relationships|publisher=Review and Herald Publishing Association|year=2002|isbn=0-8280-1684-4|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In many ways the philosophical assumptions and presuppositions of our worldview are different from traditional Christianity and bring different perspectives on some of these old issues. We do not accept the traditional Platonic dualistic worldview and metaphysics that were foundational to the church fathers' theology of the Trinity, one of these being the concept of the immortality of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christology===
It has been alleged by the [[Christian Research Institute]] that Adventism teaches that Christ ''had'' a sinful nature.&lt;ref&gt;(''Christian Research Journal'', Summer 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;13)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://greatcontroversy.org/gco/ser/kirl-halfadam.php Half Adam?] a sermon by [[Larry Kirkpatrick]]&lt;/ref&gt; Adventists hold that Christ came as fully man and yet still fully divine, and covering the nature of Christ  state that Jesus Christ inherited Adam's fallen nature that has been passed on to all of humanity but did not sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/OnlineLibrary/tabid/106/ctl/ViewMedia/mid/447/IID/87/LNG/en/SC/R/Default.aspx?7=Christ%27s-Human-Nature Christ's Human Nature] by Joe Crews&lt;/ref&gt; Such a belief is based on the following texts:

:"For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son '''in the likeness of sinful flesh''', on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh" (Romans 8:3 NKJV)

:"For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was '''in all points tempted as we are''', yet without sin." (Hebrews 4:15 NKJV)

:"...concerning his Son (Jesus), who was descended from David ''according to the flesh''..." (Romans 1:3 ESV)

:"Therefore, ''in all things'' He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people." (Hebrews 2:17 NKJV)

Adventist doctrine is that God took "man's nature in its fallen condition," but yet "Christ did not in the least participate in its sin", which shows Christ with post fall humanity but a sinlessness of Adam before the fall&lt;ref name="The"&gt;The SDA Bible Commentary, vol.5, p.1131.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream Adventists believe that Jesus was beset with all of the moral weaknesses and frailties that ordinary humans experience. However, he did not have the propensity to sin. Christ could be tested by temptation, but like Adam before the fall, did not have the ungodly desires or sinful inclinations of humanity.&lt;ref name="The" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/books/wwhc/&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen White states "The Lord Jesus came to our world, not to reveal what a God could do, but what a man could do, through faith in God’s power to help in every emergency. Man is, through faith, to be a partaker in the divine nature, and to overcome every temptation wherewith he is beset."&lt;ref name="Ellen G. White p. 929"&gt;[Ellen G. White, 7BC p. 929 par. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, he managed to resist temptation both from within and without, and lived a perfectly obedient life. Jesus is therefore set forth as the supreme Example in whose footsteps Christians must follow. The fact that he overcame sin completely, despite having no advantage over other human beings, demonstrates that we too can live a life of complete obedience by trusting in him.  [[Ellen White]] states "The Lord Jesus came to our world, not to reveal what a God could do, but what a man could do, through faith in God’s power to help in every emergency. Man is, through faith, to be a partaker in the divine nature, and to overcome every temptation wherewith he is beset."&lt;ref name="Ellen G. White p. 929"/&gt;

Adventists are firm believers that people are [[Sola fide|saved by faith and not through works]], however works are the necessary fruits that are proof of God truly being given a place in our lives.

And:
{{Quotation|"Notwithstanding that the sins of a guilty world were laid upon Christ, notwithstanding the humiliation of taking upon Himself '''our fallen nature''', the voice from heaven declared Him to be the Son of the Eternal" | [[Ellen White]], ''The Desire of Ages'', p. 112.}}

===Investigative judgment and salvation===
The ''[[Investigative Judgment]]'' doctrine is defined in the Church's list of fundamental beliefs.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/
| title = Fundamental Beliefs
| publisher = General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists
| accessdate = 2006-06-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing this uniquely Seventh-day Adventist doctrine, non-Adventist critics contend that it is not Biblical teaching.

Adventists answer that the ''Investigative Judgment'' doctrine is not about celestial geography, that a judgment of works is compatible with the gospel, and that Scriptures like {{Bibleverse|1|Peter|4:17}} and {{Bibleverse||Matthew|25}} teach an end-time judgment of the Church. They believe that the "end time gospel" of {{Bibleverse||Revelation|14:6-12}} did not sound in the first century but applies to our time. Also, many Adventist scholars interpret the references in Hebrews as to do with inauguration of the heavenly sanctuary, taking {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|6:19-20|HCSB}} as parallel to {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|10:19-20|HCSB}}, a view shared with certain biblical scholars of other faiths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author = Paul Ellingworth
| year = 1993
| title = The Epistle to the Hebrews ([[New International Greek Testament Commentary|NIGTC]])
| page= 518}}
&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the Day of Atonement event as interpreted by critics.

The essence of Old Testament sanctuary typology that Adventists rely on for their eschatology may be summarized as follows:

: The sanctuary services emphasized three aspects of Christ’s work for us: sacrifice, mediation, and judgment.

As to the 1844 date, Walter Martin wrote:

: Lest anyone reading the various accounts of the rise of "Millerism" in the United States come to the conclusion that Miller and his followers were "crackpots" or "uneducated tools of Satan," the following facts should be known: The Great Advent Awakening movement that spanned the Atlantic from Europe was bolstered by a tremendous wave of contemporary biblical scholarship. Although Miller himself lacked academic theological training, actually scores of prophetic scholars in Europe and the United States had espoused Miller's views before he himself announced them. In reality, his was only one more voice proclaiming the 1843/1844 fulfilment of {{Bibleverse||Daniel|8:14}}, or the 2300-year period allegedly dating from 457 B.C. and ending in A.D. 1843-1844.&lt;ref name="Martin2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholicism In Eschatology===
{{See also|Antichrist (historicism)|Seventh-day Adventist eschatology}}
Like the Protestant Reformers, some writings of Ellen White speak against the [[Catholic Church]] in preparation for a nefarious eschatological role as the antagonist against God's remnant church (the Seventh-day Adventist Church) and that the papacy is the beast that emerges from the sea (Ap 13).  Many Protestant reformers such as [[Martin Luther]], [[John Knox]], [[William Tyndale]] and others held similar beliefs about the Catholic Church and the papacy when they broke away from the Catholic Church during the reformation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehorsemedia.com/articles/?d=44 The Antichrist and the Protestant Reformation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dini ya Misambwa''' (Religion of the Ancestor) is an [[African traditional religion]] that has been labeled  an anti-colonial religion&lt;ref name="Institute of Current World Affairs"&gt;[http://www.icwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DER-20.pdf Newsletter], [[Institute of Current World Affairs]], August 1, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;. It is practiced primarily among the [[Luhya speaking people]] of Western [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="Kustenbauder"&gt;[http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/5326138/Kustenbauder%20-%20Prophetic%20Movements%20Eastern%20Africa%20-%20New%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Africa%20-%20DASH.pdf?sequence=1 Prophetic Movements: Eastern Africa], ''New Encyclopedia of Africa'', 4th edition Pages 261-270, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of religions to fight injustice is not new. Dini ya Misambwa, an [[African traditional religion]], stood against colonialism during the British colonial rule of Kenya. Among other things, it criticized the undermining, by the British colonial government, of elder authority and of the cultural values that had held Kenyan peoples together for ages. 


The undermining of cultural values was potentially more damaging than even the plunder of resources that's felt within the African continent today. We know that autonomous, purposive actors with the necessary capabilities and instruments often attempt to influence others to operate in an equilibrium in which degree of reciprocity and extent of influence establish the relative distribution of behavioral power within the international system (Ward &amp; House, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Ward, M. D., &amp; House, L. L. (1998). A Theory of the Behavioral Power of Nations : THE THEORY OF BEHAVIORAL ... The Journal of Conflict Resolution (1986-1998), 32(1), 3. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/236097972&lt;/ref&gt;

The old authority of the tribal elders had been undermined with the advent of colonial rule. It was the elders in turn who had lent power to the old tribal religion or [[African traditional religion]] and hence it too was also undermined. Left in a spiritual vacuum, many Bukusu and [[luhya people|luhya]], insecure in the rapidly-changing world, gravitated naturally into Christianity (Reed, 1954).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Reed, D. E. (1954). Dini ya Msambwa I: The Bukusu and The Suk. Institute of Current World Affairs, 1–18. Retrieved from http://www.icwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DER-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Masinde being an elder did not roll-over and run, he should not have been expected to.

Looking at most African countries, one realizes major damage caused by the undermining of traditional elder leadership and the traditional [[African traditional religions]] on the social imaginaries which make Africans who they are, continue to be an issue in every society. It is even more rampant when one thinks of the role religion plays in determining who they are, what they believe and how they should act and react. It’s clear, imported religions have their origin and this origin cannot be disassociated from the belief inherent in the religions. There is a need to free the mind of its conditionings that give priority to religion and may, therefore, serve to exclude other sources of identity derived from collective histories and collective experiences. The illusion into which religion plunges Africans is often the reason for the problems of identity which most African societies struggle with today. An awareness of this illusion and a new understanding of identity as derived from a shared African experience will go a long way in resolving the problem of identity in Africa (Muyingi, 2015). That is why it is important that anyone editing or deleting this post should provide authoritative citation and proof that they are not just trying to rewrite history.&lt;ref&gt;Muyingi, M. A. (2015). Religion : A New Struggle for African Identity. Asia Journal of Theology, 29(1), 88–99. https://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/2413-3086/2016/120&lt;/ref&gt;

We know from Max Weber that, the state is a relation of men dominating men, a relationship supported using legitimate (i.e. considered to be legitimate) violence (Schriften, Uni, Gerth, &amp; Mills, 1946).&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Schriften, G. P., Uni, M., Gerth, F. H. H., &amp; Mills, W. (1946). "Politics as a Vocation" Max Weber. Munich: Oxford University Press. Retrieved from http://fs2.american.edu/dfagel/www/Class Readings/Weber/PoliticsAsAVocation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Dini Ya Misambwa was therefore not anti-white but an anti-colonial rule, Reed (1954) reports that colonial rule undermined traditional rulers and the values, assumptions, beliefs, and expectations they stood for leaving a vacuum that Dini ya Msambwa tried to fill.

Reed (1954) also reports that the first European to reach Bukusu was Joseph Thomson, who arrived in 1883, he found the Bukusu living in fortified villages surrounded by moats. These were a protection against raids from the Uasin Gishu Masai and the Teso tribe of Uganda. British administration was established in North Nyanza in 1894. The following year the Bukusu killed 25 soldiers of the Sudanese garrison and a punitive expedition was undertaken against them. Their fortified villages were stormed by Sudanese troops and Africans from other tribes, and the fighting ended when the Bukusu acknowledged British rule and promised to abandon their villages. Today they live in scattered homesteads (Reed, 1954).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Although he reports ethnocentrically, we can glean from his writing that the country he found was not desperate, and there was no racism, but terms like “progress” implying adoption of “European way” are telling as for why they might have been resentment!&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

It was founded by [[Elijah Masinde]] in 1936. After Kenyan independence 1968 Dini ya Msambwa was made illegal and Masinde was arrested for fomenting Christian religion hatred.
“The essence of neo-colonialism is that the State which is subject to it is, in theory, independent and has all the outward trappings of international sovereignty. In reality, its economic system and thus its political policy is directed from outside” - Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah (1909–1972). That was the objection that leads to Dini ya Misambwa being banned in post-colonial Kenya not hatred to white people (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016). Secondly, a point must be made that
Western scholars were the first to write about ATR. Thus they dominated the study of [[African traditional religions]]. Their writings were borne out of prejudice or probably out of the impatience of the researchers to look at the universal meaning of the terms they used to describe the religious life of African people cited from Asukwo, Adaka &amp; Dimgba, (2013) by (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016). [[African traditional religions ]](ATR) practices have suffered from various racial and is leading terminologies. These terminologies which include, but not limited to paganism, heathenism, fetishism, savage, ancestral worship, juju and animism have been used widely by Euro-American
missionaries and researchers in an attempt to belittle African people and religion (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Bonsu, N. O., &amp; Ed, B. (2016). [[African traditional religions]] : An Examination of Terminologies Used for Describing the Indigenous Faith of African People, Using an Afrocentric Paradigm by.

Dini Ya Misambwa is, therefore, an [[African traditional religions|African traditional religion]]; its followers worshiping in Nyasaye/Were, God is an English word, it has other words in other languages Nyasaye or Were is God in Luhya. Through Ancestral Spirits (Misambwa) in shrines. Just like Abraham, Joseph, Muhamed are ancestors of Christians or Muslims, the people who come before you play a big role in value formation; so it happens in [[African traditional religions]] (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016)

'''Divine command theory''' (also known as '''theological voluntarism''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/ Theological Voluntarism]&amp;nbsp;— [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[medieval theological voluntarism]] and [[theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] theory which proposes that an action's status as [[Morality|morally]] [[good]] is equivalent to whether it is commanded by [[God]]. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that for a person to be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.

Numerous variants of the theory have been presented: historically, figures including [[Saint Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] have presented various versions of divine command theory; more recently, [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] has proposed a "modified divine command theory" based on the [[omnibenevolence]] of God in which morality is linked to human conceptions of right and wrong. [[Paul Copan]] has argued in favour of the theory from a Christian viewpoint, and [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski]]'s divine motivation theory proposes that God's motivations, rather than commands, are the source of morality.

Semantic challenges to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued that to be commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, [[Atheism|atheists]] and [[Agnosticism|agnostics]] could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on [[Modal logic|modal]] grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], first proposed by [[Plato]] (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral [[autonomy]] and [[religious pluralism]], although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.

==General form==
Various forms of divine command theory have been presented by philosophers including [[William of Ockham]], [[St Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], and [[John Calvin]]. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of [[God]] and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is the only reason that a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin 1993, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The theory asserts that good actions are morally good as a result of their being commanded by God, and many [[religious belief|religious believers]] subscribe to some form of divine command theory.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson, Holmgren 2010, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/ | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine command theory features in the ethics of many modern religions, including [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], and [[Christianity]], as well as being a part of numerous older [[polytheism|polytheistic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Rae 2009, ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Athens]], it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 2011, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

===Augustine===
[[Saint Augustine]] offered a version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as the pursuit of the supreme good, which delivers human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment.&lt;ref name=IEP-2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H2 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=15 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine supported [[Plato|Plato's]] view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting [[autonomy#Philosophy|autonomously]].&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, Keller, Leever &amp; White 2009, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Duns Scotus===
[[File:JohnDunsScotus.jpg|thumb|John Duns Scotus, who proposed a variant of divine command theory]]
[[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher [[John Duns Scotus]] argued that the only moral obligations that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Revelation: From Metaphor to Analogy | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Swinburne, Richard | year=2007 | pages=358–359 | isbn=978-0-19-921246-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus argued that the [[natural law]], in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently [[logical truth|analytically true]] and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the [[Ten Commandments]]. The last seven of the [[Ten Commandments]] do not belong to the natural law in the strictest sense.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, "Do all the precepts of the Decalogue belong to the natural law?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst our duties to God are [[Self-evidence|self-evident]], [[Analytic proposition|true by definition]], and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments "''are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily''".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, Q. UN, para. 25, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2013|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/#NatLaw Ethics and Moral Psychology: The natural law]}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=312–316}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Cross|1999|p=92}} for the view that our duties to others "hold automatically [i.e., without God's commands] unless God commands otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that "those of weak character" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without. Hence, the last seven commandments do belong to the natural law, but not in the strictest sense, as they belong to the natural law by rectitude rather than by definition.

===St. Thomas Aquinas===

Whilst Aquinas, as a natural law theorist, is generally seen as holding that morality is not willed by God,&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#NatLaw&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly James Clark and Anne Poortenga have presented a defence of divine command theory based on [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas']] moral theory. Aquinas proposed a theory of natural law which asserted that something is moral if it works towards the purpose of human existence, and so human nature can determine what is moral. Clark and Poortenga argued that God created human nature and thus commanded a certain morality; hence he cannot arbitrarily change what is right or wrong for humans.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
The [[deontological ethics]] of [[Immanuel Kant]] has been cast as rejecting divine command theory by several figures, among whom is ethicist [[R. M. Hare]]. Kant's view that morality should be determined by the [[categorical imperative]]&amp;nbsp;– duty to the moral law, rather than acting for a specific end&amp;nbsp;– has been viewed as incompatible with divine command theory. Philosopher and theologian [[John E. Hare]] has noted that some philosophers see divine command theory as an example of Kant's [[heteronomy|heteronomous will]]&amp;nbsp;– motives besides the moral law, which Kant regarded as non-moral.&lt;ref name=PT263&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; American philosopher [[Lewis White Beck]] takes Kant's argument to be a refutation of the theory that morality depends of divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; John E. Hare challenges this view, arguing that [[Kantian ethics]] should be seen as compatible with divine command theory.&lt;ref name=PT263/&gt;

===Robert Adams===
[[File:RobertMerrihewAdams20060625.jpg|thumb|Robert Merrihew Adams proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory"]]
American philosopher [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory".&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; Adams presents the basic form of his theory by asserting that two statements are equivalent:
#It is wrong to do X.
#It is contrary to God's commands to do X.&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008/&gt;
He proposes that God's commands precurse moral truths and must be explained in terms of moral truths, not the other way around. Adams writes that his theory is an attempt to define what being ethically 'wrong' consists of and accepts that it is only useful to those within a [[Judeo-Christian]] context. In dealing with the criticism that a seemingly immoral act would be obligatory if God commanded it, he proposes that God does not command cruelty for its own sake. Adams does not propose that it would be logically impossible for God to command cruelty, rather that it would be unthinkable for him to do so because of his nature. Adams emphasises the importance of [[faith]] in God, specifically faith in God's goodness, as well as his existence.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams proposes that an action is morally wrong [[if and only if]] it defies the commands of a loving God. If cruelty was commanded, he would not be loving; Adams argued that, in this instance, God's commands would not have to be obeyed and also that his theory of ethical wrongness would break down. He proposed that divine command morality assumes that human concepts of right and wrong are met by God's commands and that the theory can only be applied if this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2003, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Adams' theory attempts to counter the challenge that morality might be arbitrary, as moral commands are not based solely on the commands of God, but are founded on his [[omnibenevolence]]. It attempts to challenge the claim that an external standard of morality prevents God from being sovereign by making him the source of morality and his character the moral law.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"/&gt;

Adams proposes that in many Judeo-Christian contexts, the term 'wrong' is used to mean being contrary to God's commands. In ethical contexts, he believes that 'wrong' [[logical consequence|entails]] an [[emotivism|emotional]] attitude against an action and that these two uses of wrongness usually correlate.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 561-2&lt;/ref&gt; Adams suggests that a believer's concept of morality is founded in their religious belief and that right and wrong are tied to their belief in God; this works because God always commands what believers accept to be right. If God commanded what a believer perceived as wrong, the believer would not say it is right or wrong to disobey him; rather their concept of morality would break down.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Austin writes that an implication of this modified divine command theory is that God cannot command cruelty for its own sake; this could be argued to be inconsistent with God's omnipotence. Thomas Aquinas argued that God's omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do all things that are possible: he attempted to refute the idea that God's inability to perform illogical actions challenges his omnipotence. Austin contends that commanding cruelty for its own sake is not illogical, so is not covered by Aquinas' defence, although Aquinas had argued that sin is the falling short of a perfect action and thus not compatible with omnipotence.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7a | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories===
[[Paul Copan]] argues from a Christian viewpoint that man, made in God's image, conforms to God's sense of morality. The description of actions as right or wrong are therefore relevant to God; a person's sense of what is right or wrong corresponds to God's.&lt;ref name=Copan&gt;Copan, Paul, and William Lane Craig. ''Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics.'' Nashville, Tennessee: B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2007. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|We would not know goodness without God's endowing us with a moral constitution. We have rights, dignity, freedom, and responsibility because God has designed us this way. In this, we reflect God's moral goodness as His image-bearers.|Paul Copan|Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics&lt;ref name="Copan" /&gt;}}

As an alternative to divine command theory, Linda Zagzebski has proposed divine motivation theory, which still fits into a monotheistic framework. According to this theory, goodness is determined by God's motives, rather than by what he commands. Divine motivation theory is similar to [[virtue ethics]] because it considers the character of an agent, and whether they are in accordance with God's, as the standard for moral value.&lt;ref&gt;Baggett &amp; Walls 2011, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Zagzebski argues that things in the world have objective moral properties, such as being lovable, which are given to them through God's perception of them. God's attitude towards something is cast as a morally good attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-238093747.html | title=Zagzebski, Linda Trinkaus. Divine Motivation Theory.(Book review) | publisher=The Review of Metaphysics | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=25 August 2012 | author=Toner, Christopher |via=[[HighBeam]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory casts God as a good example for morality, and humans should imitate his virtues as much as is possible for finite, imperfect beings.&lt;ref&gt;Langermann 2011, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections==

===Semantic objections===
Philosopher William Wainwright considered a challenge to the theory on semantic grounds, arguing that "being commanded by God" and "being obligatory" do not mean the same thing, contrary to what the theory suggests. He used the example of water not having an identical meaning to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to propose that "being commanded by God" does not have an identical meaning to "being obligatory". This was not an objection to the truth of divine command theory, but Wainwright believed it demonstrated that the theory should not be used to formulate assertions about the meaning of obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Wainwright also noted that divine command theory might imply that one can only have moral knowledge if one has knowledge of God; Edward Wierenga argued that, if this is the case, the theory seems to deny atheists and agnostics moral knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Storer Chandler has challenged the theory based on [[modal logic|modal]] ideas of what might exist in different worlds. He suggested that, even if one accepts that being commanded by God and being morally right are the same, they may not be synonyms because they might be different in other possible worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler 2007, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral motivation===
Michael Austin has noted that divine command theory could be criticised for prompting people to be moral with impure motivations. He writes of the objection that a moral life should be sought because morality is valued, rather than to avoid punishment or receive a reward. This punishment and reward system of motivation could be seen as inadequate.&lt;ref name=IEP-2 /&gt;

===Euthyphro dilemma===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato presents the Euthyphro dilemma in one of his dialogues.]]
{{Main|Euthyphro dilemma}}
The [[Euthyphro dilemma]] was proposed in [[Plato|Plato's]] dialogue between [[Socrates]] and [[Euthyphro]]. In the scene, Socrates and Euthyphro are discussing the nature of piety when Socrates presents the dilemma, which can be presented as the question 'Is X good because God commands it, or does God command X because it is good?'&lt;ref name=IEPPlato&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H3 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?|Plato|Euthyphro&lt;ref name=IEPPlato/&gt;}}
The Euthyphro dilemma can elicit the response that an action is good because God commands the action, or that God commands an action because it is good. If the first is chosen, it would imply that whatever God commands must be good: even if he commanded someone to inflict suffering, then inflicting suffering must be moral. If the latter is chosen, then morality is no longer dependent on God, defeating the divine command theory. Additionally, if God is subject to an external law, he is not sovereign or [[omnipotent]], which would challenge the orthodox conception of God. Proponents of the Euthyphro dilemma might claim that divine command theory is obviously wrong because either answer challenges the ability of God to give moral laws.&lt;ref name=IEPPlato/&gt;

[[William of Ockham]] responded to the Euthyphro Dilemma by '[[bite the bullet|biting the bullet]]'. He argued that, if God did command people to be cruel, then that would be morally obligatory, proposing that the only limitation to what God can make obligatory is the [[principle of non-contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Moral Dilemmas in Medieval Thought: From Gratian to Aquinas | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Dougherty, M. V. | year=2011 | pages=163–164 | isbn=978-1-107-00707-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] defended Ockham's view, noting that it is only a logical possibility that God would command what we consider to be immoral, not an actuality. Even if God could logically command these actions, he would not because that is not his character.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH4 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleonore Stump and [[Norman Kretzmann]] have responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by appealing to the doctrine of [[divine simplicity]], a concept associated with Aquinas and [[Aristotle]] which suggests that the substance and attributes of God are identical. They propose that God and goodness are identical and that this is what makes his commands good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=God, Goodness and Philosophy | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | author=Harris, Harriet | year=2011 | pages=101 | isbn=978-1-4094-2852-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American philosopher [[William Alston]] responded to the [[Euthyphro dilemma]] by considering what it means for God to be morally good. If divine command theory is accepted, it implies that God is good because he obeys his own commands; Alston argued that this is not the case and that God's goodness is distinct from abiding by moral obligations. He suggested that a moral obligation implies that there is some possibility that the agent may not honour their obligation; Alston argued that this possibility does not exist for God, so his morality must be distinct from simply obeying his own commands. Alston contended that God is the supreme standard of morality and acts according to his character, which is necessarily good. There is no more arbitrariness in this view than accepting another moral standard.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Omnibenevolence===
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and some more recent philosophers, challenged the theory because it seems to entail that God's goodness consists of his following his own commands. It is argued that, if divine command theory is accepted, God's obligations would be what he commanded himself to do; the concept of God commanding himself is seen as incoherent. Neither could God hold any virtues, as a virtue would be the disposition to follow his own commands&amp;nbsp;– if he cannot logically command himself, then he cannot logically have any virtues. Edward Wierenga counters this by claiming that whatever God chooses to do is good, but that his nature means that his actions would always be praiseworthy. William Wainwright argues that, although God does not act because of his commands, it is still logical to say that God has reasons for his actions. He proposes that God is motivated by what is morally good and, when he commands what is morally good, it becomes morally obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7b | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomy===
Michael Austin draws attention to an objection from autonomy, which argues that morality requires an agent to freely choose which principles they live by. This challenges the view of divine command theory that God's will determines what is good because humans are no longer autonomous, but followers of an imposed moral law, making autonomy incompatible with divine command theory. Robert Adams challenges this criticism, arguing that humans must still choose to accept or reject God's commands and rely on their independent judgement about whether or not to follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7c | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
Austin considers the view that, in a world of [[religious pluralism]], it is impossible to know which god's or religion's commands should be followed, especially because some religions contradict others, leaving it impossible to accept all of them. Within religions there are also various interpretations of what is commanded. Austin notes that some of the responses to the autonomy objection may be relevant, as an agent must choose whichever [[religion and morality]] they judge to be correct. He argues that divine command theory is also consistent with the view that [[Ethics in religion|moral truths can be found in all religions]] and that moral revelation can be found [[Morality without religion|apart from religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7d | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heimir Geirsson and Margaret Holmgren argue against the view that different religions can lead to the same God because some religions are incompatible with each other (monotheistic and polytheistic religions have contrasting views of divinity, for example, and some Greek or Norse gods magnified human weaknesses). They argue that determining which god should be listened to remains a problem and that, even within a religion, contrasting views of God exist&amp;nbsp;– the commands of God in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s could seem to contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson &amp; Holmgren 2010, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethics]] involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'': [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt; A central aspect of ethics is "the good life", the life worth living or life that is simply satisfying, which is held by many philosophers to be more important than traditional [[Morality|moral]] conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, P. (1993) ''Practical Ethics'', 2nd edition (p.10), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[religion]]s have an [[ethics|ethical]] component, often derived from purported supernatural [[revelation]] or guidance. Some assert that religion is necessary to live ethically. Blackburn states that there are those who "would say that we can only flourish under the umbrella of a strong social order, cemented by common adherence to a particular religious tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Simon|first= Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist ethics==
{{Main|Buddhist ethics}}
Ethics in [[Buddhism]] are traditionally based on the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]] perspective of the [[Buddha]], or other enlightened beings who followed him. Moral instructions are included in [[Buddhist scriptures]] or handed down through tradition. Most scholars of Buddhist ethics thus rely on the examination of Buddhist scriptures, and the use of anthropological evidence from traditional Buddhist societies, to justify claims about the nature of Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown ''The Nature of Buddhist Ethics'' Macmillan 1992; Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

According to traditional Buddhism, the foundation of Buddhist ethics for laypeople is the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]]: no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, or intoxicants. In becoming a Buddhist, or affirming one's commitment to Buddhism, a layperson is encouraged to vow to abstain from these negative actions. Buddhist monks and nuns take hundreds more such vows (see [[vinaya]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The sole reliance on traditional formulae or practices, however, can be questioned by Western Buddhists whose main concern is the practical solution of complex moral problems in the modern world. To find a justifiable approach to such problems it may be necessary not just to appeal to the precepts or the ''vinaya'', but to use more basic Buddhist teachings (such as the [[Middle Way]]) to aid interpretation of the precepts and find more basic justifications for their usefulness relevant to all human experience. This approach avoids basing Buddhist ethics solely on faith in the Buddha's enlightenment or Buddhist tradition, and may allow more universal non-Buddhist access to the insights offered by Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html Robert Ellis ''A Buddhist theory of moral objectivity'' (Ph.D. thesis)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723211924/http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha provided some basic guidelines for acceptable behavior that are part of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. The initial percept is non-injury or non-violence to all living creatures from the lowest insect to humans. This precept defines a non-violent attitude toward every living thing. The Buddhist practice of this does not extend to the extremes exhibited by Jainism, but from both the Buddhist and Jain perspectives, non-violence suggests an intimate involvement with, and relationship to, all living things.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson, ''The Different Paths of Buddhism'' p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravada monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] has observed:
:"Buddhist ethics, as formulated in the five precepts, is sometimes charged with being entirely negative. ... [I]t has to be pointed out that the five precepts, or even the longer codes of precepts promulgated by the Buddha, do not exhaust the full range of Buddhist ethics. The precepts are only the most rudimentary code of moral training, but the Buddha also proposes other ethical codes inculcating definite positive virtues. The Mangala Sutta, for example, commends reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude, patience, generosity, etc. Other discourses prescribe numerous family, social, and political duties establishing the well being of society. And behind all these duties lie the four attitudes called the "immeasurables" — loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (1994). For other examples of Buddhist discourses that promote ethical behaviors among laity see, for instance, the [[Sigalovada Sutta]] (referred to as "the [[Vinaya]] of the householder" by [[Buddhaghosa]]) and the [[Dhammika Sutta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian ethics==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
{{Main|Christian ethics}}
{{See also|Sermon on the Mount|The New Commandment|Ministry of Jesus}}

Christian ethics in general has tended to stress the need for love, [[divine grace|grace]], [[mercy]], and [[forgiveness]] because of [[Christian views on sin|sin]]. With divine assistance, the Christian is called to become increasingly [[Virtuous#Christian tradition|virtuous]] in both thought and deed, see also the [[Evangelical counsels]]. Conversely, the Christian is also called to abstain from [[vice]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Christian ethical principles are based on the teachings within the [[Bible]]. They begin with the notion of inherent sinfulness, which requires essential [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. Sin is estrangement from God which is the result of not doing God's will.  God's will can be summed up by the precept: "Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and your neighbor as yourself", commonly called the [[Great Commandment]]. Christian ethics are founded upon the concept of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] which transforms a person's life and enable's one to choose and act righteously.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As sin is both individual and social, so is grace applied to both the individual and society.  Christian ethics has a [[teleological]] aspect—all ethical behavior is oriented towards a vision of the [[Kingdom of God]]—a righteous society where all live in peace and harmony with God and nature, as envisioned in the [[Book of Isaiah]]. Specific ethical behaviors originate in the [[Old Testament]]’s [[Ten Commandments]], and are enriched by teachings in the Psalms and morals contained in historical accounts, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

Christian ethics is not substantially different from [[Jewish ethics]], except in the exhortation to [[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|love one's enemy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Perhaps the greatest contribution of Christian ethics is this command to love one's enemies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  It has been argued (see [[Ched Myers]]'s ''Binding the Strong Man'', and [[John Howard Yoder]]'s ''The Politics of Jesus'') that Jesus was waging a [[Nonviolent revolution|non-violent campaign]] against the [[Jewish–Roman wars|Roman oppressors]] and many of his sayings relate to this campaign--[[turn the other cheek]], go the second mile, etc. Understanding these commands as part of a larger campaign makes it impossible to interpret Christian ethics as an individual ethic.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  It is both an individual and a social ethic concerned with life here on earth.

Other tenets include maintaining personal integrity and the absence of hypocrisy, as well as honesty and loyalty, mercy and forgiveness, rejection of materialism and the desire for wealth and power, and teaching others in your life through personal joy, happiness and Godly devotion.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

There are several different schema of vice and virtue. [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] adopted the four cardinal virtues of Aristotle (justice, courage, temperance and prudence), and added to them the Christian virtues of faith, hope and charity (from St.Paul, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|13}}). Other schema include the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] and the [[Seven virtues]]. For more see [[Christian philosophy]] and [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

==Confucian ethics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Confucianism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]] emphasize the maintenance and propriety of relationships as the most important consideration in ethics. To be ethical is to do what one's relationships require. Notably, though, what you owe to another person is inversely proportional to their distance from you. In other words, you owe your parents everything, but you are not in any way obligated towards strangers. This can be seen as a recognition of the fact that it is impossible to love the entire world equally and simultaneously. This is called relational ethics, or [[situational ethics]]. The Confucian system differs very strongly from [[Kantian ethics]] in that there are rarely laws or principles which can be said to be true absolutely or universally.

This is not to say that there has never been any consideration given to universalist ethics. In fact, in [[Zhou Dynasty]] China, the Confucians' main opponents, the followers of [[Mozi]] argued for universal love ({{Zh|s=兼爱|p=jiān ài}}). The Confucian view eventually held sway, however, and continues to dominate many aspects of Chinese thought. Many have argued, for example, that [[Mao Zedong]] was more Confucian than Communist.
Confucianism, especially of the type argued for by [[Mencius]] ({{Zh|s=孟子|p=mèng zĭ}}), argued that the ideal ruler is the one who (as Confucius put it) "acts like the North Star, staying in place while the other stars orbit around it". In other words, the ideal ruler does not go out and force the people to become good, but instead leads by example. The ideal ruler fosters harmony rather than laws.

Confucius stresses [[honesty]] above all. His concepts of [[lĭ]] ({{Zh|s=理}}), [[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]] ({{Zh|s=義}}), and [[Ren (Confucianism)|rén]] ({{Zh|s=仁}}) can be seen as deeper expressions of honesty ({{Zh|s=誠|p=[[chéng]]|l=[[sincerity]]}}) and [[fidelity]] ({{Zh|s=孝|p=[[xiào]]}}) to the ones to whom one owes one's existence (parents) and survival (one's neighbours, colleagues, inferiors in rank). He codified traditional practice and actually changed the meaning of the prior concepts that those words had meant. His model of the Confucian family and Confucian ruler dominated Chinese life into the early 20th century. This had ossified by then into an Imperial hierarchy of rigid [[property rights]], hard to distinguish from any other [[dictatorship]]. Traditional ethics had been perverted by [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]].

===Buddhist influence===
Buddhism, and specifically [[Mahayana Buddhism]], brought a cohesive metaphysic to Chinese thought and a strong emphasis on universalism. Neo-Confucianism was largely a reaction to Buddhism's dominance in the [[Tang dynasty]], and an attempt at developing a native Confucian metaphysical/analytical system.

==Daoist ethics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Laozi]] (Lao Tzu) and other [[Daoist|Taoist]] (Daoist) authors argued for an even greater passivity on the part of rulers than did the Confucians. For Laozi, (Lao Tzu) the ideal ruler is one who does virtually nothing that can be directly identified as ruling. Clearly, both Daoism and Confucianism presume that human nature is basically good. The main branch of Confucianism, however, argues that human nature must be nurtured through ritual (''[[Li (Confucian)|li]]'' 禮), culture (''[[Chinese culture|wen]]'' 文) and other things, while the Daoists (Taoists) argued that the trappings of society were to be gotten rid of.

Taoist ethics ask for a greater ''sense of being'' and less identification with ''the act of''  ''doing''.  Taoist ''passivity'' nurtures, cultivates and prepares an atmosphere that allows ''the majestic'' and ''the real'' to shine, which influences society for the better.    - "If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself; if you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, then eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself.  Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation."   - Lao Tzu

==Hindu ethics==
{{Main|Hinduism|Yamas|Niyamas}}
[[File:Non violence sculpture by carl fredrik reutersward malmo sweden.jpg|thumb|[[Ahimsa]] - non-violence in action, words and thoughts - is considered the highest ethical value and virtue in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=evpc&gt;Stephen H. Phillips &amp; other authors (2008), in Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, &amp; Conflict (Second Edition), {{ISBN|978-0123739858}}, Elsevier Science, Pages 1347–1356, 701-849, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; Above: non-violence sculpture by [[Carl Fredrik Reutersward]] in [[Malmo, Sweden]].]]

Ethics is called Nitisastra (Sanskrit: नीतिशास्त्र)&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+ethics&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Ethics] Sanskrit English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; in ancient texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=agw&gt;Alban G. Widgery (1930), The Principles of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 40, No. 2 (Jan., 1930), pp. 232-245&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics and virtue are a much debated&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Hindery (2004), Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions, {{ISBN|978-8120808669}}; pages 268-72;
*Quote: "(In Hinduism), srutis did not pretend to deal with all situations or irregularities in the moral life, leaving these matters to human reasons (Mbh Xii.109); Accordingly, that again which is virtue may, according to time and place, be sin (...); Under certain conditions, acts that are apparently evil (such as violence) can be permitted if they produce consequences that are good (protection of children and women in self defense when the society is attacked in war)
*Quote: "(The Hindu scripture) notes the interrelationship of several virtues, consequentially. Anger springs from covetousness; (the vice of) envy disappears in consequence of (the virtues) of compassion and knowledge of self (Mbh Xii.163);&lt;/ref&gt; and an evolving concept in ancient scriptures of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, S. Cromwell (1982), The evolution of Hindu ethical ideals, Asian Studies Program, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker and Becker (2001), Encyclopedia of Ethics, {{ISBN|978-0415936729}}, 2nd Edition, Routledge, pages 845-848&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue, right conduct, ethics and morality are part of the complex concept Hindus call [[Dharma]] - everything that is essential for people, the world and nature to exist and prosper together, in harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rosen (2006), Essential Hinduism, Praeger, {{ISBN|0-275-99006-0}}, page 31-45&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Pandurang Vaman Kane|P.V. Kane]], the author of the [[History of Dharmaśāstra|History of Dharmasastra]] said, the term "Dharma" does not have a synonym in English language. While it is often interpreted as meaning "duty", it can mean justice, right, moral, good, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kane, P.V. (1962), History of Dharmasastra (Ancient and Medieval Religious and Civil Law in India),|last=Kane|first=P. V.|publisher=Bhandarkar Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=Pune|pages=Volume 1, pp 2–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics are explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, [[Apastamba]] explained it thus: "virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagoner, see Foreword, in Srinivasan, Dharma: Hindu Approach to a Purposeful Life, {{ISBN|978-1-62209-672-5}};
* Also see: Apastamba, Dharma Sutra, 1.20.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics that constitute a [[dharma|dharmic]] life  - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Ethical subjects and questions are debated by various schools of Hinduism, quite extensively, in numerous texts on what is right conduct, when, how and why.&lt;ref name=agw/&gt; Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' (forgiveness), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (freedom from anger).&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, K. N. (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought: A Philosophical Study of Hindu, Jaina, and Buddhist Morals, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1608-4}}, pp 52-55&lt;/ref&gt; In later verses, this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' ([[Ahimsa|Non-violence]]), ''Dama'' ([[Temperance (virtue)|self restraint]]), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B. (2006). BHAGAVAD GĪTĀ AS DUTY AND VIRTUE ETHICS. Journal of Religious Ethics, 34(3), 373-395.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohapatra &amp; Mohapatra, Hinduism: Analytical Study, {{ISBN|978-8170993889}}; see pages 37-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian historian [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al Biruni]] who visited and lived in India for 16 years in the early 11th century, describes the concept of ethics and virtuous behavior among Hindus of his times.

Hindu literature variously discuss ethics as one or more of four topics: (1) ''Gunas'' that is inner tendencies of conduct found in every individual (in large measure, psychology); (2) ''Purushartha'' that is proper aims of life for every individual for self-development and happiness ([[dharma]], [[artha]], [[kama]] and [[moksha]]); (3) ''Ashramas'' that is ethics for an individual in different periods of one's lifetime (ethical expectations for a child are distinguished from those for adults, old age); and (4) ''Varnasramas'' that is ethics and conduct for every individual in relation to society.&lt;ref name=agw/&gt; Ancient literature at the foundation of various Hindu traditions primarily discuss the first three, while the last has attracted greater attention since the 18th century. Some early 20th century literature wondered if ethics was ever a serious topic of study in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=wfg&gt;William F. Goodwin, Ethics and Value in Indian Philosophy, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Jan., 1955), pp. 321-344&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies have yielded the above four approaches to ethics in different schools of Hinduism, tied together with three common themes:&lt;ref name=agw/&gt;&lt;ref name=wfg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection - Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) ethics is an essential part of dharma concept,&lt;ref name=wfg2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arti Dhand (2002), The Dharma of Ethics, the Ethics of Dharma: Quizzing the Ideals of Hinduism, The Journal of Religious Ethics, Vol. 30, No. 3 (Fall, 2002), pp. 347-372&lt;/ref&gt; (2) Ahimsa (non-violence) is the foundational premise without which - suggests Hinduism - ethics and any consistent ethical theory is impossible,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection - Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, pages 87-96, 111-114, 131-257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

Reichenbach (1988), The Law of Karma and the Principle of Causation, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Oct., 1988), pp. 399-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. Perrett (1998), Hindu Ethics: A Philosophical Study, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824820855}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that the [[karma]] doctrine of Hinduism is part of its ethical theory compendium.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]]—considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong—argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as [[Ahimsa]] must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S.

==Islamic ethics==
{{Main|Islamic ethics}}{{See also|Halal|Haram}}
The foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the mankind has been [[fitrah|granted the faculty to discern]] God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence, which, as [[John Kelsay]] in the ''Encyclopedia of Ethics'' phrases, "ultimately points to the reality of God." Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a [[moral responsibility]] to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]], or the sayings of Muhammad) {{Quran-usc-range|7|172|173}}).&lt;ref name="EncEthic"&gt;''Islamic ethics'', Encyclopedia of Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished among one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on [[materialism]], according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' or "ignorance."&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

Muslims believe that Muhammad, like other [[prophets in Islam]], was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

# The division of Arabs into varying tribes (based upon blood and kinship). This categorization was confronted by the ideal of a unified community based upon [[taqwa|Islamic piety]], an "''[[ummah]]'';"
# The acceptance of the worship of a multitude of deities besides Allah - a view challenged by strict [[Tawhid|Islamic monotheism]], which dictates that Allah has no partner in worship nor any equal;
# The trait of ''muruwwa'' ([[Macho|manliness]]), which Islam discouraged, instead emphasizing on the traits of humility and piety;
# The focus on achieving fame or establishing a legacy, which was replaced by the concept that mankind would be called to account before God on the [[Qiyamah|day of resurrection]];
# The reverence of and compliance with ancestral traditions, a practice challenged by Islam — which instead assigned primacy to submitting to God and following revelation.

These changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, [[world view]], and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. For Muhammad, although [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] exemplified "heedlessness," it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one's near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of justice. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

Furthermore, a Muslim should not only follow these five main characteristics, but also be more broad about his morals. Therefore, the more the Muslim is applying these rules, the better that person is morally. For example,Islamic ethics can be applied by important verses in the Quran . The most fundamental characteristics of a Muslim are piety and humility.  A Muslim must be humble with God and with other people:

“And turn not your face away from people (with pride), nor walk in insolence through the earth.  Verily, God likes not each arrogant boaster.  And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice.  Verily, the harshest of all voices is the voice (braying) of the ass.”  (Quran 31:18-19)

Muslims must be in controls of their passions and desires.

A Muslim should not be vain or attached to the ephemeral pleasures of this world. While most people allow the material world to fill their hearts, Muslims should keep God in their hearts and the material world in their hand.  Instead of being attached to the car and the job and the diploma and the bank account, all these things become tools to make us better people.
Morality in Islam addresses every aspect of a Muslim's life, from greetings to international relations.  It is universal in its scope and in its applicability.  Morality reigns in selfish desires, vanity and bad habits.  Muslims must not only be virtuous, but they must also enjoin virtue.  They must not only refrain from evil and vice, but they must also forbid them.  In other words, they must not only be morally healthy, but they must also contribute to the moral health of society as a whole.

“You are the best of the nations raised up for (the benefit of) men; you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in God; and if the followers of the Book had believed it would have been better for them; of them (some) are believers and most of them are transgressors.” (Quran: 3:110)

Muhammad summarized the conduct of a Muslim when he said:

“My Sustainer has given me nine commands: to remain conscious of God, whether in private or in public; to speak justly, whether angry or pleased; to show moderation both when poor and when rich, to reunite friendship with those who have broken off with me; to give to him  who refuses me; that my silence should be occupied with thought; that my looking should be an admonition; and that I should command what is right.”

==Jewish ethics==
{{Main|Jewish ethics}}
Jewish ethics may be said to originate with the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], its broad legal injunctions, wisdom narratives and prophetic teachings. Most subsequent Jewish ethical claims may be traced back to the texts, themes and teachings of the written Torah.

In early rabbinic Judaism, the [[Oral Torah]] both interprets the Hebrew Bible and delves afresh into many other ethical topics. The best known rabbinic text associated with [[ethics]] is the non-legal [[Mishnah]] [[Mishnah|tractate]] of ''[[Pirkei Avot|Avot]]'', popularly translated as ''Ethics of the Fathers''. Generally, ethics is a key aspect of non-legal rabbinic literature, known as [[aggadah]], and ethical teachings are found throughout the more legal ([[halakhic]]) portions of the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]] and other rabbinic literature.  This early Rabbinic ethics shows signs of cross-fertilization and polemical exchange with both the Greek (Western philosophical) ethical tradition and early [[Christian]] tradition.

In the medieval period, direct Jewish responses to Greek ethics may be seen in major rabbinic writings. Notably, [[Maimonides]] offers a Jewish interpretation of [[Aristotle]] (e.g., ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''), who enters into Jewish discourse through Islamic writings. Maimonides, in turn, influences [[Thomas Aquinas]], a dominant figure in Catholic ethics and the [[natural law]] tradition of moral theology. The relevance of natural law to medieval [[Jewish philosophy]] is a matter of dispute among scholars.

===Hellenistic influence===
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
Ethics in systematic form, and apart from religious belief, is as little found in apocryphal or Judæo-Hellenistic literature as in the Bible. However, Greek philosophy greatly influenced Alexandrian writers such as the authors of [[IV Maccabees]], the [[Book of Wisdom]], and [[Philo]].

Much progress in theoretical ethics came as Jews came into closer contact with the Hellenic world. Before that period the [[Wisdom literature]] shows a tendency to dwell solely on the moral obligations and problems of life as appealing to man as an individual, leaving out of consideration the ceremonial and other laws which concern only the Jewish nation. From this point of view [[Ben Sira]]'s collection of sayings and monitions was written, translated into Greek, and circulated as a practical guide. The book contains popular ethics in proverbial form as the result of everyday life experience, without higher philosophical or religious principles and ideals.

More developed ethical works emanated from [[Hasidean]] circles in the [[Maccabean]] time, such as are contained in [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], especially in Chapter IV. Here the first [[ethical will]] or testament is found, giving a summary of moral teachings, with the [[Golden Rule]], "Do that to no man which thou hatest!" as the leading maxim. There are even more elaborate ethical teachings in the ''[[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]'', in which each of the twelve sons of Jacob, in his last words to his children and children's children, reviews his life and gives them moral lessons, either warning them against a certain vice he had been guilty of, so that they may avoid divine punishment, or recommending them to cultivate a certain virtue he had practised during life, so that they may win God's favor. The chief virtues recommended are love for one's fellow man, industry, especially in agricultural pursuits, simplicity, sobriety, benevolence toward the poor, compassion even for the brute and avoidance of all passion, pride, and hatred. Similar ethical farewell monitions are attributed to Enoch in the [[Book of Enoch|Ethiopic Enoch]] (xciv. et seq.) and the [[Slavonic Enoch]] (lviii. et seq.) and to the three patriarchs.

The Hellenistic Jewish propaganda literature made the propagation of Jewish ethics taken from the Bible its main object for the sake of winning the pagan world to pure monotheism. It was owing to this endeavor that certain ethical principles were laid down as guiding maxims for the Gentiles, first of all the three capital sins, [[idolatry]], [[murder]], and [[incest]], were prohibited (see Sibyllines, iii. 38, 761; iv. 30 et seq.). In later Jewish [[rabbinic literature]] these [[Noachide Laws]] were gradually developed into six, seven, and ten, or thirty laws of ethics binding upon every human being.

==Germanic Neopagan ethics==
[[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic Neopagans]], including followers of both [[Asatru]] and [[Theodism]], try to emulate the ethical values of the ancient Germanic peoples ([[Norsemen|Norse]] or [[Anglo-Saxon]]) through the form of the [[Nine Noble Virtues]].

==Scientology ethics==
{{Main|Ethics (Scientology)}}
Scientology ethics is based upon the concepts of [[good and evil]]. Ethics may be defined as the actions an individual takes on itself to ensure its continued survival across the [[Scientology beliefs and practices#The Dynamics|dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617232906/http://scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm |archivedate=2006-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secular ethics==
{{Main|Morality without religion}} {{See also|Secular ethics}}
Secular ethics is a [[moral philosophy]] in which ethics are based solely on human faculties such as scientific reason, sociobiological composition, or ethical intuition, and not derived from purported supernatural revelation or guidance. Secular ethics comprise a wide variety of moral and ethical systems including [[consequentialism]], [[freethinking]], [[humanism]], [[secular humanism]], and [[utilitarianism]], among others.

The majority of secular moral concepts are based on the acceptance of [[natural rights]] and [[social contract]]s, and on a more individual scale of either some form of attribution of intrinsic value to things, [[Immanuel Kant|Kantianesque]] [[ethical intuitionism]] or of a logical deduction that establishes a preference for one thing over another, as with [[Occam's razor]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Approaches such as [[ethical egoism]], [[moral relativism]], [[moral skepticism]], and [[moral nihilism]] are also considered.

==Shinto ethics==
Shinto beliefs start with an assumption of the inherent goodness of humans as descendants of the ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"&gt;{{cite book |title= World Religions: The Great Faiths Explored &amp; Explained |edition= |last= Bowker|first= John|authorlink= John Bowker (theologian)|year= 1997|publisher= Dorling Kindersley Limited|location= London|isbn= 0-7894-1439-2|page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century CE, Shinto had drawn from a Chinese idea that good people will adhere to societal norms, and emperors have a divine mandate to bring about the "desirable and required order".&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"/&gt; Shinto adherents are to "realize and carry out the will of the ''kami'' and the ancestors in the family, the community, and the nation".&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"/&gt;

Although State Shinto reinforced subordination to the emperor and the state, Shrine Shinto is a situation-based ethical system that emphasizes right actions toward others, versus adherence to a specific belief system.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 108"&gt;{{cite book |title= World Religions: The Great Faiths Explored &amp; Explained |edition= |last= Bowker|first= John|authorlink= John Bowker (theologian)|year= 1997|publisher= Dorling Kindersley Limited|location= London|isbn= 0-7894-1439-2|page= 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrine Shinto also stresses gratefulness for "blessings of the ''kami''", and maintaining harmony with the emperor and the world.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 108"/&gt;

==Wiccan ethics==
{{Main|Wiccan morality}}
Wiccan morality is largely based on the [[Wiccan Rede]]: 'An' it harm none, do what ye will' -- old-fashioned language for 'as long as you aren't harming anyone, do as you wish'. While this could be interpreted to mean "do no harm at all", it is usually interpreted as a declaration of the freedom to act, along with the necessity of thinking through and taking responsibility for the consequences of one's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Harrow, Judy (1985) [http://www.draknet.com/proteus/rede.htm "Exegesis on the Rede"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QgCzLc0I?url=http://www.draknet.com/proteus/rede.htm |date=2007-07-28 }} in ''[[Harvest (Neopagan magazine)|Harvest]]'' vol. 5, Number 3 ([[Oimelc]] 1985). Retrieved 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another element of Wiccan Morality comes from the [[Rule of Three (Wiccan)|Law of Threefold Return]], which is understood to mean that whatever one does to another person or thing (benevolent or otherwise) returns with triple force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], ''High Magic's Aid'', London: Michael Houghton, 1949, p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in [[Doreen Valiente]]'s ''[[Charge of the Goddess]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Farrar|Farrar, Janet]] &amp; [[Stewart Farrar|Stewart]], ''Eight Sabbats for Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; these being [[Gladness|mirth]], [[reverence (emotion)|reverence]], [[honour]], [[humility]], strength, [[beauty]], [[Power (sociology)|power]] and [[compassion]]. In Valiente's poem they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In [[Hinduism]], [[Brahma]], the creator god, will live for 100 years, with each day of these years made up of two [[kalpa (aeon)|''kalpas'']], and each ''kalpa'' lasting  4.32 billion human years. The lifetime of Brahma, and thus the universe, is therefore predicted to last 315.36 trillion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Time|author=Dan Falk|year=2009|publisher=National Maritime Museum|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21081">{{Taoism}}
The history of [[Taoism]] stretches throughout Chinese history. Originating in prehistoric China, it has exerted a powerful influence over Chinese culture throughout the ages. Taoism evolved in response to changing times, with its doctrine and associated practices being revised and refined. The acceptance of Taoism by the ruling class has waxed and waned, alternately enjoying periods of favor and rejection. Most recently, Taoism has emerged from a period of suppression and is undergoing a revival in China.

[[Laozi]] is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoist religion and is closely associated in this context with "original", or "primordial", Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Whether he actually existed is disputed,&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 25"&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; however, the work attributed to him - the Daodejing - is dated to the 4th or 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; However, Taoism clearly predates Laozi (Lao Tzu) as he refers to "The Tao masters of antiquity" in Chapter 15 of the Daodejing ([[Tao Te Ching]]). Moreover, the '''[[Yellow Emperor]],''' Huangdi (2697–2597 BCE) Is often associated with origin of the Tao.

Sinologist Isabelle Robinet identifies four components in the emergence of Taoism:
#[[Taoism#Categorization|Philosophical Taoism]], i.e. the ''[[Daodejing]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''
#Techniques for achieving ecstasy
#Practices for achieving longevity or immortality
#Exorcism&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 25"/&gt;

Some elements of Taoism may be traced to [[prehistoric]] folk religions in China that later coalesced into a Taoist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Demerath (2003), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hucker (1995), pp. 203–04.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, many Taoist practices drew from the Warring-States-era phenomena of the [[Wu (shaman)]] (connected to the "shamanism" of Southern China) and the [[Fangshi]] (which probably derived from the "archivist-soothsayers of antiquity, one of whom supposedly was Laozi himself"), even though later Taoists insisted that this was not the case.&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 36"&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Both terms were used to designate individuals dedicated to "... magic, medicine, divination,... methods of longevity and to ecstatic wanderings" as well as exorcism; in the case of the ''wu'', "shamans" or "sorcerers" is often used as a translation.&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 36"/&gt; The ''fangshi'' were philosophically close to the [[School of Naturalists|School of Yin-Yang]], and relied much on astrological and calendrical speculations in their divinatory activities.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Han Dynasty (206 BCE&amp;ndash;220 CE)==
The term ''Daojia'' (usually translated as "philosophical Taoism") was coined during the [[Han Dynasty]]. In [[Sima Qian]]'s history (chapter 63) it refers to immortals; in Liu Xiang it refers to Laozi and Zhuangzi (''Daojiao'' came to be applied to the religious movements in later times). The earliest commentary on the ''Dao De Jing'' is that of [[Heshang Gong]] (the "Riverside Master"), a legendary figure depicted as a teacher to the Han emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Han Dynasty, the Tao came to be associated with or conflated with the [[Emperor Xian of Han|Xian Di Emperor]]. A major text from the [[Huang-Lao]] movement would be the ''[[Huainanzi]]'', which interprets earlier works of the Taoist canon in light of the quest for immortality.

The first organized form of Taoism, the [[Tianshi Dao|Tianshi]] (Celestial Masters') school (later known as [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi]] school), developed from the [[Five Pecks of Rice]] movement at the end of the 2nd century CE; the latter had been founded by [[Zhang Daoling]], who claimed that Laozi appeared to him in the year 142.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The Tianshi school was officially recognized by ruler [[Cao Cao]] in 215, legitimizing Cao Cao's rise to power in return.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celestial Masters' activities did hasten the downfall of the Han Dynasty, largely because Zhang's grandson set up a theocratic state into what is now [[Sichuan]] province. The same could be said of their contemporaries, the Taoist-leaning [[Yellow Turban]] sect.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three Kingdoms Period (220&amp;ndash;265)==
During the [[Three Kingdoms Period]], the [[Xuanxue]] (Mysterious Wisdom) school, including [[Wang Bi]], focused on the texts of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Many of the school's members, including Wang Bi himself, were not religious in any sense.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Bi mostly focused on reconciling Confucian thought with Taoist thought. Because the version of the Tao Te Ching that has been passed on to the present is the one that Wang Bi commented upon, his interpretations became very influential as they were passed on alongside the Tao Te Ching. In addition, his commentary was compatible with Confucian ideas and Buddhist ideas that later entered China. This compatibility ensured Taoism would remain an important aspect of Chinese culture, and made the merging of the three religions easier in later periods, such as the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/w/wangbi.htm Wang Bi [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six Dynasties (316&amp;ndash;589)==
Taoist alchemist [[Ge Hong]], also known as [[Baopuzi]] (抱扑子 The "Master Embracing Simplicity") was active in the third and fourth centuries and had great influence on later Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Major scriptures were produced during this time period, including The [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] (上清 "Supreme Clarity") (365&amp;ndash;370) and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] (靈寶 "Sacred Treasure") scriptures (397&amp;ndash;402) received at Maoshan. The Shangqing revelations were received by Yang Xi, a relative of Ge Hong's; the revelations emphasised meditative visualisation (內觀 ''neiguan''). They spoke of the Shangqing heaven, which stood above what had been previously considered the highest heaven by Celestial Master Taoists. Yang Xi's revelations consisted of visitations from the residents of this heaven (the "[[Zhenren]]") many of whom were ancestors of a circle of aristocrats from southern China. These Zhenren spoke of an apocalypse which was to arrive in 384, and claimed that only certain people from this aristocratic circle had been chosen to be saved. For the first century of its existence, Shangqing Taoism was isolated to this aristocratic circle. However, [[Tao Hongjing]] (456&amp;ndash;536) codified and wrote commentaries on Yang Xi's writings and allowed for the creation of Shangqing Taoism as a popular religion.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lingbao scriptures added some Buddhist elements such as an emphasis on universal salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during the [[Six Dynasties]] period, the Celestial Master movement re-emerged in two distinct forms. [[The Northern Celestial Masters]] were founded in 424 century by [[Kou Qianzhi]], and a Taoist theocracy was established that lasted until 450 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 284-285.&lt;/ref&gt; After this time, the Northern Celestial Masters were expelled from the Wei court and re-established themselves at Louguan where they survived into the [[Tang Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 284-289-290.&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Celestial Masters were centered at Jiankang (modern-day [[Nanjing]], and were likely made of those adherents who fled Sichuan and others who fled from [[Luoyang]] after its fall in 311 CE. These various followers of The Way of the Celestial Master coalesced to form a distinct form of Taoism known as the Southern Celestial Masters, who lasted as a distinct movement into the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tang Dynasty (618&amp;ndash;907)==
Taoism gained official status in China during the Tang Dynasty, whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was forced to compete with [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]], its major rivals, for patronage and rank. Emperor [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] (685&amp;ndash;762), who ruled at the height of the Tang, wrote commentaries on texts from all three of these traditions, which exemplifies the fact that in many people's lives they were not mutually exclusive. This marks the beginning of a long-lived tendency within imperial China, in which the government supported (and simultaneously regulated) all three movements.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Gaozong Emperor]] added the ''Tao Te Ching'' to the list of classics (''jing,'' 經) to be studied for the imperial examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Song Dynasty (960&amp;ndash;1279)==
Several Song emperors, most notably [[Emperor Huizong (Song Dynasty)|Huizong]], were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the ''[[Daozang]].''&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quanzhen]] school of Taoism was founded during this period, and together with the resurgent Celestial Masters called the [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi]] is one of the two schools of Taoism that have survived to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Song Dynasty]] saw an increasingly complex interaction between the elite traditions of organised Taoism as practised by ordained Taoist ministers (''daoshi'') and the local traditions of [[folk religion]] as practised by spirit mediums (''wu'') and a new class of non-ordained ritual experts known as ''fashi''.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; This interaction manifested itself in the integration of 'converted' local deities into the bureaucratically organised Taoist pantheon and the emergence of new exorcistic rituals, including the [[Celestial Heart Rites]] and the [[Thunder Rites]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 416-418, 423&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism were consciously synthesised in the [[Neo-Confucian]] school, which eventually became Imperial [[orthodoxy]] for state bureaucratic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. XVII.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yuan Dynasty (1279&amp;ndash;1367)==
[[File:Baiyun.jpg|thumb|500px|White Cloud Monastery in Beijing]]
Taoism suffered a significant setback in 1281 when many copies of the ''Daozang'' were ordered burned. This destruction gave Taoism a chance to renew itself.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper and Verellen (2004), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Neidan]]'', a form of [[internal alchemy]], became a major emphasis of the Quanzhen sect, whose practitioners followed a monastic model inspired by Buddhism. One of its leaders, Qiu Chuji became a teacher of [[Genghis Khan]] before the establishment of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. (and used his influence to save millions of lives). Originally from [[Shanxi]] and [[Shandong]], the sect established its main center in [[Beijing]]'s [[White Cloud Temple|Baiyunguan]] ("White Cloud Monastery").&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of the dynasty, the Celestial Masters sect (and Buddhism) again gained preeminence.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ming Dynasty (1368&amp;ndash;1644)==
In 1406, [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] emperor [[Zhu Di]] commanded that all Taoist texts be collected and combined into a new version of the ''Daozang.'' The text was finally finished in 1447, and took nearly forty years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper and Verellen (2004), p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qing Dynasty (1644&amp;ndash;1912)==
The fall of the Ming Dynasty and the subsequent establishment of the [[Qing Dynasty]] by the Manchus was blamed by some literati on religion, specifically Taoism. They sought to regain power by advocating a return to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] orthodoxy in a movement called ''Hanxue'', or "[[Han Learning]]." This movement returned the Confucian classics to favor and nearly completely rejected Taoism. During the eighteenth century, the [[Siku Quanshu|imperial library]] was constituted, but excluded virtually all Taoist books.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the twentieth century, Taoism had fallen much from favor (only one complete copy of the ''[[Daozang]]'' still remained, at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing).&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationalist Period (1912&amp;ndash;1949)==
[[Guomindang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party) leaders embraced science, modernity, and Western culture, including (to some extent) Christianity. Viewing the popular religion as reactionary and parasitic, they confiscated some temples for public buildings, and otherwise attempted to control traditional religious activity.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==People's Republic of China (1949&amp;ndash;present)==
The [[Communist Party of China]], officially atheistic, initially suppressed Taoism along with other religions. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976, many Taoist temples and sites were damaged and Monks and priests were sent to labor camps.&lt;ref name="Dean 1993, p. 41"&gt;Dean (1993), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution of Taoists stopped in 1979, and many Taoists began reviving their traditions.&lt;ref name="Dean 1993, p. 41"&gt;Dean (1993), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, many temples and monasteries have been repaired and reopened.

Taoism is one of five religions recognized by the PRC, which regulates its activities through the China Taoist Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hrwf.net/advocacy/ext/religious_freedom_china.pdf |title= Human Rights Without Frontiers "Religious Freedom in China in 2006" |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327075017/http://www.hrwf.net/advocacy/ext/religious_freedom_china.pdf |archivedate= 2009-03-27 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(30.6&amp;nbsp;KB)}} An address given to the Delegation EU-China of the European Parliament.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitive areas include the relationship of the [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi]] Taoists with their sect's lineage-holder, who lives in Taiwan, and various traditional temple activities such as astrology and shamanism, which have been criticized as "superstitious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oslocoalition.org/html/project_china/report_china_visit_2000.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001211132/http://www.oslocoalition.org/html/project_china/report_china_visit_2000.html|archivedate=2007-10-01|title=Report from The Oslo Coalition "Visit to China"|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taoism in the West==
From 1927-1944, the chief proponent of Taoism in the West was Professor [[Henri Maspero]] in Paris. [[Michael Saso]] was the first westerner to be initiated as a Taoist priest; he subsequently served also as co-editor of ''Taoist Resources''. Today, many Taoist organizations have been established in the West.

"Popular Western Taoism" is a term coined by Jonathan R. Herman in his 1998 review of [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[Daodejing]]'' "rendition", referring to the
&lt;blockquote&gt;abundance of new literature on Taoism by nonspecialists, including "translations" of Taoist texts by authors who (sometimes boastfully) lack linguistic competence. Scholars have been quick to reject such documents as ahistorical and inauthentic, and many do indeed combine questionable scholarship with a promiscuous blend of western individualism and new-age universalism. However, this popular western Taoism is not exclusively or even primarily a scholarly phenomenon; rather, it is an ''aesthetic'', ''cultural'', and ''religious'' phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Jonathan R.. 1998. "Review of Tao Te Ching: A Book About the Way and the Power of the Way". ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 66 (3). [Oxford University Press, American Academy of Religion]: 686–89. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1466152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This review was largely positive with some criticisms and cautions. While Herman states that the book "is not a useful text for informing students" about philosophical thought during the Chinese [[Warring States period]],
Herman praised the book as a "surprisingly interesting and scholastically responsible" example of western Daoist thought and as "an intelligent example of the emerging western transformation of Taoism, an area too often overlooked by sinologists." On the other hand, he criticized that Le Guin "make[s] some claims—or rather, employs some language—that may carry misleading implications", such as identifying Laozi "as a mystic and his perceptions as mystical, without ever defining the terms or questioning what generalizations can be drawn."

Herman subsequently described popular Western Taoism as the modern proliferation of self-proclaimed Daoist journals, meditation centers, websites, and renderings of Daoist texts by nonspecialists; and said, "not surprisingly, the sinological community (myself included) has generally greeted this overall phenomenon – what I will from here on label "popular Western Daoism" – with varying degrees of indifferences, amusement, and derision."&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Jonathan R. (2001), "Daoist Environmentalism in the West: Ursula K. Le Guin's Reception and Transmission of Daoism," in ''Daoism and Ecology'', ed. by N. J. Girardot et al., Harvard University Press, 391, 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1998 article about teaching Daoism, Russell Kirkland urged colleagues not to "Pooh-pooh Taoism" with "popular fluff" like Benjamin Hoff's coffee-table book ''[[The Tao of Pooh]]'', and characterized [[Stephen Mitchell (translator)|Stephen Mitchell]] and others as "self-indulgent dilettantes who deceive the public by publishing pseudo-translations of the ''Tao-te ching'', without having actually read the text in its original language".&lt;ref&gt;Russell Kirkland, "Teaching Taoism in the 1990s", ''Teaching Theology and Religion'', 1998, 1.2, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Komjathy described modern "Western Daoism" or "American Daoism" in [[religious studies]] terms, where "New Age discourse communities and advocates of Perennial Philosophy identify and interpret Daoist texts as part of a 'universal wisdom tradition'."&lt;ref&gt;Komjathy, Louis (2004), [http://www.daoistcenter.org/novareligio.pdf Tracing the Contours of Daoism in North America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226091433/http://www.daoistcenter.org/novareligio.pdf |date=2011-12-26 }}, ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', 8.2, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Komjathy later elaborated on these spiritual hybrids that "domesticate, sterilize and misrepresent Daoism", and may best be understood as part of a [[new religious movement]] labeled "Popular Western Taoism (PWT), with 'Taoism' pronounced with a hard 't' sound."&lt;ref&gt;Komjathy, Louis (2010), [http://www.daoistcenter.org/pwt.html Popular Western Taoism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211110432/http://www.daoistcenter.org/pwt.html |date=2015-12-11 }}, Center for Daoist Studies. This refers to the common {{IPA|/ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/}} mispronunciation of English ''Taoism'' {{IPA|/ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm/}} (see [[Daoism–Taoism romanization issue]]).&lt;/ref&gt; In this construct, "'Daoism' becomes anything for anyone", and Popular Western Taoism "has little to no connection with the Daoist religious tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Komjathy, Louis (2010),  [http://www.daoistcenter.org/daoist3.html Popular Construction of Daoist Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125122245/http://www.daoistcenter.org/daoist3.html |date=2015-11-25 }} , Center for Daoist Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperreligiosity''' is a psychiatric disturbance in which a person experiences intense religious beliefs or experiences that interfere with normal functioning.  Hyperreligiosity generally includes [[delusions|abnormal beliefs]] and a focus on religious content, which interferes with work and social functioning.  Hyperreligiosity may occur in a variety of disorders including [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=D. M.|last2=Novelly|first2=R. A.|last3=Walker|first3=P.

==Signs and symptoms==

Hyperreligiosity is characterized by an increased tendency to report spiritual, religious or mystical experiences, religious delusions, rigid legalistic thoughts,&lt;ref name="mpfc"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muramoto|first1=Osamu|title=The role of the medial prefrontal cortex in human religious activity|journal=Medical Hypotheses|date=1 January 2004|volume=62|issue=4|pages=479–485|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2003.10.010|pmid=15050093|issn=0306-9877}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} and extravagant expression of religiosity.&lt;ref name="volume"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wuerfel|first1=J.|last2=Krishnamoorthy|first2=E.

==Pathophysiology and cause==

Hyperreligiosity may be associated with epilepsy — in particular [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] involving [[complex partial seizures]] — [[mania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hyperreligiosity in Psychotic Disorders (PDF Download Available)|journal=ResearchGate|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12637755_Hyperreligiosity_in_Psychotic_Disorders|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[frontotemporal lobar degeneration]], [[Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuppuswamy|first1=PS|last2=Takala|first2=CR|last3=Sola|first3=CL|title=Management of psychiatric symptoms in anti-NMDAR encephalitis: a case series, literature review and future directions.|journal=General hospital psychiatry|date=NaN|volume=36|issue=4|pages=388–91|doi=10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2014.02.010|pmid=24731834}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Substance-induced psychosis|hallucinogen related psychosis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Virginia|first1=Sadock|last2=Benjamin|first2=Sadock|last3=Pedro|first3=Ruiz|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|isbn=978-1451100471|edition=10th|quote=Clinically, they are said to have more mood swings, euphoria, grandiosity, hyperreligiosity, and multimodal hallucinations, and more prominent positive than negative symptoms.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[psychotic disorder]].

The '''International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion''' ('''IACSR'''), founded in 2006, is a scholarly association dedicated to the promotion of the [[Cognitive Science of Religion]]. The IACSR is an interdisciplinary association, including scholars from a wide variety of disciplines in the human, social, natural and health sciences that are interested in the academic, scientific study of religious phenomena. The IACSR seeks to advance the naturalistic study of religion. It is strictly scientific and does not encourage or welcome those who are interested in dialogue between science and religion, attempt to find religion in science and science in religion, or attempt to validate religious or spiritual doctrines through cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;[[IACSR]] as cited in {{cite web |url=http://www.iacsr.com/Home.html |title=IACSR-Home |accessdate=2008-08-08 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IACSR supports the ''Electronic Archive for Religion &amp; Cognition'' at the ''Centre for Religion &amp; Cognition'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religionandcognition.com/crc/|title=Centre for Religion &amp; Cognition|last=|first=|date=|website=www.religionandcognition.com/crc|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groningen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csr-arc.com|title=Archive for Religion &amp; Cognition|date=|website=www.csr-arc.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Journal of Cognition &amp; Culture'' ([[Brill Publishers]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brill.nl/jocc|title=Journal of Cognition and Culture {{!}} Brill|website=www.brill.nl|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two book series, ''Scientific Studies of Religion: Inquiry and Explanation'' ([http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/series/scientific-studies-of-religion-inquiry-and-explanation/ Bloomsbury Academic]), which was formerly the series ''Cognitive Science of Religion'' ([[AltaMira Press]]), and ''Religion, Cognition and Culture'' (Equinox Press).

'''The International Panel of Parliamentarians for Freedom of Religion or Belief (IPPFoRB)''' is a network of parliamentarians from around the world committed to combating religious persecution and advancing freedom of religion or belief, as defined by Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ippforb.com|title=The IPPFoRB's website|last=|first=|date=|website=ippforb.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
IPPFoRB was established on 8 November 2014 with the signing of the Oslo Charter for Freedom of Religion or Belief at the [[Nobel Peace Center]] in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldreligionnews.com/issues/30-parliamentarians-meet-oslo-sign-freedom-religion-charter|title=30 Parliamentarians Meet with USCIRF in Oslo to Sign a Freedom of Religion Charter|last=|first=|date=2014-11-13|work=World Religion News|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irreligion''' (adjective form: ''non-religious'' or ''irreligious'') is the absence, indifference, rejection of, or hostility towards [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite web|url=http://onelook.com/?w=irreligion&amp;ls=a|title=''Irreligion'' as presented in 26 reference works}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

Irreligion may include some forms of [[theism]], depending on the religious context it is defined against; for example, in 18th-century Europe, the [[epitome]] of irreligion was [[deism]],&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Colin. 1971. ''Towards a Sociology of Irreligion''. London:McMillan p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; while in contemporary [[East Asia]] the shared term meaning "irreligion" or "no religion" (無宗教, Chinese pron. ''wú zōngjiào'', Japanese pron. ''mu shūkyō''), with which the majority of East Asian populations identify themselves, implies non-membership in one of the institutional religions (such as Buddhism and Christianity), and not necessarily non-belief in traditional folk religions collectively represented by Chinese ''[[Shendao]]'' and Japanese ''[[Shinto]]'' (both meaning "ways of gods").&lt;ref name="Handbook Japanese"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bestor|editor1-first=Theodore C.|editor2-last=Bestor|editor2-first=Victoria|editor3-last=Yamagata|editor3-first=Akiko|title=Handbook of Japanese Culture and Society|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415436494|pages=66–67|quote=無宗教 ''mushūkyō'', "no religion", in Japanese language and mindset identifies those people who do not belong to organised religion. To the Japanese, the term "religion" or "faith" means organised religions on the model of Christianity, that is a religion with specific doctrines and requirement for church membership. So, when asked "what is their religion", most of the Japanese answer that they "do not belong to any religion". According to [[NHK]] studies, those Japanese who identify with ''mushūkyō'' and therefore do not belong to any organised religion, actually take part in the folk ritual dimension of ''Shinto''. Ama Toshimaru in ''Nihonjin wa naze mushukyo na no ka'' ("Why are the Japanese non-religious?") of 1996, explains that people who do not belong to organised religions but regularly pray and make offerings to ancestors and protective deities at private altars or Shinto shrines will identify themselves as ''mushukyo''. Ama designates "natural religion" what NHK studies define as "folk religion", and other scholars have named "Nipponism" (''Nipponkyō'') or "common religion".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2012 global study of 230 countries and territories, 16% of the world's population is not affiliated with a religion, while 84% are affiliated.&lt;ref name="Pew Global"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/ |title=The Global Religious Landscape |author=Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=
December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2060, according to their projections, the number of unaffiliated will increase by over 35 million, but the percentage will decrease to 13% because the total population will grow faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why People With No Religion Are Projected To Decline As A Share Of The World’s Population|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/03/why-people-with-no-religion-are-projected-to-decline-as-a-share-of-the-worlds-population/|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Changing Global Religious Landscape: Babies Born to Muslims will Begin to Outnumber Christian Births by 2035; People with No Religion Face a Birth Dearth |website=Pew Research Center|date=April 5, 2017|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2017/04/05/the-changing-global-religious-landscape/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to cross-cultural studies, secularism is expected to decline throughout the 21st century since religion and fertility are positively related, while secularism and fertility are negatively related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Lee |last2=Hoskin |first2=Anthony W. |last3=Dutton |first3=Edward |last4=Nyborg |first4=Helmuth |title=The Future of Secularism: a Biologically Informed Theory Supplemented with Cross-Cultural Evidence |journal=Evolutionary Psychological Science |date=8 March 2017 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=224–42 |doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0090-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinds of irreligion==
* [[Secular humanism]] embraces human reason, ethics, social justice, and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|philosophical naturalism]] while specifically rejecting religious dogma, supernaturalism, pseudoscience, and superstition as the bases of morality and decision making. Secular humanism posits that human beings are capable of being ethical and moral without religion or a god.
* [[Freethought]] holds that positions regarding truth should be formed on the basis of logic, reason, and empiricism, rather than authority, tradition, revelation, or other dogma. In particular, freethought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional religious belief.
* "[[Spiritual but not religious]]" rejects organized religion as the sole or most valuable means of furthering spiritual growth. In contrast to religion, spirituality has often been associated with the interior life of the individual.
* [[Theological noncognitivism]] is the argument that religious language – specifically, words such as "God" – are not cognitively meaningful. It is sometimes considered as synonymous with [[ignosticism]].
* [[Antireligion]] is opposition to religion of any kind. It can describe opposition to organized religion, religious practices, religious institutions, or specific forms of supernatural worship or practice, whether organized or not.

==Human rights==
In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/3273/normative-instruments/ccpr-general-comment-22-300793-on-iccpr-article-18.html |title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18 |work=Minorityrights.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116043952/http://www.minorityrights.org/3273/normative-instruments/ccpr-general-comment-22-300793-on-iccpr-article-18.html |archivedate=2015-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views." Signatories to the convention are barred from "the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers" to recant their beliefs or convert.&lt;ref name="fdih1"&gt;{{cite web |date=1 August 2003|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran|author=International Federation for Human Rights|publisher=fdih.org|accessdate=3 March 2009|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right |accessdate=3 March 2009 |last=Davis |first=Derek H. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210828/http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Western democracies protect the [[freedom of religion]], and it is largely implied in respective legal systems that those who do not believe or observe any religion are allowed [[freedom of thought]].

A noted exception to ambiguity, explicitly allowing non-religion, is Article 36 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] (as adopted in 1982), which states that "No state organ, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkhrm.org.hk/english/law/const03.html]
&lt;/ref&gt; Article 46 of China’s [[1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1978 Constitution]] was even more explicit, stating that "Citizens enjoy freedom to believe in religion and freedom not to believe in religion and to propagate atheism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:People%27s_Republic_of_China_1978_Constitution.pdf?page=41|title=People's Republic of China 1978 Constitution|page=41|year=1978|accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-denominational==
A non-denominational person or organization is not restricted to any particular or specific [[religious denomination]]. The term has been used in the context of various faiths including [[Jainism]],&lt;ref&gt;Jainism in a global perspective. p. 115, Sāgaramala Jaina, Shriprakash Pandey, Pārśvanātha Vidyāpīṭha – 1998&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'í Faith]],&lt;ref&gt;Earth Versus the Science-fiction Filmmakers. p. 70, Tom Weaver – 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zoroastrianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Zoroastrianism: An Introduction. p. 227, Jenny Rose – 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unitarian Universalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Resourcewomen|title=Religious Funding Resource Guide|date=2000|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paganism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mammone|first1=Andrea|title=Varieties of Right-Wing Extremism in Europe|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;Models for Christian Higher Education, Richard Thomas Hughes, William B.

Katz, Steven Bayme – 2012, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref&gt;Personality Of Adolescent Students . p. 42, D.B.

==Demographics==
{{main|List of countries by irreligion}}

Although 11 countries listed below have non-religious majorities, it does not mean that the majority of the populations of these countries don′t belong to any religious group. For example, 68% of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] population belongs to the Lutheran Christian Church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/statistik |title=Kyrkan i siffror, Swedish Lutheran Christian Church in numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 59% of [[Albanians]] declare themselves as Muslims.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Also, though Scandinavian countries have among the highest measures of nonreligiosity and even atheism in Europe, 47% of atheists who live in those countries are still members of the national churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Zuckerman|editor1-first=Phil|title=Atheism and Secularity Vol.2|date=2010|publisher=Praeger|isbn=0313351813|chapter=Ch. 9 Atheism And Secularity: The Scandinavian Paradox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Pew 2015 global projection study for religion and nonreligion, projects that between 2010 and 2050, there will be some initial increases of the unaffiliated followed by a decline by 2050 due to lower global fertility rates among this demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010–2050|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Phil Zuckerman]]'s global studies on atheism have indicated that global atheism may be in decline due to irreligious countries having the lowest birth rates in the world and religious countries having higher birth rates in general.&lt;ref name=zucker&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Phil|editor1-last=Martin|editor1-first=Michael|title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|isbn=0521603676|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pew Research Center's 2012 global study of 230 countries and territories, 16% of the world's population is not affiliated with a religion, while 84% are affiliated.&lt;ref name="Pew Global"/&gt; A 2012 [[WIN/GIA|Worldwide Independent Network/Gallup International Association]] report on a poll from 57 countries reported that 59% of the world's population identified as religious person, 23% as not religious person, 13% as "convinced [[atheism|atheists]]", and also a 9% decrease in identification as "religious" when compared to the 2005 average from 39 countries.&lt;ref name="GallupInt2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |title=Global Index of Religion and Atheism |publisher=WIN/Gallup International |accessdate=13 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016062403/http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their follow-up report, based on a poll in 2015, found that 63% of the globe identified as religious person, 22% as not religious person, and 11% as "convinced atheists".&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

A World of Atheism: Global Demographics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being non-religious is not necessarily equivalent to being an atheist or agnostic. Pew Research Center's global study from 2012 noted that many of the nonreligious actually have some religious beliefs. For example, they observed that "belief in God or a higher power is shared by 7% of Chinese unaffiliated adults, 30% of French unaffiliated adults and 68% of unaffiliated U.S. adults."&lt;ref name="Pew Global Unaffiliated 12/2012" /&gt; Out of the global nonreligious population, 76% reside in Asia and the Pacific, while the remainder reside in Europe (12%), North America (5%), Latin America and the Caribbean (4%), sub-Saharan Africa (2%) and the Middle East and North Africa (less than 1%).&lt;ref name="Pew Global Unaffiliated 12/2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx |title=Religiously Unaffiliated |last= |first= |work=The Global Religious Landscape |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |date=December 18, 2012 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''nones''' is sometimes used in the U.S. to refer to those who are unaffiliated with any organized religion. This use derives from surveys of religious affiliation, in which "None" (or "None of the above") is typically the last choice. Since this status refers to lack of organizational affiliation rather than lack of personal belief, it is a more specific concept than irreligion. A 2015 [[Gallup poll]] concluded that in the U.S. "nones" were the only "religious" group that was growing as a percentage of the population.&lt;ref name="gallup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/187955/percentage-christians-drifting-down-high.aspx?g_source=Religion&amp;g_medium=lead&amp;g_campaign=tiles|title=Percentage of Christians in U.S. Drifting Down, but Still High}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kélé''''' is an [[Afro-Saint Lucian]] religion, originated from the [[Djiné]] people of the [[Babonneau]] region. Its primary deities are [[Ogoun|Ogun]], [[Shango]] and [[Eshu]]. ''Kélé'' ceremonies include the drumming of the ''tanbou manman'' (''mother drum'') and the ''tanbou ich'' (''child drum'') of the [[Batá drum]] family.
The religion has its origins in African slaves of the [[Babonneau]] region. The religion is strongly connected to the [[Ogun]] festival in Nigeria. Repressed by the Roman Catholic church until the early 1960s, it had been practiced in secrecy underground. The ritual includes the display of smooth stones (one of Shango's worship items) and iron/steel items in honor of Ogun.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=uspTNzJ_NoYC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;lpg=PA381&amp;dq=st+lucia+kele&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tPoEjsH0Nc&amp;sig=-Zu4nPy9eZGO8ohv4Gpcb-7Uu6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBpeqa08_JAhWOoYMKHfucDZUQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=st%20lucia%20kele&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The faith itself is believed to be a Saint Lucian version of [[Yoruba religion]].&lt;ref name="Holloway2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph E.

&lt;!--Please only include examples of miraculous births in faith-based, legendary, or mythological traditions. Do NOT include births of non-spiritual figures.--&gt;

Stories of '''miraculous births''' often include conceptions by [[miracle|miraculous]] circumstances and features such as intervention by a [[deity]], [[supernatural]] elements, [[Astronomy|astronomical]] signs, hardship or, in the case of some mythologies, complex plots related to creation.

==Near Eastern mythology==
The [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n concept of origins expressed procreation first in “relationships between gods and goddesses resulting in other gods and goddesses," such as [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]] and [[Damkina]] assisted by [[Apsu]] giving birth to [[Marduk]]. The [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'' describes the birth of Marduk as follows: "Ea, having overheard the plan of the primordial deities to destroy the other gods, deceived [[Apsu]] and [[Mummu]] and put them to death. 'Ea, his triumph over his enemies secured, in his sacred chamber in profound peace he rested.' (ANET, p.&amp;nbsp;61, lines 74—75.)  Then he took over the place which Apsu had used for his cult and dwelt there with his spouse, Damkina." It was here that Marduk, the "most potent and wisest of gods" was created in the heart of Apsu and "He who begot him was Ea, his father, she who conceived him was Damkina, his mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/enuma.html |title=Enuma Elish, The Sumerian Epic of Creation |publisher=Ancienttexts.org |date=2001-06-07 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Norman Lockyer]], Ea, Ia, or [[Oannes (mythology)|Oannes]] was the primal god of Babylon. He was a ‘Great God, Maker of Men, Potter, Artist and Workman.’  He formed a Triad with [[Anu]] and [[Bil]]—the two poles of heaven and the equator.&lt;ref name="Lockyer, Norman, Sir"&gt;Lockyer, Norman, The dawn of astronomy : a study of temple worship and mythology of the ancient Egyptians. With a preface by Giorgio de Santillana, Mineola, NY. : Dover Publications, Inc., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Oannes first appeared from the sea to teach the Babylonians the art of writing, sciences and crafts, the building of cities, the surveying of land, the observation of the stars, and the sowing and harvesting of all kinds of grains and plants.  He was believed to have been "reincarnated" several times.  [[Berossos]], priest of the Temple of [[Bel (god)|Bel]], in Babylon, knew of as many as six such reincarnations.&lt;ref name="Eisler, Robert"&gt;Orpheus the fisher; comparative studies in Orphic and early Christian cult symbolism, J. M. Watkins, London, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, “procreative deities, either male or female, played a part in the birth of other deities or great personages, such as the [[Ugaritic]] tradition of Lady [[Asherah]], ‘the Progenitress of the gods’; [[Mami (goddess)|Mami]], 'the Mother-womb, the one who creates mankind'; Father [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]], the 'begetter of gods and men'; the Assyrian traditions that Tukulti-Urta was created by the gods in the womb of his mother and that [[Sennacherib]]'s birth was assisted by Ea, who provided a 'spacious womb', and [[Assur]], 'the god, my begetter'; and the North Arabian myth of the mother goddess who was responsible for [[Dusares]]."&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"&gt;Boslooper, Thomas, The Virgin Birth, The Westminster Press, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 62-7941.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hittite mythology]], the god [[Anu]] was overthrown by his son [[Kumarbi]];&lt;ref name=Puhvel1987&gt;{{cite book|last=Puhvel|first=Jaan|authorlink=Jaan Puhvel|title=Comparative Mythology|date=1987|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=0-8018-3938-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=J.

==Egyptian mythology==
===Gods===
{{Further|Myth of Osiris and Isis|Horus}}
[[File:Abydos Tempelrelief Sethos I. 36.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Isis, in the form of a bird, copulates with the deceased Osiris. At either side are Horus, although he is as yet unborn, and Isis in human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Meeks|author1-first=Dimitri|author2-last=Favard-Meeks|author2-first=Christine|others=Translated by G. M. Goshgarian|title=Daily Life of the Egyptian Gods|publisher=Cornell University Press| year=1996|origyear=1993|isbn=978-0-8014-8248-9|page=37|ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The belief in the conception of [[Horus]] by [[Isis]] is traced to the beginning of Egyptian history.  Horus' conception and birth were understood in terms of the Egyptian doctrine of [[parthenogenesis]], which was connected with the goddess Neith of Sais. (page 220)&lt;ref name="Budge, E. A. Wallis"&gt;[[Budge, E. A. Wallis]], ''The Gods of the Egyptians'', II, Dover Publications, New York, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;  In Upper Egypt, Net was worshipped at Seni and represented with the head of a lioness painted green, with the titles: "Father of fathers and Mother of mothers," and "net-Menhit, the great lady, lady of the south, the great cow who gave birth to the sun, who made the germ of gods and men, the mother of [[Ra]], who raised up [[Atum|Tem]] in primeval time, who existed when nothing else had being, and who created that which exists after she had come into being."(page 150)&lt;ref name="Erman, Adolf"&gt;Erman, Adolf, The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians, B. Blom, New York, 1971, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Many of the attributes of Isis, the God-mother, the mother of Horus; and of [[Neith]], the goddess of [[Sais]] are identical with those of Mary the Mother of Christ." (page 161)&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;  Early Christian stories in the [[Apocrypha]]l Gospels, which record the wanderings of the Virgin and Child in Egypt are similar to stories found on the [[Metternich Stela]] texts about the life of Isis. (page 161)&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; Also, the pictures and sculptures of Isis suckling her child Horus are the foundation for Christian figurines and paintings of the Madonna and Child.  Of course, the legend of the birth of Horus has many elements not found even in the Apocryphal Gospels.  Egyptian texts mention numerous forms of Horus.  In one he is "Heru-sa Ast, sa-Asar, or Horus, son of Isis, son of [[Osiris]]."  Isis is described in the Hymn to Osiris, as finding and restoring the body of her dead husband, and using magical words given her by [[Thoth]] to restore him to life.  Then, by uniting with Osiris she conceives Horus.  Horus represented the rising sun and in this respect was comparable to the Greek [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name="hammerwood.mistral.com.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammerwood.mistral.co.uk/apollo.htm |title=Apollo. Hammerwood. Parthenon. Borghese Vase Plaques. Dionysus. Python. Egyptian Horus. Isis. Ra. Amon. Set. Helios. Delphi. Prophecy. Know Thyself. Delphic Oracle. National Curriculum: Ancient Greece, Greeks |publisher=Hammerwood.mistral.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were at least fifteen other Horuses in the Egyptian pantheon,&lt;ref name="egyptianmyths.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptianmyths.net/horus.htm |title=Ancient Egypt: the Mythology - Horus |publisher=Egyptianmyths.net |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; so in the story of Isis and Osiris Horus is "sometimes known as Harsiesis, to distinguish him from the others.  He is depicted as a falcon, or with a falcon's head.  He eventually avenged Osiris' death and reclaimed the throne, ruling peacefully...Herakhty, or 'Horus of the Horizon', was a sun god who rose each morning on the eastern horizon.  He was often identified with the sun god, Ra, and was eventually absorbed by him, forming Ra-Herakhty."&lt;ref name="egyptianmyths.net"/&gt;

Lineal descent from Ra, whether by birth or by marriage, was claimed by all kings of Egypt at least since User-ka-f, first king of the V Dynasty, who was high priest of Ra at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].  An important part of this tradition was the legend of the God Re generating with the wife of a priest.  "The newborn child was regarded as a god incarnate, and later with appropriate ceremonies he was presented to [[Ra|Re]] or Amen-Re, in his temple, where the god accepted it and acknowledged it to be his child."  This tradition was later inscribed in a stereotyped form in temple reliefs.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

Many texts mention different attributes of Isis.  These were combined into a single narrative by [[Plutarch]] in the 1st century AD. In her aspect of protector of Egypt and its people, Isis is depicted with huge outspread wings.  She taught women to grind corn, to spin and to weave, and she taught the people how to cure illnesses. She instituted the rite of marriage.  When her consort, Osiris, left Egypt to travel the world, Isis ruled the country in his absence.  "The [[hieroglyph]] for her name is the image of a throne, and her lap came to be seen as the throne of Egypt.  Because of her fame Isis eventually absorbed the qualities of almost all the other goddesses; "she was a great mother goddess, a bird goddess, a goddess of the underworld who brought life to the dead, and a goddess of the primeval waters...Her following spread beyond Egypt to Greece and throughout the Roman Empire...(lasting) from before 3000 BC until well into Christian times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roman-empire.net/religion/isis.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unrv.com/culture/isis.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharaohs===
{{Further|Stories of divine birth in the eighteenth dynasty}}
There is a myth on the birth of [[Hatshepsut]]. In this myth, [[Amun]] goes to [[Queen Ahmose]] in the form of the Pharaoh [[Thutmose I]] and awakens her with pleasant odors. At this point Amun places the ''[[ankh]]'', a symbol of life, to Ahmose's nose, and Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Robins, ''Women in Ancient Egypt'', Harvard University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Another myth on divine birth concerns [[Amenhotep III]]: he is conceived by [[Amun]] which has gone to queen [[Mutemwiya]] in form of [[Thutmosis IV]].&lt;ref&gt;O' Connor, David and Cline, Eric H.: ''Amenhotep III:Perspectives of his reign'', University of Michigan Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce: ''Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
In the Hebrew Bible, and in later Jewish tradition there are stories of matriarchs giving birth where the God of Israel miraculously intervenes. For example, within the Rabbinic literature expansions were made on the birth of the matriarch [[Sarah]] on the earlier Old Testament traditions.

===Isaac===
{{Main|Isaac|Sarah}}
[[File:Abraham renvoyant Agar.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Banishment of Hagar'', Etching. À Paris chez Fr. Fanet, Éditeur, Rue des Saints Pères n° 10. 18th century. Sarah is seen on the left side, looking]]
Due to her old age, Sarai was infertile, but a miracle was vouchsafed to her ([[Genesis Rabbah]] xlvii. 3) after her name was changed from "Sarai" to "Sarah" (R. H. 16b). When her youth had been restored and she had given birth to [[Isaac]] the people would not believe in the miracle, saying that the patriarch and his wife had adopted a foundling and pretended that it was their own son. Abraham thereupon invited all the notables to a banquet on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. Sarah invited the women, who brought their infants with them, and on this occasion she gave milk from her breasts to all the children, thus convincing the guests of the miracle (B. M. 87a; comp. Gen. R. liii. 13).

===Immanuel===
According to [[Isaiah 7:14]], around 735 BC King [[Ahaz]] of Judah received a message from the prophet [[Isaiah]] during the [[Syro-Ephraimite War]] with Aram (Syria) and Israel, "Therefore, the Lord, of His own, shall give you a sign; behold, the young woman is with child, and she shall bear a son, and she shall call his name Immanuel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15938/showrashi/true |title=Yeshayahu - Chapter 7 - Texts &amp; Writings |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally taken by Judaic commentators to be a reference to the non-miraculous birth of [[Hezekiah]] or another contemporary child, as indicated in Isaiah's following indication of the timing.

The Greek [[Septuagint]] and some later Christian translations, following the application of Isaiah 7 in Matthew 1, use the word "virgin". The Hebrew word ''alma'' actually translates as a young woman of childbearing age who had not yet given birth and who might or might not be a virgin, whereas the Hebrew ''betulah'', used elsewhere in Isaiah, is the word that means "virgin." If the reference is to Ahaz's betrothed, [[Abijah (queen)|Abi]], daughter of the [[High Priest]], no miraculous birth is implied, merely chastity. The Christian world believes that the verse is a messianic prediction of the miraculous birth of Jesus, as described in various gospels of the New Testament of the Bible.

===Melchizedek===
The [[Second Book of Enoch]] contains a section, called ''Exaltation of Melchizedek'', which says that [[Melchizedek]] was born of a virgin, Sofonim (or Sopanima), the wife of Nir, a brother of [[Noah]]. The child came out from his mother after she had died and sat on the bed beside her corpse, already physically developed, clothed, speaking and blessing the Lord, and marked with the badge of priesthood. Forty days later, Melchizedek was taken by the archangel [[Gabriel]] ([[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] in some manuscripts) to the [[Garden of Eden]] and was thus preserved from the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]] without having to be in [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ueberallesdownload.com/enoch7.html |title=THE SECOND BOOK OF ENOCH - Page 7 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2015-02-24 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129084437/http://www.ueberallesdownload.com/enoch7.html |archivedate=January 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Book of the Secrets of Enoch| author= Morfill, W R (translator)| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/3678772/The-Book-of-the-Secrets-of-Enoch-WR-Morfill  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoroaster==
{{Further|Zoroastrianism|Zoroaster}}
Zoroaster’s name has been adopted from the Greek and [[Latin]] Zoroastres.  The ancient form of his name in the Avesta is [[Zarathustra]].  His native country was probably [[Median Empire|Media]] in Western Iran, (possibly in modern [[Azerbaijan]]), but his ministry took place in eastern Iran, especially in the region of [[Bactria]], about 1200 BC. [[Zoroaster]] was originally a Magian priest, and under the reforms he instituted, Mithra became one of the [[Yazata]]s (Worshipful Ones), the angels or lesser divine beings.

"It was said that (Zoroaster's) birth was foretold from the beginning of time, and that the moment he was born, he burst out laughing and the whole universe rejoiced with him."  After his birth evil demons tried to destroy him, but with Ahura Mazda's protection, he survived all attempts on his life.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"/&gt;  The Zoroastrian tradition differs from the Christian one because the divine only assists in the preservation of [[Zoroaster]]’s seed.  "The central scripture, the [[Avesta]] and also the Pahlavi texts include the tradition that the 'kingly glory' is handed onward from ruler to ruler and from saint to saint for the purpose of illuminating ultimately the soul of the Zarathushtra."  Also the scriptures clearly allude to conjugal relations between his parents, during which evil spirits try to prevent his conception.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;  But according to later tradition, Zoroaster's mother, Dughdova, was a virgin when she conceived Zoroaster by a shaft of light.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"&gt;Egyptian mythology, Lorenz, London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman and Hellenistic mythology==
===Gods===
[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - Minerva.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Birth of [[Minerva]]'' by [[René-Antoine Houasse]] (before 1688)]]

[[Greco-Roman]] and [[Hellenistic]] literature is rich in the tradition of birth among the gods. In his poem ''[[Theogony]]'', the Greek poet [[Hesiod]] tells a story that Zeus had once lain with the goddess [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], impregnating her, but, fearing that she might bear a child mightier than he himself, he swallowed her.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 886&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter [[Athena]] was born fully grown from Zeus's forehead, fully armed and clad in armor.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 929a&lt;/ref&gt; Hesiod also relates that the goddess [[Aphrodite]] was born from the foam of the sea after [[Ouranos]]'s castrated testicles were thrown into it.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helios]] was a child of Zeus by [[Euryphaessa]].  He was also called "the son of Earth and starry Heaven," and the son of [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]]. [[Dionysus]] was dithyrambus, "he who entered life by a double door." His first birth took place prematurely. His mother, Semele, died when Zeus appeared to her in a flash of lightning, and so Zeus opened his own flesh and enclosed the infant.  In time, Dionysus was born "perfect" from Zeus' thigh.  Dionysus [[Zagreus]] was important in Orphic theology. In Protrepticus ii. 14 ff. by Clement of Alexandria, this child had the form of a bull.  Zeus intended to make him the ruler of the universe but the jealous Titans lured the child away, tore him to pieces, cooked him and ate him.  Athena preserved his heart, however, which Zeus swallowed.  According to Boslooper, Clement omitted one part of the myth that forms a connection between his account and the Theban legend of Dionysus.  Because Zeus swallowed the heart of Dionysus Zagreus, when Semele bore Dionysus the new god was Zagreus reborn.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

===Mithra and Mithras===
{{Main|Mithras|Mithra|Mitra}}
[[File:MithrasIMG 5339.JPG|thumb|right|325px|Roman statue showing Mithras born from the rock from the Diocletian Baths Museum]]

In Indian mythology, [[Mithra]] is known as Mitra.  He was originally a god of contracts and friendship and was a forerunner of the Graeco-Roman god [[Mithras]].  In [[Iran]], he developed into the protector of truth.  Before the time of Zoroaster, he was associated with [[Ahura Mazda]], the principle of good. As a consequence of Zoroaster's reforms to Iranian religion, Mithra was ousted from power and Ahura Mazda became supreme.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"/&gt;  In the more ancient Indian [[Vedas]] Mithra was the god of light, invoked under the name of [[Varuna]], and was called "the Light of the World." He was the mediator between heaven and Earth.

"The light bursting from the heavens, which were conceived as a solid vault, became, in the mythology of the [[Magi]], Mithra born from the rock."&lt;ref name="Boerie, C. George, Dr."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/romanempire.html |title=The Roman Empire |publisher=Webspace.ship.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mithraism absorbed [[astrology]] from the [[Babylon|Chaldeans]] after the Chaldean conquest, and continued as an astronomical religion.  In the Hellenistic period it took on its final form.  Mithra was assimilated into [[Graeco-Roman]] beliefs in the 1st century BC as Mithras.  He was an ancient and highly honored god of [[Roman mythology|Roman]] Paganism, where he was worshipped for more than 300 years as "the soldier's god."&lt;ref name="Newadvent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10402a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Mithraism |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-10-01 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythological heroes===
[[File:Danae gold shower Louvre CA925.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ancient [[Boeotia]]n [[bell-krater]] showing Zeus impregnating [[Danaë]] in the form of a shower of gold, circa 450-425 BC]]

The love of a god for a mortal, resulting in the birth of a hero, is one notable deviation from the tradition of the origin of gods. The legend of [[Perseus]], whose mother conceived him when [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] came to her in the form of a golden shower, is one example of this type (cf. Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book IV).  The ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' has the following: [[Zeus]], turned to gold, piercing the brazen chamber of Danae, cut the knot of intact virginity.

Heroes created by generation of a god with a mortal include [[Ion (play)|Ion]] by Apollo and [[Creusa]], [[Romulus]] by Mars and Aemila, [[Asclepius]] by Apollo and [[Coronis (Greek mythology)|Coronis]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] by Zeus and [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]].   [[Plutarch]] records how Theseus and [[Romulus]] were both born out of wedlock and of uncertain parentage and at the same time had the reputation of being sprung from the gods.  He said that Theseus' grandfather [[Pittheus]] invented the story that Theseus was the child of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] to conceal Theseus' lineage as the son of Pittheus' daughter [[Aethra (Greek mythology)|Aethra]] and [[Aegeus]] ("Lives", Vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;2; pp.&amp;nbsp;3 ff.).  But there were other stories about the birth of Romulus and his brother Remus.  The story of Romulus' divine origin says that his mother was the mortal daughter of Aeneas and Lavinia, and his father was Mars.

In his "Hymn to Asclepius", [[Homer]] attributes his origin to the god Apollo and the daughter of a renowned soldier, King Phlegyas.  As the divine patron of the healing art, [[Asclepius]] became the most popular of the hero gods of Greece.  The belief that religion was concerned with sickness and disease was central to his cult.  His sanctuaries in the Greco-Roman world became so famous there was a movement to make him a god of the first rank and identify him with Zeus himself.  Asclepius was "the one who leads and controls all things, the savior of the whole world, and the guardian of mortals."

Helen of Troy was worshiped as a heroine in several parts of the ancient world during the early historical epoch.  [[Euripides]]' play "Helen" depends on a tradition begun in the early 6th century B.C. by the Greek poet Stesichorus that Helen was the daughter of Zeus (who took the form of a swan) and Leda.  But this might simply be a poetic way of saying that she was hatched from an egg.

There are two versions of the birth of [[Oedipus]].  He was given a semidivine status in [[Sophocles]]' "Oedipus the King," where he was said to be the son of either [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], Loxias, "or the Bacchants' god, dweller on the hilltops ..." and one of the nymphs of Helicon.  But in Euripides' "Phoenissae," his mother, Jocasta, says Oedupus is the son of Laius, a mortal, who was warned by the god Phoebus not to have children.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"King of Thebes for horses famed! seek not to beget children against the will of heaven; for if thou beget a son, that child will slay thee, and all thy house shall wade in blood."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Laius ignored the warning, but after the child was born he gave him to shepherds to expose on Mount Cithaeron.  The child was found and raised among the keepers of the horses of Polybus.  As a grown man, Oedipus did indeed kill his father, not realizing who he was, and then married his mother.  When he discovered the truth he blinded himself.  In this story, he is clearly considered to be the son of Laius and Jocasta.  This is also obvious in Sophocles' "Oedipus the King".&lt;ref name="Eds. Oates and O'Neill"&gt;The Complete Greek Drama, Eds. Oates and O'Neill, Vol. 1, p. 409, Random House, New York, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Boslooper, "The two passages indicate that in the Greek mind the thoughts of divine and human paternal participation in conception were not mutually exclusive."&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;178)

[[File:Mignard - The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife'' by [[Nicolas Mignard]] (1654)]]

[[Romulus and Remus]], the legendary twin founders of the city of [[Rome]], were said to have been born to a [[Vestal Virgin]], [[Rhea Silvia]].  Rhea Silvia had been forced to become a Vestal Virgin against her will and claimed to have been impregnated through divine intervention.  [[Livy]] attests that she was instead raped by an unknown man.  In any case [[Amulius|King Amulius]] ordered the twins to be drowned as death through the elements would not trigger divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Romulus_and_Remus/|title=Romulus and Remus|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical figures===
Alexander, the Ptolemies, and the Caesars were said by some scholars to have been "virgin-born."  [[Alexander the Great]], " journeyed to the Oasis of Amon in order that he might be recognized as the god’s son and thus become a legitimate and recognized king of Egypt.  Inscriptions show that he and the [[Ptolemies]] after him had the incidents of their birth regularly depicted in temple reliefs.”&lt;ref name="Breasted"&gt;Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol. 2, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; (As cited by Boslooper)  Norden calls this the Hellenistic virgin motif.  However, evidence shows that Alexander must have had a double tradition of origin.  It is recorded that "Alexander the Great and Augustus are deemed to have been conceived of a serpent god, and they claimed between them [[Phoebus]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] as their progenitors."&lt;ref name="Sidonius Apollinaris"&gt;Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina II, 121, Testimonies 289 in Asclepius, E. J. and Ludwig Edelstein (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

“The Emperor [[Augustus]] was praised as the Savior of the world …[but] the idea of Savior was not unique or original with Augustus himself.  Before him the same title was given to [[Seleucid]] and other Hellenistic kings.  Throughout this period there were frequent longings for a savior from the present troubles.”  Augustus was said to have had a miraculous birth and a childhood filled with many portents and signs.  A few months before he was born a portent was observed at Rome which gave warning that nature was pregnant with a king for the Roman People.  "Thereupon the Senate in consternation decreed that no male child born that year should be reared; but those whose wives were with child saw to it that the decree was not filed in the treasury, since each one appropriated the prediction to his own family."  Boslooper relates several additional stories.  In one, Suetonius narrates what he learned from Asclepias of Mendes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When Atia had come in the middle of the night to the solemn service of Apollo, she had her litter set down in the temple and fell asleep, while the rest of the matrons also slept.  On a sudden a serpent glided up to her and shortly went away.  When she awoke, she purified herself, as if after the embraces of her husband, and at once there appeared on her body a mark in colors like a serpent, and she could never get rid of it; so that presently she ceased ever to go to the public baths.  In the tenth month after that Augustus was born and was therefore regarded as the son of Apollo.  Atia too, before she gave him birth, dreamed that her vitals were borne up to the stars and spread over the whole extent of land and sea, while Octavius dreamed that the sun rose from Atia's womb."&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; (p. 180)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The hope for a savior was expressed in [[Virgil]]’s “Fourth Eclogue".  The Church fathers later claimed this was a reference to Jesus Christ, however, the poem was dedicated to Pollio, one of the great influential men at the time of the civil wars and Virgil's patron and friend.  The hero of the poem is a child born or to be born in 40 B.C., at the time of Pollio's consulate.  A new era was expected, in fulfillment of an older oracle.&lt;blockquote&gt;"... Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung

Has come and gone, and the majestic roll

Of circling centuries begins anew:

Justice returns, returns old Saturn's reign,

With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.

Only do thou, at the boy's birth in whom

The iron shall cease, the golden race arise,

Befriend him, chaste Lucina; 'tis thine own

Apollo reigns ...

"For thee, O boy,

First shall the earth, untilled, pour freely forth

Her childish gifts, the gadding ivy-spray

With foxglove and Egyptian bean-flower mixed,

And laughing-eyed acanthus. Of themselves,

Untended, will the she-goats then bring home

Their udders swollen with milk, while flocks afield

Shall of the monstrous lion have no fear..."&lt;ref name="classics.mit.edu"&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Hinduism}}
In the story of [[Krishna]] the deity is the agent of conception and also the offspring.  Because of his sympathy for the earth, the divine [[Vishnu]] himself descended into the womb of [[Devaki]] and was born as her son, Krishna. The Hindu Vishnu Purana relates: "Devaki bore in her womb the lotus-eyed deity...before the birth of Krishna, no one “could bear to gaze upon Devaki, from the light that invested her, and those who contemplated her radiance felt their minds disturbed.” This reference to light is reminiscent of the Vedic hymn "To an Unknown God," which refers to a Golden Child.  According to F. M. Müller this term means "the golden germ of child" and is an attempt at naming the sun.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

This is  occasionally brought up as evidence for the hypothesis that "virgin birth" tales are a fairly common phenomenon in non-Christian religions around the world.&lt;ref name="Hitchens, Christopher"&gt;Christopher Hitchens, God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything (Paperback), 2007, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen, Chapman"&gt;Chapman Cohen, Essays in Freethinking, 1927, "Monism and Religion"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph, Peter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/13726978 |title=Private Video on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is nothing in Hindu scriptures to suggest that it was a "virgin" birth. By the time of conception and birth of Krishna, Devaki was married to [[Vasudeva]] and had already borne seven children.&lt;ref name="Vishnu Puran"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Vishnupurana-English-MnDutt#page/n307/mode/2up/search/devaki |title=VishnuPurana - English - MN Dutt |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some Hindus believe that when the emanations of the Supreme Being are [[pratyaksha]], or obvious to the sight, they become sacara, or embodied. Krishna was such an embodiment and usually bore a human form. In that mode of appearance the deities are generally supposed to be born of a woman, but without any carnal intercourse. This belief is not adhered to by those who follow the Purva Mimansa, or the philosophy of Jaimini. They insist that the Devas were mere mortals whom the Supreme Being endowed with qualities similar to his own. In general, the Hindus perform acts of worship to some of their ancient monarchs and sages, who were deified on account of their eminent virtues.&lt;ref name="On Egypt and the Nile"&gt;Wilford, On Egypt and the Nile, Asiatic Researches, Vol. III p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{Main|Buddha#Conception and birth}}
[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Queen Maya Birth.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Māyā]] miraculously giving birth to Siddhārtha. [[Sanskrit]], [[palm-leaf manuscript]]. [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], [[Bihar]], India. [[Pala Empire|Pāla period]]]]

The stories of Buddha’s unusual birth developed through the centuries. Two accounts cited by Boslooper tell of the descent of the future Bodhisattva from the "Tusita Body" into the mother’s womb, the appearance of the [[Buddha]] in the mother as a shining gem, and the accompanying wonders in the natural world.  These are the Majjhima-Nikāya, 123 Acchariyabbhutadhammasuta III. 119-124; (I. B. Horner, 1959, pp.&amp;nbsp;164–169); and Māhapadānasutta, Dīgha ii. 12.&lt;ref name="Davids, T. W. rhys"&gt;Davids, T. W. Rhys, Dialogues of the Buddha, Part II, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, Vol. III (1910), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Mahapadana-sutra, Digha ii. 12, is the description of the incarnation of the [[Vipassī Buddha]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now Vipassi, brethren, when, as Bodhisat, he ceased to belong to the hosts of the heaven of Delight, descended into his mother’s womb mindful and self-possessed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to this text, the [[Vipassī Buddha]] was the first of six incarnations to precede [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]]. The others listed are [[Sikhī Buddha|Sikhī]], [[Vessabhū Buddha|Vessabhū]], [[Kakusandha Buddha|Kakusandha]], [[Koṇāgamana Buddha|Koṇāgamana]], and [[Kassapa Buddha|Kassapa]]. The most popular legendary account of the birth of Buddha is in the Nidanakatha Jataka (see, [[Jataka tales]]) which accounted for the lives of Buddha in previous incarnations.  In this account, the “Great Being” chose the time and place of his birth, the tribe into which he would be born, and who his mother would be.  In the time chosen by him, Maya, his mother, fell asleep and dreamed that four archangels carried her to the [[Himalayan Mountains]] where their queens bathed and dressed her.  In her dream the Great Being soon entered her womb from her side, in the form of a white elephant. When she woke, she told her dream to the Raja, who summoned sixty-four eminent [[Brahman]]s to interpret it.

"Then is described how at his birth he took seven great steps and at the seventh he shouted, 'I am the chief of the world,' how he at birth held in his hand some medicine that became for him the drug by which he later healed the sick and blind and deaf, how at birth he wished to give a gift but was presented one himself by his mother, and how lastly he sang the song of victory.'

The [[Yellow Emperor]] is sometimes said to have been the fruit of extraordinary birth, as his mother Fubao conceived him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning bolt from the [[Big Dipper]].&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy, ''Asian Mythologies''.

Qi, the Abandoned One, who later became known as [[Houji]] {{ndash}} a [[culture hero]] or [[god of agriculture]] {{ndash}} was held in some accounts to have been miraculously conceived when his mother, the consort [[Jiang Yuan]], stepped into a footprint left by the supreme god [[Shangdi]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. "Hou Ji".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laozi===
Some [[Taoism|Taoist]] schools held that [[Laozi]] was conceived when his mother gazed upon a falling star. He was born while his mother was leaning against a [[plum tree]]. Laozi was said to have emerged as an old man with a full grey beard. This may be because his name {{ndash}} "Old Master" ({{lang|zh|老子}}) {{ndash}} can also be read as "Old Child".&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Diane, ''The Best Guide to Eastern Philosophy and Religion'', New York, St. Martin's Griffin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abaoji===
There are some legends about the birth of [[Abaoji]] (also known as Yi), the Emperor Taizu of Liao. According to the legends, his mother dreamed that the sun fell from the sky and into her bosom, from which pregnancy followed.  When she gave birth, the room is said to have become filled with a mysterious light and extraordinary fragrance.  As a newborn, his body was that of a three-year-old, and the legends go on to say that he was walking at the age of three months.&lt;ref&gt;Mote, F.W.

Mainstream scholars agree that the [[nativity of Jesus]], if not taken as [[Historical Jesus|historically accurate]], should be interpreted within the context of first-century Judaism, not in the context of foreign mythologies, which contain only remote similarities.&lt;ref&gt;[[James D.G.

===Mary===

According to tradition of the Catholic church, the Virgin Mary's parents, [[St. Anne]] and [[St. Joachim]], were childless, when an angel came to them and [[Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate|told them]] they would give birth to a daughter. During the [[Immaculate Conception|conception of Mary]], she was preserved from the stain of [[original sin]].

===Jesus===

[[File:Iconnativity.jpg|thumb|right|[[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian]] [[icon]] of the Nativity.]]
The [[Gospel of Luke]] and the [[Gospel of Matthew]] describe the nativity of [[Jesus]]. In the account in the Gospel of Luke, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] learns from the [[angel]] [[Gabriel]] that she will conceive and bear a child. When she asks how this can be, since she is a virgin, he tells her that the [[Holy Spirit]] would "come upon her" and that "nothing will be impossible with God". She responds: "Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:31-38|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time that Mary is due to give birth, she and her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] travel from their home in [[Nazareth]] to Joseph's ancestral home in [[Bethlehem]] to register in the [[Census of Quirinius]]. Finding no place for themselves in the inn, Mary gives birth to Jesus and she places him in a [[manger]] (feeding trough).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|2:1-7|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Annunciation to the shepherds|angel of the Lord visits the shepherds]] guarding their flocks in nearby fields and brings them "good news of great joy": "to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is the Messiah, the Lord." The angel tells them they will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.

In the Gospel of Matthew, the impending birth is announced to Joseph in a dream, in which he is instructed to name the child Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|1:21|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Star of Bethlehem|star]] reveals the birth of Jesus to a number (traditionally three) of [[Biblical Magi|''magi'']], Greek ''μάγος'', commonly translated as "wise man" but in this context probably meaning "astronomer" or "astrologer",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Brown | first=Raymond Edward | authorlink=Raymond E.

After the 1st century, traditions flourished that represented the thinking of that time, and also preserved source material for many of the ideas in the "theological writings of the church fathers." In their present form the [[pseudepigrapha]]l writings contained in the [[Sibylline Oracles]] include literature written from the 2nd century BC through the 6th century of the Christian era. They contain some material relevant to the birth and infancy of Jesus. But this passage in the Oracles, Book III, probably represents the hopes of pre-Christian Alexandrian Jews.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Be of good cheer, O maiden, and exult; for the Eternal, who made heaven and earth, has given thee joy, and he will dwell in thee, and for thee shall be an immortal light.
And wolves and lambs promiscuously shall eat grass in the mountains, and among the kids shall leopards graze,
And wandering bears shall lodge among the calves, and the carnivorous lion
shall eat straw in the manger like the ox,
and little children lead them with a band. For tame will be on earth the beasts he made,
And with young babes will dragons fall asleep, and no harm, for God’s hand will be on them."&lt;ref name="Terry, Milton Spenser"&gt;Terry, Milton Spenser, Aloisius Rzach, The Sibylline Oracles, Eaton &amp; Mains, Cincinnati:: Curtis &amp; Jennings, 1899 (page 93, lines 975-984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, the church fathers refer to subsequent books in the Oracles that are clear allusions to Christ, and probably dated from the close of the second or beginning of the 3rd century AD.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The first Christian theologians demonstrated in their writings their knowledge of such non-canonical sources.

The [[New Testament apocrypha#Non-canonical gospels|non-canonical gospels]] contain much that is pertinent. The apocryphal literature departs from the Christian canon and its legends have many elements similar to [[pagan]] stories representing popular beliefs of the church from the second Christian century on through the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

==Islam==
[[File:Virgin Mary and Jesus (old Persian miniature).jpg|thumb|left|Mary and Jesus in old [[Persian miniature|Persian Shi'a miniature]].]]

===Jesus in Islam===
The [[Qur'an]] and other Islamic literature contain reports of a number of miraculous births of biblical characters. The [[Qur'an]] describes [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]] of Jesus by Mary (Arabic: ''Maryam''), which is recounted throughout several passages in the Qur'an. The narrative goes that Mary was visited by the angel Gabriel that she will give birth to a holy son, named Isa' (Jesus), the Messiah and that he will be a great prophet, to whom God will give the Injil (Gospel) and he will speak in infancy and maturity and will be a companion to the most righteous. When this news was given to Mary, she asked the angel how she can have a baby as she was a [[virgin]].&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, Chapter 3, Verse 43&lt;/ref&gt; To this, the angel replied "Even though when God wants to create a matter, he merely wills (Kun-fa-yakun) it and the things come into being".&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, Chapter 3, verse 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

After giving birth, while resting near the trunk of a palm tree Jesus spoke to Mary from the cradle instructing her to shake the tree and obtain its fruits. After showing Jesus as a newborn to her family Jesus again spoke "Lo, I am God's servant; God has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet. Blessed he has made me, wherever I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give alms, so long as I live and likewise to cherish my mother" in order to dispel rumours of conception.&lt;ref name="EoI-Isa"&gt;"Isa", Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc-range|19|30|e=31|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; This birth narrative draws strong parallels to the apocryphal tradition of Jesus' birth within the ''[[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]]'' and ''[[Arabic Infancy Gospel]]''.

===Muhammad===
After the death of the [[Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Abdullah]] his wife [[Aminah]] had a vision where angels visited her and informed that soon she will give birth to a boy and told her to name him [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;https://seekerofthesacredknowledge.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/miracles-that-took-place-at-the-time-of-beloved-prophets-blessed-birth%E2%80%8F/&lt;/ref&gt; When Prophet Muhammad was about to be born, Aminah was visited by [[Eve|Hawa]], [[Asiya, wife of the Pharaoh|Asiya]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] with angels to help her.&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.islam-today.ru/society/aminah-the-mother-of-muhammad-peace-be-upon-him/&lt;/ref&gt; All the pagan idols of [[Kaaba]] fall down and bright light appeared.&lt;ref&gt;https://islamicmisconceptions.wordpress.com/2014/01/12/miracles-on-birth-of-prophet-mohammed-s-a-w/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kabir===
{{Main|Sufism}}
In 1440,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/309270/Kabir |title=Kabir &amp;#124; biography - Indian mystic and poet &amp;#124; Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2015-02-18 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the poet [[Kabir]] was also said to have been born of a virgin widow (a Hindu), through the palm of her hand. Like [[Karna]], Kabir was sent down the river in a basket; he was found and adopted by a family of Muslim weavers, downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/kabir/ |title=Kabir presented in Philosophy section |publisher=Newsfinder.org |date=2003-05-24 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/8319260/Images-of-Kabir |title=Images of Kabir |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This (presumably posthumous) account—which depicts Kabir as secretly descended from Hindus—was intended to legitimise Kabir's religious authority in the eyes of the Hindu population who venerated his works. This story is absent from Muslim and Sikh accounts of Kabir's work.

==Other traditions==
===Aztec mythology===

====Huitzilopochtli====
The myth of [[Huitzilopochtli]] is uniquely [[Aztec]]. Huitzilopochtli is therefore considered to be the cult god or the patron god of the [[Aztec]]. As a solar deity, Huitzilopochtli is closely related to and overlaps with [[Tonatiuh]]. Huitzilopochtli’s mother was [[Coatlicue]], or She of the Serpent Skirt. Coatlicue, known for her devout nature and virtuous qualities, was at Mount Coatepec or Coatepetl ("Serpent Hill"; near [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]) one day, sweeping and tending to her penance, when she discovered a bundle of feathers on the ground. She decided to save them and placed them in her bosom. Without her realizing, the feathers impregnated her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Diposkan oleh Blue Roland |url=http://aztecgods.blogspot.com/2008/06/birth-of-huitzilopochtli.html |title=Aztec Gods - Resources for all gods, goddesses and deities of Aztec Mythology |publisher=Aztecgods.blogspot.com |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=193tKPdM-ykC&amp;pg=PA584&amp;lpg=PA584&amp;dq=Coatlicue+coatepetl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5uVmbQvFbA&amp;sig=aRdAaNKf_MVzlH19VbFdfLU4irI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlj7OB57vOAhXIPZoKHdAsDE4Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Coatlicue%20coatepetl&amp;f=false |title=The History of the Indies of New Spain |first=Fray Diego |last=Durán |authorlink=Diego Durán |page=584 |origyear=1581 |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |date=October 1994 |others=Translated by [[Doris Heyden|Heyden, Doris]] |isbn=978-0806126494 |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/nahuatl/ReadingCoatlicue.html |title=Readings in Classical Nahuatl: The Murders of Coatlicue and Coyolxauhqui |website=[[UCSD]] |first=David K. |last=Jordan |date=January 23, 2016 |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quetzalcoatl====
There are several stories about the birth of [[Quetzalcoatl]]. In the first story, Quetzalcoatl was born by a virgin named [[Chimalman]], to whom the god [[Ometeotl]] appeared in a dream.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Bierlein, ''Living Myths. How Myth Gives Meaning to Human Experience'', Ballantine Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In another story, the virgin Chimalman conceived Quetzalcoatl by swallowing an emerald.&lt;ref&gt;David Carrasco, ''Quetzalcoatl and the Irony of Empire'', The University of Chicago Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; A third story narrates that Chimalman was hit in the womb by an arrow bolted by [[Mixcoatl]] and nine months later she gave birth to Quetzalcoatl.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Bierlein, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2016|talk=Bierlein_cite_about_Quetzalcoatl}} A fourth story narrates that Quetzalcoatl was born from [[Coatlicue]], who already had four hundred children who formed the stars of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Bierlein 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mongolian mythology===
According to a legend narrated by ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', a Mongol woman named [[Alan Gua]] had a son, named [[Bodonchar Munkhag|Bodonchar]], some years after her husband has died. She claimed a radiant yellow person visited her at night and impregnated her. She believed the visitor was the god [[Tengri]]. Bodonchar became the founder of the [[Borjigin]] tribe and a direct ancestor of [[Genghis Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lococo Paul, ''Genghis Khan: History's Greatest Empire Builder'', Potomac Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese mythology===
Miraculous births are common in Japanese folklore, and include [[Momotarō]] the Peach Boy (who was found inside a giant peach floating on a river), [[Kintarō]] (about whom several origin myths are told), and [[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Kaguya-hime]] (who was born inside the stalk of a glowing bamboo plant).

===Native American mythology===
The [[Great Peacemaker]], sometimes referred to as Deganawida or Dekanawida ([[Iroquois]]) was born a Huron, and by some accounts, his mother was a virgin, so the birth was miraculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Discovery TV |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFIgq8D3oRk|location= Location 14:00min |title=War of the American Indians : Documentary on the History of the Iroquois |date=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5449">'''Prison religion''' includes the [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices of [[prison]] [[Wikt:Inmate|inmates]], usually stemming from or including concepts surrounding their imprisonment and accompanying lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.scranton.edu/faculty/DAMMERH2/religion.html ''Religion in Prison''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702212124/http://academic.scranton.edu/faculty/DAMMERH2/religion.html |date=2007-07-02 }}. Harry R. Dammer, University of Scranton&lt;/ref&gt; "Prison Ministry" is a larger concept, including the support of the spiritual and religious needs of prison guards and staff, whose work in an often demanding and brutal environment often creates a special need for pastoral care, similar to the care that is extended to the military, police officers and fire fighters.

==History==
[[File:Prison de Sainte-Pélagie - Chapelle.jpg|thumb|The chapel of the Saint-Pélagie Prison, Paris]]
Many religious groups often supply scripture and reading material, organize programs and worship, and train [[chaplains]] for work in prisons. Members of religious groups also engage in missionary activity, as there have been many instances of conversion throughout history.  For instance, one of the earliest introductions of [[Islam]] into [[Eastern Europe]] was through the work of an early 11th-century Muslim prisoner who was captured by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] during their war against Muslims.  The Muslim prisoner was brought into the territory of the [[Pechenegs]], where he taught and converted individuals to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O45CAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thomas+walker+arnold+preaching&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Vh74TLilEIOdlgfN34ifAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith''. Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, p. 335]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, early [[colonists]] originated the concept of the [[prison|penitentiary]] as a place where inmates would demonstrate their [[penance]] and remorse for their crimes through prayer and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Clear, Todd R., Cole, George F., Reisig, Michael D. 2008. ''American Corrections''. Florence, KY: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

English prison chaplains also heard confessions from condemned prisoners, some of which were published – for example, the 18th century ''[[Ordinary of Newgate's Account]]''. Such accounts presented the prisoners as coming to terms with their guilt and preparing for salvation.

Chaplains have worked with prisoners and prison staff for many years, even before formal legislation addressed the constitutional rights of inmates.

A 2005 ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'' study suggests that the practice of religion significantly reduces the chance of prisoners to engage in verbal or physical [[Wikt:altercation|altercations]], and increases the likelihood of reform after completing prison sentence time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070323195324/http://main.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=87547 ''UAB Study Finds Religion Helps Reduce Negative Prison Behaviors'']. Gail Short, UAB.edu, citing: Kent R. Kerley, Todd L. Matthews and Troy C. Blanchard. (2005) "Religiosity, Religious Participation, and Negative
Prison Behaviors." ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]''. 44(4):443–57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for religious involvement==
[[File:Rabbi Philip Alstat.jpg|thumb|right|Rabbi Philip R. Alstat, c. 1920]]

Prisoners may become involved with religion while incarcerated for a variety of reasons ranging from the materially pragmatic to the personal and spiritual.  According to research conducted by sociologist Harry R. Dammer, some of the more prominent reasons include:
#Gaining direction and meaning in one's life.
#Improving one's concept of self.
#Promoting personal behavioral change.
#Gaining protection.
#Meeting other inmates.
#Meeting volunteers.
#Obtaining prison resources.&lt;ref&gt;Dammer, Harry R.  2006.  "Religion in prison."  In ''Encyclopedia of American Prisons'', edited by Marylin D. McShane and Frank P. Williams III.  New York: Garland Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dammer, Harry R. 1992. ''Piety in Prison''. Ann Arbor: University Microfilms.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Rabbi [[Philip R. Alstat]], who served as Jewish chaplain for [[The Tombs]], the Manhattan Detention Facility, for thirty years, and also served as the Secretary of the National Jewish Council of Prison Chaplains, shared his vision of prison ministry by saying,  "My goals are the same as those of the prison authorities – to make better human beings. The only difference is that their means are discipline, security, and iron bars. Mine are the spiritual ministrations that operate with the mind and the heart."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fiske, ''New York Times'', "City Prison Chaplains' Load is Heavy", Oct 26, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Qolusta''' ({{lang-mid|Qōlutā|script=Latn}}) is the canonical [[prayer book]] of the [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]], a [[gnosticism|Gnostic sect]] from [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]]. It was translated into [[English language|English]] by [[E. S. Drower]]. The Mandaic word ''qolusta'' means "collection".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canonical Prayerbook of the Mandeans|last=Drower|first=E. S.|publisher=E.J. Brill|year=1959|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prayerbook is a collection of Mandaic prayers regarding baptisms and other sacred rituals involved in the ascension of the soul.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gnosis: Character and Testimony|last=Haardt|first=Robert|publisher=|year=1971|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Qolusta'', and two other key texts to Mandaic literature, the ''[[Mandaean Book of John]]'' and the ''[[Ginza Rba]]'', were compiled together,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though their date of authorship is heavily debated, some believing it to be during the second and third centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran: Their Cults, Customs, Magic|last=Drower|first=E.

As a pupil of another CSI systematic theologian, [[Joshua Russell Chandran]], under whom he was groomed in the 1960s, Yesurathnam established himself as a scholar and during the subsequent decade, as evidenced by his interest in Dialogical Theology, Yesurathnam seemed to have been influenced by the religious scholars [[Stanley Jedidiah Samartha]], of the [[Church of South India]] (CSI), Herbert Jai Singh, of the [[Methodist Church in India]] (MCI)&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Jai Singh, ''The Teaching of Religions in the Indian Context'', ''[[Indian Journal of Theology]]'', Volume 29, Numbers 3 and 4, July–December 1980, pp.149-159.[https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/ijt/29-3-4_149.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and David C. Scott, also of the MCI.&lt;ref name="Bob"/&gt;  During the initial years of his doctoral research in the 1970s, it was [[Arvind P. Nirmal]], [[Church of North India|CNI]] (the proponent of [[Dalit theology]]) who supervised and enabled Yesurathnam to push through his doctoral studies.

==Contribution==
===Dialogical theology===
{{Main article|Interfaith dialogue}}
Professor Jutta Sperber, of the [[University of Münster]], Germany, in a work about Dialogical Theology with special reference to the activities of the [[World Council of Churches]] and its unit on Dialogue, has quoted the work of Yesurathnam on the Christian-[[Muslim]] dialogue.  Similarly, Sonia Calza&lt;ref name="Sonia"&gt;Sonia Calza, ''La contemplazione: via privilegiata al dialogo cristiano-induista : Sulle orme di [[Jules Monchanin|J. Monchanin]], [[Henri Le Saux|H. Le Saux]], [[Raimon Panikkar|R. Panikkar]] e [[Bede Griffiths|B. Griffiths]]'', Pauline, Milan, 2001, p.359.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UDa57qubFoIC&amp;lpg=PA165]&lt;/ref&gt; while researching on interfaith dialogue with reference to [[Hinduism]] and Christianity, referred to Yesurathnam's work on Dialogical Theology while writing about the contribution of [[Henri Le Saux]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cornille (Edited), ''The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Inter-Religious Dialogue'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2013.  [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UHdgFhRKCOsC&amp;pg=PA1931]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative religion===
{{Main article|Comparative religion}}

Yesurathnam, also wrote on the work on the concept of Avatara, which has been cited by other scholars. Bob Robinson&lt;ref name="Bob"&gt;Bob Robinson, ''Christians Meeting Hindus: An Analysis and Theological Critique of the Hindu-Christian Encounter in India'', Regnum, [[Oxford]], 2004, p.275.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jYsVCItO7tAC&amp;pg=PR4]&lt;/ref&gt; noted this work with special emphasis on the relationship to [[Christianity]] and Steven Tsoukalas quoted Yesurathnam's work on the forms of Avatara.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Tsoukalas, ''Krishna and Christ: Body-divine Relation in the Thought of [[Shiva|Sankara]], [[Ramanuja]] and Classical Christian Orthodoxy'', [[Paternoster Press|Paternoster]], [[Milton Keynes]], 2007, pp.23, 227, 240, 241.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=djIlAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=regunta+yesuratnam&amp;dq=regunta+yesuratnam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGhNCvysXVAhXGMo8KHR9sDPkQ6AEIQzAG]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contextualization===
{{Main article|Contextualization (Bible translation)}}
Inter-disciplinary writings by Yesurathnam have struck new ground in [[inculturation]] as espoused by [[Swamy Amalorananda]] and the [[New Testament]] Scholar [[Suppogu Joseph]], [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches|STBC]] (2007)&lt;ref name="Adaptation"&gt;[http://www.printsasia.it/book/adaptation-of-the-gospel-tradition-in-luke-suppogu-joseph-8184580029-9788184580020 S. Joseph, ''Adaptation of the Gospel Tradition in Luke'', ISPCK, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924081817/http://www.printsasia.it/book/adaptation-of-the-gospel-tradition-in-luke-suppogu-joseph-8184580029-9788184580020 |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had made a sustained research exploring possibilities for the [[Gospel]] to adapt itself to the multi-religious ethos of India.  Earlier proponents who experimented with [[Contextualization (Bible translation)|Contextualization]], emphasizing on the presentation of [[Christ]] adapting to the [[Indian culture]], were [[Robert de Nobili]], [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], [[E. Stanley Jones]], [[Methodist Church in India|MCI]], and [[B. V. Subbamma]], [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church|AELC]], who together were known for their contribution to the [[Christian Ashram Movement]] in India.

Yesurathnam's definition of [[Contextualization (Bible translation)|Contextualization]] has been acknowledged by scholars as a resourceful addition.  Charles E. Van Engen&lt;ref name="Contextualization"/&gt; and Akintunde E. Akinade&lt;ref&gt;Akintunde E. Akinade, ''The Crucible of Faith:  Justice and Liberation in the work of Engelbert Mvent'' in ''Religions - A Scholarly Journal'', Issue 3, 2012, pp.107-116.  [http://www.qscience.com/doi/pdf/10.5339/rels.2012.justice.17]&lt;/ref&gt; refer to the word ''contextualization'' as defined by Yesurathnam.

===Renewal of the Church===
{{Main article|Church renewal}}
Yesurathnam cautioned the Church against falling into traditionalism.  During the Golden Jubilee of the founding of the [[Uniting church]], the CSI held in [[Chennai]] in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;John C. B. Webster, ''The Church of South India Golden Jubilee'' in  ''[[International Bulletin of Missionary Research]]'', Volume 22, Number 2, 1998, pp.50-54.[http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/1998-02/1998-02-ibmr.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Yesurathnam spoke on the ills befalling the Church in India,
{{quotation|(Adapted) ''The church hierarchy of [[Bishop]]s, [[Presbyter]]s, [[Deacon]]s and [[Laity]] is turning into a [[Varna (Hinduism)|Chaturvarna system]], with the [[Laity]] and [[Women]] as the [[Shudras]], the bottom-most caste.''&lt;ref&gt;R. Yesurathnam, ''Liberation from Jubilee Perspective'' in ''South India Churchman'', July 1997, pp.7-8.[http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/1998-02/1998-02-ibmr.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=May 2018}}}}  Echoing the apprehensions by Yesurathnam, [[Stanley Jedidiah Samartha]] who was also present at the Jubilee in [[Chennai]], pointed out that one must first introspect before raising [[cudgels]] against the [[Indian caste system]] and believed that one failed to notice the gradual transformation of the [[episcopacy]] into such a system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Jedidiah Samartha]], "Vision and Reality: Reflections on the Church of South India" in ''[[People's Reporter]]'', 1–15 September 1997, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yesurathnam, in an introduction to the book ''Jesus' Tears!'' by Elizabeth Thelma Johnson (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Thelma Johnson, ''Jesus' Tears!'', ISPCK, New Delhi, 2007, p.xv.  [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=nlbUf3gPPl0C&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;dq=r.yesuratnam&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; has highlighted the work of a [[Laity]] and appreciated their contribution towards the [[Christian missions]].

==Studies==
From his youth, Yesurathnam was inspired by the work of the [[Roman Catholic missionaries|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant missionary|Protestant]] [[Christian mission]]s in Telangana. He entered the ministry of the [[Catholic Church]] through the [[Diocese of Medak]], becoming a ministerial candidate during the bishopric of [[Frank Whittaker]], the first Bishop-in-Medak. He studied at a [[seminary]] in [[Bangalore]] for spiritual formation and was ordained in 1967 by [[Bishop]] [[Eber Priestley]], the then Bishop-in-Medak.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Graduate===
After initial schooling at the mission schools founded by the [[English Wesleyan Mission|Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society]] (WMMS) in Telangana, Yesurathnam decided to take up [[priesthood]]. Bishops [[Frank Whittaker]] and [[Eber Priestley]], successively, became his Spiritual Confessors and led him to take up spiritual studies at the [[United Theological College, Bangalore]] during 1963-1967.&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; He was awarded a [[Bachelor of Divinity|B. D.]] degree.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Postgraduate===
{{Main article|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin}}
In 1969, Yesurathnam was recalled from parish work and sent to the Protestant Regional Theologiate in [[Bangalore]] for further spiritual studies that lasted until 1972 and resulted in the award of a [[Master of Theology]] degree after research under [[Joshua Russell Chandran]] of the CSI.&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt;

===Doctoral===
{{Main article|Henri Le Saux}}
[[File:Swami Abhishiktananda.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Henri Le Saux]], [[Order of Saint Benedict|OSB]] (1910-1973) ([[Swami Abhishiktananda]]);  Yesurathnam researched during 1978-1982 on [[Benedictine monk|Benedictine monk's]] experiences of [[spirituality]] as found in [[Hinduism]] and [[Christianity]]]]
After a five-year teaching ministry that began in 1974&lt;ref name="Punthi"/&gt; at the Andhra Christian Theological College, Secunderabad, Yesurathnam qualified to undertake doctoral level research in 1978&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; and was granted a five-year study leave.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;R. Yesurathnam, ''Religious Pluralism: Some Implications for the Mission of the Church'' in [[H. S. Wilson]] (Edited),  ''The Church on the Move: A Quest to Affirm the Biblical Faith'', Christian Literature Society, Chennai, 1988.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=S-wrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=h.+s.+wilson+victor+premasagar&amp;dq=h.+s.+wilson+victor+premasagar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF3fKC7NnVAhVMrY8KHVgyCyMQ6AEIJzAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Yesurathnam's Bishop during that period, [[B. G. Prasada Rao]], made efforts to ensure that Yesurathnam was able to join his ''[[alma mater]]'', the United Theological College, Bangalore, where he was able to take up research in the discipline of systematic theology under the guidance of Arvind P. Nirmal, [[Church of North India|CNI]].  Yesurathnam also came under the tutelage of [[Stanley Jedidiah Samartha]], a leading authority on Dialogical Theology.&lt;ref name="Hans"&gt;Hans Schwarz, ''Theology in a Global Context: The Last Two Hundred Years'', William B. Eerdmans, [[Grand Rapids]], 2005. pp.523-526. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gtkvQxB-6lsC&amp;pg=PA524]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the research period between 1978-1982,&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; Yesurathnam was also sent to the [[University of Birmingham]], England, in 1979 for a two-year research exposure through the efforts of Gordon Shaw&lt;ref name="Punthi"/&gt; who ensured his overseas travel and stay in England at Kingsmead College under the [[Selly Oak Colleges]], where he was supervised by [[Walter Jacob Hollenweger]], a leading authority on [[Pentecostalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Jacob Hollenweger]], ''My Pilgrimage in Mission'', ''[[International Bulletin of Missionary Research]]'', Volume 29, Number 2, 2005, p. 85-88.[http://www.wjhollenweger.ch/files/2005-02-085-hollenweger-my-pilgrimage-in-mission.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1981, Yesurathnam returned to the United Theological College and began shaping his doctoral dissertation under the guidance of David C. Scott and by 1982, he rejoined the Andhra Christian Theological College, which by then was being led by the [[New Testament]] scholar,&lt;ref&gt;David Komaravalli, ''Divine Operation and Human Response: A Comparison Between [[Rudolf Bultmann]]'s Understanding of the Pauline Perspectives and Certain Elements in Recent Indian Thought'', [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Edinburgh]], 1973.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Iq8UMwEACAAJ&amp;dq=komaravalli+david&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW3abo_f_VAhXMvY8KHTj8AoEQ6AEIJzAA]&lt;/ref&gt; K. David, [[CBCNC]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Mar Aprem Mooken]], ''Indian Christian who is who'', Bombay Parish Church of the East, Bombay, 1983, p.106.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=u2s5AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=komaravalli+david&amp;dq=komaravalli+david&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW3abo_f_VAhXMvY8KHTj8AoEQ6AEIMDAC]&lt;/ref&gt; and took up his teaching role in systematic theology, but was able to submit his doctoral thesis to the university through his supervisor at the United Theological College and finally in 1987, much before nearing a decade of registering with the university, it awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Theology]].&lt;ref name="DTH"&gt;Senate of Serampore College, ''List of the Recipient of the Degree of Doctor of Theology''.  [http://www.senateofseramporecollege.edu.in/hall-of-fame/doctor-of-theology/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Yesurathnam sought permission from the Senate of Serampore College to publish his doctoral work nearly two decades later, in 2006.&lt;ref name="Punthi"/&gt; His thesis was already being referred by research scholars&lt;ref&gt;Antony Kalliath, ''The Word in the Cave: The Experiential Journey of Swami Abhishiktānanda to the Point of Hindu-Christian Meeting'', Intercultural Publications, New Delhi, 1996, p.436.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tgPkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=antony+kalliath+dialogical+theology&amp;dq=antony+kalliath+dialogical+theology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLnIur8f_VAhUBOY8KHXaEBUkQ6AEILDAB]&lt;/ref&gt; on works relating to the contribution of [[Swami Abhishiktananda]].

==Ministry==

===Pastoral ministry===
[[File:Medakcathedralsideview.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[Church of South India|CSI]]-Medak Cathedral,[[Medak]] where Yesurathnam was ordained in 1967 by Bishop [[Eber Priestley]], [[Diocese of Medak|Bishop - in - Medak]].]]
{{Main article|Diocese of Medak of the Church of South India}}
Yesurathnam was ordained in 1967 by Priestley, then Bishop-in-Medak, and was assigned ministerial functions in the parishes falling under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Medak and served in [[Sangareddy]]&lt;ref name="Hope"/&gt; and other towns shepherding congregations for nearly a decade&lt;ref name="Punthi"/&gt; until he was recalled in 1974 by then Bishop, [[H. D. L. Abraham]], and reassigned the role of a Spiritual Formator.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 1992, when [[Victor Premasagar]] vacated the bishopric of Medak on attaining superannuation, the ensuing [[Sede vacante]] was contested among whom Yesurathnam stood in the fray for the vacant bishopric, which was overseen by [[Ryder Devapriam]], then Moderator of the [[Church of South India Synod]] and a former colleague of Yesurathnam at the Protestant Regional Theologiate.  However, the sudden death of Devapriam on 4 September 1992&lt;ref name="Nandyal"&gt;[http://dioceseofnandyal.org/ Diocese of Nandyal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106141716/http://dioceseofnandyal.org/ |date=2010-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Council of Churches Review]]'', Volume 112, 1992, p.774.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MgnZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ryder+devapriam+germany&amp;dq=ryder+devapriam+germany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixraOg4eHXAhWBv48KHfPuDxgQ6AEIJTAA]&lt;/ref&gt; turned the tides for those in fray, resulting in the appointment and subsequent consecration of [[B. P. Sugandhar]].

===Teaching===

The Andhra Christian Theological College (ACTC) relocated from [[Rajahmundry]] to Secunderabad. Yesurathnam was invited to join the college in 1974,&lt;ref name="Punthi"/&gt; during the Principalship of [[Victor Premasagar]].&lt;ref name="Carder"&gt;William Gordon Carder, ''On theological education in [[Andhra Pradesh]] of the [[Canadian Baptist Mission]] [[Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars]] 1880-1975'' in ''Indian Church History Review'', Volume 13, Issue 1, 1979, pp.70-84.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wsTYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Christian+Ministerial+Training+in+the+Convention+of+Baptist+Churches+of+Northern+Circars+from+1882+to+1971&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=jeremiah]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 he was appointed guest professor at the [[Kirchliche Hochschule Wuppertal/Bethel]] in Germany,&lt;ref name="Matthias"&gt;Matthias Freudenberg, ''Anniversary letter to [[Jürgen Fangmeier]]'', 2011, p.6.[http://www.reformiert-info.de/daten/File/Upload/doc-10788-1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; where he taught until 1994.{{cn|date=May 2018}} He then returned to ACTC and was appointed principal under the institution's policy of rotating that office between the various constituent churches in four-year cycles.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Yesurathnam took a year's sabbatical leave in 1998 to the Overseas Ministries Study Center,&lt;ref name="IBMR"/&gt; [[New Haven, Connecticut]] to continue his research pursuits&lt;ref name="IBMR1"&gt;R. Yesurathnam, ''Book Review: Relevant Patterns of Christian Witness in India: People as Agents of Mission'', [[International Bulletin of Missionary Research]], Volume 25, Issue 88, 2001.

===Missionary service===
When the [[Council for World Mission]] (CWM) sought missionaries from the CSI, Yesurathnam moved to the [[International University of the Caribbean]], [[Kingston, Jamaica]], where he began his sojourn in the [[New millennium]] and served as a theological educator for nearly a decade&lt;ref&gt;[[Council for World Mission]] Annual Review 2009'', ''Missionaries serving with CWM, 2009, pp. 18, 23.[http://www.cwmission.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AnnualReport2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; until his death on 8 August 2011&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt; at the [[Yashoda Hospitals]], [[Hyderabad]].

==Writings==

The relationship between '''religion and [[HIV/AIDS]]''' is complicated, and often controversial. Controversies have mainly revolved around [[LGBT]] people and [[condom]] use.

==Religious attitudes towards HIV-positive people and AIDS==
===Islam===

The question of Islam and [[AIDS]] has arisen in recent years as the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic has grown stronger, with awareness and efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.&lt;ref name="Tackling AIDS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1157962465531&amp;pagename=Zone-English-HealthScience%2FHSELayout |title=Tackling AIDS Through Islam? |author=Najma Mohamed |work=Islam Online |accessdate=26 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529085511/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1157962465531&amp;pagename=Zone-English-HealthScience%2FHSELayout |archivedate=May 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Muslims view the AIDS epidemic through what is called the “prism of sin”, and as the consequence of sinful behavior, such as [[prostitution]], sex with multiple partners or [[promiscuity]].&lt;ref name="Tackling AIDS"/&gt; Awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is growing among the Muslim community and efforts are being initiated to prevent its spread. The Muslim Awareness Programme (MAP), based in South Africa is a faith-based organization that promotes HIV/AIDS prevention strategies based on the moral teachings of Islam. These activities include the promotion of [[abstinence]] from all sexual activity outside marriage; refraining from drug use, and instilling faithfulness within marriage. According to most Muslims, the key to combating to the HIV/AIDS epidemic is prevention.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In their view, the Islamic position on morality, chastity and the sanctity of marriage needs to be shared with the world. Islam cites sex with multiple partners, sex outside marriage, other promiscuous sexual behaviors and [[homosexuality]] as immoral and as a result of this some Muslims consider this behavior the main cause of HIV/AIDS, believing that promoting abstinence, chastity, and intramarital sex is the key to ending or at least containing the epidemic.

===Judaism and Jewish thinkers===
As opposed to the Catholic Church and some other denominations or religions, today, there isn't any central Jewish religious authority that is acceptable by vast majority of religious Jews or by most Jewish religious movements.

[[Orthodox Judaism]] links between immoral sexual behavior and AIDS. [[Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits]], former Chief Rabbi of England, a prominent figure in 20th century Jewish medical ethics&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits]]&lt;/ref&gt; maintains in his article "Halachic Perspectives on AIDS" that "... from my reading of Jewish sources, it would appear that under no circumstances would we be justified in branding the incidence of the disease (...) as punishment ... we have not the vision, that would enable us to link, as an assertion of certainty, any form of human travail, grief, bereavement or suffering in general with shortcomings of a moral nature... It is one thing to speak of a consequence, and it is quite another thing to speak of a punishment ... if you warn a child not to play with fire, lest he gets burnt, and the child then gets burnt, then the burning may not be a punishment for not listening, but it certainly is a consequence. ... I think we should declare in very plain and explicit terms indicating that our society violated some of the norms of the Divine Law, and of the natural law, and that as a consequence we pay a price, and an exceedingly heavy price. This certainly is Jewish doctrine ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medethics.org.il/articles/JME/JMEB2/JMEB2.14.asp] ASSIA – ''Jewish Medical Ethics'', Vol. 2, No. 1, January 1991, pp. 3–8&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish Orthodox]] society, having AIDS is considered a mark of disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Responses to HIV: A Mitzvah|url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art56481.html|work=TheBody.com|accessdate=27 January 2014|author=Alana Krivo-Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]] emphasize the importance of ''[[bikur cholim]]'', the responsibility to care for the sick:
:"The [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]] calls upon all of its congregations to reach out to individuals infected with the AIDS virus, their families and their friends by providing acceptance, comfort, counseling, and sympathetic and empathetic listening; and ... affirms that those infected with the AIDS virus must be protected from all forms of [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|illegal discrimination]], such as discriminatory housing, employment, health care delivery services and synagogue services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Synagogue Resolution On AIDS|url=http://www.jewishlasvegas.com/page.aspx?id=12085|publisher=The Jewish Federation of Las Vegas|accessdate=27 June 2013|author=United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism|year=1991 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920230253/http://www.jewishlasvegas.com/page.aspx?id=12085 |archivedate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Marla J. Feldman, Director of the Joint Commission on Social Action of the Union for Reform Judaism: "However, we must look past the incomprehensible statistics and long lists of facts and recognize the Divine image within the faces of the individual people infected and affected by this disease. The responsibility lies with each of us to protect and care for these victims ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rac.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=1999&amp;pge_prg_id=13740 |publisher=Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism|title=Reform Jewish Leader Mourns AIDS Deaths and Calls for Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Prevention |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127211945/http://rac.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=1999&amp;pge_prg_id=13740 |archivedate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
Many Christian charities provide services for people living with HIV/AIDS.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} One example is the [[DREAM (AIDS therapy program)|"Drug Resources Enhancement against Aids and Malnutrition" (DREAM)]], program promoted by the [[Christian]] [[Community of Sant'Egidio]].

[[Jerry Falwell]] regularly linked the [[AIDS pandemic]] to LGBT issues and stated, "AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals, it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals."&lt;ref name="Falwell"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.milforddailynews.com/opinion/x1987843539|title=Press: The Sad Legacy of Jerry Falwell|accessdate=2007-05-18|last= Press|first = Bill |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430144811/http://www.milforddailynews.com/opinion/x1987843539 |archivedate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
[[Hinduism]] has shown support for research aimed at curing HIV/AIDS, and care for those affected by HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Tackling AIDS"/&gt;

==Prevention==
===Catholicism===
{{main|Catholic Church and AIDS}}
The Catholic Church opposes [[condom]] use between heterosexual couples because it is an artificial form of [[contraception]] that does not rely on the functions of the body (and thus also God's will) itself as to whether a conception will occur or not, and the Church believes it also serves to implicitly and inexcusably encourage premarital and extramarital sexuality (and recourse to abortion if the condom fails).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[Pope John Paul II]] strongly opposed the use of artificial birth control, and rejected the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name="John Paul II and condoms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1979145,00.html|title=Catholic Church to Ease Ban on Condom Use|date=24 April 2006|publisher=© 2006, 2009 Deutsche Welle|accessdate=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] stated in 2005 that condoms were not a sufficient solution to the AIDS crisis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Pope rejects condoms for Africa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4081276.stm | date=2005-06-10 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then in 2009 claimed that AIDS "cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Telegraph|title=Pope Benedict XVI: condoms make Aids crisis worse|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/5005357/Pope-Benedict-XVI-condoms-make-Aids-crisis-worse.html | date=2009-03-17 | accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moscow Patriarchate]] gave support to Benedict XVI's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/international/africa/story.php?id=32756 |title=Moscow Patriarchate Backs Pope's Stance on Condoms |publisher=Zenit News Agency |date=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Benedict XVI's statements, the [[United Church of Christ]] issued a statement encouraging condom distribution at places of worship.&lt;ref name="UCC and condoms"&gt;[http://www.ucc.org/news/uccs-health-advocates-press.html UCC’s health advocates press for increased condom distribution]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 2010, when questioned about the rampant HIV spread in Africa, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] suggested that the use of condoms in male prostitution is not a moral solution to stopping AIDS, but could represent a first step in assuming moral responsibility "in the intention of reducing the risk of infection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101120/ap_on_re_eu/eu_pope_condoms |title=Pope says some condom use first step of morality |website=Yahoo News |publisher=Associated Press |date=20 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121121202/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101120/ap_on_re_eu/eu_pope_condoms |archivedate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vatican City clarifies, after Benedict's statement sows confusion, that the position of the Church on condoms has not changed. It is merely a statement that in homosexual relations, where unnatural contraception is not the main concern, condoms can be seen as moral responsibility in preventing HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-11-20-pope-condoms_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Vatican clarifies pope's condom comments: Nothing's changed | date=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 23, 2010, Benedict furthermore stated that the concept of condoms as a lesser evil in preventing HIV infections can be applied to women as well. The use of condoms is the first step in taking responsibility and attempting to prevent the infection of one's partner. The Pope does not say anything about condoms being acceptable as unnatural birth control, only as a responsible approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40331930/ns/world_news-europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
In Thailand, some Buddhist monks encourage the use of condoms for HIV prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=52,3702,0,0,1,0|title=Buddhist Monk Embraces Condoms|date=2007-02-07|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of [[Mechai Viravaidya]]'s pro-condom campaign, Buddhist monks have offered blessed condoms for couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/rxforsurvival/series/champions/mechai_viravaidya.html|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|title = Global Health Champions: Mechai Viravaidya|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
The work of some Christian ministries has affected the treatment of AIDS. According to the African Health Policy Network, some churches in [[London]] claim that prayer will cure AIDS and the [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reports that several people have stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their [[pastor]], leading to a number of deaths.&lt;ref name=BBC18102011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14406818|title=Church HIV prayer cure claims 'cause three deaths'|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=18 October 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Synagogue Church Of All Nations]] advertise an "anointing water" to promote God's healing, although the group deny advising people to stop taking medication,&lt;ref name=BBC18102011 /&gt; and US [[patent application]] 2001051133 similarly suggests that intravenous pure distilled water will eradicate HIV through the mercy of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2001051133|status=application}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian churches actively distribute HIV/AIDS medication.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19783">One of the most common ways that people cope with trauma is through the comfort found in religious or spiritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists of religion have performed multiple studies to measure the positive and negative effects of this coping style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trevino | first1 = K. M. | last2 = Pargament | first2 = K. I. | year = 2007 | title = Religious coping with terrorism and natural disaster | url = | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 100 | issue = 9| pages = 946–947 | doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3181454660| pmid = 17902314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading researchers have split religious coping into two categories: positive religious coping and negative religious coping. Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.

The effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles of religious coping==
[[Kenneth Pargament]] is the author of the book ''[[Psychology of Religion and Coping]]'' and a leading researcher in religious coping. Along with developing the "RCOPE" questionnaire to measure religious coping strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = Kenneth I. | last2 = Koenig | first2 = Harold G. | last3 = Perez | first3 = Lisa M. | year = 2000 | title = The many methods of religious coping: Development and initial validation of the RCOPE | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 519–543 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4&lt;519::AID-JCLP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1 | pmid = 10775045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pargament and his colleagues designated three basic styles of coping with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament, Joseph Kennell, William Hathaway, Nancy Grevengoed, Jon Newman &amp; Wendy Jones (1988). Religion and the problem-solving process: Three styles of coping. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, v27 n1, pp90-104. ISSN 0021-8294&lt;/ref&gt; In Pargament's article "Religion and the Problem-Solving Process: Three Styles of Coping", he identifies the collaborative, self-directed, and deferring coping styles. The collaborative style of religious coping involves an active and internalized personal exchange with God. The deferring coping style is when individuals rely heavily on God and delegate their stress without taking personal responsibility for the situation. The self-directed style of religious coping emphasizes the free will given by God that allows for the individual to solve the problem on their own. The collaborative style of coping has been found to produce the most advantages in clinical settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = III | last2 = Lynn | first2 = Q. K. | last3 = Crossley | first3 = C. D. | last4 = Pargament | first4 = K. I. | year = 2004 | title = Self-Directing Religious Coping: A Deistic God, Abandoning God, or No God at All? | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 409–418 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00243.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meta-analysis of 49 studies reviewing religion as a coping method, several mechanisms of positive coping were identified. Several are listed below.
* religious purification/forgiveness
* religious direction/conversion
* seeking support from clergy members
* spiritual connection
In the same study, negative coping strategies were also pinpointed. Some of them are listed below.
* spiritual discontent
* punishing God reappraisal
* reappraisal of God's powers
* pleading for direct intercession
The study then identified forms of positive psychological adjustment, like those listed below.
* acceptance
* happiness
* optimism
* purpose in life
A similar list of negative psychological adjustments was compiled.
* anxiety
* burden
* negative mood
* callousness
Positive religious coping methods correlated more strongly with positive psychological adjustment than negative psychological adjustment. Similarly, negative religious coping methods correlated with negative psychological adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–80|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific traumatic events==

===September 11 attacks===
The [[September 11 attacks]] have been widely studied among psychologists. Research has shown that 90% of Americans coped with the stress of September 11 (2001) by "turning to religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Harold G|title=Research on Religion, Spirituality, and Mental Health: A Review|journal=The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|volume=54|issue=5|pages=283–291|doi=10.1177/070674370905400502|pmid=19497160|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-two percent of a sample of undergraduate and graduate students reported praying to cope with the stress that followed the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stein | first1 = BD | last2 = Elliott | first2 = MN | last3 = Jaycox | first3 = LH | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = A national longitudinal study of the psychological consequences of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks: reactions, impairment, and help-seeking | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 105–117 | doi=10.1521/psyc.67.2.105.35964| pmid = 15262576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis showed that searching for spiritual meaning was associated with less anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Cascio | first2 = T | last3 = Santangelo | first3 = LK | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Hope, meaning, and growth following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks | url = | journal = J Interpers Violence | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 523–548 | doi=10.1177/0886260504272896| pmid = 15788553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists also examined the types of coping used and how they affected mental health outcomes. Research shows that people who used positive religious coping displayed greater optimism, less anxiety, and higher levels of positive emotion three months after the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Tice | first2 = TN | last3 = Peterson | first3 = C | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Prayers, spiritual support, and positive attitudes in coping with the September 11 national crisis | url = | journal = J Pers | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 763–791 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00328.x| pmid = 15854013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who used positive religious coping were found to have significantly more positive outcomes (closeness with God, relationships with family and friends) than those who used negative religious coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = KI | last2 = Ishler | first2 = K | last3 = Dubow | first3 = EF | display-authors = etal | year = 1994 | title = Methods of religious coping with the Gulf War: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses | url = | journal = J Sci Study Relig | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 347–361 | doi=10.2307/1386494| jstor = 1386494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American Muslims were another highly studied group after the attacks. Results in this area align with previous research, showing that positive religious coping is associated with posttraumatic growth, while negative religious coping predicted higher levels of depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abu-Raiya | first1 = H. | last2 = Pargament | first2 = K. I. | last3 = Mahoney | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Examining coping methods with stressful interpersonal events experienced by Muslims living in the United States following the 9/11 attacks | url = | journal = Psychology of Religion and Spirituality | volume = 3| issue = | pages = 1–14| doi = 10.1037/a0020034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of a loved one===

Individuals deal with the death of significant people in their lives in a variety of ways. One of the most common ways that Americans deal with the death of a loved one is by turning to religion. Although most psychologists would argue that religious coping leads to positive outcomes, some research identifies that coping using religious can lead to greater amounts of distress, especially in dealing with the loss of a family member due to homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Vardaman | first2 = P. J. | year = 1997 | title = The role of religion in coping with the loss of a family member to homicide | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 44–51 | doi = 10.2307/1387881 | jstor = 1387881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research recognized that the role of attachment to God is very important in determining how successful religious coping will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ungureanu | first1 = I. | last2 = Sandberg | first2 = J. G. | year = 2010 | title = Broken together": Spirituality and religion as coping strategies for couples dealing with the death of a child: A literature review with clinical implications | url = | journal = Contemporary Family Therapy: An International Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 302–319 | doi = 10.1007/s10591-010-9120-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that secure attachment to God and a positive religious coping style is positively correlated with stress related growth, positive religious outcomes, and a developed sense of meaning. Anxious and avoidant attachments to God and negative religious coping styles were positively correlated with depression, traumatic distress, and separation distress. Furthermore, attachment to God was strongly more correlated to positive outcomes than attachment to others.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, M. M. (2003, April). Bereavement and grief related to a significant death: A psychological and theological study of attachment styles and religious coping. Dissertation Abstracts International Section A, 63,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near-death experiences===

[[Near-death experiences]] (NDEs) provide a unique opportunity for psychologists to study the way in which people cope with their own death. NDEs generally trigger an out-of-body experience into a realm populated with spiritual beings and have the potential to shape American attitudes toward death in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kwilecki | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Religion and Coping: A Contribution from Religious Studies | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 477–489 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00250.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys show that five percent of Americans have a NDE, which presents a limited field to study.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L. W. and J. Yates. (1996.) Introduction. In the near-death experience: A reader, edited by L. W. Bailey and J. Yates, pp. 1–23. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, people who have NDEs report positive outcomes including reduced anxiety, increased capacity to love, and a higher sense of meaning and purpose in life.&lt;ref&gt;Atwater, P. M. H. (1994). Beyond the light: The mysteries and revelations of near-death experiences. New York: Avon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have NDEs often fall into Pargament's category of transformative coping. In these cases, the person is transformed into a whole new way of life and way of thinking by one supernatural experience.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using religious coping in school and work ==

=== MindUP Initiative ===
Twelve years ago Goldie Hawn founded MindUP: a mindfulness based initiative to help students in schools deal with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, E. (2015, Feb 17). Can 'mindfulness' help students do better in school? advocates say the meditation technique raises focus and lowers stress. critics see religion in disguise. Wall Street Journal (Online)&lt;/ref&gt; The program has since been implemented in schools in 28 states, and has locations in Canada, China, Serbia, Australia, and Venezuela. The program invites students to participate in 15 lessons based on neuroscience. Kimberly Schonert-Reichl an employee of MindsUP and of the University of British Columbia evaluated the effectiveness of MindUP on students grades 4 through 5. Her findings are shown below:

* 82% of children reported having a more positive outlook
* 81% of children learned to make themselves happy
* 58% of children tried to help others more often

Even though MindUP has had very positive effects skeptics call it religion in disguise. They claim that the mindfulness exercises such as "belly breaths" are [[Buddhist]] practices as a different name. In some states MindUP has been removed from schools because schools are supposed to be secular and non-religious.

===Religion as buffer in the workplace===
A study was conducted by Dr Roxane Gervais, a senior psychologist at the Health and Safety Laboratory in Stockport.&lt;ref&gt;Religion forms buffer against work stress. (2014, Jan 09). Telegraph.Co.Uk&lt;/ref&gt; She found that people who were more actively religious were more likely to report low levels of anxiety, depression and fatigue and also felt a higher presence of meaning in life. These people also took less sick days. She concluded that employers should accommodate time for employees to engage in religious beliefs while at work in order to improve performance.

==Religious coping in clinical settings==
Despite the problems encountered when studying religion as a coping mechanism, much research suggests that using it in intervention settings when applicable may be beneficial. For example, according to a study be Wachholtz and Pargament, when identified religious people suffering from splitting migraines were exposed to meditations with religious or non-religious content, they reported less pain after the religious meditations. Such "psychospiritual" methods have been utilized for a while, although their applications are limited and specific from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|pages=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion vs. spirituality==
Research in the psychology of religion often reveals different outcomes between [[religion]] and [[spirituality]]. A person's religion is a collection of belief systems and moral values, often established by a governing institution. Religion is generally more traditional, organized, and sociological. Religion is considered to be more formal and upheld than spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirituality, on the other hand, is a measure of one's intrinsic relationship with their God. Spirituality is viewed and studied as being more free-formed and psychological. Also, spirituality is considered to be a private experience that promotes a process of growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the psychology of coping with trauma, religion and spirituality can play very different roles. Some research shows that religion, but not spirituality can help with coping,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Tomas. (2012). Religion, but not spirituality, helps protect against post-earthquake trauma. Epiphenom.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other shows that intrinsic spirituality can be a very effective style of coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vespa | first1 = A. | last2 = Jacobsen | first2 = P.

Through religious and spiritual coping, individuals can derive support from a divine being, from other members of a religious congregation, and from making meaning of distressing events, which can lead to the promotion of resilience, healing, and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E.

==Problems with studying religious coping==
Studying religion as a coping mechanism has proved a difficult task for psychologists. Religion seems to be an integral part of some people's lives but not of others, so specialists cannot be certain whether religion is the variable to study or if there is something about religious people that makes them religious that is worth studying. Many studies only measure the frequency of certain "religious" activities including prayer or religious service attendance; however, just because a person exhibits religious behavior does not mean that he or she uses his or her religion to cope or even adheres to the set of beliefs that constitutes a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–480|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the research done on religion and coping has been isolated to Christianity. Studies are being conducted to accommodate for the diversity of religions and their differences among cultures.

Many studies on the subject show contrary results. For example, some psychologists conclude that religiosity has no positive or negative outcomes at all and others cite that any form of religious coping has ultimately negative effects. These results may be a product of the inconsistencies in the ways that religion is studied as a coping mechanism or could reflect biases of researchers toward a certain religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34296">Scholarly studies have investigated the effects of religion on health. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) discerns four dimensions of health, namely physical, social, mental, and spirirtual health. Having a [[religious belief]] may have both positive and negative impacts on health and morbidity.

==Religion and spirituality==
[[Spirituality]] has been ascribed many different definitions in different contexts, but a general definition is: an individual’s search for meaning and purpose in life. Spirituality is distinct from [[organized religion]] in that spirituality does not necessarily need a religious framework. That is, one does not necessarily need to follow certain rules, guidelines or practices to be spiritual, but an organized religion often has some combination of these in place. Some people who suffer from severe mental disorders may find comfort in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pargament|first=Kenneth|date=February 2013|title=Understanding and addressing religion among people with mental illness|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=12 | issue = 1 |pages=26–32|doi=10.1002/wps.20005|pmid=23471791|pmc=3619169}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who report themselves to be spiritual people may not observe any specific religious practices or traditions.&lt;ref name="Nelson, C.J. 2002 pp. 213"&gt;Nelson, C.J., Rosenfeld, B., Breitbart, W., Galietta, M.

==Dimensions of health==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) discerns four dimensions of health, namely physical, social, mental, and spirirtual health.

===Physical health===

====Positive effects====
According to Ellison &amp; Levin (1998), some studies indicate that religiosity appears to positively correlate with physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accoridng to Seybold &amp; Hill (2001), almost all studies involved in the effect of religion on a person's physical health have revealed it has a positive attribution to their lifestyle. These studies have been carried out among all ages,genders and religions. These are based on the experience of religion is positive in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seybold,K.S &amp; Hill,P.C|date=February 2001|title=The Role Of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=10 | issue = 1 |pages=21–24|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00106|jstor=20182684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One possibility is that religion provides physical health benefits indirectly. Church attendees present with lower rates of alcohol consumption and improvement in mood, which is associated with better physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Pargament]]  is a major contributor to the theory of how individuals may use religion as a resource in coping with [[stress (medicine)|stress]], His work seems to show the influence of [[attribution theory]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar studies have been done investigating religious emotions and health. Although religious emotions, such as humility, forgiveness, and gratitude confer health benefits, it is unclear if religious people cultivate and experience those emotions more frequently than non-religious peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145024 | pmid=12171998 | volume=54 | title=The psychology of religion | year=2003 | pages=377–402 |vauthors=Emmons RA, Paloutzian RF | journal=Annual Review of Psychology | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Church attendance====
Church attendance has been found to increase life expectancy (Hummer et al. 1999) with a life expectancy at age 20 of 83 years for frequent attendees and 75 years for non-attendees.  The finding, however, does not prove that religion in itself increases life expectancy.

====Death rates====
Kark et. (1996) included almost 4,000 Israelis, over 16 years (beginning in 1970), death rates were compared between the experimental group (people belonging to 11 religious [[kibbutz]]im) versus the control group (people belonging to secular kibbutzim). Some determining factors for the groups included the date the kibbutz was created, geography of the different groups, and the similarity in age. It was determined that “belonging to a religious collective was associated with a strong protective effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kark JD, Shemi G, Friedlander Y, Martin O, Manor O, Blondheim SH |title=Does religious observance promote health? mortality in secular vs religious kibbutzim in Israel |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=341–6 |date=March 1996  |pmid=8604758 |pmc=1380514 |doi=10.2105/ajph.86.3.341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do religious people tend to exhibit healthier lifestyles, they also have a strong support system that secular people would not normally have. A religious community can provide support especially through a stressful life event such as the death of a loved one or illness. There is the belief that a higher power will provide healing and strength through the rough times which also can explain the lower mortality rate of religious people vs. secular people.

The existence of ‘religious struggle’ in elderly patients was predictive of greater risk of mortality in a study by Pargament et al. (2001). Results indicate that patients, with a previously sound religious life, experienced a 19% to 28% greater mortality due to the belief that God was supposedly punishing them or abandoning them.

====Infections====
A number of religious practices have been reported to cause [[infections]]. These happened during an ultra-orthodox Jewish [[circumcision]]s practice known as [[Brit milah#Metzitzah B.27Peh|metzitzah b'peh]], the ritual 'side roll' in [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The ‘side roll’ is a ritual performed during a Hindu festival in which large numbers of male devotees lie prostrate on the ground and roll sideways around the temple premises in fulfilment of vows taken at the temple. Because the men’s upper bodies are usually bare during this ritual, their skin comes into contact with the parasitic larvae that infest the soil or sand on the ground, resulting in the [[Cutaneous larva migrans]] (CLM) skin disease.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Communion rite|communion]] [[chalice]], during the Islamic [[Hajj]] and after the Muslim ritual [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]].&lt;ref name="Pellerin"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Prayer====
{{Main|Studies on intercessory prayer}}

Some religions claim that praying for somebody who is sick can have positive effects on the health of the person being prayed for. [[meta-study|Meta-studies]] of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernible effect" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=Masters &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masters | first1 = K. | last2 = Spielmans | first2 = G. | last3 = Goodson | first3 = J. | date = Aug 2006 | title = Are there demonstrable effects of distant intercessory prayer?

Randomized controlled trials of intercessory prayer have not yielded significant effects on health. These trials have compared personal, focused, committed and organized intercessory prayer with those interceding holding some belief that they are praying to God or a god versus any other intervention. A Cochrane collaboration review of these trials concluded that 1) results were equivocal, 2) evidence does not support a recommendation either in favor or against the use of intercessory prayer and 3) any resources available for future trials should be used to investigate other questions in health research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roberts L, Ahmed I, Hall S, Davison A |title=Intercessory prayer for the alleviation of ill health |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000368 |year=2009 |pmid=19370557 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000368.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a case-control study done following 5,286 Californians over a 28-year period in which variables were controlled for (i.e. age, race/ethnicity, gender, education level), participants who went to church on a frequent basis (defined as attending a religious service once a week or more) were 36% less likely to die during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strawbridge WJ, Cohen RD, Shema SJ, Kaplan GA |title=Frequent attendance at religious services and mortality over 28 years |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=957–61 |date=June 1997  |pmid=9224176 |pmc=1380930 |doi=10.2105/ajph.87.6.957}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can be partly be attributed to a better lifestyle since religious people tend to drink and smoke less and eat a healthier diet.

===Mental health===
Evidence suggests that religiosity can be a pathway to both mental health and mental disorder. For example, [[religiosity]] is positively associated with mental disorders that involve an excessive amount of self-control and negatively associated with mental disorders that involve a lack of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Depression====
Studies have shown a negative relationship between spiritual well-being and depressive symptoms. In one study, those who were assessed to have a higher spiritual [[quality of life]] on a spiritual well-being scale had less [[Depression symptoms|depressive symptoms]].&lt;ref&gt;Fehring, R.J., Miller, J.F., Shaw, C. (1997). Spiritual well-being, religiosity, hope, depression, and other mood states in elderly people coping with cancer 24. Oncology Nursing Forum. pp. 663–671.&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer and AIDS patients who were more spiritual had lower depressive symptoms than religious patients. Spirituality shows beneficial effects possibly because it speaks to one’s ability to intrinsically find meaning in life, strength, and inner peace, which is especially important for very ill patients.&lt;ref name="Nelson, C.J. 2002 pp. 213"/&gt;

Exline et al. 1999  showed that the difficulty in forgiving God and alienation from God were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Among those who currently believed in God, forgiving God for a specific, unfortunate incident predicted lower levels of anxious and depressed mood.

====Schizophrenia and Psychosis====
Studies have reported beneficial effects of spirituality on the lives of patients with schizophrenia, [[major depression]], and other psychotic disorders. Schizophrenic patients were less likely to be re-hospitalized if families encouraged [[religious]] practice, and in depressed patients who underwent religiously based interventions, their symptoms improved faster than those who underwent [[secular]] interventions. Furthermore, a few cross-sectional studies have shown that more religiously involved people had less instance of [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Koenig, H. G. (2008) Research on religion, spirituality, and mental health: A review. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Life satisfaction====
Research shows that religiosity moderates the relationship between “thinking about meaning of life” and life satisfaction. For individuals scoring low and moderately on religiosity, thinking about the meaning of life is negatively correlated with life satisfaction. For people scoring highly on religiosity, however, this relationship is positive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Religiosity has also been found to moderate the relationship between negative affect and life satisfaction, such that life satisfaction is less strongly influenced by the frequency of negative emotions in more religious (vs less religious) individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joshanloo|first=Mohsen|date=2016-04-01|title=Religiosity moderates the relationship between negative affect and life satisfaction: A study in 29 European countries|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656616300010|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=61|pages=11–14|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2016.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coping with trauma====
{{Main|Religion and coping with trauma}}

One of the most common ways that people cope with trauma is through the comfort found in religious or spiritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists of religion have performed multiple studies to measure the positive and negative effects of this coping style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trevino | first1 = K. M. | last2 = Pargament | first2 = K. I. | year = 2007 | title = Religious coping with terrorism and natural disaster | url = | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 100 | issue = 9| pages = 946–947 | doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3181454660| pmid = 17902314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading researchers have split religious coping into two categories: positive religious coping and negative religious coping. Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.

The effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social health===
{{expand section|date=December 2017}}

===Spiritual health===
'''Spiritual Health''' is one of four dimensions to well-being as defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which include physical, social, and mental.

The preamble to Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO)  adopted by the International Health Conference held in New York from 19 June to 22 July 1946 and signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2002, 80 (12)&lt;/ref&gt; defined health as a state of "physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"&lt;ref&gt;Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, 19–22 June 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has not been amended.

However, in 1983 twenty-two WHO member countries from the Eastern Mediterranean Region proposed a draft resolution to this preamble to include reference to spiritual health, such that it would redefine health as a state of "physical, mental, spiritual and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity".&lt;ref&gt;Review of the Constitution of the World Health Organization: Report of the Executive Board Special Group. 101st Session. Agenda Item 7.3. 22 January 1998. Geneva: World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst WHO did not amend the preamble to its constitution, resolution WHA31.13 passed by the Thirty-seventh World Health Assembly, in 1984&lt;ref&gt;Thirty-seventh World Health Assembly, Resolution WHA37.13. Geneva: World Health Organization; 1984. WHO document WHA37/1984/REC/1:6.&lt;/ref&gt; called upon Member States to consider including in their [[Health For All]] strategies a spiritual dimension as defined in that resolution in accordance with their own social and cultural patterns
&lt;ref&gt;The fourth ten years of the World Health Organization: 1978–1987. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; recognizing  that "the  spiritual dimension  plays  a great  role in motivating people's achievements in all aspects of life".&lt;ref&gt;Draft Regional Health-for-all Policy and Strategy for the Twenty-First Century. World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean. Forty-fifth Session, Agenda item 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete description of the spiritual dimension as articulated by the Health Assembly is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The spiritual dimension is understood to imply a phenomenon that is not material in nature, but belongs to the realm of ideas, beliefs, values and ethics that have arisen in  the minds and conscience of human beings, particularly ennobling ideas. Ennobling ideas have given rise to health ideals, which have led to a practical strategy for Health for All that aims at attaining a goal that has both a material and non-material component. If the material component of the strategy can be provided to people, the non-material or spiritual one is something that has to arise within people and communities in keeping with their social and cultural patterns. The spiritual dimension plays a great role in motivating people’s achievement in all aspects of life.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization Publication: Year 1991. Issue 9290211407. Chapter 4: The Spiritual Dimension.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the inclusion of spiritual health within WHO's purview, a number of other significant organizations have also attended to spirituality and incorporated reference to it in key documents, including the [[United Nations]] action plan [[Agenda 21]]&lt;ref&gt;Sitarz, Dan. "Agenda 21: The earth summit strategy to save our planet." (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; which recognizes the right of individuals to "healthy physical, mental, and spiritual development".&lt;ref&gt;Agenda 21. Chapter 6.23. United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Rio de Janeiro, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41805">'''Asia''' is the largest and most populous continent, with a wide variety of '''religions''', and was the birthplace of many religions such as &lt;!-- Alphabetical order --&gt;[[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]],  [[Confucianism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Shintoism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]]. All major religious traditions are practiced in the region and new forms are constantly emerging. Asia is noted for its diversity of culture.

==Dharmic religions==
{{Main article|Indian religions}}
Dharmic religions are the predominant and oldest religions of Asia. Most of Asia's population follows Indian religions. All Indian religions originated in [[South Asia]]. These religions all have the concepts of [[dharma]], [[karma]], and [[reincarnation]].

===Hinduism ===

[[Hinduism]] is the second largest and the oldest religion in [[Asia]] with more than 1 billion followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-hindu/ |title=THE GLOBAL RELIGIOUS LANDSCAPE: Hindus |accessdate=2012-12-18 |work=pewforum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographically, it is the largest religion in [[Hinduism in India|India]] (80%), [[Hinduism in Nepal|Nepal]] (81%), and the island of [[Balinese Hinduism|Bali]] (83.5%),&lt;ref name=census2010&gt;[http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&amp;wid=0 Penduduk Menurut Wilayah dan Agama yang Dianut] (2010 Census). bps.go.id&lt;/ref&gt; with strong minorities in the Asian nations of [[Hinduism in Bhutan|Bhutan]], [[Hinduism in Fiji|Fiji]], [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Hinduism in Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Hinduism in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Hinduism in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Hinduism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], [[Hinduism in Arab states#United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], [[Hinduism in Arab states#Oman|Oman]], [[Yemen]], [[Russia]], [[Hinduism in Arab states#Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Hinduism in Arab states#Qatar|Qatar]], [[Mayanmar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Afghanistan]]. Hinduism is subdivided into a number of major currents, the primary ones being Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Smartism and Shaktism. The vast majority of present-day Hindus can be categorized under one of these four groups, although there are many other, partly overlapping, allegiances and denominations.

Hinduism predates recorded history and is thought to have had a beginning during the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] itself. It has no single founder; rather, it is a diverse melange of traditions, practices, and lineages. [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]] emerged in ancient India from Hinduism.

===Jainism===
{{Main article|Jainism}}
Jainism is an [[Indian religions|Indian religion]]. Jains are mostly found in [[India]] but are increasingly found throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Estimates for the population of Jains differ from just over four million to twelve million due to difficulties of Jain identity, with Jains in some areas counted as a Hindu sect. Many Jains do not return Jainism as their religion on census forms for various reasons such as certain Jain castes considering themselves both Hindu and Jain. The 1981 Census of India returned 3.19 million Jains. This was estimated at the time to be at least half the true number. There are an estimated 25,000-30,000 Jains in Europe (mostly in Britain), 20,000 in Africa, 45,000 plus in North America (from {{cite book |title=The Jains |last=Dundas |first=Paul |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=9780415266062 |page=271; 354 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5ialKAbIyV4C&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=jains+britain#v=onepage&amp;q=jains%20britain&amp;f=false }}) and 5,000 in the rest of Asia.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains have significantly influenced and contributed to [[ethics|ethical]], [[politics|political]] and economic spheres in India. Jains have an ancient tradition of scholarship and have the highest degree of literacy for a religious community in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page1.asp?relid=3724 |title=Press Information Bureau, Government of India |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date=2004-09-06 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net |title=Census of India 2001 |publisher=Censusindia.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain libraries are the oldest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;The Jain Knowledge Warehouses: Traditional Libraries in India, John E.

The religion professes its roots in the area of [[Punjab region|Punjab]], whose territories form part of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].

This system of religious philosophy and expression has been traditionally known as the Gurmat (literally the counsel of the gurus) or the Sikh Dharm. Sikhism originated from the word Sikh, which in turn comes from the Sanskrit root śhiṣhya meaning "disciple" or "learner", or śhikṣha meaning "instruction".

Sikhism is the 4th largest religion in India with 2% of the total population being Sikh. There is also a large concentration of Sikhs in [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], [[the Philippines]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Hongkong]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kuwait]] and [[United Arab Emirates|U.A.E]].

==East Asian religions==
{{Main article|East Asian religions}}
East Asian religions (also known as [[Far Eastern religions]], [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]], or [[Taoic religions]]) form a subset of the [[Eastern religions]].

===Confucianism ===
{{Main article|Confucianism}}
Confucianism was founded in ancient [[China]] by [[Confucius]] (551 B.C.E. - 479). Confucianism is a complex of [[morality|moral]], [[social philosophy|social]], [[politics|political]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical]], and [[religion|religious]] concerns that permeated the culture and history of [[East Asia]]. Confucianism emphasizes family, social hierarchy, and personal integrity and is manifested in practices and attitudes rather than institutions and is centered on the family and local society. It was, however, considered the [[state religion]] of East Asian countries in some periods. Today the [[Chinese diaspora|Chinese]], [[Korean diaspora|Korean]], [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]] and [[Vietnamese diaspora|Vietnamese]] diasporas have brought Confucianism to all parts of the world.

===Taoism===
{{Main article|Taoism}}
Taoism (also [[romanized]] Daoism) is a diverse philosophical and religious tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the [[Tao]] ([[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanized "Dao"]]), a term that means "way", "path" or "principle". The concept is shared with other Chinese philosophies and religions. In Taoism, however, ''Tao'' denotes both the source and the driving force inherent in everything that exists. It is ultimately [[Ineffability|ineffable]]: "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/gateway/passages/tao-te-ching.htm|title=Tao Te Ching, 1. chapter, translated by Livia Kohn (1993)|author=Laozi|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laozi]] is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism and is closely associated with "original", or "primordial", Taoism.&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 63"&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether he actually existed is commonly disputed;&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 25"&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2004, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; however, the work attributed to him – the [[Daodejing]] – is dated to the late 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2004, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoist propriety and ethics vary according to the particular school, but in general tends to emphasize [[wu-wei]] (action through non-action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]: compassion, moderation, and humility.

Significant Taoist communities can be found in China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam and in the [[Chinese diaspora|Chinese]], [[Korean diaspora|Korean]], [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]] and [[Vietnamese diaspora|Vietnamese]] diasporas.

===Chinese folk religion===
{{Main article|Chinese folk religion}}
[[Chinese folk religion]] is a label used to describe the ethnic religious traditions which have been a main belief system in China and among the Han Chinese ethnic group for most of the civilization's history. This group of diverse beliefs comprises [[Chinese mythology]] and includes the worship of various [[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]] (神, shén; "deities", "spirits", "awarenesses", "consciousnesses", "archetypes") which can be nature deities, Taizu or clan deities, city deities, national deities, cultural heroes and demigods, dragons and ancestors. Chinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with Taoism, since over the world institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administer local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a component of Chinese religion, since it sprang out of folk religion and [[Chinese philosophy]]. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous. With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population, Chinese folk religion is one of the major religious traditions in the world. In China more than 30% of the population adheres to folk religions or Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ChartsBin |url=http://chartsbin.com/view/sgx |title=Chinese Folk Religion Adherents by Country |publisher=Chartsbin.com |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shinto===
{{Main article|Shintoism}}
[[Kami-no-michi]] is almost unique to [[Japan]] and the [[Japanese diaspora]]. It is a set of practices carried out to establish a connection between present-day Japan and its ancient past. Shinto practices were first recorded and codified in the written records of the [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]] in the 7th and 8th century. Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified "Shinto religion", but rather to disorganized [[folklore]], [[History of Japan|history]], and [[mythology]]. Shinto today applies to public [[shrine]]s suited to various purposes such as [[Yasukuni|war memorial]]s, [[harvest festival]]s, romance, and historical monuments, as well as various sectarian organizations.

[[Shinto]] is the largest religion in Japan, practiced by nearly 80% of the population, yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as "Shintoists" in surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/honcho/index.html |title=Association of Shinto Shrines &amp;#124; 設立 |publisher=Jinja Honcho |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to surveys carried out in 2006 and 2008 show that 3% to 3.9% of the population of Japan are members of [[Shinto sects and schools#Shintō inspired religions|Shinto sects and derived religions]].&lt;ref name="NHK2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/bunken/summary/research/report/2009_05/090505.pdf |title=2008 NHK survey of religion in Japan — 宗教的なもの にひかれる日本人〜ISSP国際比較調査（宗教）から〜|publisher=NHK Culture Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the ''mudang'', usually a woman, is to act as intermediary between a spirit entity, spirits or [[gods]] and human beings.

Women are enlisted by those who want the help of the [[Spirit|spirit world]]. Shamans hold ''[[gut (ritual)|gut]]'', or services, in order to gain good fortune for clients, cure illnesses by exorcising negative or 'bad' [[spirits]] that cling to people, or propitiate local or village gods. Such services are also held to guide the spirit of a deceased person to higher realms. Today this religion is a minority, but has in recent years seen a resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/06/world/asia/06iht-shaman.1.6527738.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{See also|Zoroastrianism in India|Zoroastrians in Iran}}
[[Zoroastrianism]] was once the state religion of the [[Persian Empire]], but is now a minority mostly found in [[India]] and [[Iran]]. It worships a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] god, [[Ahura Mazda]], and was founded by [[Zoroaster]]. Zoroastrianism is a religion and philosophy based on the teachings of prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra, in Avestan), probably founded some time before the 6th century BC. The term Zoroastrianism is, in general usage, essentially synonymous with Mazdaism, i.e., the worship of Ahura Mazda, exalted by Zoroaster as the supreme divine authority.

In Zoroastrianism, the Creator Ahura Mazda is all good, and no evil originates from Him. Thus, in Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources, with evil (druj) trying to destroy the creation of Mazda (asha), and good trying to sustain it. Mazda is not immanent in the world, and His creation is represented by the Amesha Spentas and the host of other Yazatas, through whom the works of God are evident to humanity, and through whom worship of Mazda is ultimately directed. The most important texts of the religion are those of the Avesta, of which a significant portion has been lost, and mostly only the liturgies of which have survived. The lost portions are known of only through references and brief quotations in the later works of (primarily) the 9th-11th centuries.

The total number of currently practicing adherents of [[Zoroastrianism]] is unknown. A 2004 estimate gives a range of 124,000 to 190,000,&lt;ref&gt;
According to a survey in 2004 by the Zoroastrian Associations of North America, the number of Zoroastrians worldwide was estimated at between 124,000 and 190,000. The number is imprecise because of wildly diverging counts in Iran.{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/us/06faith.html|title=Zoroastrians Keep the Faith, and Keep Dwindling|publisher=The New York Times|date=2008-09-06|accessdate=2009-10-03 | first=Laurie | last=Goodstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly half of them in [[India]] (the [[Parsi]] and [[Irani (India)|Irani]] groups).

The largest number of Zoroastrians in Asia can be found in [[India]]; according to the 2001 census, they amounted 69,000.&lt;ref&gt;India's 2001 Census reported 69,601 Parsi Zoroastrians.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Iran]], there were some 25,000 according to the 2011 census.&lt;ref&gt;25,271 according to http://www.amar.org.ir/Portals/1/Iran/census-2.pdf {{year needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the numbers for Zoroastrians were; India (61,000), Iran (15,000 / 22,271), [[United States]] (14,405), [[Canada]] (6,442), [[Great Britain]] (5,500), [[Australia]] (2,577), [[Arab states of the Arabian Gulf|Persian Gulf Countries]] (1,900) [[Pakistan]] (1,675), [[Singapore]] (372).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fezana.org/downloads/ZoroastrianWorldPopTable_FEZANA_Journal_Fall_2013.pdf Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has been established in all Asian countries except for Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia and North Korea. Ahmadis are most [[Persecution of Ahmadiyya|persecuted]] in Asia, particularly in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia.

===Bahá'í Faith===
[[File:Bahá'í House of Worship, Battambang.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Bahá'í Temple ([[Battambang]], [[Cambodia]])]]
{{Main article|Bahá'í Faith in Asia}}
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is an Abrahamic religion although it is quite different from [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]]. It was so founded by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in what was then Persia (also known as Iran). Today the largest national population of Bahá'ís is in [[Bahá'í Faith in India|India]] with between 1.7 million&lt;ref&gt;Source: Year 2000 Estimated Baha'i statistics from: David Barrett, World Christian Encyclopedia, 2000; Total population statistics, mid-2000 from Population Reference Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; to 3.2 million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahaindia.org/ National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of India]&lt;/ref&gt; where there is also the [[Lotus Temple]]. Significant populations are found in many countries including [[Bahá'í Faith in Vietnam|Vietnam]] and [[Religion in Malaysia|Malaysia]] where "about 1%", some 260,000, of the population are Bahá'ís.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai.org.my/main/content/view/42/46/ National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706164701/http://bahai.org.my/main/content/view/42/46/ |date=2007-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, like [[Bahá'í Faith in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] there are 25 Local Spiritual Assemblies.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web | author = Government of Kazakhstan | title = Religious Groups in Kazakhstan | work = 2001 Census | publisher = Embassy of Kazakhstan to the USA &amp; Canada | year = 2001 | url = http://www.kazakhembus.com/files/Religious_Groups_in_Kazakhstan.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern-day Iran, the religion is severely persecuted (see [[Persecution of Bahá'ís]]). In neighboring [[Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan]], Bahá'í Faith is effectively banned,&lt;ref name="turk"&gt;{{cite web | last = compiled by Wagner | first = Ralph D. | title = Turkmenistan | work = Synopsis of References to the Bahá'í Faith, in the US State Department's Reports on Human Rights 1991–2000 | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | url = http://bahai-library.com/documents/hr/hr-turkmenistan.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals have had their homes raided for [[Bahá'í literature]].&lt;ref name="raided"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Corley | first = Felix | author-link = Felix Corley | title = TURKMENISTAN: Religious communities theoretically permitted, but attacked in practice? | newspaper = F18News | date = 2004-04-01 | url = http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=293 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; For further information, see [[Bahá'í statistics#Asia|Bahá'í Statistics for Asia]] and [[:Category:Bahá'í Faith by country]].

==Irreligion ==
According to a [[Pew Research Center]] survey in 2012 [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]] (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 21.2% of Asia population.&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx Religiously Unaffiliated]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same survey, the religiously unaffiliated are the majority of the population in four Asian countries/territories: [[North Korea]] (71%), [[Japan]] (57%), [[Hong Kong]] (56%), and [[Mainland China]] (52%).&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"/&gt;

Other sources say that in the [[People's Republic of China]], 59% of the population claim to be [[Irreligion|non-religious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China – People |work=World Desk Reference |url=http://dev.prenhall.com/divisions/hss/worldreference/CN/people.html |accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this percentage may be significantly greater (up to 80%) or smaller (down to 30%) in reality, because some Chinese define religion differently. Some Chinese define religion as practicing customs (which may be done for cultural or traditional reasons), while others define it as actually consciously believing their religion will lead to post-mortem salvation or reincarnation. A Dentsu statistic states that 46% of Vietnamese and 51% of Japanese are irreligious.&lt;ref name="dentsu"&gt;[http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/~honkawa/9460.html Dentsu Communication Institute Inc., Research Centre for Japan (2006)]{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Venezuela]], like most [[South American]] nations, [[Christianity]] is the largest religion, with a predominantly [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] population. 

The influence of the [[Catholic Church]] was introduced in its [[Colonial Venezuela|colonization by Spain]]. According to a 2011 poll (GIS XXI), 88 percent of the population is Christian, primarily [[Roman Catholic]] (71%), and the remaining 17 percent [[Protestant]], primarily [[Evangelicals]] (in Latin America Protestants are usually called Evangelicos). The [[Venezuelans]] without religion are 8% ([[atheist]] 2% and [[agnostic]] or indifferent 6%), almost 3% of the population follow other religion (1% of them are of [[santeria]]).&lt;ref name="grumilla"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aguire|first1=Jesus Maria|language=Spanish|title=Informe Sociográfico sobre la religión en Venezuela|url=http://www.gumilla.org/biblioteca/bases/biblo/texto/SIC2012745_211-222.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2015|publisher=El Centro Gumilla|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are small but influential [[Islam|Muslim]], [[Buddhist]], and [[History of the Jews in Venezuela|Jewish]] communities. The Muslim community of  about 95,000 is concentrated among persons of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Syrian people|Syrian]] descent living in [[Nueva Esparta]] State, [[Punto Fijo]] and the [[Caracas]] area; Venezuela also has a significant [[Druze]] community from the same countries (the [[Tareck El Aissami|current]] [[Vice President of Venezuela|vice president]] is Druze, showing the small group's influence). Buddhism in Venezuela is practiced by over 52,000 people. The Buddhist community is made up mainly of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], and [[Koreans]]. There are Buddhist centers in Caracas, Maracay, Mérida, Puerto Ordáz, San Felipe, and Valencia.
The Jewish community numbers approximately 13,000 and is mainly concentrated in Caracas.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] (Mormons) claims 165,527 members (April 2016) mostly in and around [[Caracas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/venezuela/ | title = LDS Starics | publisher = Mormon Newsroom|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela is also notable for its significant [[Syncretic#Religious syncretism|syncretic]] religious traditions, most notably those revolving around the figures of [[Maria Lionza]] and [[Jose Gregorio Hernandez]].

In Venezuela, a population of [[Santeria]] followers has been growing since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23057224/ns/world_news-venezuela/t/venezuelans-increasingly-turn-santeria/#.UK8K9oaFC_M |title=Santeria surges in Venezuela - World news - Venezuela &amp;#124; NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rituals can cost 40,000 bolivars and include the slaughtering of a rooster, a chicken, or a goat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimasnoticias.com.ve/noticias/actualidad/economia/hasta-40-mil-bolivares-cuesta-hacerse-el-santo.aspx |title=Hasta 40 mil bolívares cuesta hacerse "El Santo" - Actualidad &amp;#124; Últimas Noticias |publisher=Ultimasnoticias.com.ve |date=2012-08-28 |accessdate=2013-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116234925/http://www.ultimasnoticias.com.ve/noticias/actualidad/economia/hasta-40-mil-bolivares-cuesta-hacerse-el-santo.aspx |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1885">The '''Religious Experience Research Centre''' was founded by the distinguished marine biologist Professor [[Alister Hardy]] FRS in 1969 as The Religious Experience Research Unit. He and his co-researchers began to gather a unique archive of accounts of [[religious experience]] and to publish research into the area. The maintenance of both the archives and the research and publications have continued. The Centre organises conferences and produces both books and a series of Occasional Papers on religious experience and spirituality.

Sir Alister was awarded the ''[[Templeton Prize]] for Progress In Religion'' in 1985 and the Centre has since received a grant from the Templeton Foundation for the computerisation of the archives. The Centre was located at [[Manchester College, Oxford]] from 1969-1989 and from 1989–1999 at [[Westminster College, Oxford]]. In 2000 the Centre moved to the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]]
(presently University of Wales, Trinity Saint David). 

The directors of the Centre are currently Greg Barker, Bettina Schmidt and Sally Wilkinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/lrc/librariesandcentres/alisterhardyreligiousexperienceresearchcentre/contacts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328113909/http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/lrc/librariesandcentres/alisterhardyreligiousexperienceresearchcentre/contacts/ |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's conception of the physical world provided a stable model of the natural world that would reinforce stability and harmony in the civic world. &lt;!--The [[law of gravity]] became Newton's best-known discovery, but--&gt; Newton saw a [[monotheistic God]] as the masterful creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation.&lt;ref name="Principia, Book III 1953"&gt;Principia, Book III; cited in; Newton's Philosophy of Nature: Selections from his writings, p. 42, ed.

Newton was born into an Anglican family three months after the death of his father, a prosperous farmer also named Isaac Newton. When Newton was three, his mother married the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|rector]] of the neighbouring parish of [[North Witham]] and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Newton's religious views developed as a result of participation in an investigative discourse with Nature (the nature of the world), and developed from the apparent [[dichotomy]] between biblical reality and the increasing revelation of the structure of reality from investigation. Newton saw these truths of nature as challenging established religion, particularly as embodied in Christian scriptural belief.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Goldish 1998 -  ''Judaism in the theology of Sir Isaac Newton'' - 239 pages ''Volume 157 of Archives internationales d'histoire des idées'' [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nRKUNkeFFJMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Isaac+Newton+and+christianity&amp;ots=iC9NabEGs9&amp;sig=xNOLJpmKoGAZwpSn5G_JrtzrTcI#v=onepage&amp;q=Isaac%20Newton%20and%20christianity&amp;f=false Springer, 1998] Retrieved 28 January 2012 {{ISBN|0-7923-4996-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christianity Today International - [http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/1991/issue30/3038.html archives ] Retrieved 28 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Unorthodoxy was made necessary for Newton, and those affiliated with him, by the need for rediscovery of a  ''[[Wikt:prisco|prisca]]'' truth that had been hidden somewhere in the time of classical history.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Boyd Haycock]] 2004 - 'The long lost truth' Sir Isaac Newton and the Newtonian pursuit of long lost knowledge [http://www.cefetrn.br/~zanoni/Arquivos_licenciatura/historia_da_ciencia/The_long_lost_truth.pdf Elsevier 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324062304/http://www.cefetrn.br/~zanoni/Arquivos_licenciatura/historia_da_ciencia/The_long_lost_truth.pdf |date=24 March 2012 }} Retrieved 29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By this they might have the capacity to engage in open dialogue with an investigation into Nature.

As is found among some of the established intellectuals of the [[Renaissance]] age, Newton believed that ancient philosophers and religious persons had gained insight into the truth of the nature of the world and universe, but this truth having become hidden within the language of the recording of the truth at the time and by later medieval scholars ([[Albertus Magnus]], [[Arnold of Villanova]] and [[Roger Bacon]]) that required deciphering in order to be understood. The belief in the wisdom of the ancients, that thinking was intelligent and knowing in the civilization of classical religious figures (Jesus of Nazareth, the prophet Isaiah and [[Solomon]]) and writers (Plato and Democritus) is known as ''prisca sapientia''.&lt;ref name=" Christianson  "/&gt;

Like many contemporaries (e.g., [[Thomas Aikenhead]]) he lived with the threat of severe punishment if he had been open about his religious beliefs. Heresy was a crime that could have been punishable by the loss of all property and status or even death (see, e.g., the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]]). Because of his secrecy over his religious beliefs, Newton has been described as a [[Nicodemite]].&lt;ref name="heretic"/&gt;

==God as masterful creator==
Newton saw God as the masterful creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, R.K. ed. Knud Haakonssen. "The emergence of Rational Dissent." Enlightenment and Religion: Rational Dissent in eighteenth-century Britain. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1996. p19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, he rejected [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]' thesis that God would necessarily make a perfect world which requires no intervention from the creator. In Query 31 of the ''Opticks'', Newton simultaneously made an argument from design and for the necessity of intervention:
{{quote| For while comets move in very eccentric orbs in all manner of positions, blind fate could never make all the planets move one and the same way in orbs concentric, some inconsiderable irregularities excepted which may have arisen from the mutual actions of comets and planets on one another, and which will be apt to increase, till this system wants a reformation.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, 1706 ''Opticks'' (2nd Edition), quoted in H. G. Alexander 1956 (ed): ''The Leibniz-Clarke correspondence'', University of Manchester Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This passage prompted an attack by Leibniz in a letter to his friend [[Caroline of Ansbach]]:
{{quote|Sir Isaac Newton and his followers have also a very odd opinion concerning the work of God. According to their doctrine, God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, first letter, in Alexander 1956, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Leibniz' letter initiated the [[Leibniz-Clarke correspondence]], ostensibly with Newton's friend and disciple [[Samuel Clarke]], although as Caroline wrote, Clarke's letters "are not written without the advice of the Chev. Newton".&lt;ref&gt;Caroline to Leibniz, 10 January 1716, quoted in Alexander 1956, p. 193. (Chev. = Chevalier i.e. Knight.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Clarke complained that Leibniz' concept of God as a "supra-mundane intelligence" who set up a "pre-established harmony" was only a step from atheism: "And as those men, who pretend that in an earthly government things may go on perfectly well without the king himself ordering or disposing of any thing, may reasonably be suspected that they would like very well to set the king aside: so, whosoever contends, that the beings of the world can go on without the continual direction of God...his doctrine does in effect tend to exclude God out of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, first reply, in Alexander 1956 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to stepping in to re-form the solar system, Newton invoked God's active intervention to prevent the stars falling in on each other, and perhaps in preventing the amount of motion in the universe from decaying due to viscosity and friction.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Alexander 1956, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; In private correspondence Newton sometimes hinted that the force of Gravity was due to an immaterial influence:
{{quote|Tis inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should (without the mediation of something else which is not material) operate upon &amp; affect other matter without mutual contact.&lt;ref&gt;Newton to Bentley, 25 Feb 1693&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Leibniz jibed that such an immaterial influence would be a continual miracle; this was another strand of his debate with Clarke.

Newton's view has been considered to be close to [[deism]] and several biographers and scholars labeled him as a deist who is strongly influenced by Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essays on the Context, Nature, and Influence of Isaac Newton's Theology|year=1990|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780792305835|first=James E.|last= Force|first2= Richard Henry |last2=Popkin|editor-first=James E. |editor-last=Force|editor2-first= Richard Henry |editor2-last=Popkin|page=53|quote=Newton has often been identified as a deist. ...In the 19th century, William Blake seems to have put Newton into the deistic camp.

Cragg views Newton as a kind of proto-deist and, as evidence, points to Newton's belief in a true, original, monotheistic religion first discovered in ancient times by natural reason. This position, in Cragg's view, leads to the elimination of the Christian revelation as neither necessary nor sufficient for human knowledge of God. This agenda is indeed the key point, as Leland describes above, of the deistic program which seeks to "set aside" revelatory religious texts. Cragg writes that, "In effect, Newton ignored the claims of revelation and pointed in a direction which many eighteenth-century thinkers would willingly follow." John Redwood has also recently linked anti-Trinitarian theology with both "Newtonianism" and "deism."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Innermost Kernel: Depth Psychology and Quantum Physics.

On the other hand, [[latitudinarian]] and Newtonian ideas taken too far resulted in the millenarians, a religious faction dedicated to the concept of a mechanical universe, but finding in it the same enthusiasm and mysticism that the Enlightenment had fought so hard to extinguish.&lt;ref name="jacob"&gt;Jacob, Margaret C.

==The Bible==

Newton spent a great deal of time trying to discover [[Bible code|hidden messages within the Bible]].  After 1690, Newton wrote a number of [[religious tracts]] dealing with the literal interpretation of the [[Bible]]. In a manuscript Newton wrote in 1704 he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible. He estimated that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this he said "This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail."&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{cite news |title=Papers Show Isaac Newton's Religious Side, Predict Date of Apocalypse |agency=Associated Press |date=19 June 2007 |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28049_Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton%27s_Religious_Side%2C_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070629231937/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28049_Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton's_Religious_Side,_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse.htm |archivedate=29 June 2007 |accessdate=2018-05-17 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prophecy===
Newton relied upon the existing Scripture for prophecy, believing his interpretations would set the record straight in the face of what he considered to be, "so little understood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Newton  | first = Isaac  | title = The First Book Concerning the Language of the Prophets  | publisher = The Newton Project  | date = 5 April 2007  | url = http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&amp;mode=normalized  | accessdate = 15 August 2007  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108210637/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&amp;mode=normalized  | archivedate = 8 November 2007  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he would never write a cohesive body of work on Prophecy, Newton's beliefs would lead him to write several treatises on the subject, including an unpublished guide for prophetic interpretation entitled ''Rules for interpreting the words &amp; language in Scripture''. In this manuscript he details the necessary requirements for what he considered to be the proper interpretation of the Bible.

===End of The World vs Start of The Millennial Kingdom===

In his posthumously-published ''Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John'', Newton expressed his belief that Bible prophecy would not be understood "until the time of the end", and that even then "none of the wicked shall understand". Referring to that as a future time ("the last age, the age of opening these things, be now approaching"), Newton also anticipated "the general preaching of the Gospel be approaching" and "the Gospel must first be preached in all nations before the great tribulation, and end of the world".&lt;ref&gt;''Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John'' by Sir Isaac Newton, 1733, J. DARBY and T. BROWNE, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16878/16878-h/16878-h.htm#NtpJohI_41 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, a large amount of media attention and public interest has circulated regarding largely unknown and unpublished documents, evidently written by Isaac Newton, that indicate he believed the world could end in 2060. While Newton also had many other possible dates (e.g. 2034),&lt;ref name=Snobelen&gt;{{cite web

Like most Protestant theologians of his time, Newton believed that the Papal Office, (and not any one particular Pope) was the fulfillment of the Biblical predictions about [[Antichrist]], whose rule was predicted to last for 1,260 years. They applied the [[day-year principle]] (in which a day represents a year in prophecy) to certain key verses in the books of Daniel&lt;ref&gt; the "time, times and half a time" of Daniel 7:25 and 12:7 &lt;/ref&gt; and Revelation&lt;ref&gt; the "42 months" of Revelation 11:2 and 13:5 equals the "1260 days" of Revelation 11:3 and 12:6 &lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the Apocalypse), and looked for significant dates in the Papacy's rise to power to begin this timeline. Newton's calculation ending in 2060 is based on the 1,260-year timeline commencing in 800 AD when [[Charlemagne]] became the first Holy Roman Emperor and reconfirmed the earlier (756 AD) [[Donation of Pepin]] to the Papacy.&lt;ref name="paper"/&gt;

=== 2016 vs 2060 ===

However, between the time he wrote his 2060 prediction (about 1704) until his death in 1727 Newton conversed, both first hand and by correspondence, with other famous theologians of his time. Those contemporaries who knew him during the remaining 23 years of his life appear to be in agreement that Newton, and the "best interpreters" including [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)| Jonathan Edwards]], [[Robert Fleming the younger | Robert Fleming]], [[Moses Lowman]], [[Phillip Doddridge]], and Bishop [[Thomas Newton]], were eventually "pretty well agreed" that the 1,260-year timeline should be calculated from the year 756 AD.&lt;ref&gt; Jonathan Edwards ”History of Redemption” New York: T. and J. Swords (1793) page 431: "The Beginning of the reign of Antichrist.] The best interpreters (as Mr. Fleming, Sir I. Newton, Mr. Lowman, Dr. Doddridge, Bp. Newton, and Mr. Reader) are pretty well agreed that this reign is to be dated from about A. D. 756, when the Pope began to be a temporal power, (that is, in prophetic language, a beast) by assuming temporal dominion; 1260 years from this period will bring us to about A. D. 2000, and about the 6000th year of the world, which agrees with a tradition at least as ancient as the epistle ascribed to the apostle Barnabas (f 15.] which says, that " in six thousand years shall all things be accomplished." &lt;/ref&gt;

F.A. Cox also confirmed that this was the view of Newton and others, including himself:

{{bquote | ''“The author adopts the hypothesis of Fleming, Sir Isaac Newton, and Lowman, that the 1260 years commenced in A.d. 756; and consequently that the millennium will not begin till the year 2016.”''&lt;ref&gt; Rev. F.A. Cox “Outlines of Lectures on the Book of Daniel” London: Westley and Davis (1833) 2nd Edition Page 152 &lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Thomas Williams (1755–1839)|Thomas Williams]] stated that this timeline had become the predominant view among the leading Protestant theologians of his time:

{{bquote | ''“Mr. Lowman, though an earlier commentator, is (we believe) far more generally followed ; and he commences the 1260 days from about 756, when, by aid of Pepin, King of France, the Pope obtained considerable temporalities. This carries on the reign of Popery to 2016, or sixteen years into the commencement of the Millennium, as it is generally reckoned.”''&lt;ref&gt; Thomas Williams “The Cottage Bible and family expositor” Hartford: D.F.

In April of 756 AD, [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]], King of France, accompanied by [[Pope Stephen II]] entered northern Italy, forcing the Lombard King [[Aistulf]] to lift his siege of Rome, and return to [[Pavia]]. Following Aistulf's capitulation, Pepin gave the newly conquered territories to the Papacy by means of the [[Donation of Pepin]], thereby elevating the Pope from being a subject of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to [[head of state]], with [[temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] over the newly constituted [[Papal States]]. 

The end of the timeline is based on Daniel 8:25 which reads ''"...but he shall be broken without hand"'' and is understood to mean that the end of the Papacy with not be caused by any human action.&lt;ref&gt; Bishop Thomas Newton "DISSERTATIONS ON THE PROPHECIES" London: J.F. and C. Rivington (1789) 8th Edition Page 327: "As the stone in Nebuchadnezzar's dream was cut out of the mountain without hands, that is not by human, but by supernatural means; so the little horn shall be broken without hand, not die the common death, not fall by the hand of men, but perish by a stroke from heaven."&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanic activity is described as the means by which Rome will be overthrown.&lt;ref&gt; East Apthorp, D.D. "Discourses on Prophecy" (1786) Discourse XI,  Page 273: "Rome the seat of Antichrist will be consumed with fire, at the coming of Christ, or when the period of her apostacy is expired, in 1260 years from the rise of Antichrist." Page 275: "...present Rome, when by an eruption of fire the mountainous soil, being undermined, will fall into an abyss, and be covered with the sea* &lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text= ''"Antichrist will retain some part of his dominion over the nations till about the year 2016." "And when the 1260 years are expired, Rome itself, with all its magnificence, will be absorbed in a lake of fire, sink into the sea, and rise no more at all for ever*."&lt;ref&gt; Rev. David Simpson "A Plea for Religion and the Sacred Writings" London: W. Baynes, and Paternoster-Row. (1808) 5th Edition, pages 131 and 133.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1870 the newly formed [[Kingdom of Italy]] annexed the remaining [[Papal States]], depriving the Popes of any temporal rule for the next 59 years. Unaware that Papal rule would be restored, (albeit on a greatly diminished scale) in 1929 as head of the [[Vatican City]] state, the historicist view that the Papacy is the Antichrist, and the associated timelines delineating his rule rapidly declined in popularity as one of the defining characteristics of the Antichrist (i.e. that he would also be a political temporal power at the time of the return of Jesus) were no longer met. 

Eventually, the prediction was largely forgotten and no major Protestant denomination currently subscribes to this timeline.

Despite the dramatic nature of a prediction of the end of the world, Newton may not have been referring to the 2060 date as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the earth and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace. In Christian theology, this concept is often referred to as The [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the establishment of [[Paradise]] by The [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth.&lt;ref name=Snobelen/&gt;

[[Henry More]]'s belief in the universe and rejection of [[Cartesian dualism]] may have influenced Newton's religious ideas.  Later works—''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'' (1728) and ''Observations Upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John'' (1733)—were published after his death.&lt;ref name="Westfall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Westfall|first=Richard S.|title=Science and Religion in Seventeenth-Century England|year=1973| publisher=U of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-06190-7|origyear=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton and [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]]'s mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox clergy as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians.&lt;ref name="jacob" /&gt; The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way in which to combat the emotional and mystical superlatives of superstitious enthusiasm, as well as the threat of atheism.&lt;ref name="jacob" /&gt;

The attacks made against pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[magical thinking]], and the [[mystical]] elements of [[Christianity]], were given their foundation with Boyle's mechanical conception of the universe.  Newton gave Boyle's ideas their completion through [[mathematical proof]]s, and more importantly was very successful in popularizing them.&lt;ref name="Westfall" /&gt;  Newton refashioned the world governed by an interventionist God into a world crafted by a God that designs along rational and universal principles.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Martin. ed.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1996. p64.&lt;/ref&gt; These principles were available for all people to discover, allowed man to pursue his own aims fruitfully in this life, not the next, and to perfect himself with his own rational powers.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Charles.

==Writings==
His first writing on the subject of religion was ''Introductio. Continens Apocalypseos rationem generalem'' (''Introduction. Containing an explanation of the Apocalypse''), which has an unnumbered leaf between folios 1 and 2 with the subheading ''De prophetia prima'',&lt;ref&gt;The Newton Project, [http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/catalogue/record/THEM00046 THEM00046], retrieved 20 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; written in Latin some time prior to 1670. Written subsequently in English was ''Notes on early Church history and the moral superiority of the 'barbarians' to the Romans''. His last writing, in 1737, was entitled ''A Dissertation upon the Sacred Cubit of the Jews and the Cubits of the several Nations''.&lt;ref name="Iliffe"/&gt;

'''Saltigue''', sometimes spelt ''Saltigué'' or wrongly ''Saltigui'', are [[Serer people|Serer]] high priests and priestesses who preside over the religious ceremonies and affairs of the Serer people, such as the ''Xoy'' ceremony, the biggest event in the Serer religious calendar.  They usually come from ancient Serer paternal families.  Such a title is usually inherited by birthright.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Gravrand. La Civilisation Seereer. Pangool. Published by Les Nouvelles Edition Africaines du Senegal (1990). {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalis, Simone, "Medecine Traditionnele Religion et Divination Chez Les Seereer Siin du Senegal", L'Harmattan (1997),  pp 11–297, {{ISBN|2-7384-5196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''"Saltigi"'' is also adopted by the [[Fula people]]. They were the leaders of the Fulas in some Fula areas, belonging to the [[Denianke Dynasty]] of the [[Empire of Great Fulo]] founded by Koli Tengella Bâ in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. Th. Houtsma. E. J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam 1913–1936. BRILL. {{ISBN|90-04-08265-4}}. p 663&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that the word "''Saltigi''", used in reference to the Fulas, comes from the [[Mandinka language]], in which it means ''"master of the road"'', used in reference to their neighbors who are Fulani herders and tenders of the flock, the traditional activity of Fulani leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Mwakikagile|Mwakikagile, Godfrey]],  ''Ethnic Diversity and Integration in the [[Gambia]]:'' The Land, the People and the Culture. {{ISBN|9987-9322-2-3}}. p163&lt;/ref&gt; In Serer country, ''Saltigue'', not to be confused with ''Saltigi'', are always [[Divination|diviners]]. In [[Wolof people|Wolof]] areas, they were the assistant chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in [[Senegal]] [[Sine-Saloum]], 1847–1914'', Edinburgh University Press (1968) p 262&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of this article deals only with ''Saltigue'' or ''Saltigué''  – "diviners" (the high priests and priestesses) and termed by some scholars as "the ministers of the religious cult";&lt;ref&gt;University of Texas at Austin.

==Role of Saltigues==
The Saltigues were advisers to Serer governments, for example in the old Serer Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], [[Saloum]] and [[Baol]]. Their principal role was and still is for the prosperity of the country. In this role, they were responsible for predicting the future of kings; the weather to come (for the purposes of agriculture); any natural disaster or political catastrophe that could befall the country; etc. As such, they were frequently consulted by the Serer kings ([[Maad a Sinig]] and [[Maad Saloum]])&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Serer language]], ''Maad'' and very rarely used ''Maat'' (though correct) means "king" i.e. [[Maad a Sinig]] (King of [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]]), [[Maad Saloum]] (King of [[Saloum]]). The  [[Lamane]]s, – the ancient Serer kings and [[landed gentry]], should not be confused with the post-[[Guelowar]] Lamanes who were merely the landed gentry and provincial chiefs answerable to the king. There are two types of Lamanes in Serer chronology : Lamanes pre-Guelowar (the original Lamanes, kings and landowners) and Lamanes during and after the Guelowar period (1350–1969) (mere chiefs and landowners)&lt;/ref&gt; preferably at the beginning of the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alioune Sarr|Sarr, Alioune]], ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'', Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. p31&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a king launches a war against another kingdom, or to repel an attack from another kingdom, the king consults the great assembly of Saltigues to predict the outcome of the battle, as was the case of Saltigué and ''Diaraf'' Wassaly Sene and Saltigué Laba Diene Ngom at the [[Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune]] (18 July 1867), commonly known as the Battle of Somb, during the reign of [[Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarr, Alioune . Histoire du [[Sine-Saloum]]. Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. pp 31–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, Mahawa, ''L'information Historique: L'exemple du Siin.'' Ethiopiques n°54 revue semestrielle de culture négro-africaine. Nouvelle série volume 7 2e semestre 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, Niokhobaye, ''Chronique du Royaume du Sine'', IFAN, commenté par Charles Becker &amp; Victor Martin (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in Senegal Sine-Saloum, 1847–1914.'' [[Edinburgh University Press]] (1968), p 91&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly of Saltigues will predict the outcome, offer precautionary advice on when to launch the attack, the route to take to the battlefield and the animals to be sacrificed, etc. The role of Saltigue was not political. They are not government ministers or politicians, but spiritual advisors and elders. They are the Serer hereditary "Rain priests" – guardians of the [[Serer religion]] and customs, a birthright they inherited from their ancient [[Lamane|Lamanic]] ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Sarr, Alioune,, ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'', Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. p31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[precolonialism|precolonial]] period, during the ''Raan Festival''&lt;ref&gt;See [[Serer religion]] for Raan Festival.&lt;/ref&gt; which takes place in [[Tukar]] annually on the second Thursday after the onset of the [[new moon]] in April, the kings (during the [[Guelowar]] period&lt;ref&gt;In Serer history and chronology, the Guelowar period starts from 1350 during the reign of [[Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali Jaxateh Manneh]] – the first Guelowar king to reign in Serer country i.e. the [[Kingdom of Sine]] and ends in 1969 following the deaths of [[Maad a Sinig Mahecor Joof]] and [[Maad Saloum]] Fode N'Goye Joof, king of Sine and [[Saloum]] respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;) will attend the Raan Festival of Tukar, making their way from the capital ([[Diakhao Arrondissement|Diakhao]]). However, the king was extremely careful never to arrive before the Lamane&lt;ref&gt;These should not be confused with pre-Guelowar Lamanes, who were the kings and landowners (the [[landed gentry]] among the old the Serer noble classes).&lt;/ref&gt; and always avoid direct encounters with the Lamane of Tukar. Whilst the Lamane was busy self-meditating, touring Tukar and making offerings to the [[pangool]] Jegan Joof, the Chief Saltigue and his associates drink ''sum-sum'' alcohol all morning before the Festival. It is reported that drinking ''sum-sum'' improves the Saltigue's vision of the future and the supernatural world.

Having prepared himself sufficiently, the Saltigue and his close associates leave the house and mount their horses, then start their own tour of some of the sacred places of the country. The Saltigué's tour is programmed to follow the king, but ultimately to cross his path at a location known as 'Nenem". In this location, the king, aware that the Saltigue is coming, stops the royal entourage. The king and the royal entourage must wait for the Saltigue and his companions to pass. After these high priests and priestesses have passed, the king then gives the signal to the royal entourage to pass as they proceed to their next destination. This is the kind of respect that is afforded to the Saltigue.&lt;ref&gt;Galvan, Dennis Charles, ''The State Must Be Our Master of Fire:'' How Peasants Craft Culturally Sustainable Development in Senegal. Berkeley, University of California Press ( 2004). pp 202–204&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars like [[Alioune Sarr]] note that Saltigues are famously celebrated and respected in Serer Kingdoms because of their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Sarr, Alioune, ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'', Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. p31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serer and Lebu healing methods==
The [[Lebu people]] share many cosmo-spiritual beliefs with the [[Serer people|Serers]]. Many Lebu ''rab'' ([[jinn]]) are actually Serer ''[[pangool]]'' ([[Reincarnation#Serer religion|ancestral spirits or saints]]). The sacred dwelling place of the Lebu ''rab'' is the same as the Serer ''pangool'' called ''Sangomar'', based on the ancient Serer and [[Diola people|Diola]] legend of ''[[The legend of Jambooñ and Agaire|Jambooñ and Agaire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Many variations of spelling especially Agaire. Sometimes spelt Ageen, Ougeney, Eugene, etc. Jambooñ is sometimes spelt Jambon, Jambonge, etc. Fata Ndiaye in Ethiopiques {{fr}} [http://ethiopiques.refer.sn/spip.php?article1245 Le SIIN avant les Gelwaar]&lt;/ref&gt; – two young sisters whose boat split into half around [[the Point of Sangomar]]. One sails to the north, the other sails south. Those traveling south became the ancestors of the Diolas and the other became the ancestor of the Serers. The healing method of the Lebu is called ''ndepp'' while the Serer healing method is called ''Loup''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abibitumikasa.com/yabb/Attachments/coumbalambafinalreport.pdf The Cosaan Foundation]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ecole pratique des hautes études (France). 6. section: Sciences économiques et sociales.

'''Scrupulosity''' is characterized by pathological guilt about moral or religious issues. It is personally distressing, objectively dysfunctional, and often accompanied by significant impairment in social functioning.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Scrupulosity: A cognitive–behavioral analysis and implications for treatment|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211364914000116?via=sd|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically conceptualized as a moral or religious form of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD),&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Deacon B, Nelson EA |title=On the nature and treatment of scrupulosity |journal=Pragmatic Case Stud Psychother |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=39–53 |year=2008 |url=http://jrul.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/pcsp/article/view/932/2329 |format=PDF |doi=10.14713/pcsp.v4i2.932}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this categorization is empirically disputable.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

The term is derived from the Latin ''scrupulum'', a sharp stone, implying a stabbing pain on the [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="Miller-Hedges"&gt;{{vcite journal |author = Miller CH, Hedges DW|title = Scrupulosity disorder: an overview and introductory analysis|journal = J Anxiety Disord|volume = 22|issue = 6|pages = 1042–58|year = 2008|pmid = 18226490|doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2007.11.004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Scrupulosity was formerly called ''scruples'' in religious contexts, but the word ''[[Scruples (disambiguation)|scruples]]'' now commonly refers to a troubling of the [[conscience]] rather than to the disorder.

As a personality trait, scrupulosity is a recognized diagnostic criterion for [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 301.4 Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/o-cpd.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called "scrupulousness", but that word properly applies to the positive trait of having scruples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scrupulous |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/scrupulous |website=Dictionary.com |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:JohnMooreBpOfEly.jpg|thumb|alt=Mezzotint portrait of a seated man in flowing vestments and long wavy hair. He is about 50 years old and with receding hairline and a calm expression on his roundish face.

Scrupulosity is a modern-day psychological problem that echoes a traditional use of the term ''scruples'' in a religious context, e.g. by [[Roman Catholic]]s, to mean obsessive concern with one's own sins and compulsive performance of religious devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Ciarrocchi JW |date=1995 |title=The Doubting Disease: Help for Scrupulosity and Religious Compulsions |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Paulist Press |isbn=0-8091-3553-1 |ref=Doubting }} Scruples: common and uncommon. p. 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term dates to the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Taylor CZ |title=Religious addiction: obsession with spirituality |journal=Pastoral Psych |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=291–315 |doi=10.1023/A:1014074130084 |date=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several historical and religious figures suffered from doubts of sin, and expressed their pains. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], wrote "After I have trodden upon a cross formed by two straws&amp;nbsp;... there comes to me from without a thought that I have sinned&amp;nbsp;... this is probably a scruple and temptation suggested by the enemy."&lt;ref name=van-Megen&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Obsessive compulsive disorder and religion: a reconnaissance |author=van Megen HJGM, den Boer-Wolters D, Verhagen PJ |pages=271–82 |title=Religion and Psychiatry: Beyond Boundaries |editor=Verhagen P, Van Praag HM, López-Ibor JJ Jr, Cox J, Moussaoui D, editors |isbn=978-0-470-69471-8 |publisher=Wiley |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alphonsus Liguori]], the [[Redemptorists]]' founder, wrote of it as "groundless fear of sinning that arises from 'erroneous ideas'".&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Although the condition was lifelong for Loyola and Liguori,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Rose S |date=2007 |title=St. Ignatius Loyola And The Early Jesuits |isbn=1-4086-2255-6 |chapter=Manresa—the spiritual exercises—1523 |pages=45–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Alphonsus de Liguori |editor=Jones FM, editor and translator |date=1999 |title=Selected Writings |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Paulist Press |chapter=Peace for scrupulous souls |pages=209–18 |isbn=0-8091-3771-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thérèse of Lisieux]] stated that she recovered from her condition after 18 months, writing "One would have to pass through this martyrdom to understand it well, and for me to express what I experienced for a year and a half would be impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Monahan J |date=2003 |title=Thérèse of Lisieux |page=45 |isbn=0-8091-6710-7 |publisher=Paulist Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] also suffered from obsessive doubts; in his mind, his omitting the word ''enim'' ("for") during the [[Eucharist]] was as horrible as laziness, divorce, or murdering one's parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Aho JA |date=2005 |title=Confession and Bookkeeping: the Religious, Moral, and Rhetorical Roots of Modern Accounting |location=Albany |publisher=State University of New York Press |chapter=Martin Luther and scrupulosity |pages=95–8 |isbn=0-7914-6545-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historical religious figures such as Loyola, Luther and [[John Bunyan]] are commonly cited as examples of scrupulosity in modern self-help books, some of these retrospective diagnoses may be deeply ahistorical: these figures' obsession with salvation may have been excessive by modern standards, but that does not mean that it was pathological.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Cefalu P |title=The doubting disease: religious scrupulosity and obsessive–compulsive disorder in historical context |journal=J Med Humanit  |year=2010 |pmid=20127153 |doi=10.1007/s10912-010-9107-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrupulosity's first known public description as a disorder was in 1691, by [[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]], who called it "religious melancholy" and said it made people "fear, that what they do, is so defective and unfit to be presented unto God, that he will not accept it".&lt;ref name=Lopez-Ibor&gt;{{vcite book |chapterurl=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/18/04706947/0470694718-2.pdf |chapterformat=PDF |chapter=Religious experience and psychopathology |author=López-Ibor JJ Jr, López-Ibor Alcocer MI |pages=211–33 |title=Religion and Psychiatry: Beyond Boundaries |editor=Verhagen P, Van Praag HM, López-Ibor JJ Jr, Cox J, Moussaoui D, editors |isbn=978-0-470-69471-8 |publisher=Wiley |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loyola, Liguori, the French confessor [[R.P.

Studies in the mid-20th century reported that scrupulosity was a major problem among American Catholics, with up to 25&amp;nbsp;per cent of high school students affected; commentators at the time asserted that this was an increase over previous levels.&lt;ref name=Bourke/&gt;

Starting in the 20th century, individuals with scrupulosity in the U.S. and Britain increasingly began looking to psychiatrists, rather than to religious advisors, for help with the condition.&lt;ref name=Bourke&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Bourke J |title=Divine madness: the dilemma of religious scruples in twentieth-century America and Britain |journal=J Soc Hist |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=581–603 |date=2009 |doi=10.1353/jsh.0.0152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This part needs more work.--&gt;

== Characteristics ==

In scrupulosity, a person's obsessions focus on moral or religious fears, such as the fear of being an evil person or the fear of divine retribution for sin. Although it can affect nonreligious people, it is usually related to religious beliefs. In the strict sense, not all obsessive–compulsive behaviors related to religion are instances of scrupulosity: strictly speaking, for example, scrupulosity is not present in people who repeat religious requirements merely to be sure that they were done properly.&lt;ref name=Huppert&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Huppert JD, Siev J, Kushner ES |title=When religion and obsessive–compulsive disorder collide: treating scrupulosity in Ultra-Orthodox Jews |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=925–41 |date=2007 |pmid=17828763 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

Treatment is similar to that for other forms of obsessive–compulsive disorder.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; [[Exposure and response prevention]] (ERP), a form of behavior therapy, is widely used for OCD in general and may be promising for scrupulosity in particular.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"/&gt; ERP is based on the idea that deliberate repeated exposure to obsessional stimuli lessens anxiety, and that avoiding rituals lowers the urge to behave compulsively. For example, with ERP a person [[Intrusive thought#Blasphemous religious thoughts|obsessed by blasphemous thoughts]] while reading the Bible would practice reading the Bible.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz&gt;{{vcite book |editor=Abramowitz JS, McKay D, Taylor S |title=Clinical Handbook of Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder and Related Problems |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |date=2008 |isbn=0-8018-8697-X |chapter=Scrupulosity |author=Abramowitz JS |pages=156–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Exposure Therapy for Anxiety: Principles and Practice|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pnoznH2c7esC|publisher = Guilford Press|date = 2011-03-14|isbn = 9781609180171|language = en|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|first2 = Brett J.|last2 = Deacon|first3 = Stephen P. H.|last3 = Whiteside}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ERP is considerably harder to implement than with other disorders, because scrupulosity often involves spiritual issues that are not specific situations and objects. For example, ERP is not appropriate for a man obsessed by feelings that God has rejected and is punishing him. [[Cognitive therapy]] may be appropriate when ERP is not feasible.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Other therapy strategies include noting contradictions between the compulsive behaviors and moral or religious teachings, and informing individuals that for centuries religious figures have suggested strategies similar to ERP.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; Religious counseling may be an additional way to readjust beliefs associated with the disorder, though it may also stimulate greater anxiety.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

Little evidence is available on the use of medications to treat scrupulosity.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Although [[serotonergic]] medications are often used to treat OCD,&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; studies of pharmacologic treatment of scrupulosity in particular have produced so few results that even tentative recommendations cannot be made.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

Treatment of scrupulosity in children has not been investigated to the extent it has been studied in adults, and one of the factors that makes the treatment difficult is the fine line the therapist must walk between engaging and offending the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |editor=McKay D, Storch EA, editors |date=2009 |title=Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Children: Treating Complex and Refractory Cases |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-8261-1686-8 |author=McKay D, Storch EA, Nelson B, Morales M, Moretz MW |chapter=Obsessive–compulsive disorder in children and adolescents: treating difficult cases |pages=81–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==

The [[prevalence]] of scrupulosity is speculative. Available data do not permit reliable estimates, and available analyses mostly disregard associations with age or with gender, and have not reliably addressed associations with geography or ethnicity.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Available data suggest that the [[prevalence]] of obsessive–compulsive disorder does not differ by culture, except where prevalence rates differ for all psychiatric disorders. No association between OCD and depth of religious beliefs has been demonstrated, although data are scarce.&lt;ref name=Huppert/&gt; There are large regional differences in the percentage of OCD patients who have religious obsessions or compulsions, ranging from 0–7% in countries like the U.K. and Singapore, to 40–60% in traditional Muslim and orthodox Jewish populations.&lt;ref name=van-Megen/&gt;

'''Self-realization''' is an expression used in Western [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[spirituality]]; and in [[Indian religions]]. In the Western understanding it is the "fulfillment by oneself of the possibilities of one's character or personality."&lt;ref name=SR/&gt; In the Indian understanding, self-realization is [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|liberating knowledge]] of the true Self, either as the permanent undying Atman, or as the absence (''sunyata'') of such a permanent Self.

==Western understanding==
Merriam Webster's dictionary defines self-realization as:
{{quote|Fulfillment by oneself of the possibilities of one's character or personality.&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-realization |title=Self-realization|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Western world "self-realization" has gained great popularity. Influential in this popularity were psycho-analysis, humanistic psychology, the growing acquaintance with Eastern religions, and the growing popularity of Western [[esotericism]].

===Psychoanalysis===
Though [[Sigmund Freud]] was skeptical of religion and esotericism, his theories have had a lasting influence on Western thought and self-understanding. His notion of repressed memories, though based on false assumptions, has become part of mainstream thought.{{sfn|Webster|1996}}

Freud's ideas were further developed by his students and neo-psycho-analysts. [[Carl Jung]], [[Erik Erikson]], and [[Winnicott]] have been especially important in the Western understanding of the self. But other alternatives have also been developed.

Jung developed the notion of [[individuation]], the lifelong process in which the centre of psychological life shifts from the ego to the self.

Erikson described human development throughout the life-span in his [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|theory of psychosocial development]].

[[Winnicott]] developed the notion of the [[True self and false self|true self]].

Roberto Assagioli developed his approach of [[Psychosynthesis]], an original approach to psychology.

===Western esotericism===
Western [[esotericism]] integrates a broad variety of traditions, some of which view self-realization as the ultimate goal of a human being.{{who|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Indian religions==
===Jainism===
[[Jain]] philosophy is the oldest world philosophy that separates body ([[matter]]) from the [[soul]] (consciousness) completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Individual conscience and individual consciousness are central in the [[Jain philosophy]]. Self-realisation is one of the major pre-requisites to attain ultimate enlightenment and liberation ([[moksha]]). Self-realisation means peeling away fabricated layers of own personality to understand the true self and hence the true nature of reality. In Jainism, [[karma]] is portrayed as invisible particles of subtle matter that adhere to a living organism or [[Jiva]]. These particles come together to form a film of negativity and darkness around the soul that obscures the true consciousness; making the Jiva lose touch with its original essence as a [[soul]]. These karmic particles tend to attract more such particles which cause the inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul ([[Āsrava]]), leading the organism to fall into the bondage of lust, worldly pleasures, ego, hatred, jealousy, anger, etc. Thus self-realisation paves the way to simply reverse this process and help the seeker to decipher the absolute truth on its own. Jainism firmly rejects the belief of a creator, and one being is solely responsible for his thoughts, actions, and their consequences.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=CIgqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=self+realisation+Jainism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD8-qum9TcAhWVWysKHZA3CTMQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=self%20realisation%20Jainism&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrimadrajchandramission.org/pujya-gurudevshri/pearls-of-wisdom/is-self-realisation-possible-in-present-times-4002.htm|title=Is Self-realisation Possible in Present Times?|author=|date=|website=www.shrimadrajchandramission.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4K9GDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Samyak+darshan+Samyak+gnana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtx9eU3s7ZAhVTObwKHc6sDnQQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Samyak%20darshan%20Samyak%20gnana&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Expert needed|Hinduism
}}
In [[Hinduism]], self-realization (''[[Atman jnana|atma-jnana]]'' or ''atmabodha'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%A7-meaning-in-english.words?amp=1|title=आत्मबोध|last=|first=|date=|website=dict.hinkhoj.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is knowledge of the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|true self]] beyond both delusion and identification with material phenomena. It refers to self-identification and not mere ego identification{{Clarify|reason=|date=August 2018}}.

====Shaivism====
In  [[Shaivism]], self-realization is the direct knowing of the Self God [[Parashiva]]. Self-realization ([[nirvikalpa]] [[samadhi]], which means "ecstasy without form or seed," or asamprajñata samādhi) is considered the ultimate spiritual attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/dancing-with-siva/web/glossary_c.html|title=Glossary - "Self Realization"|last=Sivaya|first=Subramuniyaswami|last3=|publisher=Himalayan academy|year=1997|isbn=9780945497974|location=USA|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Self-realization is considered the gateway to [[moksha]], liberation/freedom from rebirth. This state is attained when the [[Kundalini]] force pierces through the [[Sahasrara|Sahasrara chakra]] at the crown of the head. The realization of Self, [[Parashiva]], considered to be each soul's destiny, is attainable through renunciation, sustained meditation and preventing the germination of future [[karma]] (the phrase "frying the seeds of karma" is often used)&lt;ref&gt;Veeraswamy Krishnaraj, ''The Bhagavad-Gita: Translation and Commentary'' pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/dancing-with-siva/web/ch01_05.html|title=Dancing with Siva|last=Subramuniyaswami|first=Sivaya|publisher=Himalayan academy|year=1997|isbn=9780945497974|location=USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advaita Vedanta====
Ātman is the [[first principle]] in Advaita Vedanta, along with its concept of Brahman, with Atman being the perceptible personal particular and Brahman the inferred unlimited universal, both synonymous and interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Deussen, Paul and Geden, A. S. (2010), The Philosophy of the Upanishads, Cosimo Classics, pp. 86-87. {{ISBN|1-61640-240-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge and complete understanding of the identity of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman leads dissolution of all dualistic tendencies and to [[Moksha|liberation]]. Moksha is attained by realizing one's true identity as Ātman, and the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}} This is stated by Shankara as follows:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I am other than name, form and action.
My nature is ever free!
I am Self, the supreme unconditioned Brahman.
I am pure Awareness, always non-dual.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Adi Shankara, [[Upadesasahasri]] 11.7|{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}}}

===Buddhism===
{{main|Enlightenment in Buddhism}}

Since [[Buddhism]] denies the existence of a separate self, as explicated in the teachings of [[anatman]] and [[sunyata]], self-realization is a ''contradictio in terminis'' for Buddhism. Though the [[tathagatagarbha|tathagatagarbha-teachings]] seem to teach the existence of a separate self, they point to the inherent possibility of attaining [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], not to the existence of a separate self. The [[dharmadhatu|dharmadhatu-teachings]] make this even more clear: reality is an undivided whole; awakening is the realization of this whole.

===Sikhism===
{{main|Sikh philosophy}}

[[Sikhism]] propounds the philosophy of Self-realization. This is possible by "aatam-cheennea"&lt;ref&gt;[[Guru Granth Sahib|Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], page 375&lt;/ref&gt; or "Aap Pashaanae", purifying the self from the false ego:&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P.1056&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|'Atam-cheene' is self-analysis, which is gained by peeping into one's self in the light of the teachings of ''[[Guru Granth Sahib|Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]''. It is the process of evaluating and analyzing oneself on the touchstone of 'naam simran' which if practised, pierces into the self and washes it from within. The filth of too much of materialism goes, the self gets purified and the mind comes in 'charhdi kala/higher state of mind". This means that the self should be assessed, examined and purified, leading to self-realization and the purification of our mind. Once purified the mind helps in ushering in oneness with the Super Power as the Guru says, "Atam-cheen bhae nirankari" (SGGS:P. 415) which means that one gets attuned to the Formless Lord through self-realization. Indirectly it means that self-realization leads to God-realization.{{sfn|Majhail (Dr.)|2010|p=272}}}}

[[Guru Nanak]] says,
{{quote|Those who realize their self get immersed in the Lord Himself.&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P. 421&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|He who realizes his self, comes to know the essence.&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P. 224&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A '''suangi''' is a common name  of a male who is suspected, and therefore accused, of being a  [[witch]] in the [[belief system]] of West Papuans. Suangis are said to eat the blood and/or internal organs of their victims and then stuff the bodies with leaves and grass. They are also believed to devour the person's soul. After being attacked, the [[zombified]] victim is then said to return home where they seem to have fallen mysteriously ill. If a victim is able to name the suangi that has attacked him, they are often killed and eaten by the victim's family in the belief that it will free the person's spirit.

{{italic title}}
'''''Summum bonum''''' is a Latin expression meaning "the highest good", which was introduced by the [[Roman philosopher]] [[Cicero]],{{sfn|Dinneen|1909}} to correspond to the [[Form of the Good|Idea of the Good]] in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. The ''summum bonum'' is generally thought of as being an end in itself, and at the same time containing all other goods.

The term was used in [[medieval philosophy]]. In the [[Thomism|Thomist]] synthesis of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Christianity]], the highest good is usually defined as the life of the righteous and/or the life led in [[communion (Christian)|communion]] with [[God]] and according to [[Divine law|God's precepts]].{{sfn|Dinneen|1909}} In [[Kantianism]], it was used to describe the [[ultimate importance]], the singular and overriding end which human beings ought to pursue.

==Plato and Aristotle==
[[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' argued that, "In the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen...to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right".&lt;ref&gt;B. Jowett trans, ''The Essential Plato'' (1999) p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Silent contemplation was the route to appreciation of the Idea of the Good.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kojeve, ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'' (1980) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' accepted that the target of human activity, "Must be the 'Good', that is, the supreme good.", but challenged Plato's Idea of the Good with the [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] question: "Will one who has had a vision of the Idea itself become thereby a better doctor or general?".&lt;ref&gt;H, Tredennick revd, ''The Ethics of Aristotle'' (1976) p. 63 and p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; However, arguably at least, Aristotle's concept of the [[unmoved mover]] owed much to Plato's Idea of the Good.&lt;ref&gt;Tredennick, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hellenic syncretism==
[[Philo]] of Alexandria conflated the [[Old Testament]] God with the unmoved mover and the Idea of the Good.&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman ed., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 703&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plotinus]], the [[neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] philosopher, built on Plato's Good for his concept of the supreme One, while [[Plutarch]] drew on [[Zoroastrianism]] to develop his eternal principle of good.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 705-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] in his early writings offered the summum bonum as the highest human goal, but was later to identify it as a feature of the Christian God&lt;ref&gt;J. McWilliam, ''Augustine'' (1992) p. 152-4&lt;/ref&gt; in ''De natura boni'' (''On the Nature of Good'', c. 399). Augustine denies the positive existence of absolute [[evil]], describing a world with [[God]] as the supreme good at the center, and defining different grades of evil as different stages of remoteness from that center{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

==Later developments==
The summum bonum has continued to be a focus of attention in Western philosophy, secular and religious. [[Hegel]] replaced Plato's dialectical ascent to the Good by his own dialectical ascent to the Real.&lt;ref&gt;Kojeve, p. 181-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. E. Moore]] placed the highest good in personal relations and the contemplation of beauty – even if not all his followers in the [[Bloomsbury Group]] may have appreciated what [[Clive Bell]] called his "all-important distinction between 'Good on the whole' and 'Good as a whole'".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in H. Lee, ''Virginia Woolf'' (1996)  p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] considered that "the sovereign good, if this confusing term must be retained, can be found again only at the level of the law",&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;  i.e. the [[symbolic order]], offsetting [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] with [[Marquis de Sade|De Sade]] to undercut nobler but one-dimensional notions of the Good.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Concepts'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier he had regretted the way the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] must know, "Not only doesn't he have that Sovereign Good that is asked of him, but he also knows there isn't any".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis'' (1992) p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgments==
{{Details|Intrinsic value (ethics)#Life stances and intrinsic value}}
Judgments on the highest good have generally fallen into four categories:{{sfn|Dinneen|1909}}
* [[Utilitarianism]], when the highest good is identified with the maximum possible psychological happiness for the maximum number of people;
* [[Eudaemonism]] or [[virtue ethics]], when the highest good is identified with [[eudaemonia|flourishing]];
* Rational [[deontologism]], when the highest good is identified with [[virtue]] or duty;
* Rational eudaemonism, or tempered deontologism, when both virtue and happiness are combined in the highest good.

'''Supererogation''' ([[Latin|Late Latin]]: ''supererogatio'' "payment beyond what is due or asked", from ''super'' "beyond" and ''erogare'' "to pay out, expend", itself from ''ex'' "out" and ''rogare'' "to ask") is the performance of more than is asked for; the action of doing more than [[duty]] requires. In [[ethics]], an act is '''supererogatory''' if it is good but not morally required to be done. It refers to an act that is more than is necessary, when another course of action—involving less—would still be an acceptable action. It differs from a duty, which is an act wrong not to do, and from acts morally neutral. Supererogation may be considered as performing above and beyond a normative course of duty to further benefits and functionality.

==In Catholicism==
In the [[theology]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], "works of supererogation" (also called "acts of supererogation") are those performed beyond what God requires. For example, in [[1 Corinthians 7]], [[Paul the Apostle]] says that while everyone is free to marry, it is better to refrain from marriage and remain celibate to better serve God. The Roman Catholic Church holds that the [[counsels of perfection]] are supererogatory acts, which specific [[Christian]]s may engage in above their moral duties. Similarly, it teaches that to determine how to act, one must engage in reasonable efforts to be sure of what the right actions are; after the reasonable action, the person is in a state of [[vincible ignorance|invincible ignorance]] and guiltless of wrongdoing, but to undertake more than reasonable actions to overcome ignorance is supererogatory, and praiseworthy.

According to the classic teaching on [[indulgence]]s, the works of supererogation performed by all the saints form a treasure with God, the "[[treasury of merit,]]" which the church can apply to exempt [[repentance (Christianity)|repentant]] sinners from the works of [[penance|penitence]] that would otherwise be required of them to achieve full reconciliation with the church.

==In Protestantism==
[[Martin Luther]]'s opposition of this teaching seeded the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Church of England]] denied the doctrine of supererogation in the fourteenth of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], which states that works of supererogation

&lt;blockquote&gt;
cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety: for by them men do declare, that they not only render unto God as much as they are bound to, but that they do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer_(ECUSA)/Historical_Documents_of_the_Church/Articles_of_Religion Book of Common Prayer (ECUSA)/Historical Documents of the Church/Articles of Religion. XIV.  Of Works of Supererogation.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later Protestant movements followed suit, such as in the [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]].

==In Islam==
A [[Muslim]] must complete a minimum of the [[Salah#The Five Daily Prayers|five daily prayers]], each typically lasting an average of 5 to 10 minutes. Supererogatory prayers beyond these are known as [[Nafl prayer|nafl]] prayers, and praying them is considered to bear additional reward. There are also several other supererogatory acts in [[Islam]], such as fasting outside of the month of [[Ramadhan]], or giving [[sadaqah]] (charity, consisting of simple acts of kindness to financial assistance) that is not obligatory.

==Discussion==
Whether an act is supererogatory or obligatory can be debated. In many schools of thought, donating money to [[Charitable organization|charity]] is supererogatory. In other schools of thought that regard some level of charitable donation to be duty (such as with the [[tithe]] in [[Judaism]], [[zakat]] in Islam, and similar standards in many Christian sects), only exceeding a certain level of donation (e.g. going above the common 2.5%-of-capital-assets standard in zakat) would count as supererogatory.

In [[criminal law]], it may be observed that state prohibitions on killing, stealing, and so on derive from the state's duty to protect one's own citizens. However, a nation state has no duty to protect the citizens of an adjacent nation from crime. To send a [[peacekeeping]] force into another country would be — in the view of the nation doing it — supererogatory.

Some schools of ethics do not include supererogatory acts. In [[utilitarianism]], an act can only be better because it would bring more good to a greater number, and in that case it becomes a duty, not a supererogatory act. The lack of a notion of supererogation in utilitarianism and related schools leads to the [[demandingness objection]], arguing that these schools are too ethically demanding, requiring unreasonable acts.

[[File:Huxley Perennial Philosophy coverblurb1946 Low Res.jpg|thumb|Publisher's jacket blurb for the first United Kingdom edition]]

'''''The Perennial Philosophy''''' is a comparative study of mysticism by the British writer and novelist [[Aldous Huxley]]. Its title derives from the theological tradition of the ''[[philosophia perennis]]''.

==Social and political context==

''The Perennial Philosophy'' was first published in 1945 immediately after the [[Second World War]] (and the defeat of [[National Socialism]]) by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] in the United States (1946 by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] in the United Kingdom). The jacket text of the British first edition explains:&lt;ref name="Cover"&gt;{{cite book | author=Huxley, Aldous | authorlink=Aldous Huxley | title=The Perennial Philosophy | edition=1st. | year=1946 | publisher=Chatto and Windus | location= London | page=Dust Jacket}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''The Perennial Philosophy'' is an attempt to present this Highest Common Factor of all theologies by assembling passages from the writings of those saints and prophets who have approached a direct spiritual knowledge of the Divine...&lt;ref name="Cover"/&gt;}}

The book offers readers, who are assumed to be familiar with the Christian religion and the Bible, a fresh approach employing Eastern and Western [[mysticism]]:
{{quote|Mr. Huxley quotes from the Chinese [[Taoist]] philosophers, from followers of [[Buddha]] and [[Muhammad|Mohammed]], from the [[Brahmin]] scriptures and from Christian mystics ranging from [[John of the Cross|St John of the Cross]] to [[William Law]], giving preference to those whose writings, often illuminated by genius, are unfamiliar to the modern reader.&lt;ref name="Cover"/&gt;}}

The final paragraph of the jacket text states:

{{quote|In this profoundly important work, Mr. Huxley has made no attempt to 'found a new religion'; but in analyzing the Natural Theology of the Saints, as he has described it, he provides us with an absolute standard of faith by which we can judge both our moral depravity as individuals and the insane and often criminal behaviour of the national societies we have created.&lt;ref name="Cover"/&gt;}}

==Scope of the book==

In the words of poet and anthologist [[John Robert Colombo]]:

{{quote|''The Perennial Philosophy'' is essentially an anthology of short passages taken from traditional Eastern texts and the writings of Western mystics, organised by subject and topic, with short connecting commentaries. No specific sources are given. Paging through the index gives the reader (or non-reader) an idea of who and what Huxley has taken seriously. Here are the entries in the index that warrant two lines of page references or more:&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gurdjieffbooks.wordpress.com/category/the-perennial-philosophy-revisited/ | title=books, news, reviews | publisher=Gurdjieff Books Wordpress | work='THE PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHY' revisited | date=16 June 2010 | accessdate=25 October 2011 | author=Colombo, John Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Aquinas, Augustine, St. Bernard, Bhagavad-Gita, Buddha, Jean Pierre Camus, St. Catherine, Christ, Chuang Tzu, "Cloud of Unknowing,” Contemplation, Deliverance, Desire, Eckhart (five lines, the most quoted person), Eternity, Fénelon, François de Sales, Godhead, Humility, Idolatry, St. John of the Cross, Knowledge, Lankavatara Sutra, William Law (another four lines), Logos, Love, Mahayana, Mind, Mortification, Nirvana, Perennial Philosophy (six lines, a total of 40 entries in all), Prayer, Rumi, Ruysbroeck, Self, Shankara, Soul, Spirit, "Theologia Germanica," Truth, Upanishads (six different ones are quoted), Will, Words.&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff/&gt;}}

==Style of the book==

Huxley deliberately chose less well-known quotations because "familiarity with traditionally hallowed writings tends to breed, not indeed contempt, but ... a kind of reverential insensibility, ... an inward deafness to the meaning of the sacred words."&lt;ref&gt;''The Perennial Philosophy'', page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, Chapter 5 on "Charity" takes just one quotation from the Bible, combining it with less familiar sources:

:"He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love."&lt;sub&gt;''1 John iv''&lt;/sub&gt;

:"By love may He be gotten and holden, but by thought never."&lt;sub&gt;''The Cloud of Unknowing''&lt;/sub&gt;

:"The astrolabe of the mysteries of God is love."&lt;sub&gt;''Jalal-uddin Rumi''&lt;/sub&gt;"&lt;ref name=PP95&gt;''The Perennial Philosophy'', page 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley then explains: "We can only love what we know, and we can never know completely what we do not love. Love is a mode of knowledge ..."&lt;ref name=PP95/&gt;

Huxley is quite vague with his references: "No specific sources are given."&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff /&gt;

==Structure of the book==

The book's structure consists of:

* A brief Introduction by Huxley, of just over 5 pages.
* Twenty-seven chapters (each of about 10 pages) of quotations from sages and saints on specific topics, with "short connecting commentaries."&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff /&gt; The chapters are not grouped in any way though there is a kind of order from the nature of the ''Ground'' at the beginning, down to practical exercises at the end. The Acknowledgements list 27 books from which quotations have been taken. The chapter titles are:

*''Book Week'' (21 October 1945).
*''Booklist'' v. 42 (15 November 1945).
*''The Christian Century'' v. 62 (12 December 1945).
*Bull VA Kirkus' Bookshop Serv v. 13 (1 August 1945). 
*''The Nation'' v. 161 (27 October 1945).
*''The New Republic'' v. 113 (5 November 1945).

The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that, "Perhaps Mr. Huxley, in ''The Perennial Philosophy'' has, at this time, written the most needed book in the world."&lt;ref name=nyt1945&gt;{{cite news | author=Toksvig, Signe |title= Aldous Huxley's prescriptions for spiritual myopia| newspaper=New York Times |date= 30 September 1945 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' described the book as an:

{{quote|... anthology [that] is above all a masterpiece of discrimination.... [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] gave the name of the [[Perennial philosophy|Perennial Philosophy]] to this theme. Mr. Huxley has systematised, and dealt with, its many-branching problems, perils and [[beatitudes]].&lt;ref name=nyt1945/&gt;}}

The ''Times'' also stated that, "It is important to say that even an agnostic, even a behaviorist-materialist ... can read this book with joy. It is the masterpiece of all anthologies."&lt;ref name=nyt1945/&gt;

Similarly, forty years later [[Huston Smith]], a religious scholar, wrote that, in ''The Perennial Philosophy'':

{{quote|Huxley provides us with the most systematic statement of his mature outlook. Its running commentary deals with many of the social implications of Huxley's metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous (1993) ''Huxley on God'', Introduction – Walter Houston Smith p. 9, HarperSanFrancisco {{ISBN|0-06-250536-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Not all the reception was so positive. Chad Walsh, writing in the ''Journal of Bible and Religion''&lt;ref name=ChadWalsh&gt;{{Cite journal| jstor=3693645 | title=Journal of Bible and Religion | publisher=Journal of Bible and Religion. Vol 16, No 1. pp 3–12 | work=Pilgrimage to the Perennial Philosophy: The Case of Aldous Huxley | date=January 1948 | author=Walsh, Chad | pages=3–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948, spoke of Huxley's distinguished family background, only to continue:

{{quote|The only startling fact, and the one that could not have been predicted by the most discerning sociologist or psychologist, is that in his mid-forties he was destined to turn also to mysticism, and that since his conversion he was to be one of a small group in California busily writing books to win as many people as possible over to the "perennial philosophy" as a way of life.&lt;ref name=ChadWalsh /&gt;}}

===In the United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, reviewers admired the comprehensiveness of Huxley's survey but questioned his other-worldliness and were hostile to his belief in the paranormal.

[[C. E. M. Joad]] wrote in ''[[New Statesman and Society]]'' that, although the book was a mine of learning and Huxley's commentary was profound, readers would be surprised to find that he had adopted a series of peculiar beliefs such as the curative power of relics and spiritual presences incarnated in sacramental objects. Joad pointed out that, if the argument of the book is correct, only those who have undergone the religious experiences upon which it is based are properly able to assess its worth. Further, he found that the book was dogmatic and intolerant, "in which pretty well everything we want to do is wrong."

Finally, Joad asserted that Huxley's mistake was in his "intellectual whole-hoggery" and that he was led by ideas untempered by ordinary human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Joad, C.E.M. (5 October 1946) ''Huxley Gone Sou''r, The New Statesman and Society, 32, P. 249-50 in Watt, Donald ed. (1997) Aldous Huxley The Critical Heritage, pps 363–365, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-15915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the journal ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', the Anglican priest Rev. [[William Inge (priest)|W. R. Inge]] remarked on the book's well chosen quotations and called it "probably the most important treatise we have had on mysticism for many years." He saw it as evidence that Huxley was now a mystical philosopher, which he regarded as an encouraging sign. Inge pointed out conflicts between religions and within religion and agreed that a [[rapprochement]] must be through mystical religion. However, he wondered if the book, with its transcendence of the personality and detachment from worldly concerns, might not be more Buddhist than Christian. He concluded his review by calling into question Huxley's belief in [[Psychic|psychical phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;Inge, W.R. (April 1947) Perennial Philosophy – Review, Philosophy, XXII, pps 66–70 in Watt, Donald ed. (1997) Aldous Huxley The Critical Heritage, pps 366–368, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-15915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elsewhere===

Canadian author [[John Robert Colombo]] wrote that as a young man he, like many others in the 1950s, was swept away with enthusiasm for "the coveted volume" :

{{quote|Everyone interested in consciousness studies has heard of his study called ''The Perennial Philosophy''. It bears such a prescient and memorable title. His use of the title has preempted its use by any other author, neuropsychologist, Traditionalist, or enthusiast for the [[New Age]]. The book so nobly named did much to romanticise the notion of “perennialism” and to cast into the shade such long-established timid Christian notions of “[[ecumenicism]]” ([[Protestants]] dialoguing with [[Catholics]], etc.) or “inter-faith” meetings (Christians encountering non-Christians, etc.). Who would care about the beliefs of [[Baptists]] when one could care about the practices of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetans]]?''&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff/&gt;}}

Colombo also stated that:

{{quote|Painfully absent from these pages are Huxley's mordant wit and insights into human nature. It is as if his [[wiktionary:quicksilver|quicksilverish]] intelligence has been put on hold or has found itself in a deep freeze of his own making. When it comes to selecting short and sometimes long quotations, he is no compiler like [[John Bartlett (publisher)|John Bartlett]] of quotation fame, but he does find time to make a few deft personal observations.&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff/&gt;}}

==Huxley's view of perennial philosophy==
{{further|Perennial philosophy}}

Huxley's Introduction to ''The Perennial Philosophy'' begins:

{{quote|The [[metaphysic]] that recognises a divine Reality substantial to the world of things and lives and minds; the [[psychology]] that finds in the soul something similar to, or even identical with, divine Reality; the [[ethic]] that places man's final end in the knowledge of the [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Ground of being|Ground of all being]] — the thing is immemorial and universal.

Rudiments of the [[Perennial Philosophy]] may be found among the traditionary lore of primitive peoples in every region of the world, and in its fully developed forms it has a place in every one of the higher religions. A version of this [[Highest common factor|Highest Common Factor]] in all preceding and subsequent theologies was first committed to writing more than twenty-five centuries ago, and since that time the inexhaustible theme has been treated again and again, from the standpoint of every religious tradition and in all the principal languages of Asia and Europe.&lt;ref name=PP1&gt;(''The Perennial Philosophy'', Introduction, page 1)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the next paragraph, Huxley summarises the problem more succinctly, saying: "Knowledge is a function of being."&lt;ref name=PP1 /&gt; In other words, if you are not suited to knowing something, you do not know it. This makes knowing the Ground of All Being difficult, in Huxley's view. Therefore, he concludes his Introduction with:

{{quote|If one is not oneself a sage or saint, the best thing one can do, in the field of metaphysics, is to study the works of those who were, and who, because they had modified their merely human mode of being, were capable of a more than merely human kind and amount of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;(''The Perennial Philosophy'', Introduction, pages 5–6.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Time and Eternity - An Essay on the Philosophy of Religion''''' (1st imp. [[Princeton University|Princeton]] [[New Jersey]] 1952, [[Princeton University Press]], 169 pp) is a philosophy book written by [[Walter Terence Stace]]. At the time of writing, Stace was a professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]], where he had worked since 1932 after a 22-year career in the [[Ceylon Civil Service]]. ''Time and Eternity'' was one of his first books about the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[mysticism]], after writing throughout most of the 1930s and 1940s that was influenced by [[Phenomenalism|phenomenalist]] philosophy.

In his introduction Stace writes that ''Time and Eternity'' is an attempt to set out the fundamental nature of religion, and to deal with the conflict between religion and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He explains that the basic idea set out in the book is that all religious thought is symbolic, and that his influences include [[Rudolf Otto]], especially his ''Mysticism East and West'', and [[Immanuel Kant]]. He says he was motivated to write the book in an attempt to add to the "other half of the truth which I now think naturalism [as espoused in his 1947 essay ''Man Against Darkness''] misses".

The book begins by looking at religion, specifically God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He goes on to say that the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.

==Synopsis==

The first chapter asks what religion is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, is rooted in [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]], and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the [[Apophatic theology|negative divine]] - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, it is only the theories about it that differ.&lt;ref&gt;Stace, W. T. (1952) ''Time and Eternity''.  [[Princeton University Press]]. P. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.

| style="text-align: left;" | "It is not that the mystic has an experience, even a direct vision, of God. For in that case God would be the object for the soul as subject. The distinction between God and the soul, as object and subject respectively, is wholly done away with. The soul passes into the being of God, becomes God, is God."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 23&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Stace then goes on to explain that all religions say that religious revelation is [[ineffability|ineffable]], because no words or concepts can be applied to God who is without qualities or predicates. Thus, God cannot be comprehended by the intellect, but is apprehended by intuition. "... it is of the very nature of intellect to involve the subject-object opposition. But in the mystic experience this opposition is transcended. Therefore the intellect is incapable of understanding it. Therefore it is incomprehensible, ineffable."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace then looks at the [[Cataphatic theology|positive divine]]; he asks how concepts can be applied to that which is above all concepts and finds that all propositions about God are symbolical. He defines religious and non-religious symbolism as differing in two respects. Firstly, religious symbols cannot be translated into logical propositions because they refer to an (ineffable) experience rather than a proposition. Secondly, the relationship between the religious symbol and what is symbolised is one of evocation rather than "meaning", as meaning is a concept, which is absent in the mystical experience. "Yet in some way this symbolic language evokes in us some glimpse, some hint, seen dimly through the mists and fogs which envelop us, of that being who stands above all human thought and conception."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to write that some of these symbols feel more appropriate than others (e.g. God is love not hate).

[[File:Plotinos.jpg|thumb|200px|"Thus when Plotinus speaks of "the flight of the alone to the Alone,"… [this] evoke[s] in us a measure of the same experience which the author of them had."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 91&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Next Stace explains that there are two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of [[phenomenon|phenomena]] and the [[noumenon]], although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at symbolism in religion, Stace states that there are two types of predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a [[hierarchy of being]], and the latter to a hierarchy of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the [[numinous|numen]] and qualities found in the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace next looks at religion’s claims to truth. He draws an analogy between mystical illumination and aesthetic truth, as the truths of both rest on revelation rather than reason. "Either you directly perceive beauty, or you do not. And either you directly perceive God in intuition, or you do not."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he maintains the arguments of both mystics and naturalists in denying each other’s positions are invalid, as they concern different realities.

{| class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "What is the meaning of the metaphor of intersection? This intersection means precisely what the eternal moment is experienced to be. It is one and the same human consciousness which experiences both the temporal or natural world and that eternal and infinite order which is disclosed in mystical illumination."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 82&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

These separate spheres lead Stace to reflect on both [[Existence of God#Arguments for the existence of God|proofs for God]] and [[acosmism]]. He writes that proofs and disproofs for God are equally false, as God is only accessible by intuition and not logic. "… the production by philosophers of proofs of the unreality of space, time, and the temporal world generally, is a direct result of their mistaking of their mystical propositions for factual propositions." &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Further, proofs of God actually harm religion as they make him a part of the natural order - a point on which he says that he agrees with Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 147-8&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely acosmism (the denial of the reality of the world) has its root in the mystical moment, within which there is no other truth, God is the supreme reality and there is no naturalistic world. However this is a symbolic truth, rather than a statement of fact. Its counterpart in naturalism is atheism, which denies the reality of God.

{| class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "The pure religious consciousness lies in a region which is forever beyond all proof or disproof. This is a necessary consequence of the "utterly other" character of God from the world, and of the "utterly other" character of the world from God. The eternal order is not the natural order, and the natural order is not the eternal order. The two orders intersect, but in the intersection each remains what it is. Each is wholly self-contained. Therefore, it is impossible to pass, by any logical inference, from one to the other. This at once precludes as impossible any talk either of the proof or disproof of religion."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 136&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

In the final chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns to the idea that theology and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of [[Vedanta]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[F. H. Bradley|Bradley]]) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.

[[File:Ikone Athanasius von Alexandria.jpg|thumb|200px|“[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|The Upanishad]] says flatly that Brahman "is incomprehensible, for it cannot be comprehended". [[Creed of St. Athanasius|The creed of St. Athanasius]] agrees with the Upanishad: 
'The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, 
the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. . . . 
Yet not three incomprehensibles, but one incomprehensible.'"&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 37&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Critical response==

[[Virgil Aldrich|Virgil C Aldrich]] reviewed the book alongside ''Religion and the Modern Mind'' and ''The Gate of Silence'', also by Stace and published in 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a [[David Hume|Hume]] or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because it is difficult to determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil Aldrich|Aldrich, Virgil C.]] (Jan. 21, 1954). "Book Reviews", ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', 51(2), 75-77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. Seelye Bixler|Julius Seelye Bixler]] reviewed the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review he wrote that he believed Stace was trying to have his cake and eat it with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Seelye Bixler|Bixler, J.S.]] (Oct., 1952). "Book Reviews", ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion|The Journal of Bible and Religion]]'', 20(4), 272-274, OUP.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he reviewed ''Time and Eternity'' alongside ''Religion and the Modern Mind''. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Seelye Bixler|Bixler, J.S.]] (Jul 1953). "Reviews of Books", ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', 62(3), 479-480.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace was praised for his clarity and ambitious aims in ''Time and Eternity'' by [[Abraham Kaplan]] who believed the book was one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for the appropriateness of religious language by relying on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ and levels of being in the manner of [[Samuel Alexander]]. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and neither can it be said how they evoke the experience to which they refer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Kaplan|Kaplan, Abraham]] (Oct 1953). "Book Reviews", ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'', 3(3), 1953, 275-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also noting the unachievable ambition of solving the conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost if one were to approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|''Tractatus'']]: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.)&lt;ref&gt;Greenman, Martin A. (Mar. 1953). "Reviews", ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]'',13(3), 416-417.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy M. Emmet]] found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emmet, Dorothy, M.]] (Jan 1954). "New Books", ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', 29(108), 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Maurice Friedman writes about the book in the context of the various attempts to find a universal essence - or [[perennial philosophy]] - within religion. He finds that ''Time and Eternity'' is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by [[Aldous Huxley]] or [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Maurice. (2012) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hnWXeuZN2MoC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99 A Heart of Wisdom: Religion and Human Wholeness]'' [[SUNY Press]]. pp. 98-100. {{ISBN|9781438403366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has received more positive support however. [[Robert Cummings Neville|Robert C Neville]] called ''Time and Eternity'' “the most sophisticated treatment of eternity and time in our century so far”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Cummings Neville|Neville, Robert Cummings]]. (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bqUYCRhDooAC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236 Eternity and Time's Flow]'', [[SUNY Press]]. pp. 236-237. {{ISBN|9780791415993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Thought: [[A Very Short Introduction]]'', Tim Bayne says the book contains a “classic” discussion of ineffability.&lt;ref&gt;Bayne, Tim. (2013). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jXIo9QLwjh4C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121 Thought: A Very Short Introduction]'' Oxford University Press. p. 121. {{ISBN|9780199601721}}&lt;/ref&gt; American writer Arthur Goldwag has said that the phrase "that than which there is no other" that he encountered in ''Time and Eternity'' was one of a number of factors that contributed to him giving up praying.&lt;ref&gt;Goldwag, Arthur (October 9, 2009) [http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/confession/why-i-dont-pray/ ''Confession: Why I Don't Pray'']. Killing the Buddha magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tony Blair Faith Foundation''' was an [[Interfaith dialog|interfaith]] [[charitable foundation]] established in May 2008 by former British prime minister [[Tony Blair]]. Since December 2016 its work has been continued by the [[Tony Blair Institute for Global Change]].&lt;ref name=G30/&gt;

==Launch==
The Foundation was launched in May 2008 in New York at the headquarters of the media group [[Time Warner]]. In his speech, Blair outlined the Foundation's aim that "idealism becomes the new realism", and that one of its goals was to "counter extremism in all six leading religions" (i.e., according to the Foundation, [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Sikhism]]). Blair said that while in office, he feared being exposed as a "nutter" if he had talked about his religious views. Former US president [[Bill Clinton]] attended the launch, describing Blair as "a good man as well as a great leader". In an interview with [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]], Blair said the Foundation was "how I want to spend the rest of my life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7427809.stm  "BBC News Blair launches faith foundation"], bbc.co.uk. Retrieved 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation listed several goals: "The foundation provides the practical support required to help prevent religious prejudice, conflict and extremism. At school, university and professional level the foundation provides various education programmes. The foundation encouraged interfaith initiatives to tackle global poverty and conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1123243&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=Charity overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation's basic premises, as listed in its initial mission statement, were that 1) faith is important to many, underpinning their systems of thought, their behaviour and the behaviour of many of the world's progressive movements, and that 2) the great religions share values of respect, justice and compassion. But the statement also recognised that faith can be divisive, too; this is viewed by the Foundation as being based on distortions of faith rather than being intrinsic to it.

The aim of the Foundation was to use the tools of modern communication to "educate, inform and develop understanding" about various faiths, and the relationships between them. It aimed to do this in such a way as to address [[Poverty|global poverty]] and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/about-us/mission-statement.html "Tony Blair Faith Foundation: Mission statement"], Tonyblairfaithfoundation.org. Retrieved July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation had several projects: Faith and Globalisation Initiative, Face to Faith (later Generation Global), Faiths Act (an activist group), and Faith Shorts (for short religious films).

===Faith and Globalisation Initiative===
{{main|Faith and Globalisation Initiative}}

Faith and Globalisation Initiative launched in Yale University in September 2008 was an attempt to build a "global conversation" between an "elite group" of universities. As part of this attempt, Blair was to be the [[Howland Memorial Prize|Howland Distinguished Fellow]] at Yale and was one of the professors for the course.&lt;ref name=yale-20080321&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v36.n22/story1.html |title=Tony Blair to teach Yale course on faith and globalization |publisher=Yale Bulletin and Calendar |date=21 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418094320/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v36.n22/story1.html |archivedate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Face to Faith===
Face to Faith was a programme for schoolchildren (12–17 years) which allowed via videoconferencing international interaction where cross-faith discussions may take place. The proclaimed aim was to break down religious and cultural differences and thereby reduce conflict.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/page/about-face-to-faith The Tony Blair Faith Foundation: Face to Faith (Accessed March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faiths Act initiative===
Faiths Act was a project of the Foundation described as an attempt to build a global movement to both "inspire and mobilise" those who believe, in a faith, to address the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The project focused on deaths from [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faithsact.org/about/faiths-act  "Faiths Act"], FaithsAct.org. Retrieved 7 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[Hugh O'Shaughnessy]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that the Foundation "inspires ridicule". He noted that Professor [[Michel Schooyans]] of the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Leuven]] and the [[Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences]] "accused Blair and [[Cherie Blair|his wife]] of supporting a messianic US plan for world domination."&lt;ref name=guardian-20090513&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/13/tony-blair-faith-foundation |title=Tony Blair's Faith Foundation inspires ridicule |author=Hugh O'Shaughnessy |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism's focus was that the Foundation's approach amounted to reducing the religions to the same, predetermined common denominator. This meant "stripping them of their identity". Schooyans arguing that "(t)his project threatens to set us back to an age in which political power was ascribed the mission of promoting a religious confession, or of changing it. In the case of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, this is also a matter of promoting one and only one religious confession, which a universal, global political power would impose on the entire world."&lt;ref name=guardian-20090513/&gt;

The director of the Muslim charity [[Forward Thinking (Charity)|Forward Thinking]], Huda Jawad was reported by the BBC as raising doubts about levels of support from many Muslims for the Foundation, given Blair's foreign-policy record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7994618.stm  "Tony Blair's faith in new mission"], by Christopher Landau, BBC, 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2009, sceptic and secularist [[Richard Dawkins]] mocked the Foundation in a spoof letter, published in the ''[[New Statesman]]''.  In it, Dawkins ridiculed the idea that faith is not a divisive force, and attacked religion's record on promoting dialogue and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/religion/2009/04/tony-blair-faith-children|title=The Tony Blair Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 2008 and April 2009, the foundation raised more than 3.5 million pounds, and paid, according to the ''Daily Telegraph'', six-figure salaries to its top officials. An implied criticism was that these pay scales were in line with much larger charitable organisations. However, the wages were also reported to be the result of external recommendations and a strategy of hiring a small number of capable senior staff to co-ordinate a variety of efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/7229874/Tony-Blairs-faith-charity-pays-six-figure-salaries-to-top-officials.html "Tony Blair's faith charity pays six figure salaries to top officials"], Robert Mendick, ''The Telegraph'', 13 February 2010.

A former editor of a Foundation website, [[Martin Bright]], was critical of the organisation and its style. He mentioned the problems associated with the need to tiptoe around some of Tony Blair's business interests in Kazakhstan, Romania and the Gulf, his advising of the new government of Egypt being "a nightmare", the organisation's use of "ritzy offices in a West End tower block", the employment of a five-people in a communications department "whose sole aim seemed to be to say as little as possible" and the use of unpaid interns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2714316/Inside-Blair-s-lair-Five-spin-doctors-ministerial-red-box-town-hall-meetings-doughnuts-deals-dictators-After-THAT-party-Cherie-former-ex-PM-employee-reveals-really-happens.html |title=Inside Blair's lair |newspaper=Mail on Sunday |date=2 August 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014 |location=London |first=Martin |last=Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-20140803&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/03/tony-blair-faith-foundation-charity-martin-bright-role |title=Tony Blair lambasted by former employee over role in own charity |author=Rowena Mason |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Declaration of Independence''' is the statement adopted by the [[Second Continental Congress]] meeting at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as [[Independence Hall]]) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 4, 1776. The Declaration announced that the [[Thirteen Colonies]] at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain would regard themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states, no longer under British rule. With the Declaration, these new states took a collective first step toward forming the United States of America. The declaration was signed by representatives from [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]].

The [[Lee Resolution]] for independence was passed on July 2 with no opposing votes. The [[Committee of Five]] had drafted the Declaration to be ready when Congress voted on independence. [[John Adams]], a leader in pushing for independence, had persuaded the committee to select [[Thomas Jefferson]] to compose the original draft of the document,&lt;ref name="digitalhistory"&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/active_learning/explorations/revolution/revolution_declaringindependence.cfm "Declaring Independence"], ''Revolutionary War'', Digital History, University of Houston. From Adams' notes: "Why will you not? You ought to do it." "I will not." "Why?" "Reasons enough." "What can be your reasons?" "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." "Well," said Jefferson, "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting."&lt;/ref&gt; which Congress edited to produce the final version. The Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had voted to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Adams wrote to his wife [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]], "The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/archive/doc?id=L17760703jasecond Letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, 3 July 1776]&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– although Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4, the date that the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved.

After ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as the printed [[Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence#Dunlap broadside|Dunlap broadside]] that was widely distributed and read to the public. The source copy used for this printing has been lost and may have been a copy in Thomas Jefferson's hand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boyd (1976), ''The Declaration of Independence: The Mystery of the Lost Original'', p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's original draft is preserved at the [[Library of Congress]], complete with changes made by John Adams and [[Benjamin Franklin]], as well as Jefferson's notes of changes made by Congress.  The best-known version of the Declaration is a signed copy that is displayed at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C., and which is popularly regarded as the official document. This engrossed copy was ordered by Congress on July 19 and signed primarily on August 2.&lt;ref&gt;

The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry. The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and by asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of revolution. Its original purpose was to announce independence, and references to the text of the Declaration were few in the following years. [[Abraham Lincoln]] made it the centerpiece of his policies and his rhetoric, as in the [[Gettysburg Address]] of 1863. Since then, it has become a well-known statement on human rights, particularly its second sentence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been called "one of the best-known sentences in the English language",&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Lucas, "Justifying America: The Declaration of Independence as a Rhetorical Document", in Thomas W. Benson, ed., ''American Rhetoric: Context and Criticism'', Carbondale, Illinois: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; containing "the most potent and consequential words in American history".&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, ''American Creation'', 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Lincoln, who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy and argued that it is a statement of principles through which the [[United States Constitution]] should be interpreted.&lt;ref name="McPherson126"&gt;McPherson, ''Second American Revolution'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration of Independence inspired many similar documents in other countries, the first being the 1789 ''Declaration of Flanders'' issued during the [[Brabant Revolution]] in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. It also served as the primary model for numerous declarations of independence in Europe and Latin America, as well as Africa (Liberia) and Oceania (New Zealand) during the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=David| last=Armitage| title=The Declaration of Independence: A Global History| date=2007| publisher=Harvard University Press| location=Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn=0-674-02282-3| pages=113–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Thomas Jefferson rev.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration]]

{{quote|text=Believe me, dear Sir: there is not in the British empire a man who more cordially loves a union with Great Britain than I do. But, by the God that made me, I will cease to exist before I yield to a connection on such terms as the British Parliament propose; and in this, I think I speak the sentiments of America.|sign=[[Thomas Jefferson]], November 29, 1775&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the time that the Declaration of Independence was adopted in July 1776, the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and Great Britain had been at war for more than a year. Relations had been deteriorating between the colonies and the mother country since 1763.  [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] enacted a series of measures to increase revenue from the colonies, such as the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]] and the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767. Parliament believed that these acts were a legitimate means of having the colonies pay their fair share of the costs to keep them in the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Christie and Labaree, ''Empire or Independence'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many colonists, however, had developed a different conception of the empire. The colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, and colonists argued that Parliament had [[No taxation without representation|no right to levy taxes]] upon them. This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the [[British Constitution]] and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The orthodox British view, dating from the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, was that Parliament was the [[Parliamentary sovereignty|supreme authority]] throughout the empire, and so, by definition, anything that Parliament did was constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 200–02.&lt;/ref&gt; In the colonies, however, the idea had developed that the British Constitution recognized certain [[natural and legal rights|fundamental rights]] that no government could violate, not even Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 180–82.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] jurisdiction in the colonies at all.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating the arrangement of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]],&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt; by 1774 American writers such as [[Samuel Adams]], [[James Wilson]], and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that the colonies, which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 241–42. The writings in question include Wilson's ''Considerations on the Authority of Parliament'' and Jefferson's ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]'' (both 1774), as well as Samuel Adams's 1768 [[Massachusetts Circular Letter|Circular Letter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress convenes===
The issue of Parliament's authority in the colonies became a crisis after Parliament passed the [[Coercive Acts]] (known as the Intolerable Acts in the colonies) in 1774 to punish the colonists for the [[Gaspee Affair]] of 1772 and the [[Boston Tea Party]] of 1773. Many colonists saw the Coercive Acts as a violation of the British Constitution and thus a threat to the liberties of all of [[British America]], so the [[First Continental Congress]] convened in Philadelphia in September 1774 to coordinate a response. Congress organized a [[Continental Association|boycott of British goods]] and [[Petition to the King (1774)|petitioned the king]] for repeal of the acts. These measures were unsuccessful because King George and the ministry of Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] were determined to enforce parliamentary supremacy in America. As the king wrote to North in November 1774, "blows must decide whether they are to be subject to this country or independent".&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 168; Ferling, ''Leap in the Dark'', 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most colonists still hoped for reconciliation with Great Britain, even after fighting began in the [[American Revolutionary War]] at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 13; Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 318.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Continental Congress]] convened at the [[Independence Hall (United States)|Pennsylvania State House]] in Philadelphia in May 1775, and some delegates hoped for eventual independence, but no one yet advocated declaring it.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Many colonists no longer believed that Parliament had any sovereignty over them, yet they still professed loyalty to King George, who they hoped would intercede on their behalf. They were disappointed in late 1775 when the king rejected Congress's [[Olive Branch Petition|second petition]], issued a [[Proclamation of Rebellion]], and announced before Parliament on October 26 that he was considering "friendly offers of foreign assistance" to suppress the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25. The text of the 1775 [[Speech from the Throne|king's speech]] is [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/rbpe:@field(DOCID+@lit(rbpe1440150a)) online], published by the [[American Memory]] project.&lt;/ref&gt; A pro-American minority in Parliament warned that the government was driving the colonists toward independence.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toward independence==
[[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' was published in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined to act as a conciliator.&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''Beginnings of National Politics'', 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating [[republicanism]] as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule.&lt;ref&gt;Christie and Labaree, ''Empire or Independence'', 270; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Common Sense'' made a persuasive and impassioned case for independence, which had not yet been given serious intellectual consideration in the American colonies. Paine connected independence with Protestant beliefs as a means to present a distinctly American political identity, thereby stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss,&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''Beginnings of National Politics'', 89; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after its publication.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Independence Hall Assembly Room.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.90|The Assembly Room in Philadelphia's [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]], where the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence]]

Some colonists still held out hope for reconciliation, but developments in early 1776 further strengthened public support for independence. In February 1776, colonists learned of Parliament's passage of the [[Prohibitory Act]], which established a blockade of American ports and declared American ships to be enemy vessels. [[John Adams]], a strong supporter of independence, believed that Parliament had effectively declared American independence before Congress had been able to. Adams labeled the Prohibitory Act the "Act of Independency", calling it "a compleat&lt;!-- sic --&gt; Dismemberment of the British Empire".&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 209; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Support for declaring independence grew even more when it was confirmed that King George had hired German mercenaries to use against his American subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this growing popular support for independence, Congress lacked the clear authority to declare it. Delegates had been elected to Congress by 13 different governments, which included extralegal conventions, ad hoc committees, and elected assemblies, and they were bound by the instructions given to them. Regardless of their personal opinions, delegates could not vote to declare independence unless their instructions permitted such an action.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Several colonies, in fact, expressly prohibited their delegates from taking any steps towards separation from Great Britain, while other delegations had instructions that were ambiguous on the issue;&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, advocates of independence sought to have the Congressional instructions revised. For Congress to declare independence, a majority of delegations would need authorization to vote for it, and at least one colonial government would need to specifically instruct its delegation to propose a declaration of independence in Congress. Between April and July 1776, a "complex political war"&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; was waged to bring this about.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 671; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revising instructions===
In the campaign to revise Congressional instructions, many Americans formally expressed their support for separation from Great Britain in what were effectively state and local declarations of independence. Historian [[Pauline Maier]] identifies more than ninety such declarations that were issued throughout the Thirteen Colonies from April to July 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 48, and Appendix A, which lists the state and local declarations.&lt;/ref&gt; These "declarations" took a variety of forms. Some were formal written instructions for Congressional delegations, such as the [[Halifax Resolves]] of April 12, with which North Carolina became the first colony to explicitly authorize its delegates to vote for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 678–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Others were legislative acts that officially ended British rule in individual colonies, such as the Rhode Island legislature declaring its independence from Great Britain on May 4, the first colony to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 679; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Many "declarations" were resolutions adopted at town or county meetings that offered support for independence. A few came in the form of jury instructions, such as the statement issued on April 23, 1776, by Chief Justice [[William Henry Drayton]] of South Carolina: "the law of the land authorizes me to declare ... that ''George'' the Third, King of ''Great Britain'' ... has no authority over us, and we owe no obedience to him."&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 69–72, quoted on 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these declarations are now obscure, having been overshadowed by the declaration approved by Congress on July 2, and signed July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 48. The modern scholarly consensus is that the best-known and earliest of the local declarations is most likely inauthentic, the [[Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence]], allegedly adopted in May 1775 (a full year before other local declarations); Maier, ''American Scripture'', 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some colonies held back from endorsing independence. Resistance was centered in the [[middle colonies]] of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.&lt;ref name="Jensen, Founding, 682"&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of independence saw Pennsylvania as the key; if that colony could be converted to the pro-independence cause, it was believed that the others would follow.&lt;ref name="Jensen, Founding, 682"/&gt; On May 1, however, opponents of independence retained control of the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|Pennsylvania Assembly]] in a special election that had focused on the question of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 683.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Congress passed a resolution on May 10 which had been promoted by John Adams and [[Richard Henry Lee]], calling on colonies without a "government sufficient to the [[wikt:exigency|exigencies]] of their affairs" to adopt new governments.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 684; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 37. For the full text of the May 10 resolve, see the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc004109)): ''Journals of the Continental Congress''].&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution passed unanimously, and was even supported by Pennsylvania's [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], the leader of the anti-independence faction in Congress, who believed that it did not apply to his colony.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 684.&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 15 preamble===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=This Day the Congress has passed the most important Resolution, that ever was taken in America.|source=—John Adams, May 15, 1776&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 159. The text of Adams's letter is [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(dg003624)):: online].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As was the custom, Congress appointed a committee to draft a [[preamble]] to explain the purpose of the resolution. John Adams wrote the preamble, which stated that because King George had rejected reconciliation and was hiring foreign mercenaries to use against the colonies, "it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 37; Jensen, ''Founding'', 684. For the full text of the May 15 preamble see the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc004113)) ''Journals of the Continental Congress''].&lt;/ref&gt; Adams's preamble was meant to encourage the overthrow of the governments of Pennsylvania and Maryland, which were still under [[proprietary colony|proprietary]] governance.&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''National Politics'', 96; Jensen, ''Founding'', 684; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress passed the preamble on May 15 after several days of debate, but four of the middle colonies voted against it, and the Maryland delegation walked out in protest.&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''National Politics'', 97; Jensen, ''Founding'', 685.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams regarded his May 15 preamble effectively as an American declaration of independence, although a formal declaration would still have to be made.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lee's resolution===
{{main|Lee Resolution}}
On the same day that Congress passed Adams's radical preamble, the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention]] set the stage for a formal Congressional declaration of independence. On May 15, the Convention instructed Virginia's congressional delegation "to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent States, absolved from all allegiance to, or dependence upon, the Crown or Parliament of Great Britain".&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 18; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 63. The text of the May 15 Virginia resolution is [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/const/const02.htm online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620032827/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/const/const02.htm |date=June 20, 2008 }} at Yale Law School's Avalon Project.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with those instructions, [[Richard Henry Lee]] of Virginia presented a [[Lee Resolution|three-part resolution]] to Congress on June 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{wdl|109}} |author=Jefferson, Thomas |date=July 4, 1776 |title=Declaration of Independence. In Congress, July 4, 1776, a Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress Assembled |work=World Digital Library |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=July 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was seconded by John Adams, calling on Congress to declare independence, form foreign alliances, and prepare a plan of colonial confederation. The part of the resolution relating to declaring independence read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 41; Boyd, ''Evolution'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lee's resolution met with resistance in the ensuing debate. Opponents of the resolution conceded that reconciliation was unlikely with Great Britain, while arguing that declaring independence was premature, and that securing foreign aid should take priority.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 689–90; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the resolution countered that foreign governments would not intervene in an internal British struggle, and so a formal declaration of independence was needed before foreign aid was possible. All Congress needed to do, they insisted, was to "declare a fact which already exists".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 689; Armitage, ''Global History'', 33–34. The quotation is from Jefferson's notes; Boyd, ''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:311.&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates from Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and New York were still not yet authorized to vote for independence, however, and some of them threatened to leave Congress if the resolution were adopted. Congress, therefore, voted on June 10 to postpone further discussion of Lee's resolution for three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 42–43; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, Congress decided that a committee should prepare a document announcing and explaining independence in the event that Lee's resolution was approved when it was brought up again in July.

=== The final push ===
[[File:Writing the Declaration of Independence 1776 cph.3g09904.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|This idealized depiction of (left to right) Franklin, Adams, and Jefferson working on the Declaration was widely reprinted (by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]], 1900).&lt;ref&gt;Dupont and Onuf, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Support for a Congressional declaration of independence was consolidated in the final weeks of June 1776. On June 14, the Connecticut Assembly instructed its delegates to propose independence and, the following day, the legislatures of New Hampshire and Delaware authorized their delegates to declare independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 691–92.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pennsylvania, political struggles ended with the dissolution of the colonial assembly, and a new Conference of Committees under [[Thomas McKean]] authorized Pennsylvania's delegates to declare independence on June 18.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 106–07; Jensen, ''Founding'', 691.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Provincial Congress of New Jersey]] had been governing the province since January 1776; they resolved on June 15 that [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|Royal Governor]] [[William Franklin]] was "an enemy to the liberties of this country" and had him arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 692.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, they chose new delegates to Congress and empowered them to join in a declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 693.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only Maryland and New York had yet to authorize independence towards the end of June. Previously, Maryland's delegates had walked out when the Continental Congress adopted Adams's radical May 15 preamble, and had sent to the [[Annapolis Convention (1774–1776)|Annapolis Convention]] for instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 694.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, the Annapolis Convention rejected Adams's preamble, instructing its delegates to remain against independence. But [[Samuel Chase]] went to Maryland and, thanks to local resolutions in favor of independence, was able to get the Annapolis Convention to change its mind on June 28.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 694–96; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 96; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions. When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8, the [[New York Provincial Congress]] told the delegates to wait.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 118; Jensen, ''Founding'', 698.&lt;/ref&gt; But on June 30, the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached, and would not convene again until July 10. This meant that New York's delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until after Congress had made its decision.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Draft and adoption==
{{main|Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence}}
Political maneuvering was setting the stage for an official declaration of independence even while a document was being written to explain the decision. On June 11, 1776, Congress appointed a "[[Committee of Five]]" to draft a declaration, consisting of [[John Adams]] of Massachusetts, [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Pennsylvania, [[Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia, [[Robert Livingston (1746-1813)|Robert R. Livingston]] of New York, and [[Roger Sherman]] of Connecticut. The committee left no minutes, so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable—although their accounts are frequently cited.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 97–105; Boyd, ''Evolution'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt; What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Jefferson would write the first draft.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee in general, and Jefferson in particular, thought that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally.&lt;ref name="digitalhistory" /&gt; Considering Congress's busy schedule, Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days, and likely wrote the draft quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt; He then consulted the others and made some changes, and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations. The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28, 1776. The title of the document was "A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled."&lt;ref&gt;Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jefferson's+deskdetail.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.90|Portable writing desk that Jefferson used to draft and write the Declaration of Independence]]
Congress ordered that the draft "[[Table (parliamentary)|lie on the table]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 701.&lt;/ref&gt;  For two days, Congress methodically edited Jefferson's primary document, shortening it by a fourth, removing unnecessary wording, and improving sentence structure.&lt;ref name="Ferling (2000), pp. 131–137"/&gt; They removed Jefferson's assertion that Great Britain had forced slavery on the colonies in order to moderate the document and appease persons in Great Britain who supported the Revolution.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Jefferson wrote that Congress had "mangled" his draft version, but the Declaration that was finally produced was "the majestic document that inspired both contemporaries and posterity," in the words of his biographer [[John Ferling]].&lt;ref name="Ferling (2000), pp. 131–137"&gt;[[John E. Ferling]], ''Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and the American Revolution'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513409-4}}. {{OCLC|468591593}}, pp. 131–37&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress tabled the draft of the declaration on Monday, July 1, and resolved itself into a [[Committee of the Whole|committee of the whole]], with [[Benjamin Harrison V|Benjamin Harrison]] of Virginia presiding, and they resumed debate on Lee's resolution of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 181.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] made one last effort to delay the decision, arguing that Congress should not declare independence without first securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the [[Articles of Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 699.&lt;/ref&gt; John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson, restating the case for an immediate declaration.

A vote was taken after a long day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The delegation for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between [[Thomas McKean]] (who voted yes) and [[George Read (signer)|George Read]] (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. [[Edward Rutledge]] of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 182; Jensen, ''Founding'', 700.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Declaration House Graff House.jpg|thumb|upright=0.90|"Declaration House", the boarding house at Market and S. 7th Street where Jefferson wrote the Declaration]]

On July 2, South Carolina reversed its position and voted for independence. In the Pennsylvania delegation, Dickinson and [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] abstained, allowing the delegation to vote three-to-two in favor of independence. The tie in the Delaware delegation was broken by the timely arrival of [[Caesar Rodney]], who voted for independence. The New York delegation abstained once again since they were still not authorized to vote for independence, although they were allowed to do so a week later by the [[New York Provincial Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution of independence had been adopted with twelve affirmative votes and one abstention. With this, the colonies had officially severed political ties with Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Adams predicted in a famous letter, written to his wife on the following day, that July 2 would become a great American holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 703–04.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the vote for independence would be commemorated; he did not foresee that Americans—including himself—would instead celebrate [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] on the date when the announcement of that act was finalized.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am apt to believe that [Independence Day] will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in {{cite book|last=Adams|first=John|title=My Dearest Friend: Letters of Abigail and John Adams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTzX2ROPOCwC|year=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02606-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vTzX2ROPOCwC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22I+am+apt+to+believe%22 125]}}
Adams predicted that the celebration date would be July 2, the date the independence resolution was adopted, rather than July 4, the date the declaration was approved. Though he may have predicted the wrong celebration date, his thoughts were prophetic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After voting in favor of the resolution of independence, Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.

[[File:US-original-Declaration-1776.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|center|The opening of the original printing of the Declaration, printed on July 4, 1776, under Jefferson's supervision. The engrossed copy was made later (shown at the top of this article). Note that the opening lines differ between the two versions.&lt;ref name="journals.psu.edu"&gt;Julian P.

{{Clear}}
There is a distinct change in wording from this original broadside printing of the Declaration and the final official engrossed copy.  The word "unanimous" was inserted as a result of a Congressional resolution passed on July 19, 1776:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved, That the Declaration passed on the 4th, be fairly engrossed on parchment, with the title and stile of "The unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of America," and that the same, when engrossed, be signed by every member of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28jc00538%29%29: Journals of the Continental Congress – FRIDAY, JULY 19, 1776]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian George Billias says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Independence amounted to a new status of interdependence: the United States was now a sovereign nation entitled to the privileges and responsibilities that came with that status.  America thus became a member of the international community, which meant becoming a maker of treaties and alliances, a military ally in diplomacy, and a partner in foreign trade on a more equal basis.&lt;ref&gt;George Billias ''American Constitutionalism Heard Round the World, 1776-1989'' (2011) p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The declaration is not divided into formal sections; but it is often discussed as consisting of five parts: ''introduction'', ''preamble'', ''indictment'' of King George III, ''denunciation'' of the British people, and ''conclusion''.&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_style.html|title=The Stylistic Artistry of the Declaration of Independence|last=Lucas|first=Stephen E.|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

"He has refused his [[Royal assent|Assent to Laws]], the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

"He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

"He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

"He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

"He has [[Legislative session|dissolved]] Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness of his invasions on the rights of the people.

"He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

"He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the [[Plantation Act 1740|Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners]]; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

"He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.

"He has made [[Judicial independence|Judges dependent]] on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

"He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.

"He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

"He has affected to render the Military [[Civilian control of the military|independent of and superior to the Civil Power]].

"He has combined with others to subject us to a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|jurisdiction foreign to our constitution]], and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

"For [[Quartering Acts|quartering]] large bodies of armed troops among us:

"For protecting them, by a [[Kangaroo court|mock Trial]] from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

"For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

"For [[Townshend Acts|imposing Taxes]] on us [[No taxation without representation|without our Consent]]:

"For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of [[Jury trial|Trial by Jury]]:

"For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:

"For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a [[Quebec Act|neighbouring Province]], establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

"For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and [[Massachusetts Government Act|altering fundamentally]] the Forms of our Governments:

"For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

"He has abdicated Government here, by [[Proclamation of Rebellion|declaring]] us out of his Protection and [[Prohibitory Act|waging War]] against us.

"He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

"He is at this time transporting large Armies of [[Hessian (soldier)|foreign Mercenaries]] to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

"He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to [[Impressment|bear Arms against their Country]], to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

"He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

"In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a [[Tyrant]], is unfit to be the ruler of a free people."

==Influences and legal status==
[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|upright=.90|English political philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704)]]

Historians have often sought to identify the sources that most influenced the words and [[political philosophy]] of the Declaration of Independence. By Jefferson's own admission, the Declaration contained no original ideas, but was instead a statement of sentiments widely shared by supporters of the American Revolution. As he explained in 1825:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing, it was intended to be an expression of the American mind, and to give to that expression the proper tone and spirit called for by the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=808&amp;chapter=88496&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=TO HENRY LEE&amp;nbsp;– Thomas Jefferson The Works, vol. 12 (Correspondence and Papers 1816–1826; 1905) |date=May 8, 1825 |publisher=The Online Library of Liberty |accessdate=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jefferson's most immediate sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own draft of the preamble of the [[Constitution of Virginia]], and [[George Mason]]'s draft of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, ''Jefferson the Virginian'', 221; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt; They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Declaration of Rights]], which formally ended the reign of [[James II of England|King James&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 126–28.&lt;/ref&gt; During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights as a model of how to end the reign of an unjust king.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 53–57.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish [[Declaration of Arbroath]] (1320) and the Dutch [[Act of Abjuration]] (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Maier found no evidence that the Dutch Act of Abjuration served as a model for the Declaration, and considers the argument "unpersuasive" (''American Scripture'', p. 264). Armitage discounts the influence of the Scottish and Dutch acts, and writes that neither was called "declarations of independence" until fairly recently (''Global History'', pp. 42–44). For the argument in favor of the influence of the Dutch act, see Stephen E. Lucas, "The 'Plakkaat van Verlatinge': A Neglected Model for the American Declaration of Independence", in Rosemarijn Hofte and Johanna C. Kardux, eds., ''Connecting Cultures: The Netherlands in Five Centuries of Transatlantic Exchange'' (Amsterdam, 1994), 189–207, and Barbara Wolff, "Was the Declaration of Independence Inspired by the Dutch?" University of Wisconsin Madison News, June 29, 1988, http://www.news.wisc.edu/3049 Accessed July 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson wrote that a number of authors exerted a general influence on the words of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; English political theorist [[John Locke]] is usually cited as one of the primary influences, a man whom Jefferson called one of "the three greatest men that have ever lived".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Their works in the physical and moral sciences were instrumental in Jefferson's education and world view.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, historian [[Carl L. Becker]] wrote, "Most Americans had absorbed Locke's works as a kind of political gospel; and the Declaration, in its form, in its phraseology, follows closely certain sentences in Locke's [[Two Treatises of Government|second treatise on government]]."&lt;ref&gt;Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of Locke's influence on the American Revolution has been questioned by some subsequent scholars, however. Historian Ray Forrest Harvey argued in 1937 for the dominant influence of Swiss jurist [[Jean Jacques Burlamaqui]], declaring that Jefferson and Locke were at "two opposite poles" in their political philosophy, as evidenced by Jefferson's use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase "pursuit of happiness" instead of "property".&lt;ref&gt;Ray Forrest Harvey, ''Jean Jacques Burlamaqui: A Liberal Tradition in American Constitutionalism'' (Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 1937), 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars emphasized the influence of [[republicanism]] rather than Locke's [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;A brief, online overview of the classical liberalism vs. republicanism debate is Alec Ewald, [http://www.flowofhistory.org/themes/american_republic/overview.php "The American Republic: 1760–1870" (2004)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517080053/http://www.flowofhistory.org/themes/american_republic/overview.php |date=May 17, 2008 }}.  In a similar vein, historian Robert Middlekauff argues that the political ideas of the independence movement took their origins mainly from the "eighteenth-century [[commonwealthmen]], the radical [[Radical Whigs|Whig]] ideology", which in turn drew on the political thought of [[John Milton]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], and [[John Locke]].  See [[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause'', pp. 3–6, 51–52, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Garry Wills]] argued that Jefferson was influenced by the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], particularly [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], rather than Locke,&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Inventing America'', especially chs. 11–13. Wills concludes (p. 315) that "the air of enlightened America was full of Hutcheson's politics, not Locke's".&lt;/ref&gt; an interpretation that has been strongly criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Hamowy, "Jefferson and the Scottish Enlightenment", argues that Wills gets much wrong (p. 523), that the Declaration seems to be influenced by Hutcheson because Hutcheson was, like Jefferson, influenced by Locke (pp. 508–09), and that Jefferson often wrote of Locke's influence, but never mentioned Hutcheson in any of his writings (p. 514). See also Kenneth S. Lynn, "Falsifying Jefferson", ''Commentary'' 66 (Oct. 1978), 66–71. [[Ralph Luker]], in [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1980/spring/luker-garry-wills/ "Garry Wills and the New Debate Over the Declaration of Independence"] (''The Virginia Quarterly Review'', Spring 1980, 244–61) agreed that Wills overstated Hutcheson's influence to provide a [[communitarian]] reading of the Declaration, but he also argued that Wills's critics similarly read their own views into the document.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal historian John Phillip Reid has written that the emphasis on the political philosophy of the Declaration has been misplaced. The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights, argues Reid, but is instead a legal document—an [[indictment]] against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists.&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, "The Irrelevance of the Declaration", in Hendrik Hartog, ed., ''Law in the American Revolution and the Revolution in the Law'' (New York University Press, 1981), 46–89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]] has argued that the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel's ''[[The Law of Nations]]'', the dominant [[international law]] treatise of the period, and a book that Benjamin Franklin said was "continually in the hands of the members of our Congress".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin to Charles F.W. Dumas, December 19, 1775, in ''The Writings of Benjamin Franklin'', ed. Albert Henry Smyth (New York: 1970), 6:432.&lt;/ref&gt; Armitage writes, "Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood"; therefore, the primary purpose of the Declaration was "to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States". If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers, the American revolutionaries first had to make it clear that they were no longer dependent on Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 21, 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Declaration of Independence does not have the force of law domestically, but nevertheless it may help to provide historical and legal clarity about the Constitution and other laws.&lt;ref&gt;Gulf, C. &amp; SFR Co. v. Ellis, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4471514776465320556 165 US 150] (1897): "While such declaration of principles may not have the force of organic law, or be made the basis of judicial decision as to the limits of right and duty ... it is always safe to read the letter of the Constitution in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Gary.

==Signing==
{{Main|Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence}}
[[File:USA declaration independence.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The signed copy of the Declaration is now badly faded because of poor preserving practices in the 19th century. It is on display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
[[File:Syng inkstand.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|The [[Syng inkstand]] was used at both the signing of the Declaration and the 1787 signing of the U.S. Constitution.]]
The Declaration became official when Congress voted for it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed it has long been the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, "Fourth of July Myths", 242–43.&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1796, signer [[Thomas McKean]] disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 299–302; Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration was transposed on paper, adopted by the Continental Congress, and signed by [[John Hancock]], President of the Congress, on July 4, 1776, according to the 1911 record of events by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] under Secretary [[Philander C. Knox]].&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"&gt;The U.S. State Department (1911), ''The Declaration of Independence, 1776'', pp. 10, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, 1776, a parchment paper copy of the Declaration was signed by 56 persons.&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"/&gt; Many of these signers were not present when the original Declaration was adopted on July 4.&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"/&gt;  Signer [[Matthew Thornton]] from [[New Hampshire]] was seated in the Continental Congress in November; he asked for and received the privilege of adding his signature at that time, and signed on November 4, 1776.&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"/&gt;

[[File:JohnHancocksSignature.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|On July 4, 1776, Continental Congress President [[John Hancock]]'s signature authenticated the United States Declaration of Independence.]]

Historians have generally accepted McKean's version of events, arguing that the famous signed version of the Declaration was created after July 19, and was not signed by Congress until August 2, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, "Fourth of July Myths", 245–46; Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 208–19; Wills, ''Inventing America'', 341.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, legal historian Wilfred Ritz argued that historians had misunderstood the primary documents and given too much credence to McKean, who had not been present in Congress on July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Ritz, "Authentication", 179–200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ritz, about thirty-four delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and the others signed on or after August 2.&lt;ref&gt;Ritz, "Authentication", 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians who reject a July 4 signing maintain that most delegates signed on August 2, and that those eventual signers who were not present added their names later.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 208–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two future U.S. presidents were among the signatories: Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. The most famous signature on the [[engrossed]] copy is that of [[John Hancock]], who presumably signed first as [[President of the Continental Congress|President of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock's large, flamboyant signature became iconic, and the term ''John Hancock'' emerged in the United States as an informal synonym for "signature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/John%20Hancock Merriam-Webster online]; [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/john%20hancock Dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt; A commonly circulated but apocryphal account claims that, after Hancock signed, the delegate from Massachusetts commented, "The British ministry can read that name without spectacles." Another apocryphal report indicates that Hancock proudly declared, "There! I guess King George will be able to read that!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachamericanhistory.org/File/John_Hancock.pdf|title=TeachAmericanHistory.org: John Hancock|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510132936/http://www.teachamericanhistory.org/File/John_Hancock.pdf|archive-date=May 10, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various legends emerged years later about the signing of the Declaration, when the document had become an important national symbol. In one famous story, John Hancock supposedly said that Congress, having signed the Declaration, must now "all hang together", and Benjamin Franklin replied: "Yes, we must indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately." The quotation did not appear in print until more than fifty years after Franklin's death.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, ''Story of the Declaration'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Syng inkstand]] used at the signing was also used at the signing of the United States Constitution in 1787.

==Publication and reaction==

After Congress approved the final wording of the Declaration on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of [[John Dunlap]]. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] for distribution. Before long, it was being read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the 13 states. The first formal public readings of the document took place on July 8, in Philadelphia (by [[John Nixon (financier)|John Nixon]] in the yard of Independence Hall), [[Trenton, New Jersey]], and [[Easton, Pennsylvania]]; the first newspaper to publish it was the ''[[Pennsylvania Evening Post]]'' on July 6.&lt;ref name="Maier156"&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 156.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[German language|German]] translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

President of Congress John Hancock sent a broadside to General [[George Washington]], instructing him to have it proclaimed "at the Head of the Army in the way you shall think it most proper".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington had the Declaration read to his troops in [[New York City]] on July 9, with thousands of British troops on ships in the harbor. Washington and Congress hoped that the Declaration would inspire the soldiers, and encourage others to join the army.&lt;ref name="Maier156"/&gt; After hearing the Declaration, crowds in many cities tore down and destroyed signs or statues representing royal authority. An equestrian statue of King George in New York City was pulled down and the lead used to make musket balls.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 156–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Whipple.jpg|thumb|upright|left=.90|[[William Whipple]], signer of the Declaration of Independence, freed his slave believing that he could not both fight for liberty and own a slave.]]

British officials in North America sent copies of the Declaration to Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in British newspapers beginning in mid-August, it had reached Florence and Warsaw by mid-September, and a German translation appeared in Switzerland by October. The first copy of the Declaration sent to France got lost, and the second copy arrived only in November 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/courses/teachers_corner/34411.html|title=The Declaration of Independence in World Context|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached Portuguese America by Brazilian medical student "Vendek" José Joaquim Maia e Barbalho, who had met with Thomas Jefferson in Nîmes.

The Spanish-American authorities banned the circulation of the Declaration, but it was widely transmitted and translated: by Venezuelan Manuel García de Sena, by Colombian Miguel de Pombo, by Ecuadorian Vicente Rocafuerte, and by New Englanders Richard Cleveland and William Shaler, who distributed the Declaration and the United States Constitution among Creoles in Chile and Indians in Mexico in 1821.&lt;ref name="scholar.harvard.edu"&gt;[http://scholar.harvard.edu/armitage/files/sahj.pdf The Contagion of Sovereignty: Declarations of Independence since 1776]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[North Ministry]] did not give an official answer to the Declaration, but instead secretly commissioned pamphleteer [[John Lind (barrister)|John Lind]] to publish a response entitled ''Answer to the Declaration of the American Congress''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2QCAa27Zy4C&amp;pg=PA75|title=Armitage, ''Global History'', 75.|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Tories denounced the signers of the Declaration for not applying the same principles of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" to African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jessup |first=John J. |title=America and the Future |magazine=Life |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cVAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |page=105 |date=September 20, 1943 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], the former royal governor of Massachusetts, also published a rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;

[[William Whipple]], a signer of the Declaration of Independence who had fought in the war, freed his slave [[Prince Whipple]] because of revolutionary ideals. In the postwar decades, other slaveholders also freed their slaves; from 1790 to 1810, the percentage of free blacks in the Upper South increased to 8.3 percent from less than one percent of the black population.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery, 1619–1877'' (1993), pp. 77–79, 81&lt;/ref&gt; All Northern states abolished slavery by 1804.

==History of the documents==
{{main|Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence}}
The official copy of the Declaration of Independence was the one printed on July 4, 1776, under Jefferson's supervision. It was sent to the states and to the Army and was widely reprinted in newspapers. The slightly different "engrossed copy" (shown at the top of this article) was made later for members to sign. The engrossed version is the one widely distributed in the 21st century.  Note that the opening lines differ between the two versions.&lt;ref name="journals.psu.edu"/&gt;

The copy of the Declaration that was signed by Congress is known as the engrossed or [[parchment]] copy. It was probably engrossed (that is, carefully handwritten) by clerk [[Timothy Matlack]].&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_history.html |title=The Declaration of Independence: A History|work=Charters of Freedom |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A facsimile made in 1823 has become the basis of most modern reproductions rather than the original because of poor conservation of the engrossed copy through the 19th century.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt; In 1921, custody of the engrossed copy of the Declaration was transferred from the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to the [[Library of Congress]], along with the [[United States Constitution]]. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the documents were moved for safekeeping to the [[United States Bullion Depository]] at [[Fort Knox]] in Kentucky, where they were kept until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, ''Story of the Declaration'', 263.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the engrossed Declaration was transferred to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] and is now on permanent display at the National Archives in the "Rotunda for the [[Charters of Freedom]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-kits/charters.html#pressrelaese1 |title=Charters of Freedom Re-encasement Project|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArchivesRotunda.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|The Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom in the National Archives building]]

The document signed by Congress and enshrined in the National Archives is usually regarded as ''the'' Declaration of Independence, but historian [[Julian P. Boyd]] argued that the Declaration, like [[Magna Carta]], is not a single document. Boyd considered the printed broadsides ordered by Congress to be official texts, as well. The Declaration was first published as a broadside that was printed the night of July 4 by [[John Dunlap]] of Philadelphia. Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides, of which 26 are known to survive. The 26th copy was discovered in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] in England in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Rare copy of United States Declaration of Independence found in Kew |first= |last= |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5727812/Rare-copy-of-United-States-Declaration-of-Independence-found-in-Kew.html |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |date=July 3, 2009 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1777, Congress commissioned [[Mary Katherine Goddard]] to print [[:File:File-Goddard_broadside.jpg|a new broadside]] that listed the signers of the Declaration, unlike the Dunlap broadside.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dube /&gt; Nine copies of the Goddard broadside are known to still exist.&lt;ref name=Dube&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/dube/inde2.htm |title=The Declaration of Independence |author=Ann Marie Dube |date=May 1996 |work=A Multitude of Amendments, Alterations and Additions: The Writing and Publicizing of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution of the United States |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of broadsides printed by the states are also extant.&lt;ref name=Dube /&gt;

Several early handwritten copies and drafts of the Declaration have also been preserved. Jefferson kept a four-page draft that late in life he called the "original Rough draught".&lt;ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446"&gt;Boyd, "Lost Original", 446.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how many drafts Jefferson wrote prior to this one, and how much of the text was contributed by other committee members. In 1947, Boyd discovered a fragment of an earlier draft in Jefferson's handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:421.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson and Adams sent copies of the rough draft to friends, with slight variations.

During the writing process, Jefferson showed the rough draft to Adams and Franklin, and perhaps to other members of the drafting committee,&lt;ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446"/&gt; who made a few more changes. Franklin, for example, may have been responsible for changing Jefferson's original phrase "We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable" to "We hold these truths to be self-evident".&lt;ref&gt;Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 142 note 1. Boyd (''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:427–28) casts doubt on Becker's belief that the change was made by Franklin.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson incorporated these changes into a copy that was submitted to Congress in the name of the committee.&lt;ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446"/&gt; The copy that was submitted to Congress on June 28 has been lost and was perhaps destroyed in the printing process,&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, "Lost Original", 448–50. Boyd argued that, if a document was signed on July 4 (which he thought unlikely), it would have been the Fair Copy, and probably would have been signed only by Hancock and Thomson.&lt;/ref&gt; or destroyed during the debates in accordance with [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Record of proceedings|Congress's secrecy rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritz, "From the ''Here''", speculates that the Fair Copy was immediately sent to the printer so that copies could be made for each member of Congress to consult during the debate. All of these copies were then destroyed, theorizes Ritz, to preserve secrecy.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2017, it was announced that a second engrossed copy had been discovered in the archives at [[West Sussex County Council]] in [[Chichester]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-sussex-44703928/declaration-of-independence-found-in-chichester-archives |title=Declaration of Independence document found |website=BBC News |author=|date= 4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Named by its finders the "Sussex Declaration", it differs from the National Archives copy (which the finders refer to as the "Matlack Declaration") in that the signatures on it are not grouped by States.  How it came to be in England is not yet known, but the finders believe that the randomness of the signatures points to an origin with signatory [[James Wilson]], who had argued strongly that the Declaration was made not by the States but by the whole people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/21/declaration-of-independence-sussex-england-rare|last=Yuhas|first=Alan|title=Rare parchment copy of US Declaration of Independence found in England|work=The Guardian|date=April 22, 2017|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://declaration.fas.harvard.edu/resources/sussex-dec|title=The Sussex Declaration|work=Declaration Resources Project|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Declaration was given little attention in the years immediately following the American Revolution, having served its original purpose in announcing the independence of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 87–88; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 162, 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Early celebrations of [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] largely ignored the Declaration, as did early histories of the Revolution. The ''act'' of declaring independence was considered important, whereas the ''text'' announcing that act attracted little attention.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 178–79; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration was rarely mentioned during the debates about the [[United States Constitution]], and its language was not incorporated into that document.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; George Mason's draft of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] was more influential, and its language was echoed in state constitutions and state bills of rights more often than Jefferson's words.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 90; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 165–67.&lt;/ref&gt; "In none of these documents", wrote Pauline Maier, "is there any evidence whatsoever that the Declaration of Independence lived in men's minds as a classic statement of American political principles."&lt;ref name="Maier167"&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence in other countries===
Many leaders of the [[French Revolution]] admired the Declaration of Independence&lt;ref name="Maier167"/&gt; but were also interested in the new American state constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration and content of the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] (1789) emerged largely from the ideals of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Georges Lefebvre|title=The Coming of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4EYuia7buUC&amp;pg=PA212|year=2005|publisher=Princeton UP|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its key drafts were prepared by [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], working closely in Paris with his friend Thomas Jefferson.  It also borrowed language from [[George Mason]]'s [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Athan Billias, ed.|title=American Constitutionalism Heard Round the World, 1776–1989: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WV0nP5n_AoC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2009|publisher=NYU Press|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Dunn, ''Sister Revolutions: French Lightning, American Light'' (1999) pp. 143–45&lt;/ref&gt;  The declaration also influenced [[Russia in the American Revolutionary War#Russia and the Declaration of Independence|the Russian Empire]].  The document had a particular impact on the [[Decembrist revolt]] and other Russian thinkers.

According to historian [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]], the Declaration of Independence did prove to be internationally influential, but not as a statement of human rights. Armitage argued that the Declaration was the first in a new genre of [[Declaration of independence|declarations of independence]] that announced the creation of new states.

Other French leaders were directly influenced by the text of the Declaration of Independence itself. The ''Manifesto of the Province of Flanders'' (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration;&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 113.&lt;/ref&gt; others include the [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence]] (1811), the [[Liberian Declaration of Independence]] (1847), the declarations of secession by the [[Confederate States of America]] (1860–61), and the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence]] (1945).&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 120–35.&lt;/ref&gt; These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 104, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries have used the Declaration as inspiration or have directly copied sections from it. These include the Haitian declaration of January 1, 1804, during the [[Haitian Revolution]], the [[United Provinces of New Granada]] in 1811, the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]] in 1816, the [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] in 1818, [[Costa Rica]] in 1821, [[El Salvador]] in 1821, [[Guatemala]] in 1821, [[Honduras]] in (1821), [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|Mexico in 1821]], [[Nicaragua]] in 1821, [[Peru]] in 1821, [[Bolivian War of Independence]] in 1825, [[Uruguay]] in 1825, [[Ecuador]] in 1830, [[Colombia]] in 1831, [[Paraguay]] in 1842, [[Dominican Republic]] in 1844, [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] in March 1836, [[California Republic]] in November 1836, [[Hungarian Declaration of Independence]] in 1849, [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand]] in 1835, and the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]] from 1918 drafted in Washington D.C. with [[Gutzon Borglum]] among the drafters. The [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Rhodesian declaration of independence]], ratified in November 1965, is based on the American one as well; however, it omits the phrases "[[all men are created equal]]" and "[[Consent of the governed|the consent of the governed]]".&lt;ref name="scholar.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Revival of interest===
Interest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s with the emergence of the United States's [[First Party System|first political parties]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1780s, few Americans knew or cared who wrote the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 172, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; But in the next decade, [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]] sought political advantage over their rival [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 179; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 168–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress, with Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, was more important than the document announcing it.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 180–84; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 171.&lt;/ref&gt; But this view faded away, like the Federalist Party itself, and, before long, the act of declaring independence became synonymous with the document.

A less partisan appreciation for the Declaration emerged in the years following the [[War of 1812]], thanks to a growing American nationalism and a renewed interest in the history of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 571–72; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175–78.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1817, Congress commissioned [[John Trumbull]]'s [[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|famous painting]] of the signers, which was exhibited to large crowds before being installed in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 572; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commemorative printings of the Declaration also appeared at this time, offering many Americans their first view of the signed document.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 572; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175–76; Wills, ''Inventing America'', 324. See also John C. Fitzpatrick, ''Spirit of the Revolution'' (Boston 1924).&lt;/ref&gt; Collective biographies of the signers were first published in the 1820s,&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 176.&lt;/ref&gt; giving birth to what Garry Wills called the "cult of the signers".&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Inventing America'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, many stories about the writing and signing of the document were published for the first time.

When interest in the Declaration was revived, the sections that were most important in 1776 were no longer relevant: the announcement of the independence of the United States and the grievances against King George. But the second paragraph was applicable long after the war had ended, with its talk of self-evident truths and unalienable rights.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, "Global History", 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] lacked sweeping statements about rights and equality, and advocates of groups with grievances turned to the Declaration for support.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1820s, variations of the Declaration were issued to proclaim the rights of workers, farmers, women, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 197. See also Philip S. Foner, ed., ''We, the Other People: Alternative Declarations of Independence by Labor Groups, Farmers, Woman's Rights Advocates, Socialists, and Blacks, 1829–1975'' (Urbana 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, for example, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] of women's rights advocates [[Declaration of Sentiments|declared]] that "all men and women are created equal".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 197; Armitage, ''Global History'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Trumbull's ''Declaration of Independence'' (1817–1826)===
{{main|Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)}}
[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|alt=About 50 men, most of them seated, are in a large meeting room. Most are focused on the five men standing in the center of the room. The tallest of the five is laying a document on a table.|[[John Trumbull]]'s [[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|famous painting]] is often identified as a depiction of the signing of the Declaration, but it actually shows the drafting committee presenting its work to the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Inventing America'', 348.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[John Trumbull]]'s painting ''Declaration of Independence'' has played a significant role in popular conceptions of the Declaration of Independence. The painting is {{convert|12|by|18|ft|adj=on}} in size and was commissioned by the [[United States Congress]] in 1817; it has hung in the [[United States Capitol Rotunda]] since 1826. It is sometimes described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but it actually shows the [[Committee of Five]] presenting their draft of the Declaration to the [[Second Continental Congress]] on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.&lt;ref&gt;John Hazelton, The Historical Value of Trumbull's – Declaration of Independence, [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA30&amp;id=tv47AAAAIAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography – Volume 31], (Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1907), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trumbull painted the figures from life whenever possible, but some had died and images could not be located; hence, the painting does not include all the signers of the Declaration. One figure had participated in the drafting but did not sign the final document; another refused to sign. In fact, the membership of the Second Continental Congress changed as time passed, and the figures in the painting were never in the same room at the same time. It is, however, an accurate depiction of the room in [[Independence Hall]], the centerpiece of the [[Independence National Historical Park]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

Trumbull's painting has been depicted multiple times on U.S. currency and postage stamps. Its first use was on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] side of the $100 [[National Bank Note]] issued in 1863. A few years later, the [[steel engraving]] used in printing the bank notes was used to produce a 24-cent stamp, issued as part of the [[1869 Pictorial Issue]]. An engraving of the signing scene has been featured on the reverse side of the [[United States two-dollar bill]] since 1976.

===Slavery and the Declaration===
{{further |Slavery in the colonial United States}}
The apparent contradiction between the claim that "all men are created equal" and the existence of [[Slavery in the United States|American slavery]] attracted comment when the Declaration was first published. As mentioned above, Jefferson had included a paragraph in his initial draft that strongly indicted Great Britain's role in the slave trade, but this was deleted from the final version.&lt;ref name="MaierAmerican"&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 146–50.&lt;/ref&gt;   Jefferson himself was a prominent [[Virginia]] slave holder, having owned hundreds of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1969), ''Thomas Jefferson and the Problem of Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to this seeming contradiction, English abolitionist [[Thomas Day]] wrote in a 1776 letter, "If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves."&lt;ref&gt;(1) [https://books.google.com/books?id=X2QCAa27Zy4C&amp;pg=PA77 Armitage, ''Global History'', 77.]&lt;br /&gt;(2) {{cite book|last=Day|first=Thomas|url=https://archive.org/stream/fragmentoforigin00dayt#page/10/mode/2up|title=Fragment of an original letter on the Slavery of the Negroes, written in the year 1776|work=London: Printed for John Stockdale (1784).

In the 19th century, the Declaration took on a special significance for the abolitionist movement. Historian [[Bertram Wyatt-Brown]] wrote that "abolitionists tended to interpret the Declaration of Independence as a theological as well as a political document".&lt;ref name=WB287&gt;Wyatt-Brown, ''Lewis Tappan'', 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Abolitionist leaders [[Benjamin Lundy]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] adopted the "twin rocks" of "the Bible and the Declaration of Independence" as the basis for their philosophies. "As long as there remains a single copy of the Declaration of Independence, or of the Bible, in our land," wrote Garrison, "we will not despair."&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, ''All on Fire'', 53, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; For radical abolitionists such as Garrison, the most important part of the Declaration was its assertion of the [[right of revolution]]. Garrison called for the destruction of the government under the Constitution, and the creation of a new state dedicated to the principles of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 198–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial question of whether to add additional [[slave state]]s to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration took place during the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri controversy]] of 1819 to 1821.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 598.&lt;/ref&gt; Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave states should not be added to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 604.&lt;/ref&gt; Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator [[Nathaniel Macon]] of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was not a part of the Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 605.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the antislavery movement gaining momentum, defenders of slavery such as [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] and [[John C. Calhoun]] found it necessary to argue that the Declaration's assertion that "all men are created equal" was false, or at least that it did not apply to black people.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 199; Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 246.&lt;/ref&gt; During the debate over the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] in 1853, for example, Senator [[John Pettit]] of Indiana argued that the statement "all men are created equal" was not a "self-evident truth" but a "self-evident lie".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, including [[Salmon P. Chase]] and [[Benjamin Wade]], defended the Declaration and what they saw as its antislavery principles.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 200–01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lincoln and the Declaration===
[[File:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb |upright=0.90|right|Congressman [[Abraham Lincoln]],&lt;br /&gt; 1845–1846]]
The Declaration's relationship to slavery was taken up in 1854 by [[Abraham Lincoln]], a little-known former Congressman who idolized the Founding Fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 201–02.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln thought that the Declaration of Independence expressed the highest principles of the American Revolution, and that the Founding Fathers had tolerated slavery with the expectation that it would ultimately wither away.&lt;ref name="McPherson126"/&gt; For the United States to legitimize the expansion of slavery in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, thought Lincoln, was to repudiate the principles of the Revolution. In his October 1854 [[Abraham Lincoln Peoria speech|Peoria speech]], Lincoln said:

{{quote|Nearly eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave others is a "sacred right of self-government".… Our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust.…  Let us repurify it. Let us re-adopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it, the practices, and policy, which harmonize with it.… If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union: but we shall have saved it, as to make, and keep it, forever worthy of the saving.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Second American Revolution'', 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The meaning of the Declaration was a recurring topic in the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|famed debates]] between Lincoln and [[Stephen Douglas]] in 1858. Douglas argued that the phrase "all men are created equal" in the Declaration referred to white men only. The purpose of the Declaration, he said, had simply been to justify the independence of the United States, and not to proclaim the equality of any "inferior or degraded race".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln, however, thought that the language of the Declaration was deliberately universal, setting a high moral standard to which the American republic should aspire. "I had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men everywhere," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 204–05.&lt;/ref&gt; During the seventh and last joint debate with Steven Douglas at Alton, Illinois on October 15, 1858, Lincoln said about the declaration:

{{quote|I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men, but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all men were equal in color, size, intellect, moral development, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness in what they did consider all men created equal—equal in "certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." This they said, and this they meant. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality, or yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit. They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all, constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even, though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865): Political Debates Between Lincoln and Douglas 1897 |page=415 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/251/pages/page415.html |publisher=Bartleby |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Pauline Maier, Douglas's interpretation was more historically accurate, but Lincoln's view ultimately prevailed. "In Lincoln's hands," wrote Maier, "the Declaration of Independence became first and foremost a living document" with "a set of goals to be realized over time".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote=[T]here is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man.|source=—Abraham Lincoln, 1858&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 100.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like [[Daniel Webster]], [[James Wilson]], and [[Joseph Story]] before him, Lincoln argued that the Declaration of Independence was a founding document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified more than a decade after the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 129–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution did not use the word "equality", yet Lincoln believed that the concept that "all men are created equal" remained a part of the nation's founding principles.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 145.&lt;/ref&gt; He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 [[Gettysburg Address]]: "Four score and seven years ago [i.e. in 1776] our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."

Lincoln's [[Declarationism|view of the Declaration]] became influential, seeing it as a moral guide to interpreting the Constitution. "For most people now," wrote Garry Wills in 1992, "the Declaration means what Lincoln told us it means, as a way of correcting the Constitution itself without overthrowing it."&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Admirers of Lincoln such as [[Harry V. Jaffa]] praised this development. Critics of Lincoln, notably [[Willmoore Kendall]] and [[Mel Bradford]], argued that Lincoln dangerously expanded the scope of the national government and violated [[states' rights]] by reading the Declaration into the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 39, 145–46. See also Harry V. Jaffa, ''Crisis of the House Divided'' (1959) and ''A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War'' (2000); Willmoore Kendall and George W. Carey, ''The Basic Symbols of the American Political Tradition'' (1970); and M.E. Bradford, "The Heresy of Equality: A Reply to Harry Jaffa" (1976), reprinted in ''A Better Guide than Reason'' (1979) and ''Modern Age, the First Twenty-five Years'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's suffrage and the Declaration===
[[File:ElizabethCadyStanton-1848-Daniel-Henry.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb |right |Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her two sons (1848).]]

In July 1848, the first woman's rights convention, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], was held in [[Seneca Falls (hamlet), New York|Seneca Falls]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  The convention was organized by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Lucretia Mott]], Mary Ann McClintock, and Jane Hunt. In their "[[Declaration of Sentiments]]", patterned on the Declaration of Independence, the convention members demanded social and political equality for women. Their motto was that "All men ''and women'' are created equal" and the convention demanded [[suffrage]] for women.  The suffrage movement was supported by [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Frederick Douglass]].&lt;ref&gt;Norton, et al (2010), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/senecafalls.html|title=Modern History Sourcebook: Seneca Falls: The Declaration of Sentiments, 1848|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century and later===
The Declaration was chosen to be the first digitized text (1971).&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Alison| last=Flood |work=The Guardian |title=Michael Hart, inventor of the ebook, dies aged 64 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/08/michael-hart-inventor-ebook-dies |date=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence]] was dedicated in 1984 in [[Constitution Gardens]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where the signatures of all the original signers are carved in stone with their names, places of residence, and occupations.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}

The '''Wheel of time''' or '''wheel of history''' (also known as ''[[Kalachakra]]'') is a concept found in several religious traditions and philosophies, notably religions of Indian origin such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Buddhism]], which regard time as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]] and consisting of repeating ages.  Many other cultures contain belief in a similar concept: notably, the Q'ero Indians in [[Peru]], as well as the Hopi Indians of Arizona.

==Buddhism==
{{See also|Kalachakra}}
The [[Kalachakra|Wheel of Time]] or Kalachakra is a [[Tantra|Tantric]] deity that is associated with [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Tantric Buddhism]], which encompasses all four main schools of [[Sakya]], [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Gelug]], and is especially important within the lesser-known [[Jonang]] tradition.

The Kalachakra tantra prophesies a world within which (religious) conflict is prevalent. A worldwide war will be waged which will see the expansion of the mystical Kingdom of [[Shambhala]] led by a messianic king.

==Ancient Rome==
The philosopher and emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] saw time as extending forwards to infinity and backwards to infinity, while admitting the possibility (without arguing the case) that "the administration of the universe is organized into a succession of finite periods".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius. ''Meditations'', book 5, paragraph 13. {{ISBN|978-0-19-957320-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==

===Literature===
In an interview included with the [[audiobook]] editions of his novels, author [[Robert Jordan]] has stated that his bestselling fantasy series ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' borrows the titular concept from Hindu mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Jordan chats about his 'Wheel of Time' series|url=http://www.cnn.com/chat/transcripts/2000/12/12/jordan/|website=CNN|publisher=CNN|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Several episodes of the American TV series ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'' feature a wheel which can be physically turned in order to manipulate space and time. In a series of episodes during the fifth season, the island on which the show takes place begins to skip violently back and forth through time after the wheel is pulled off its axis.

[[File:Baldung Hexen 1508 kol.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|''Witches'' by [[Hans Baldung]]. Woodcut, 1508]]
'''Witchcraft''' or '''witchery''' broadly means the practice of and belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups. ''Witchcraft'' is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus can be difficult to define with precision,&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LsjagvvkveEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=witchcraft+definition&amp;ots=aw4oz13kOS&amp;sig=2CWBjLB2TIsUt1aNz_nyUPxOf5E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=witchcraft%20definition&amp;f=false Witchcraft in the Middle Ages], Jeffrey Russell, p.4-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cross-cultural]] assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious [[divination|divinatory]] or medicinal role,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and is often present within societies and groups whose [[cultural framework]] includes a magical [[world view]].&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:John William Waterhouse - Magic Circle.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Magic Circle (Waterhouse painting)|The Magic Circle]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1886]]

The concept of witchcraft and the belief in its existence have persisted throughout recorded history. They have been present or central at various times and in many diverse forms among cultures and religions worldwide, including both "primitive" and "highly advanced" cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001, p xiii: ''"Magic is central not only in 'primitive' societies but in 'high cultural' societies as well"''&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to have an important role in many cultures today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Scientifically, the existence of magical powers and witchcraft are generally believed to [[pseudoscience|lack credence]] and to be unsupported by high-quality [[scientific method|experimental testing]], although individual witchcraft practices [[Medical explanations of bewitchment|and effects]] may be open to [[scientific knowledge|scientific explanation]] or explained via [[mentalism]] and [[Psychological theories of magic|psychology]].

Historically, the [[Christian views on magic|predominant concept of witchcraft in the Western world]] derives from [[Old Testament]] [[biblical law|laws]] against witchcraft, and entered the mainstream when belief in witchcraft gained Church approval in the [[Early Modern Period]]. It posits a [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] [[conflict between good and evil]], where witchcraft was generally [[evil]] and often associated with [[Devil in Christianity|the Devil]] and [[Devil worship]]. This culminated in deaths, [[torture]] and [[scapegoating]] (casting blame for human misfortune),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Burton Russell |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646051/witchcraft |title=Witchcraft – Encyclopædia Britannica |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; and many years of large scale [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch-trials]] and [[witch-hunting|witch hunts]], especially in [[Protestant]] Europe, before largely ceasing during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Christian views in the modern day are diverse and cover the gamut of views from intense belief and opposition (especially from Christian [[fundamentalist]]s) to non-belief, and in some churches even approval. From the mid-20th century, witchcraft – sometimes called contemporary witchcraft to clearly distinguish it from older beliefs – became the name of a branch of [[modern paganism]].  It is most notably practiced in the [[Wiccan]] and modern witchcraft traditions, and no longer practices in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]] (1979) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''. Boston: Beacon Press. pp. 45–47, 84–5, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western mainstream Christian view is far from the only societal perspective about witchcraft. Many cultures worldwide continue to have widespread practices and cultural beliefs that are loosely translated into English as "witchcraft", although the English translation masks a very great diversity in their forms, magical beliefs, practices, and place in their societies. During the [[History of colonialism|Age of Colonialism]], many cultures across the globe were exposed to the modern Western world via [[colonialism]], usually accompanied and often preceded by intensive [[Christianity and colonialism|Christian missionary activity]] ''(see "[[Christianization#Colonial era (16th−19th centuries)|Christianization]]")''. Beliefs related to witchcraft and magic in these cultures were at times influenced by the prevailing Western concepts. Witch hunts, scapegoating, and killing or shunning of suspected witches still occurs in the modern era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pearlman |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/papuanewguinea/9987294/Papua-New-Guinea-urged-to-halt-witchcraft-violence-after-latest-sorcery-case.html |title=Papua New Guinea urged to halt witchcraft violence after latest 'sorcery' case |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with killings both of victims [[Murder for body parts#Medicine murder|for their supposedly magical body parts]], and of suspected witchcraft practitioners.

Suspicion of modern medicine due to beliefs about illness being due to witchcraft also continues in many countries to this day, with tragic [[healthcare]] consequences. [[HIV/AIDS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV in Africa: Distinguishing disease from witchcraft |date=18 February 2008 |work=thestar.com |url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/columnists/2008/02/18/hiv_in_africa_distinguishing_disease_from_witchcraft.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ebola virus disease]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28625305 Ebola outbreak: 'Witchcraft' hampering treatment, says doctor], BBC News, 2 August 2014, citing a doctor from [[Médecins Sans Frontières]]: ''"A widespread belief in witchcraft is hampering efforts to halt the Ebola virus from spreading"''&lt;/ref&gt; are two examples of often-lethal [[infectious disease]] [[epidemic]]s whose medical care and [[Isolation (health care)|containment]] has been severely hampered by regional beliefs in witchcraft.

== Etymology and definitions ==
{{Further information|Witch (word)}}
The word ''witch'' is of uncertain origin. There are numerous etymologies that it could be derived from. One popular belief is that it is "related to the English words wit, wise, wisdom [Germanic root *weit-, *wait-, *wit-; Indo-European root *weid-, *woid-, *wid-]," so "craft of the wise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12416396|title=Power in the Name: The Origin and Meaning of the Word &amp;quot;Witch&amp;quot;|first=Michael|last=Dilts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is from the [[Old English]] wiccecræft, a compound of "wicce" ("witch") and "cræft" ("craft").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Douglas|title=witchcraft (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=witchcraft&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology|anthropological]] terminology, witches differ from sorcerers in that they don't use physical tools or actions to curse; their [[maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]] is perceived as extending from some intangible inner quality, and one may be unaware of  being a witch, or may have been convinced of his/her nature by the suggestion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Cohn |title=Europe's Inner Demons |pages=176–9 |date=1975 |isbn=978-0-465-02131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was pioneered in a study of central African magical beliefs by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], who cautioned that it might not correspond with normal English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans-Pritchard |first=Edward Evan |title=Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande |date=1937 |pages=8–9 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-874029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of European witchcraft have found the anthropological definition difficult to apply to European witchcraft, where witches could equally use (or be accused of using) physical techniques, as well as some who really had attempted to cause harm by thought alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) |date=1997 |title=Religion and the Decline of Magic |pages=464–5 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-297-00220-8}}; Ankarloo, Bengt and Henningsen, Gustav (1990) ''Early Modern European Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; European witchcraft is seen by historians and anthropologists as an [[ideology]] for explaining misfortune; however, this ideology has manifested in diverse ways, as described below.&lt;ref name="Pocs"&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 9–10. The first three categories were proposed by [[Richard Kieckhefer]], the fourth added by Christina Larner.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Alleged practices ===
[[File:A Witch.jpg|thumb|''A Witch'', 1902, by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
Historically the witchcraft label has been applied to practices people believe influence the mind, body, or property of others against their will—or practices that the person doing the labeling believes undermine social or religious order. Some modern commentators{{who|date=April 2011}} believe the malefic nature of witchcraft is a Christian projection. The concept of a magic-worker influencing another person's body or property against their will was clearly present in many cultures, as traditions in both folk magic and religious magic have the purpose of countering malicious magic or identifying malicious magic users. Many examples appear in early texts, such as those from [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]]. Malicious magic users can become a credible cause for disease, sickness in animals, bad luck, sudden death, impotence and other such misfortunes. Witchcraft of a more benign and socially acceptable sort may then be employed to turn the malevolence aside, or identify the supposed evil-doer so that punishment may be carried out. The folk magic used to identify or protect against malicious magic users is often indistinguishable from that used by the witches themselves.

{{quote|It is argued here that the medical arts played a significant and sometimes pivotal role in the witchcraft controversies of seventeenth century New England. Not only were physicians and surgeons the principal professional arbiters for determining natural versus preternatural signs and symptoms of disease, they occupied key legislative, judicial, and ministerial roles relating to witchcraft proceedings. Forty six male physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries are named in court transcripts or other contemporary source materials relating to New England witchcraft. These practitioners served on coroners' inquests, performed autopsies, took testimony, issued writs, wrote letters, or committed people to prison, in addition to diagnosing and treating patients. Some practitioners are simply mentioned in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Gevitz, N. ""The Devil Hath Laughed at the Physicians": Witchcraft and Medical Practice in Seventeenth-Century New England." Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, vol. 55 no. 1, 2000, pp. 5–36. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/15172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There has also existed in popular belief the concept of [[white witch]]es and white witchcraft, which is strictly benevolent. Many neopagan witches strongly identify with this concept, and profess [[ethical code]]s that prevent them from performing magic on a person without their request.

Where belief in malicious magic practices exists, such practitioners are typically forbidden by law as well as hated and feared by the general populace, while beneficial magic is tolerated or even accepted wholesale by the people&amp;nbsp;– even if the orthodox establishment opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QqPbJQkSo8EC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=alleged+practices+witchcraft#v=onepage&amp;q=alleged%20practices%20witchcraft&amp;f=false|title=Witches, Druids and King Arthur|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|date=2006-09-15|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781852855550|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spell casting ====
{{See also|Magic (paranormal)}}

Probably the most widely known characteristic of a witch was the ability to cast a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]], "spell" being the word used to signify the means employed to carry out a magical action. A spell could consist of a set of words, a formula or verse, or a ritual action, or any combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary, the Compact Edition'', Oxford University Press, p. 2955, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Spells traditionally were cast by many methods, such as by the inscription of [[runes]] or [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] on an object to give it magical powers; by the immolation or binding of a wax or clay image ([[poppet]]) of a person to affect him or her magically; by the recitation of [[incantation]]s; by the performance of physical [[ritual]]s; by the employment of magical [[herb]]s as amulets or [[potion]]s; by gazing at mirrors, swords or other specula ([[scrying]]) for purposes of divination; and by many other means.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, see [[Georg Luck|Luck, Georg]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds; a Collection of Ancient Texts'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006; also Kittredge, G. L., ''Witchcraft in Old and New England'', New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1929, 1957, 1958; and Davies, Owen, ''Witchcraft, Magic and Culture, 1736–1951'', Manchester University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necromancy (conjuring the dead) ====
Strictly speaking, "[[necromancy]]" is the practice of conjuring the spirits of the dead for [[divination]] or [[prophecy]]&amp;nbsp;– although the term has also been applied to raising the dead for other purposes. The biblical [[Witch of Endor]] performed it (1 Sam. 28), and it is among the witchcraft practices condemned by [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]:&lt;ref&gt;

==== Demonology ====
{{main article|Demonology}}
In [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], sorcery came to be associated with [[heresy]] and [[apostasy]] and to be viewed as evil. Among the [[Catholics]], Protestants, and [[secular]] leadership of the [[Europe]]an Late [[Medieval]]/[[Early Modern]] period, fears about witchcraft rose to fever pitch and sometimes led to large-scale [[witch-hunt]]s. The key century was the fifteenth, which saw a dramatic rise in awareness and terror of witchcraft, culminating in the publication of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' but prepared by such fanatical popular preachers as Bernardino of Siena.&lt;ref&gt;For this dramatic rise in witchcraft consciousness during the fifteenth century and Bernardino's critical role in it, see Chapter 2 (pp. 52–108) Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-53854-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this time, it was increasingly believed that Christianity was engaged in an apocalyptic battle against the Devil and his secret army of witches, who had entered into a [[Deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]]. In total, tens or hundreds of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men.&lt;ref name="gibbons"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco:Pandora. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In early modern [[Scots_language|Scots]], the word [[Warlock]] came to be used as the male equivalent of [[witch (word)|witch]] (which can be male or female, but is used predominantly for females).&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, F. Marian, ''The Silver Bough: A Four Volume Study of the National and Local Festivals of Scotland'', Glasgow: William Maclellan,1957, vol 1; also Chambers, Robert, ''Domestic Annals of Scotland'', Edinburgh: 1861, and Sinclair, George, ''Satan's Invisible World Discovered'', Edinburgh, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; From this use, the word passed into [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literature and ultimately 20th-century [[Warlock (disambiguation)|popular culture]]. Accusations of witchcraft were often combined with other charges of heresy against such groups as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]].

The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]],'' (Latin for "Hammer of The Witches") was a witch-hunting manual written in 1486 by two German monks, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. It was used by both Catholics and Protestants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0IAjBexFTgC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;f=false |title=The Emergence of Modern Europe: C. 1500 to 1788|publisher= Britannica Educational Publishing |page=27 |accessdate=2013-06-29|isbn=9781615303434 |date=2011-01-15 |editor-last1= Campbell|editor-first1=Heather M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for several hundred years, outlining how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female. The book became the handbook for secular courts throughout Renaissance Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which even cautioned against relying on the work,&lt;ref&gt;'In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the Malleus said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence.', Jolly, Raudvere, &amp; Peters(eds.), 'Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages', page 241 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and was later officially condemned by the Catholic Church in 1490.

In the modern Western world, witchcraft accusations have often accompanied the [[satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]]. Such accusations are a counterpart to [[blood libel]] of various kinds, which may be found throughout history across the globe.

==== White witches ====

[[File:Rila Monastery wall painting.jpg|thumb|A painting in the [[Rila Monastery]] in [[Bulgaria]], condemning witchcraft and traditional [[folk magic]]]]
Throughout the [[early modern period]], the [[Early Modern English|English]] term "witch" was not exclusively negative in meaning, and could also indicate [[cunning folk]]. As Alan McFarlane noted, "There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=+interchangeable+terms+for+these+practitioners,+&amp;f=false|title=Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study|first=Alan|last=Macfarlane|date=31 October 1999|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=31 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415196123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary [[Reginald Scot]] explained, "At this day it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, 'she is a witch' or 'she is a wise woman'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scot |first=Reginald |authorlink=Reginald Scot |date=1584 |title=The Discoverie of Witchcraft |volume=Booke V |chapter=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk magicians throughout Europe were often viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing,&lt;ref&gt;Wilby, Emma (2006) ''Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits''. pp. 51–4.&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to their being accused as "witches" in the negative sense. Many English "witches" convicted of consorting with demons seem to have been cunning folk whose [[fairy]] [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s had been demonised;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Wilby 2005 p. 123; See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20witches%20black%20witches&amp;f=false Alan Macfarlane p. 127 who notes how "white witches" could later be accused as "black witches".]&lt;/ref&gt; many French ''devins-guerisseurs'' ("diviner-healers") were accused of witchcraft,&lt;ref&gt;Monter () ''Witchcraft in France and Switzerland''. Ch. 7: "White versus Black Witchcraft".&lt;/ref&gt; and over one half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the healers and diviners historically accused of witchcraft have considered themselves mediators between the mundane and spiritual worlds, roughly equivalent to [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref&gt;As defined by [[Mircea Eliade]] in ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Pantheon Books, NY NY 1964, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such people described their contacts with fairies, spirits often involving out-of-body experiences and travelling through the realms of an "other-world".&lt;ref name="Ginzburg 1990 Part 2, Ch. 1"&gt;Ginzburg (1990) Part 2, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beliefs of this nature are implied in the folklore of much of Europe, and were explicitly described by accused witches in central and southern Europe. Repeated themes include participation in processions of the dead or large feasts, often presided over by a horned male deity or a female divinity who teaches magic and gives prophecies; and participation in battles against evil spirits, "vampires", or "witches" to win fertility and prosperity for the community.

=== Accusations of witchcraft ===
[[Éva Pócs]] states that reasons for accusations of witchcraft fall into four general categories:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
# A person was caught in the act of positive or negative [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]]
# A well-meaning sorcerer or healer lost their clients' or the authorities' trust
# A person did nothing more than gain the enmity of their neighbours
# A person was reputed to be a witch and surrounded with an aura of witch-beliefs or [[Occultism]]

She identifies three varieties of witch in popular belief:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
* The "neighbourhood witch" or "social witch": a witch who curses a neighbour following some conflict.
* The "magical" or "sorcerer" witch: either a professional healer, sorcerer, seer or midwife, or a person who has through magic increased her fortune to the perceived detriment of a neighbouring household; due to neighbourly or community rivalries and the ambiguity between positive and negative magic, such individuals can become labelled as witches.
* The "supernatural" or "night" witch: portrayed in court narratives as a demon appearing in visions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Neighbourhood witches" are the product of neighbourhood tensions, and are found only in self-sufficient serf village communities where the inhabitants largely rely on each other. Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of "sorcerer" witches and "supernatural" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violence related to accusations====
Belief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger of serious forms of violence, including murder. Such incidents are common in places such as [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tanzania]]. Accusations of witchcraft are sometimes linked to personal disputes, jealousy, and conflicts between neighbors or family over land or inheritance. Witchcraft-related violence is often discussed as a serious issue in the broader context of [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf |title=A Global Issue that Demands Action |publisher=the Academic Council on the United Nations System (ACUNS) Vienna Liaison Office |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&amp;context=djcil#H2N1 |title=CONFLICT BETWEEN STATE LEGAL NORMS AND NORMS UNDERLYING POPULAR BELIEFS: WITCHCRAFT IN AFRICA AS A CASE STUDY |publisher=DUKE JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE &amp; INTERNATIONAL LAW, Vol 14:351 |date=2005 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |title=WITCH HUNTS IN MODERN SOUTH AFRICA: AN UNDER-REPRESENTED FACET OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE |publisher=MRC-UNISA Crime, Violence and Injury Lead Programm |date=June 2009 |accessdate=2014-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425074549/http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/opinions/columns/AHRC-ETC-056-2011 |title=NEPAL: Witchcraft as a Superstition and a form of violence against women in Nepal — Asian Human Rights Commission |publisher=Humanrights.asia |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mensah Adinkrah |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/10/4/325.abstract |title=Witchcraft Accusations and Female Homicide Victimization in Contemporary Ghana |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=325–356 |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2014-06-07|doi=10.1177/1077801204263419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft ===
{{Further information|Neoshamanism|Modern paganism}}
Modern practices identified by their practitioners as "witchcraft" have grown dramatically since the early 20th century. Generally portrayed as revivals of pre-Christian European [[ritual]] and [[spirituality]], they are understood to involve varying degrees of [[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|magic]], [[shamanism]], [[folk medicine]], [[spiritual healing]], calling on [[elemental]]s and [[spirit]]s, veneration of ancient [[Pantheon (religion)|deities]] and [[archetype]]s, and attunement with the forces of nature.

The first [[Neopagan]] groups to publicly appear, during the 1950s and 60s, were [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Bricket Wood coven]] and [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Roy Bowers]]' [[Clan of Tubal Cain]]. They operated as [[initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society|secret societies]]. Other individual practitioners and writers such as [[Paul Huson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]] ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]: a Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks, and Covens'', New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; also claimed inheritance to surviving traditions of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, Chas S., ''Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America'', Lanham, MD: Altamira, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7591-0202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wicca ====
{{Main article|Wicca}}
During the 20th century, interest in witchcraft in [[English language|English-speaking]] and European countries began to increase, inspired particularly by [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of a [[Witch-cult hypothesis|pan-European witch-cult]] originally published in 1921, since discredited by further careful historical research.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Elliot, ''A Razor for a Goat'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1962. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'', [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Mass.]]: [[Blackwell Publishers]], 1993. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was intensified, however, by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner's]] claim in 1954 in ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' that a form of witchcraft still existed in [[England]]. The truth of Gardner's claim is now disputed too, with different historians offering evidence for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Wiccan Roots |isbn=978-1-86163-110-7|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |isbn=978-1-86163-164-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or against&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Aidan, ''Crafting the Art of Magic'', [[Llewellyn Worldwide|Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald, ''Triumph of the Moon'', Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruickbie |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Ruickbie |title=Witchcraft Out of the Shadows |isbn=978-0-7090-7567-7|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the religion's existence prior to Gardner.

The Wicca that Gardner initially taught was a witchcraft religion having a lot in common with Margaret Murray's hypothetically posited cult of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret A., ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Murray wrote an introduction to Gardner's ''Witchcraft Today'', in effect putting her stamp of approval on it. Wicca is now practised as a religion of an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society]] nature with positive ethical principles, organised into autonomous [[coven]]s and led by a High Priesthood. There is also a large "Eclectic Wiccan" movement of individuals and groups who share key Wiccan beliefs but have no initiatory connection or affiliation with traditional Wicca. Wiccan writings and ritual show borrowings from a number of sources including 19th and 20th-century [[ceremonial magic]], the medieval grimoire known as the [[Key of Solomon]], [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and pre-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, R.,''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', Oxford University Press, pp. 205–252, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, A.A., ''Crafting the Art of Magic, Book I: a History of Modern Witchcraft, 1939–1964'', Minnesota: [[Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, D., ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', London: Robert Hale, pp. 35–62, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women are equally termed "witches." They practice a form of [[Duotheism|duotheistic]] [[universalism]].

Since Gardner's death in 1964, the Wicca that he claimed he was initiated into has attracted many initiates, becoming the largest of the various witchcraft traditions in the Western world, and has influenced other Neopagan and occult movements.

=====Witchcraft, feminism, and media=====
Wiccan literature has been described as aiding the empowerment of young women through its lively portrayal of female protagonists. Part of the recent growth in Neo-Pagan religions has been attributed to the strong media presence of fictional works such as the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] and [[Harry Potter]] series with their depictions of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=tosenberger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tosenberger|first=Catherine|title=Neo-Paganism for teens|url=http://jeunessejournal.ca/index.php/yptc/article/view/81/63|journal=Jeunesse: Young People, Texts, Cultures|volume=2.2|year=2010|pages=172–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread accessibility to related material through internet media such as chat rooms and forums is also thought to be driving this development. Wiccan beliefs are currently often found to be compatible with liberal ideals such as the [[Green movement]], and particularly with [[feminism]] by providing young women with means for empowerment and for control of their own lives.&lt;ref name=jarvis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=Christine|title=Becoming a woman through Wicca: Witches and wiccans in contemporary teen fiction|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=39|issue=1|year=2008|pages= 43–52|doi=10.1007/s10583-007-9058-0|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/4140/2/CLE_Jarvis_Wicca_article_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=merskin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merskin|first=Debra|title=Joining Forces: Teen Girl Witches and Internet Chat Groups|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/1/3/0/p171306_index.html |journal=Proceedings of the International Communication Association|date=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the case particularly in North America due to the strong presence of feminist ideals.&lt;ref name=tosenberger/&gt; The 2002 study [[Enchanted Feminism|Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco]] suggests that Wiccan religion represents the second wave of feminism that has also been redefined as a religious movement.&lt;ref name=jarvis/&gt;

==== Stregheria ====
{{Main article|Stregheria}}
Stregheria is an [[Italy|Italian]] witchcraft religion popularised in the 1980s by [[Raven Grimassi]], who claims that it evolved within the ancient [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan religion]] of Italian peasants who worked under the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] upper classes.

Modern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html|website=Stregheria.com|title=Stregheria.com FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Traditional witchcraft ====
{{Main article|Traditional witchcraft}}
Traditional witchcraft is a term used to refer to a variety of contemporary forms of witchcraft. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as "a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to Gardnerianism and the wider Wiccan movement, claiming older, more "traditional" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to "any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' "refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the Sabbatic craft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft, Satanism and Luciferianism ===
{{main article|Satanism|Satanism and Witchcraft}}
[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|[[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi's]] Sabbatic goat (known as The Goat of Mendes or [[Baphomet]]) is one of Satanism's most common symbols.]]

[[Satanism]] is a broad term referring to diverse beliefs that share a symbolic association with, or admiration for, [[Satan]], who is seen as a liberating figure. While it is heir to the same historical period and pre-Enlightenment beliefs that gave rise to modern witchcraft, it is generally seen as completely separate from modern witchcraft and Wicca, and has little or no connection to them.

Modern witchcraft considers Satanism to be the "dark side of Christianity" rather than a branch of Wicca: – the character of Satan referenced in Satanism exists only in the theology of the three Abrahamic religions, and Satanism arose as, and occupies the role of, a rebellious counterpart to Christianity, in which all is permitted and the self is central. (Christianity can be characterized as having the diametrically opposite views to these.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokyhole.org/wicca/satvnp.htm|title=Satanism vs. Neo-Pagan Witchcraft|work=holysmoke.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beliefs become more visibly expressed in Europe after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when works such as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' were described anew by [[Romanticism|romantics]] who suggested that they presented the biblical Satan as an [[allegory]] representing crisis of faith, [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; a few works from that time also begin to directly present Satan in a less negative light, such as ''[[Letters from the Earth]]''. The two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]; the former venerates Satan as a supernatural [[patriarchal]] [[deity]], while the latter views Satan as merely a symbolic embodiment of certain human traits.&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized groups began to emerge in the mid 20th century, including the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]] (1948)&lt;ref name=JamesRLewis&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1573922227|page=553|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lk8_ARNz-dYC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;dq=Ophite+Cultus+Satanas+arthur+sloane#v=onepage&amp;q=Ophite%20Cultus%20Satanas%20arthur%20sloane&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Church of Satan]] (1966).  After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while "gnosis" referred to knowledge, and "[[Wicca]]" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that "the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]". Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L. Martello, 1972 (Interview with Sloane on pp. 31–34, ''Our Lord Sathanas'')&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that there were up to 100,000 Satanists worldwide by 2006, twice the number estimated in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanism.htm|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=March 2006|title=Religious Satanism, 16th century Satanism, Satanic Dabbling, etc|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|author=B.A. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satanistic beliefs have been largely permitted as a valid expression of religious belief in the West. For example, they were allowed in the [[British Royal Navy]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Helen.

[[Luciferianism]], on the other hand, is a belief system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/a/How-Luciferians-Differ-From-Satanists.htm|title=How Luciferians Differ From Satanists|author=Catherine Beyer|work=[[About.com]] Religion &amp; Spirituality|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not revere the [[devil]] figure or most characteristics typically affixed to [[Satan]].

[[Madeline Montalban]] was an English witch who adhered to a specific form of luciferianism which revolved around the veneration of Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom she considered to be a benevolent angelic being who had aided humanity's development. Within her Order, she emphasised that her followers discover their own personal relationship with the angelic beings, including Lumiel.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=26, 85–86}} Although initially seeming favourable to Gerald Gardner, by the mid-1960s she had become hostile towards him and his Gardnerian tradition, considering him to be "a 'dirty old man' and sexual pervert."{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=7|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2p=69}} She also expressed hostility to another prominent Pagan Witch of the period, [[Charles Cardell]], although in the 1960s became friends with the two Witches at the forefront of the [[Alexandrian Wicca]]n tradition, [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and his wife, [[Maxine Sanders]], who adopted some of her Luciferian angelic practices.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=69–70}} In contemporary times luciferian witches exist within traditional witchcraft.{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}}

== Historical and religious perspectives ==
===Near East beliefs===
The belief in sorcery and its practice seem to have been widespread in the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Nile Valley]]. It played a conspicuous role in the cultures of [[ancient Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]]. The latter tradition included an [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] anti-witchcraft ritual, the [[Maqlû]]. A section from the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (about 2000 B.C.) prescribes:

{{quote|If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006. There is some discrepancy between translations; compare with that given in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm article on Witchcraft] (accessed 31 March 2006), and the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm L.

===Abrahamic religions===
==== Hebrew Bible ====
{{Main article|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
According to the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia: {{quote|In the Holy Scripture references to sorcery are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices found there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of [[fraud]] as upon the abomination of the magic in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Witchcraft |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Wickiana3.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of alleged witches in Central Europe, 1587]]
The [[King James Version]] uses the words "witch", "witchcraft", and "witchcrafts" to translate the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} ''kāsháf'' ({{IPA-he|kɔˈʃaf}}) and {{hebrew|קֶסֶם}} (''qésem'');&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Nahum|3:4|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:23|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:6|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|9:22|}}; {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:10|}}; {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}}&lt;/ref&gt; these same English terms are used to translate {{lang|grc|φαρμακεία}} ''pharmakeia'' in the [[Greek New Testament]]. Verses such as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:11–12|}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}} ("Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live") thus provided scriptural justification for Christian [[witch-hunt|witch hunters]] in the [[early modern period]] (see [[Christian views on magic]]).

The precise meaning of the Hebrew {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, usually translated as "witch" or "sorceress", is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmakeía'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scot]], a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated {{Hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, φαρμακεία, and the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Latin]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning "poisoner", and on this basis, claimed that "witch" was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} include "mutterer" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning "herb", and ''hapaleh'', meaning "using"). The Greek φαρμακεία literally means "herbalist" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33–35 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:
{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?&lt;ref&gt;I Samuel 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Note that the Hebrew word {{hebrew|אֹב}} ''ob'', translated as ''familiar spirit'' in the above quotation, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].

==== New Testament ====
{{See also|Christian views on magic}}
The [[New Testament]] condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:20, compared with [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21:8; 22:15; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9; 13:6). The word in most New Testament translations is "sorcerer"/"sorcery" rather than "witch"/"witchcraft".

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.

However, some of the rabbis practiced "magic" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the "magic" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than "unclean" forces) than as witchcraft.

Judaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9–10) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).

Judaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.

==== Islam ====
Divination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460 “Magic”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P.

Also according to the Qur'an:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|publisher=Routledge|others=Leaman, Oliver, 1950-, Credo Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781780343686|location=Abingdon, Oxon [England]|pages=381|oclc=764567609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And they follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon.

Islam distinguishes between God-given gifts, which can heal sickness, and [[Demonic possession#Islam|possession]], and sorcery. Good supernatural powers are therefore a ''special gift from [[God in Islam|God]]'', whereas sorcery or black magic is achieved through help of [[jinn]] and [[Shaitan|demons]]. In the Qurʾānic narrative, the [[Solomon in Islam|Prophet Sulayman]] had the power to speak with animals and command jinn, and he thanks God for this نعمة (i.e. gift, privilege, favour, bounty), which is only given to him with God’s permission.{{Cite Quran|27|19}}&lt;ref&gt;''Tafsir Ibn Kathir'' for surah 21, verse 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] was accused of being a magician by his opponents.{{Cite Quran|10|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1374|title=Magic - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of seeking help from the jinn is prohibited and can lead to possession. The ''ruqya'' contains verses of the Qur'an as well as prayers specifically targeted against demons. The knowledge of which verses of the Qur'an to use in what way is what is considered "magic knowledge."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A ''[[hadith]]'' recorded in {{hadith-usc|bukhari|8|76|479}} states: "Seventy thousand people of my followers will enter Paradise without accounts, and they are those who do not practice Ar-Ruqya and do not see an evil omen in things, and put their trust in their Lord." [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]], a [[Islamic scholar|scholar]], commented on this ''hadith'', stating: That is because these people will enter Paradise without being called to account because of the perfection of their Tawheed, therefore he described them as people who did not ask others to perform ruqyah for them. Hence he said "and they put their trust in their Lord." Because of their complete trust in their Lord, their contentment with Him, their faith in Him, their being pleased with Him and their seeking their needs from Him, they do not ask people for anything, be it ruqyah or anything else, and they are not influenced by omens and superstitions that could prevent them from doing what they want to do, because superstition detracts from and weakens Tawheed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zad al-Ma'ad|last=al-Jawziyya|first=Ibn Qayyim|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1/475|trans-title=Provisions of the Hereafter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Southern African traditions, there are three classifications of somebody who uses magic. The ''[[tagati]]'' is usually improperly translated into English as "witch", and is a spiteful person who operates in secret to harm others. The ''[[sangoma]]'' is a diviner, somewhere on a par with a [[fortune teller]], and is employed in detecting illness, predicting a person's future (or advising them on which path to take), or identifying the guilty party in a crime. She also practices some degree of medicine. The ''inyanga'' is often translated as "witch doctor" (though many Southern Africans resent this implication, as it perpetuates the mistaken belief that a "witch doctor" is in some sense a ''practitioner'' of malicious magic). The ''inyanga''{{'}}s job is to heal illness and injury and provide customers with magical items for everyday use. Of these three categories the ''tagati'' is almost exclusively female, the ''sangoma'' is usually female, and the ''inyanga'' is almost exclusively male.

Much of what witchcraft represents in Africa has been susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, thanks in no small part to a tendency among western scholars since the time of the now largely discredited [[Margaret Murray]] to approach the subject through a comparative lens vis-a-vis European witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja|first=Uchenna|title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okeja argues that witchcraft in Africa today plays a very different social role than in Europe of the past—or present—and should be understood through an African rather than post-colonial Western lens.

Complimentary remarks about witchcraft by a native Congolese initiate: "From witchcraft ... may be developed the remedy (''kimbuki'') that will do most to raise up our country."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.12).&lt;/ref&gt; "Witchcraft ... deserves respect ... it can embellish or redeem (''ketula evo vuukisa'')."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.14).&lt;/ref&gt; "The ancestors were equipped with the protective witchcraft of the clan (''kindoki kiandundila kanda''). ... They could also gather the power of animals into their hands ... whenever they needed. ... If we could make use of these kinds of witchcraft, our country would rapidly progress in knowledge of every kind."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, pp. 54b-55a (13.9.16).&lt;/ref&gt; "You witches (''zindoki'') too, bring your science into the light to be written down so that ... the benefits in it ... endow our race."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 55b (13.10.8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cameroon ====

In eastern Cameroon, the term used for witchcraft among the [[Maka people|Maka]] is ''djambe''&lt;ref&gt;Geschiere, Peter; "''The Modernity of Witchcraft: Politics and the Occult in Postcolonial Africa''" (1997) University of Virginia Press. {{ISBN|0-8139-1703-4}} (paperback). Translated by Geschiere, Peter &amp; Roitman, Janet from the originally published in French: "''Sorcellerie et politique en Afrique – La viande des autres''" (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to a force inside a person; its powers may make the proprietor more vulnerable. It encompasses the occult, the transformative, killing and healing.&lt;ref&gt;''idem'' (Geschiere, 1997, p.13)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central Africa ====
In some [[Central Africa]]n areas, malicious magic users are believed by locals to be the source of [[terminal illness]] such as [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]]. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]]. Children may be accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such abuse are too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Every year, hundreds of people in the [[Central African Republic]] are convicted of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312100813/http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |archivedate=2010-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-balaka|Christian militias]] in the Central African Republic have also kidnapped, burnt and buried alive women accused of being 'witches' in public ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Esslemont 2015"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Esslemont | first=Tom | title=Witch burning rebels stoke Central African Republic violence | newspaper=Reuters | date=26 November 2015 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-witchcraft/witch-burning-rebels-stoke-central-african-republic-violence-idUSKBN0TF03920151126 | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Democratic Republic of the Congo ====
{{As of|2006}}, between 25,000 and 50,000 children in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], had been accused of witchcraft and thrown out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Dowden in Kinshasa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/12/theobserver.worldnews11 |title=Thousands of child 'witches' turned on to the streets to starve &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children have been subjected to often-violent abuse during [[exorcism]]s, sometimes supervised by self-styled religious pastors. Other pastors and Christian activists strongly oppose such accusations and try to rescue children from their unscrupulous colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/september/27.62.html|title=Kolwezi: Accused of witchcraft by parents and churches, children in the Democratic Republic of Congo are being rescued by Christian activists|website=Christianity Today|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual term for these children is ''enfants sorciers'' (child witches) or ''enfants dits sorciers'' (children accused of witchcraft). In 2002, [[USAID]] funded the production of two short films on the subject, made in Kinshasa by journalists Angela Nicoara and Mike Ormsby.

In April 2008, in Kinshasa, the police arrested 14 suspected victims (of [[penis snatching]]) and [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] accused of using black magic or witchcraft to steal (make disappear) or shrink men's penises to extort cash for cure, amid a wave of panic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bavier |first=Joe |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2319603620080423?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true |title=Penis theft panic hits city.. |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, the belief in magical warfare technologies (such as "bulletproofing") in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo serves a group-level function, as it increases group efficiency in warfare, even if it is suboptimal at the individual level.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nunn |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Nunn |last2=Sierra |first2=Raul Sanchez de la |date=2017 |title=Why Being Wrong can be Right: Magical Warfare Technologies and the Persistence of False Beliefs |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=582–87 |doi=10.1257/aer.p20171091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this is one reason why the belief in witchcraft persists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Ghana ====
In [[Ghana]], women are often accused of witchcraft and attacked by neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108050152/http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archivedate=2011-01-08 |title=My Mum is Not A Witch |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there exist six [[witch camp]]s in the country where women suspected of being witches can flee for safety.&lt;ref name="Camps"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19437130 | title=Ghana witch camps: Widows' lives in exile | publisher=BBC | accessdate=September 1, 2012| work=BBC News | date=September 2012 | last1=Whitaker | first1=Kati }}&lt;/ref&gt; The witch camps, which exist solely in Ghana, are thought to house a total of around 1000 women.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; Some of the camps are thought to have been set up over 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; The Ghanaian government has announced that it intends to close the camps.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt;

Arrests were made in an effort to avoid bloodshed seen in [[Ghana]] a decade ago, when 12 alleged penis snatchers were beaten to death by mobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/18/briefs/ghana.penis.html ''7 killed in Ghana over 'penis-snatching' episodes''], CNN, January 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is easy for modern people to dismiss such reports, Uchenna Okeja argues that a belief system in which such magical practices are deemed possible offer many benefits to Africans who hold them. For example, the belief that a sorcerer has "stolen" a man's penis functions as an anxiety-reduction mechanism for men suffering from impotence while simultaneously providing an explanation that is consistent with African cultural beliefs rather than appealing to Western scientific notions that are tainted by the history of colonialism (at least for many Africans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja |first=Uchenna |title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kenya ====
It was reported on May 21, 2008 that in [[Kenya]], a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL21301127 |title=Mob burns to death 11 Kenyan "witches" |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malawi ====
In [[Malawi]] it is also common practice to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result. As in other African countries both African traditional healers and their Christian counterparts are trying to make a living out of exorcising children and are actively involved in pointing out children as witches.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Carrie 2011. Hunting the vulnerable: Witchcraft and the law in Malawi; Consultancy Africa Intelligence (16 June):&lt;/ref&gt; Various secular and Christian organizations are combining their efforts to address this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Meer, Erwin 2011. The Problem of Witchcraft in Malawi, Evangelical Missions Quarterly (47:1, January): 78–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[William Kamkwamba]], witches and wizards are afraid of money, which they consider a rival evil. Any contact with [[cash]] will snap their spell and leave the wizard naked and confused. So placing cash, such as [[Malawian kwacha|kwacha]] around a room or bed mat will protect the resident from their malevolent spells.&lt;ref&gt;Kamkwamba, William. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Harper Collins. 2009. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
In [[Nigeria]], several Pentecostal pastors have mixed their evangelical brand of Christianity with African beliefs in witchcraft to benefit from the lucrative witch finding and exorcism business—which in the past was the exclusive domain of the so-called witch doctor or traditional healers. These pastors have been involved in the torturing and even killing of children accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/publications/593|title=Stepping Stones Nigeria 2007. Supporting Victims of Witchcraft Abuse and Street Children in Nigeria|website=humantrafficking.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017185346/http://humantrafficking.org/publications/593|archivedate=2012-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, around 15,000 children have been accused, and around 1,000 murdered. Churches are very numerous in Nigeria, and competition for congregations is hard. Some pastors attempt to establish a reputation for spiritual power by "detecting" child witches, usually following a death or loss of a job within a family, or an accusation of financial fraud against the pastor. In the course of "exorcisms", accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.&lt;ref&gt;Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children]. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sierra Leone ====
Among the Mende (of [[Sierra Leone]]), trial and conviction for witchcraft has a beneficial effect for those convicted. "The witchfinder had warned the whole village to ensure the relative prosperity of the accused and sentenced ... old people. ... Six months later all of the people ... accused, were secure, well-fed and arguably happier than at any [previous] time; they had hardly to beckon and people would come with food or whatever was needful. ... Instead of such old and widowed people being left helpless or (as in Western society) institutionalized in old people's homes, these were reintegrated into society and left secure in their old age ... . ... Old people are 'suitable' candidates for this kind of accusation in the sense that they are isolated and vulnerable, and they are 'suitable' candidates for 'social security' for precisely the same reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Gittins 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kuranko language]], the term for witchcraft is ''suwa'ye''&lt;ref&gt;West, Harry G. "''Ethnographic Sorcery''" (p.24); 2007. The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-89398-3}} (pbk.), {{ISBN|0-226-89398-7}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt; referring to "extraordinary powers".

==== Tanzania ====
In [[Tanzania]] in 2008, President [[Jakaya Kikwete|Kikwete]] publicly condemned [[witchdoctor]]s for killing [[Albinism|albinos]] for their body parts, which are thought to bring good luck. 25 albinos have been murdered since March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7518049.stm Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, albinos are often murdered for their body parts on the advice of witch doctors in order to produce powerful amulets that are believed to protect against witchcraft and make the owner prosper in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/blogs/?p=348|title=Wicasta 2011.

=== Americas ===
==== Caribbean ====

Brua is an Afro-Caribbean religion and healing tradition that originates in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, in the Dutch Caribbean. A healer in this culture is called a ''kurioso'' or ''kuradó'', a man or woman who performs ''trabou chikí'' (little works) and ''trabou grandi'' (large treatments) to promote or restore health, bring fortune or misfortune, deal with unrequited love, and more serious concerns, in which sorcery is involved. Sorcery usually involves reference to the ''almasola'' or ''homber chiki'', a devil-like entity. ''Transcultural Psychiatry'' published a paper called "Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua" by Jan Dirk Blom, Igmar T. Poulina, Trevor L. van Gellecum and Hans W. Hoek of the Parnassia Psychiatric Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278016204|title=Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua|first1=Jan Dirk|last1=Blom|first2=Igmar|last2=T.

==== Colonial North America ====
[[File:Matteson Examination of a Witch.jpg|thumb|''Examination of a Witch'' by [[T. H. Matteson]], inspired by the [[Salem witch trials]]]]
In 1645, [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. At America's first [[witch trial]], Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but sentenced to be hanged for the death of her child. She died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html |title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents |publisher=Masslive.com |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1645–1663, about eighty people throughout England's [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were accused of practicing witchcraft. Thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that lasted throughout [[New England]] from 1645–1663.&lt;ref name=Fraden&gt;Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692–93. These witch trials were the most famous in [[British North America]] and took place in the coastal settlements near [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. Prior to the witch trials, nearly 300 men and women had been suspected of partaking in witchcraft, and 19 of these people were hanged, and one was “pressed to death”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America: A Narrative History|year=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-393-91265-4|page=85|author=George Brown Tindall|edition=Brief Ninth Edition, Volume One|author2=David Emory Shi |editor=Jon Durbin. Retrieved 10/3/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Salem witch trials were a series of hearings before local magistrates followed by county court trials to prosecute people accused of witchcraft in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex]], [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] Counties of colonial Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. Over 150 people were arrested and imprisoned, with even more accused who were not formally pursued by the authorities. The two courts convicted 29 people of the capital felony of witchcraft. Nineteen of the accused, 14 women and 5 men, were hanged. [[Giles Corey|One man]] who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones in an attempt to force him to do so. At least five more of the accused died in prison.

Despite being generally known as the "Salem" witch trials, the preliminary hearings in 1692 were conducted in a variety of towns across the province: Salem Village (now [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]]), [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem Town]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], and [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]]. The best known trials were conducted by the Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] in 1692 in Salem Town.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salemwitchmuseum.com/education|title=Salem Witch Museum|website=www.salemwitchmuseum.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 26 who went to trial before this court were convicted. The four sessions of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, held in Salem Town, but also in Ipswich, Boston, and Charlestown, produced only 3 convictions in the 31 witchcraft trials it conducted. Likewise, alleged witchcraft was not isolated to New England. In 1706 [[Grace Sherwood]] the "Witch of Pungo" was imprisoned for the crime in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia]].

In Maryland, there is a legend of Moll Dyer, who escaped a fire set by fellow colonists only to die of exposure in December&amp;nbsp;1697. The historical record of Dyer is scant as all official records were burned in a courthouse fire, though the county courthouse has on display the rock where her frozen body was found. A letter from a colonist of the period describes her in most unfavourable terms. A local road is named after Dyer, where her homestead was said to have been. Many local families have their own version of the Moll Dyer affair, and her name is spoken with care in the rural southern counties.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Thompson, "Sister Witch: The Life of Moll Dyer" (2017 Solstice Publishing) {{ISBN|978-1973105756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of witchcraft and wizardry led to the prosecution of a man in Tennessee as recently as 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topix.com/forum/city/jamestown-tn/TPAPB6U4LVF0JDQC8/p2|title=Old Stories|work=Topix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1wvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA67|title=History of Fentress County, Tennessee|last1=Hogue|first1=Albert Ross|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Touring the East Tennessee Backroads |first=Carolyn |last=Sakowski|page=212 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rLBrUbj02IcC&amp;pg=PA212|isbn=9780895874764 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Crucible]]'' by Arthur Miller is a dramatized and partially fictionalized story of the [[Salem witch trials]] that took place in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during 1692–93.

==== Diné / Navajo ====
In [[Navajo people|Diné culture]], witches are seen as the polar opposite of [[medicine man|ceremonial people]]. While spiritual leaders perform "[[Navajo song ceremonial complex|sings]]" for healing, protection and other beneficial purposes, all practices referred to as "witchcraft" are intended to hurt and curse. Witches are associated with harm to the community and transgression of societal standards, especially those relating to family and the dead.

The ''yee naaldlooshii'' is the type of witch known in English as a "[[skin-walker]]". They are believed to take the forms of animals in order to travel in secret and do harm to the innocent.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;Wall, Leon and William Morgan, ''Navajo-English Dictionary''. Hippocrene Books, New York City, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7818-0247-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Navajo language]], ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' translates to "with it, he goes on all fours".&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;  While perhaps the most common variety seen in horror fiction by non-Navajo people, the ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' is one of several varieties of Navajo witch, specifically a type of  ''{{lang|nv|’ánti’įhnii}}''.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

Corpse powder or corpse poison ({{lang-nv|{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}}}, literally "witchery" or "harming") is a substance made from powdered corpses.  The powder is used by witches to curse their victims.&lt;ref name="PerroneStockel1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perrone|first1=Bobette|last2=Stockel|first2=H. Henrietta|last3=Krueger|first3=Victoria|title=Medicine women, curanderas, and women doctors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApJayEh43ZcC&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=1993|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-2512-1|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the ''{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}'' is a curse and disease, usually indicated by an immediate action to administration of the poison, like fainting, swelling of the tongue, or [[Trismus|lockjaw]]. Sometimes, however, the victims simply [[wasting|wastes away]], as from a normal disease.

Witchcraft was also an important part of the social and cultural history of late-Colonial Mexico, during the [[Mexican Inquisition]]. Spanish Inquisitors viewed witchcraft as a problem that could be cured simply through confession. Yet, as anthropologist [[Ruth Behar]] writes, witchcraft, not only in Mexico but in Latin America in general, was a "conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged."&lt;ref&gt;Behar, Ruth. ''Sex and Sin, Witchcraft and the Devil in Late-Colonial Mexico.'' American Ethnologist, 14:1 (February 1987), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, witchcraft in Mexico generally required an interethnic and interclass network of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Lavrin, Asunción. ''Sexuality &amp; Marriage in Colonial Latin America.'' Reprint ed. Lincoln, NB.:University of Nebraska Press, 1992, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, witchcraft in colonial Mexico ultimately represented an "affirmation of hegemony" for women, Indians, and especially Indian women over their white male counterparts as a result of the [[casta]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of mirrors: power, witchcraft, and caste in colonial Mexico.'' Durham, N.C.:Duke University Press, 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern history, notoriety has been awarded to a place called [[Catemaco#The "witches" of Catemaco|Catemaco]], in the state of Veracruz, which has a history of witchcraft, and where the practice of witchcraft by contemporary ''brujos'' and ''brujas'' thrives.

In Mexico City, people who practice brujería, [[Santería]], voodoo, ocultism and magic may find items, herbs and supplies at the ''[[mercado de Sonora]]''.

==== South America ====
In [[Chile]] there is a tradition of the [[Kalku]] in [[Mapuche religion]]; and the [[Warlock of Chiloé|Warlocks of Chiloé]] in the folklore and [[Chilote mythology]].

The presence of the witch is a constant in the [[ethnographic]] [[history]] of [[colonial Brazil]], especially during the several denunciations and confessions given to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of [[Bahia]] (1591–1593), [[Pernambuco]] and [[Paraíba]] (1593–1595).&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} João Ribeiro Júnior, ''O Que é Magia'', p.48-49, Ed.

==== Japan ====
[[File:Okabe - The cat witch.jpg|thumb|Okabe – The cat witch, by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]]]

In Japanese folklore, the most common types of witch can be separated into two categories: those who employ [[snake]]s as familiars, and those who employ foxes.&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen. The Catalpa Bow : A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan. New York: Routledge Curzon, 1999. 51–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fox witch is, by far, the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of "The Grateful foxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes – Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a fox enters the employ of a human it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared. A fox under the employ of a human can provide many services. The fox can turn invisible and find secrets its master desires. It can apply its many powers of illusion to trick and deceive its master's enemies. The most feared power of the ''kitsune-mochi'' is the ability to command his fox to possess other humans. This process of possession is called [[Kitsunetsuki]].

By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or "hereditary witches".&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tsukimono-suji'' is traditionally a family who is reported to have foxes under their employ. These foxes serve the family and are passed down through the generations, typically through the female line. ''Tsukimono-suji'' foxes are able to supply much in the way of the same mystical aid that the foxes under the employ of a ''kitsune-mochi'' can provide its more solitary master with. In addition to these powers, if the foxes are kept happy and well taken care of, they bring great fortune and prosperity to the ''Tsukimono-suji'' house. However, the aid in which these foxes give is often overshadowed by the social and mystical implications of being a member of such a family. In many villages, the status of local families as ''tsukimono-suji'' is often common, everyday knowledge. Such families are respected and feared, but are also openly shunned. Due to its hereditary nature, the status of being ''Tsukimono-suji'' is considered contagious. Because of this, it is often impossible for members of such a family to sell land or other properties, due to fear that the possession of such items will cause foxes to inundate one's own home. In addition to this, because the foxes are believed to be passed down through the female line, it is often nearly impossible for women of such families to find a husband whose family will agree to have him married to a ''tsukimono-suji'' family. In such a union the woman's status as a ''Tsukimono-suji'' would transfer to any man who married her.

==== Philippines ====
Witchcraft in [[the Philippines]] is often classified as malevolent, with practitioners of black magic called ''[[Mangkukulam]]'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and ''[[Mambabarang]]'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]; there are also practitioners of benevolent, white magic, in addition to some who practise both. ''Mambabarang'' in particular are noted for their ability to command insects and other invertebrates to accomplish a task, such as delivering a curse to a target.

Magic and witchcraft in the Philippines varies considerably across the different [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|ethnic groups]], and is commonly a modern manifestation of [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Colonial]] spirituality interwoven with [[Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] religious elements such as the invocation of [[saints]] and the use of [[pseudo-Latin]] prayers (''oración'') in spells, and ''[[anting-anting]]'' (amulets).

Practitioners of traditional herbal-based medicine and divination called ''[[albularyo]]'' are not considered witches. They are perceived to be either quack doctors or a quasi-magical option when western medicine fails to identify or cure an ailment that is thus suspected to be of supernatural, often malevolent, origin. [[Feng shui]], an influence of [[Filipino Chinese]] culture, is also not classified as witchcraft as it is considered a separate realm of belief altogether.

=== Europe ===
{{Main article|European witchcraft|Witch trials in Early Modern Europe}}
[[File:Die Hexe (Albrecht Dürer).jpg|thumb|left|[[Albrecht Dürer]] circa 1500: Witch Riding Backwards On A Goat]]
[[File:Sejdmen.jpg|thumb|During the Christianisation of Norway, King [[Olaf Trygvasson]] had male [[völva]]s (shamans) tied up and left on a [[skerry]] at [[tide|ebb]].]]Witchcraft in Europe between 500–1750 was believed to be a combination of sorcery and heresy. While sorcery attempts to produce negative supernatural effects through formulas and rituals, heresy is the Christian contribution to witchcraft in which an individual makes a pact with the Devil. In addition, heresy denies witches the recognition of important Christian values such as baptism, salvation, Christ and sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witchcraft|last=Monter|first=E. William|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the witch accusations in Europe took place in the 14th and 15th centuries; however as the social disruptions of the 16th century took place, witchcraft trials intensified.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witch Trials: Their Foundations in Popular and Learned Culture, 1300–1500|last=Kiekhefer|first=Richard|publisher=Routledge|year=201|isbn=|location=|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Persecution of witches.jpg|thumb|[[Death by burning|Burning]] of witches.  Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Brian P. Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. [[Ronald Hutton]] (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of witch trials in Europe known for certain to have ended in executions is around 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title = Estimates of executions | url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/current.htm }} Based on [[Ronald Hutton]]'s essay ''Counting the Witch Hunt''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Early Modern European tradition, witches were stereotypically, though not exclusively, women.&lt;ref name="gibbons"&gt;Gibbons, Jenny (1998) "Recent Developments in the Study of the Great European Witch Hunt" in [http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/POM ''The Pomegranate''] #5, Lammas 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Nevill (1992) ''Dictionary of Mysticism and the Esoteric Traditions'' Revised Edition. Bridport, Dorset: Prism Press. "Witch".&lt;/ref&gt; European pagan belief in witchcraft was associated with the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and dismissed as "diabolical fantasies" by medieval Christian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Regino of Prüm]] (906), see Ginzburg (1990) part 2, ch. 1 (89ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witch-hunt]]s first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest [[Germany]] were from 1561 to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. [[Erik Midelfort]], Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562–1684, 1972,71&lt;/ref&gt;

It was commonly believed that individuals with power and prestige were involved in acts of witchcraft and even cannibalism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Thornton, John. "Cannibals, Witches, and Slave Traders in the Atlantic World." The William and Mary Quarterly 60, no. 2 (2003): 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Europe had a lot of power over individuals living in West Africa, Europeans in positions of power were often accused of taking part in these practices. Though it is not likely that these individuals were actually involved in these practices, they were most likely associated due to Europe’s involvement in things like the slave trade, which negatively affected the lives of many individuals in the Atlantic World throughout the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The familiar witch of [[folklore]] and popular [[superstition]] is a combination of numerous influences. The characterization of the witch as an evil magic user developed over time.

Early converts to Christianity looked to Christian clergy to work magic more effectively than the old methods under Roman paganism, and Christianity provided a methodology involving saints and relics, similar to the gods and amulets of the Pagan world. As Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe, its concern with magic lessened.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Stuart, P. G. (2000) "The Emergence of the Christian Witch" in ''History Today'', Nov, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant Christian explanation for witchcraft, such as those typified in the confessions of the [[Pendle witches]], commonly involves a [[deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]] or at least an appeal to the intervention of the spirits of evil. The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe "[[Witches' Sabbath|the witches' sabbath]]" (performing infernal rites that often parodied the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers. It was a folkloric belief that a Devil's Mark, like the brand on cattle, was placed upon a witch's skin by the devil to signify that this pact had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Drymon, M.M. Disguised as the Devil: How Lyme Disease Created Witches and Changed History, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Witches were most often characterized as women. Witches disrupted the societal institutions, and more specifically, marriage. It was believed that a witch often joined a pact with the devil to gain powers to deal with infertility, immense fear for her children's well-being, or revenge against a lover. They were also depicted as lustful and perverted, and it was thought that they copulated with the devil at the Sabbath.

The Church and European society were not always so zealous in hunting witches or blaming them for misfortunes. [[Saint Boniface]] declared in the 8th century that belief in the existence of witches was un-Christian. The emperor [[Charlemagne]] decreed that the burning of supposed witches was a pagan custom that would be punished by the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. In 820 the [[Bishop of Lyon]] and others repudiated the belief that witches could make bad weather, fly in the night, and change their shape. This denial was accepted into [[Canon law]] . Other rulers such as [[Coloman, King of Hungary|King Coloman of Hungary]] declared that witch-hunts should cease because witches (more specifically, [[strigoi|strigas]]) do not exist.
[[File:Torturing and execution of witches in medieval miniature.jpg|thumb|Burning witches, with others held in Stocks, 14th century]]
The Church did not invent the idea of witchcraft as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners should be put to death. This idea is commonplace in pre-Christian religions. According to the scholar Max Dashu, the concept of medieval witchcraft contained many of its elements even before the emergence of Christianity. These can be found in [[Bacchanalia]]s, especially in the time when they were led by priestess [[Paculla Annia]] (188BC–186BC).

Powers typically attributed to European witches include turning food poisonous or inedible, flying on broomsticks or pitchforks, casting spells, cursing people, making livestock ill and crops fail, and creating fear and local chaos.

However, even at a later date, not all witches were assumed to be harmful practicers of the craft. In England, the provision of this curative magic was the job of a [[witch doctor]], also known as a [[cunning folk|cunning man]], [[white witch]], or wise man. The term "witch doctor" was in use in England before it came to be associated with Africa. [[Toad doctors]] were also credited with the ability to undo evil witchcraft. (Other folk magicians had their own purviews. [[Girdle-measurers]] specialised in diagnosing ailments caused by fairies, while magical cures for more mundane ailments, such as burns or toothache, could be had from [[Charmer (folklore)|charmer]]s.)

Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barry, "Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft" in  Jonathan Barry et al. eds., ''Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (1996)  pp. 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Macfarlane, ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Older women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Garrett, ""Women and witches: Patterns of analysis." ''Signs'' 3#2 (1977): 461–470. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173296 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daemonologie1.jpg|thumb|Illustration of witches, perhaps being tortured before [[James VI and I|James VI]], from his ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597)]]
In Wales,  fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500.  There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kamerick, "Tanglost of Wales: Magic and Adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500." ''Sixteenth Century Journal'' 44#1 (2013) pp25-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536–1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law. Custom provided a framework of responding to witches and witchcraft in such a way that interpersonal and communal harmony was maintained, Showing to regard to the importance of honour, social place and cultural status. Even when found guilty, execution did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Parkin, "Witchcraft, women's honour and customary law in early modern Wales." ''Social History'' 31.3 (2006): 295–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming king in 1603,  [[James I]] Brought to England and Scotland continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male [[homosociality]] among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lolis, "The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the Homosocial Refashioning of the Witches’ Community." ''CLIO'' (2008) 37#3 pp 322–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cook Islands ====
In pre-Christian times, witchcraft was a common practice in the [[Cook Islands]]. The native name for a sorcerer was ''tangata purepure'' (a man who prays).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA372|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=372|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prayers offered by the ''ta'unga'' (priests)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA471|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=471|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the gods worshiped on national or tribal ''[[marae]]'' (temples) were termed ''karakia'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=156|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; those on minor occasions to the lesser gods were named ''pure''. All these prayers were metrical, and were handed down from generation to generation with the utmost care. There were prayers for every such phase in life; for success in battle; for a change in wind (to overwhelm an adversary at sea, or that an intended voyage be propitious); that his crops may grow; to curse a thief; or wish ill-luck and death to his foes. Few men of middle age were without a number of these prayers or charms. The succession of a sorcerer was from father to son, or from uncle to nephew. So too of sorceresses: it would be from mother to daughter, or from aunt to niece. Sorcerers and sorceresses were often slain by relatives of their supposed victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|author-link=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A singular enchantment was employed to kill off a husband of a pretty woman desired by someone else. The expanded flower of a [[Gardenia taitensis|Gardenia]] was stuck upright—a very difficult performance—in a cup (i.e., half a large coconut shell) of water. A prayer was then offered for the husbands speedy death, the sorcerer earnestly watching the flower. Should it fall the incantation was successful. But if the flower still remained upright, he will live. The sorcerer would in that case try his skill another day, with perhaps better success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Beatrice Grimshaw]], a journalist who visited the Cook Islands in 1907, the uncrowned [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] was believed to have possessed the mystic power called ''[[mana]]'',  giving the possessor the power to slay at will.

=== Russia ===
Among the [[Russian language|Russian]] words for ''witch'', ведьма (ved'ma) literally means "one who knows", from Old Slavic вѣдъ "to know").&lt;ref&gt;See also Ryan, W.F. ''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequent term is колдунья (koldun'ya), ''sorcerer'' being колдун (koldun).

==== Spells ====
Pagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.
&lt;/ref&gt;  One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Botanicals should be gathered, "During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right."&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"/&gt;  Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606–631}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple—one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.&lt;ref&gt;Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The western concept of an "evil eye" or a "hex" was translated to Russia as a "spoiler".&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.&lt;/ref&gt; A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler.  The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Societal view of witchcraft ====
The dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;  Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a "whisperer" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).&lt;ref&gt;
Christine D. Worobec, 1995. "Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages." Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers – but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual’s self is often deemed as "feminine" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192–194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Witchcraft trials ====
[[File:"A true and just recorde of the information"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]

Witchcraft trials occurred frequently in seventeenth-century Russia, although the "great witch-hunt" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominately Western European phenomenon.  However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called "witch hysteria."  This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community.  Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.&lt;ref&gt;
Russell Zguta, "Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia," American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: " [so she must be a witch]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aqRCAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The sentence for an individual found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, and in previous centuries, typically included either burning at the stake or being tested with the "ordeal of cold water" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"&gt;Zguta, 1189.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but was used as a method of truth in Russia prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy.  Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them "brought back," but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these two methods of torture were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century.  Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present.  In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.&lt;ref&gt;
Zguta, 1187.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts—astrology, fortune telling, and divination—became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"&gt;Zguta, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547–1584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"/&gt;  Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565–1572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles.  Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598–1613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Time of Troubles, seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the ground, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1195.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.

== Witches in art ==
Witches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a "witch-craze" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Patricia. "THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART." Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the "protectress of childbirth and fertility" while Herodias symbolized "unbridled sensuality". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
One of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht Dürer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.&lt;ref&gt;Stumpel, Jeroen. “The Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in Dürer's ‘Four Witches.’” Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143–160., www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Dürer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as "[sucking] the blood of newborn infants"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as "practitioners of witchcraft and magic".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an "earthly alliance" had taken place between Satan's female minions who "conspired to destroy Christendom".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Hoak, Dale. "THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE." ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was Dürer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their "flight-inducing [powers]". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''World Index of Moral Freedom'''&lt;ref&gt;'''[http://www.fundalib.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/World-Index-of-Moral-Freedom-web.pdf World Index of Moral Freedom (WIMF)]'''&lt;/ref&gt; is an international index ranking one hundred and sixty countries on their performance on five categories of indicators: '''religious freedom''' (taking into account both the freedom to practice any religion or none, and the situation of religious control on the state); '''bioethical freedom''' (including the legal status of abortion, euthanasia and other practices pertaining to bioethics, like surrogacy or stem cell research); '''drugs freedom''' (including the legal status of cannabis and the country's general policy on hard drugs); '''sexual freedom''' (including the legal status of pornography and sex services among consenting adults, and the country's age of sexual consent), and '''family and gender freedom''' (including women's freedom of movement, the legal status of cohabitation of unmarried couples, same sex marriage and the situation of transgender people). The index is sponsored and published by the Foundation for the Advancement of Liberty, a [[libertarian]] [[think tank]] based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The WIMF's first edition was published on April 2, 2016, co-authored by Foundation researchers Andreas Kohl and Juan Pina. A second edition was published by the same foundation in July, 2018, this time authored by Juan Pina and Emma Watson.

== Purpose ==
The World Index of Moral Freedom aims at completing the views presented by other international [[freedom indices]] measuring general freedom or aspects thereof (press freedom, economic freedom, etcetera). To do so, the Index aims at responding a simple question: how free from state-imposed moral constraints are human beings depending on their countries of residence? The research conducted tries to determine the degree of individual freedom to take decisions pertaining to the great moral debates of our time. The first edition of the WIMF includes a short note on the comparison between its country ranking and those of the other freedom indices.

== Categories studied and classification of countries ==
Each category of indicators is worth twenty points (20% of the total score) and aims at responding the following questions:
* '''''Category A.''''' Religious indicators. How free is the practice of any religion or none, and how religious-controlled is the state.
* '''''Category B.''''' Bioethical indicators. How free is individual decision making on matters posing bioethical questions.
* '''''Category C.''''' Drugs indicators. How free is the production, trade and consumption of substances deemed harmful.
* '''''Category D.''''' Sexuality indicators. How free are sexual intercourse, pornography and sex services among consenting adults.
* '''''Category E.''''' Gender &amp; family indicators. How free are women, LGBT individuals and unmarried couples living together.

Each category is made up of various indicators (normally one or two leading indicators adjusted by one or two lesser wheighted ones), the weight of which is set in view of their inferred relevance towards the category's overall score. Countries have been classified towards each category according to the information available in the sources reviewed. All category results and the general index itself are presented in a 0-100 point scale. Countries are classified according to the following intervals:
* 90-100 points – ''Highest moral freedom''
* 80-90 points – ''Very high moral freedom''
* 60-80 points – ''High moral freedom''
* 50-60 points – ''Acceptable moral freedom''
* 40-50 points – ''Insufficient moral freedom''
* 20-40 points – ''Low moral freedom''
* 10-20 points – ''Very low moral freedom''
* 0-10 points – ''Lowest moral freedom''

== Findings of the WIMF's first edition ==

=== State of moral freedom around the world ===
Only one country, the [[Netherlands]], is classified as having the "highest" level of moral freedom by scoring slightly over the 90 points required for that label. Just four countries make it into the upper twenty points, and only ten pass the 75 point threshold. Out of the 160 countries considered, only 64 "pass the exam" and score 50 points or more. And around 30% of all countries fall in the "low", "very low" or "lowest" moral freedom areas of the index. Technology and the cultural globalization that it produces are deemed by the authors to be the most powerful driving forces towards acceptance of individual moral freedom.

=== Netherlands ===
With a three-point (three per cent) advantage over their closest competitor and eight points over the third, the Netherlands top the 2016 country ranking. The Dutch score is twenty-one points higher than the average of all countries enjoying "high" or "very high" moral freedom. For many decades, whenever moral freedom was discussed, the Netherlands had the least interventionist policies. The first country to fight [[human trafficking]] by legalising sex services performed by [[consenting adults]], or to normalize the use of [[cannabis]], or to acknowledge [[same sex marriage]] already in 2001, performs remarkably high in most indicators considered towards the index.

=== Latin countries ===
A trend may be inferred towards international unification of the legal and political approach to moral issues. And that trend favours the Western world's predominant choice for low moral interference by the state. This is particularly noticeable when looking at the index performance of many Southern European and [[Latin American]] countries, which seem to reveal a fast cultural evolution from traditional, conservative values into a laissez-faire approach to morality. Four of the top ten countries are Latin American or Iberian, while six other Latin countries in Southern Europe and the Americas make it to the "high moral freedom" region of the index. The particular performance of countries like [[Portugal]] or [[Uruguay]] is much higher than their recent history would indicate. These and other Latin countries seem to have discarded their traditional background of religiously influenced governance.

=== Islamic countries and other religious-influenced states ===
The fifteen lowest scoring countries at the World Index of Moral Freedom are [[Islamic]] and located in the [[Persian Gulf]], North-Eastern [[Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. This is also true for the region's economically free enclaves in the area. [[Saudi Arabia]] comes last (160th) in the ranking and doesn't even score ten points out of the one hundred potentially available. Only four predominantly Islamic countries obtain more than fifty points: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Turkey]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. A few non Islamic countries also show low levels of moral freedom which the authors consider likely to be due to a strong political leverage held by another [[religion]]. These include [[Belarus]] ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]), [[Israel]] ([[Jewish]]), [[Nepal]] ([[Hinduist]]), the [[Philippines]] ([[Catholic]]), [[Thailand]] ([[Buddhist]]), [[Tonga]] ([[Methodist]]), or [[Tuvalu]] ([[Calvinist]]).

=== Russia ===
In [[Russia]], moral [[conservatism]], derived from either the Orthodox faith or traditional culture, seems to have replaced [[marxism]] as the basis for an ongoing, though softer, social engineering by the state. Russia's score is just in the middle of the classification, a position shared by some of her cultural and political allies, like [[Serbia]] or [[Moldova]], while politically unfree [[Belarus]] falls further below. In all of these countries, the freedom of [[LGBT]] individuals is a matter of particular concern.

=== Communist countries ===
The remaining [[communist]] regimes coerce their citizens into abiding by a moral code based on allegedly scientific views. Freedom of conscience and the practice of any religion are repressed. In the case of the [[People's Republic of China]], decades of limited economic liberalization have not resulted in an equally noticeable moral openness. Two other communist regimes, [[North Korea]] and [[Vietnam]], fall further down into the low moral freedom area, while moral freedom is deemed insufficient in [[Laos]] and just slightly over the fifty point threshold in socialist [[Venezuela]] or in outright communist [[Cuba]].

=== Other findings ===
For different reasons, often including abnormally low scores in a particular set of indicators, a few Western countries which perform reasonably high in other freedom indices rank rather low at the WIMF. [[Hungary]] and [[Norway]] fail to make it into the "high moral freedom" area, although just for under half a point. The [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] performance is particularly low within the moral freedom area. [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[Poland]] and [[Romania]] barely manage to pass the fifty point mark, while [[Singapore]], [[Israel]] or [[South Korea]] fall in the "insufficient moral freedom" part of the index. While most countries topping the WIMF in its first edition belong to the [[developed world]], some countries with a lesser degree of development have also made their way into the higher classification areas. [[Cambodia]], scoring just over seventy points, obtains the fifteenth place in the global classification and is the first developing country in the index. It is also worth noting that the four European micro-states considered −the principalities of [[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]] and the republics of [[San Marino]] and [[Malta]]− score surprisingly low in comparison with their bigger neighbours. In spite of their high [[living standards]] and [[economic freedom]], these countries fail to perform similarly when it comes to moral freedom. A similar situation is observed in Caribbean and South Pacific island micro-states, which score poorly in most categories and rank in the lower areas of the WIMF classification. This similarity between very small countries in different regions, in spite of the cultural influence of their neighbours and allies, may lead to the conclusion that moral freedom is affected, among other relevant factors, by country size.

He was a scholar in [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].  The [[Bible Society of India]]&lt;ref&gt;John Stirling Morley Hooper, Bible Translation in India, Pakistan and Ceylon: Pakistan and Ceylon, [[Oxford University Press]], [[Oxford]], 1963.  Page 57.  [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1oBIAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=y.d.tiwari&amp;dq=y.d.tiwari&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt; entrusted him with revision of the Hindi Bible ''([[New Testament]])'' into a contemporary version.&lt;ref name="Schmalz"&gt;See Matthew N.

==History==
Yisu Das Tiwari was born Badri Prasad Tiwari into a [[Vaishnavite]] family in [[Agra]] in 1911 to [[Smt.]] Rajkunwar and [[Pandit]] Hari Govind Tiwari.&lt;ref name="Ravi Tiwari"&gt;Ravi Tiwari, Christ-bhakta Yesu Das, Dharma Deepika: A South Asian Journal of Missiological Research, Mylapore Institute of Indigenous Studies, [[Chennai]], 2002.  [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wt9iGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=yesu+das+tiwari&amp;lr=]&lt;/ref&gt;  As a growing youth, Tiwari was influenced by [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati]], founder of the [[Arya Samaj]] and [[Swami Rama Tirtha]].&lt;ref name="Ravi Tiwari"/&gt;

It was during his college days, that he came under the influence of Canon Holland, [[E. Stanley Jones]], [[C. F. Andrews]] and others.  After a reading of the [[Gospel according to Saint John]], he took keen interest in the studies of the Bible and devotional writings of Christian mystics.&lt;ref name="Ravi Tiwari"/&gt; [[Jesus Christ]] became his [[Ishta deva]].&lt;ref name="Ravi Tiwari"/&gt; However, his newfound faith did not go well with his family members who sent him for internment to a mental asylum.&lt;ref name="Ravi Tiwari"/&gt;

Tiwari however became a [[Christian]] and chose to be baptised in January 1935&lt;ref name="Schmalz"/&gt; under the aegis of the [[Baptist Missionary Society]].

He later joined [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s Ashram in [[Wardha]] and began to follow Gandhi's teachings.  He swore to uphold [[Satya]] and began to wear [[khadi]] clothes.

Simultaneously, Tiwari began growing in his new-found faith in Jesus Christ and chose to become a [[priest]].  He was [[ordained]] by the [[Baptist Missionary Society]].&lt;ref name="Ravi Tiwari"/&gt;

==Contribution==

===Translation of Scriptures===
It was [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] who first brought out the Hindi Bible&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Arangaden, Carey's Legacy of Bible Translation in J. T. K. Daniel, Roger E. Hedlund (Eds.), Carey's Obligation and India's Renaissance, Council of Serampore College, Serampore, 2005 ''(First published 1993)'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the twentieth century, the Bible Society of India took upon the task of translating the existing versions of the Bible into contemporary versions.  As early as 1956, the Hindi Common Language Translation Panel headed by Y. D. Tiwari came out with the [[Gospel according to Mark]].&lt;ref&gt;Y. D. Tiwari, Gospel according to Mark in Hindi, Lucknow Publishing House, 1956.  {{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id%3DLCfiGwAACAAJ%26dq%3Dyisu+das+tiwari |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520180306/https://books.google.co.in/books?id=LCfiGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=yisu+das+tiwari |archivedate=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In due course of time, the other books of the New Testament were also translated from the original [[Greek language|Greek]] into Hindi.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Serampore.JPG|thumb|215px|left|New look Serampore College on May Day 2006. Tiwari once taught [[Sanskrit]] and Philosophy of Religions here.]] --&gt;

Tiwari began his career as a teacher in schools - Mission School, Kotgarh, Shimla, and Baptist Mission School, Agra, where he was the Head Master, before finally stepping onto the portals of [[seminaries]].&lt;ref name="Ravi Tiwari" /&gt;  He first taught at the North India United Theological College in [[Bareilly]],&lt;ref name="Ravi Tiwari"/&gt; [[Uttar Pradesh]] before he moved to Serampore College, [[Serampore]], [[West Bengal]].  He was Lecturer in Sanskrit and Philosophy of Religions at the Serampore College from 1963&lt;ref name="Serampore"&gt;The Council of Serampore College, The Story of Serampore and its College, Fourth Edition 2005, Serampore.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}} to 1972.&lt;ref name="Serampore"/&gt;{{rp|91}} Notable among his students&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cf.]]'' Wikipedia article on [[D.

==Appraisal==
* [[K. V. Mathew]], [[Ph.D.]] ''([[Edinburgh]])'', Professor of Old Testament, Mar Thoma Theological Seminary, [[Kottayam]]:&lt;ref name="Ravi Tiwari" /&gt;
{{quote|... Tiwari shunned violence.  He was a 'sadhu' indeed.  This doesn't mean that Yesudas was a coward or one who could not endure pain and suffering.  He would endure anything in his body and mind and never cause pain to others.  Being a bystander or witness to violence like a sadist, was not part of his nature.  Being a 'sadhu', he was full of love and compassion.  It was difficult for anyone to pick a fight with Tiwari.  He was willing to lend a helping hand to others at all times.}}

* K. P. Aleaz, [[D. Th.]] ([[South Asia Theological Research Institute]]), Professor of Religions, Bishop's College, Kolkata:&lt;ref name="Ravi Tiwari"/&gt;
{{quote|... He inculcated in students a respect for other religious experiences.  Through his life, he taught that we can be disciples of Jesus without discarding any of our ancestral cultural traits.  He was a typical Indian Christian, whose life proclaimed that Christianity is not a foreign religion.  He was a person who kept constant contact with the people of other religious faiths; a person who was all for dialogue in practice.  He had deep knowledge in Hindu Sanskrit religious texts, but would impart that knowledge to another person only if he found that person fit to receive.}}

==Honours==

===Baptist World Alliance===
In the year 1955, Tiwari gave a talk on "We Preach Christ the Crucified Saviour" in [[London]] during the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the [[Baptist World Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Theodore Ohrn, [[Baptist World Alliance]], Golden Jubilee Congress (9th World Congress) [[London]], 16–22 July 1955, Published by Carey Kingsgate Press, [[London]], 1955.
