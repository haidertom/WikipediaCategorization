      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2549">'''Abraham Rovigo''' (born ca. 1650 in [[Modena]], died 1713 in [[Mantua]]) was a Jewish scholar, rabbi and [[kabbalist]]. He studied in [[Venice]] in the ''[[yeshiva]]'' of [[Moses Zacuto]] and devoted himself to study the [[Kabbalah]]. He was one of the main supporters of the moderate wings of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] and gathered around him many followers of the movement, like [[Behr Perlhefter]], [[Mordechai Mokiach]] and [[Mordechai Ashkenazi]]. In 1700–1701 he spent one year in [[Fürth]], in order to proofread and manage the publishing of the manuscripts of the Zoharic commentary of his pupil Mordecai Ashkenazi. One year later, he and a group of followers settled in the Holy Land.

Rovigo came from a wealthy Modena family, and was dedicated throughout his entire life to studying, collecting, and publishing Kabbalistic manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, Gershom. "Rovigo, Abraham ben Michael." Encyclopaedia Judaica. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. 2nd ed. Vol. 17. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 500-501. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 21 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was a close friend of Benjamin ben Eliezer Ha-Kohen Vitale of Reggio with whom he had studied Kabbalah in Venice under Moses Zacuto. Scholem also mentions in several places the correspondence about Sabbatean affairs he maintained with [[Meir bar Hiyya Rofe]] between the years 1674 and 1678 as a very important source for the history of the Sabbatean movement.&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, Gershom, ''Sabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah: 1626–1676'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1973, p. 771. This correspondence was published by Isaiah Tishby in ''Sefunoth'', III-IV (1960), pp. 71-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19454">The '''appointment of bishops''' in the [[Catholic Church]] is a complicated process. Outgoing [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]], neighbouring bishops, the faithful, the [[Nuncio|apostolic nuncio]], various members of the [[Roman Curia]], and the [[pope]] all have a role in the selection. The exact process varies based upon a number of factors, including whether the bishop is from the [[Latin Church]] or one of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the geographic location of the diocese, what office the candidate is being chosen to fill, and whether the candidate has previously been ordained to the [[Historical episcopate|episcopate]].

==History==
Initially, bishops were chosen by the local clergy with approval from nearby bishops. "A newly elected bishop was installed in office and given his authority [...] by the bishops who supervised the election and performed the ordination."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7ag9W0K9CoC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=patout+%22newly+elected+bishop%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=patout%20%22newly%20elected%20bishop%22&amp;f=false J. Patout Burns, ''Cyprian the Bishop'' (Psychology Press 2002), p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt; The bishops of the most important sees sought acceptance from Rome. The early [[church fathers]] attest to the fact that the Church of Rome - in effect its diocese - was the central point of authority. They attest to the Church's reliance on Rome for advice, for mediation of disputes, and for guidance on doctrinal issues. They note, as [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (ca [[1st century]]) does, that Rome "holds the presidency" among the other churches, and that, as [[Irenaeus]] (ca [[2nd century]]) explains, "because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree" with Rome. They are also clear on the fact that it is [[full communion]] with Rome and the [[bishop of Rome]] that causes one to be in communion with the Catholic Church. This displays a recognition that, as [[Cyprian of Carthage]] ([[3rd century]]) puts it, Rome is "the principal church, in which sacerdotal unity has its source."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l62q-d4Wi20C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=%22the+principal+church,+in+which+sacerdotal+unity+has+its+source.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ze0faR6fDR&amp;sig=s4H4xrtYBXFgeziyF_SErXUIMZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRvvr02dbTAhXMuRQKHWkLCQoQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20principal%20church%2C%20in%20which%20sacerdotal%20unity%20has%20its%20source.%22&amp;f=false W.A. Jurgens (editor), ''The Faith of the Early Fathers'' (Liturgical Press 1970), p. 232]&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, the [[metropolitan bishop]] had a role of the greatest importance in the selection. The Council decreed that the consent of the [[metropolitan bishop]] was normally required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3801.htm Canon 6 of the First Council of Nicaea]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, state authorities demanded their consent for the election of bishops. In [[medieval]] times, rulers demanded not only their consent to an election made by others but the right to choose the bishops directly. The [[Investiture Controversy]] changed that to some extent, but later concessions meant that many kings and other secular authorities exercised a right of appointment or at least of veto until the second half of the [[Christianity in the 20th century|20th century]]. In the early 19th century, this was still so normal that, in spite of the opposition of the Church in Ireland to the proposed [[royal veto of the appointment of bishops]], the Holy See was prepared to grant it to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] king.

It was in 1871 that a radical shift in law and practice began to take place. In that year the [[Law of guarantees]]  gave the pope the right to choose the bishops of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], all 237 of them, appointments that through the [[unification of Italy]] had fallen into the hands of King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]]. Although the pope denounced the law, he nevertheless profited by it to appoint, within the first seven months that followed, 102 new Italian bishops.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xtbLJZOKxx8C&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=Chadwick+%22new+Italian+bishops%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Chadwick%20%22new%20Italian%20bishops%22&amp;f=false Owen Chadwick, ''A History of the Popes, 1830-1914'' (Oxford University Press 2003), p. 239]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xtbLJZOKxx8C&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=Chadwick+%22new+Italian+bishops%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Chadwick%20%22new%20Italian%20bishops%22&amp;f=false John Julius Norwich, ''The Popes: A History'' (Random House 2011), p. 401]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/4093178/Absolute_Monarchs_A_History_of_the_Papa_-_John_Julius_Norwich John Julius Norwich, ''Absolute Monarchs: A History of the Papacy'' (Penguin Random House 2012), chapter 25]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the unification of Italy the various rulers made the appointments, with the pope doing so only for the [[Papal States]]. The [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]] had a similar effect for appointing bishops in the territories ruled by France. In the early 20th century papal appointment of Catholic bishops was an almost universal practice except where, in virtue of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[patronato real]] and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[padroado]], the appointment of Catholic bishops remained in the hands of the civil authorities.

Thus the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]] was able to affirm that, in the [[Latin Church]], the decision rests with the [[pope]]. In the course of the 20th century, remaining privileges enjoyed by secular authorities gradually diminished, especially since the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965), which declared that the right of nominating and appointing bishops belongs ''per se'' exclusively to the competent ecclesiastical authority and requested the civil authorities who still had rights and privileges in this field to renounce them voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19651028_christus-dominus_en.html Second Vatican Council, Decree ''Christus Dominus'', 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pastoral bishops in the Latin Church==

[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1D.HTM Canon 401 §1] of the [[Code of Canon Law]] states that archdiocesan/diocesan bishops (including cardinals) “are requested to” submit their resignation to the pope on reaching the age of 75 years. Some do so earlier with a view to having the resignation take effect immediately on reaching 75. Bishops should also offer their resignation if ill-health or other grave problems render them unsuited for fulfilling their office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1D.HTM Canon 401 §2]&lt;/ref&gt; The letter of resignation goes first to the [[apostolic nuncio]] or [[apostolic delegate]], the pope's representative in the country or region. He  forwards it to whichever department of the [[Holy See]] has particular responsibility for the selection of bishops for the country in question: the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]] in the case of mission countries, the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]] in the case of even [[Latin Church|Latin]] bishops in certain Middle Eastern countries and Greece, the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Secretariat of State]] if the country's government has been given the right to present objections of "a general political nature" (not of a party-political kind) or is involved in some other way, but generally the [[Congregation for Bishops]]. The Congregation presents the bishop's offer of resignation to the pope, who has a range of options from rejecting the offer of resignation to accepting it with immediate effect. In the case of diocesan bishops who have reached 75 years of age, the usual decision is to accept the resignation but with effect only from the date of publication of the appointment of a successor, a decision known as acceptance ''[[nunc pro tunc]]'' (now for then).

If the resignation is accepted with immediate effect, the episcopal see becomes vacant on publication of the pope's decision. Vacancy of a see may occur also because of a bishop's transfer to another see or position, or because of his death. In the case of a ''nunc pro tunc'' acceptance, the see does not become vacant immediately, but the process that leads to the appointment of a successor begins without delay.

One important element in selecting a bishop is the list of priests, of both the diocesan and the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] clergy, that the bishops of the ecclesiastical province or the whole [[Episcopal Conference]] judge to be suitable generically (without reference to any particular see) for appointment as bishops. They are required to draw up this list at least once every three years, so that it is always recent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1C.HTM Canon 377 §2]&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to a concrete appointment for a particular see, the papal representative (apostolic nuncio or delegate) asks either the outgoing bishop, or in case of a ''[[sede vacante]]'', the [[vicar general]] or [[diocesan administrator]], to draw up a report on its situation and the needs.  That person will be the bishop who has presented his resignation or, if the see is vacant, the [[diocesan administrator]] or [[apostolic administrator]]. The papal representative is also obliged to consult the [[Metropolitan archbishop#Roman Catholic|metropolitan archbishop]] and the other bishops of the province, the president of the bishops conference, and at least some members of the [[Consultor|college of consultors]] and the [[cathedral chapter]].  He may also consult others, whether clergy, diocesan or religious, and "lay persons of outstanding wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1C.HTM Canon 377 §3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Circular Letter No. 1550/72 of 25 March 1972 from the Council of the Public Affairs of the Church ([[Acta Apostolicae Sedis|AAS]] 64, 1972, pp. 386 ff.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon law insists on enabling those consulted to provide information and express their views confidentially, requiring that they be consulted "individually and in secret".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1C.HTM Canon 377 §3], towards end&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, when the ''[[Irish Times]]'' of 12 April 2007 published the text of the letter with which  Archbishop [[Giuseppe Lazzarotto]], [[Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland|Nuncio to Ireland]], consulted certain priests on the choice of their next bishop, he said, "All aspects relating to the process of episcopal appointments should be dealt with in the strictest confidentiality. I trust that you will understand that I cannot depart from this practice."

The nuncio then decides on a short list, or ''terna'', of three candidates for further investigation and seeks precise information on each of them. Since if it were widely known that a priest who was not the one who was finally chosen for the post had been under consideration, people might think he had been excluded because of some fault found in him (a groundless conclusion, since all those examined may be eminently worthy and suitable, but only one can be selected), the nuncio will ask those consulted about individual candidates to observe the strictest confidentiality on the fact of the consultation.  He will then send to the Holy See a list (known as a "terna") of the (usually) three candidates that seem to be the most appropriate for consideration, together with all the information that has been gathered on them and accompanying the information with the conclusions that he himself draws from the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1C.HTM Canon 377 §3], final words; cf. [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1A.HTM canon 364, 4°]&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualities that a candidate must have are listed in canon [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1C.HTM 378 §1.]  As well as being at least 35 years old and a priest for at least 5 years, he should be "outstanding in strong faith, good morals, piety, zeal for souls, wisdom, prudence and human virtues", and should possess the other qualities needed for fulfilling the office in question; and he should be well versed in sacred Scripture, theology and canon law and, preferably, hold a doctorate in one of these fields.

The [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|congregation]] of the [[Roman Curia]] responsible for the appointment (one of the four indicated above) studies the documentation provided by the nuncio, taking into consideration his opinion, but not necessarily accepting it. It might even reject all the candidates he has proposed and ask him to prepare another list, or it might ask him to provide more information on one or more of the priests who have already been presented. When the Congregation decides on which priest should be appointed, it presents its conclusions to the pope, asking him to make the appointment. If he agrees, the papal act is communicated to the nuncio for him to obtain the consent of the priest to his appointment and to choose a date for its publication.  The newly appointed bishop is obliged to get episcopal consecration within three months of the arrival the [[papal bull]] of his appointment, which is usually prepared only at least a month after the publication. If the consecration takes place within the diocese, he takes charge immediately.  If it occurs elsewhere, a separate act is required, after the consecration, for taking possession of his new post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1C.HTM Canon 379]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing the process to a conclusion obviously requires much time, usually taking at least nine months, and it may on occasions take up to two years.

The procedure described above is the normal one for the appointment of a diocesan bishop. In the case of an [[auxiliary bishop]], the diocesan bishop chooses the three priests to be presented for the appointment, but the nuncio still has the duty of gathering information and opinions on the candidates, and the Congregation can either select one of them or ask for a different list of candidates to be presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1C.HTM Canon 377 §4]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, the diocesan [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] or some other body decides on the three names to send, through the nuncio, to the Holy See. With the names, the nuncio sends the information he has gathered on the candidates. If none of the three candidates is acceptable to the Holy See, the chapter is asked for another list. However, the Holy See can reject the list in its entirety and appoint someone not proposed by the chapter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942471-2,00.html Time Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases the cathedral chapter chooses the bishop from among a list of three presented to them by the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Steinberg, ''Why Switzerland'' (Cambridge University Press 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-521-48453-4}}), p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapter participates in the election of bishops of 13 of the 27 German dioceses ([[Bishop of Aachen|Aachen]], [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Bishop of Essen|Essen]], [[Archdiocese of Freiburg|Freiburg]], [[Diocese of Fulda|Fulda]], [[Bishop of Hildesheim|Hildesheim]], [[Diocese of Limburg|Limburg]], [[Bishop of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Münster|Münster]], [[Bishop of Osnabrück|Osnabrúck]], [[Archdiocese of Paderborn|Paderborn]], [[Bishop of Rottenburg-Stuttgart|Rottenburg-Stuttgart]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]]), 3 Swiss dioceses ([[Bishopric of Basel|Basel]], [[Diocese of Chur|Chur]], [[Bishop of St. Gallen|Sankt Gallen]]), and 1 Austrian ([[Archdiocese of Salzburg|Salzburg]]).&lt;ref&gt;Monica-Elena Herghelegiu, ''Reservatio Papalis'' (LIT Verlag, Münster 2008 {{ISBN|978-3-8258-1665-0}}), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Personal Ordinariate|Personal Ordinarates]] established under the [[apostolic constitution]] ''Anglicanorum Coetibus'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_ben-xvi_apc_20091104_anglicanorum-coetibus.html ''Anglicanorum Coetibus'']&lt;/ref&gt; out of respect for the synodal tradition of Anglicanism, the Ordinary will be appointed by the Roman Pontiff from a terna of names presented by the Governing Council (CN Art. 4 § 1)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20091104_norme-anglicanorum-coetibus_en.html Complementary Norms]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, privileges regarding the appointment of bishops were granted to kings and other civil authorities. In accordance with the decision of the [[Second Vatican Council]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19651028_christus-dominus_en.html ''Christus Dominus'', 20]&lt;/ref&gt; the Code of Canon Law lays down that "for the future, no rights or privileges of election, appointment, presentation or designation of Bishops are conceded to civil authorities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1C.HTM Canon 377 §5]&lt;/ref&gt; In about a dozen countries, the civil government still has the right of consultation or even of presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Herghelegiu 2008, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Catholic Churches==
There are 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] totalling about 20 million people that are in communion with the [[Holy See]] but their liturgy and other practices are different. A [[patriarch]]al Eastern Catholic church itself elects its bishops who are to serve within its own territory, but other bishops are appointed by the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_VII Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 181]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the election of a bishop, the patriarchal synod considers the names proposed by its members and draws up a list of those it considers to be valid candidates for episcopacy; this is communicated to the Pope and any name for which he refuses his assent is removed from the list.&lt;ref&gt;Canon 182&lt;/ref&gt; When the synod then comes to elect a bishop, no further procedure is required if the person chosen is on the list; but if he is not on the list, the assent of the Pope is needed before asking the newly elected to accept his election.&lt;ref&gt;Canons 184–185&lt;/ref&gt; The same arrangement holds for a Church headed by a [[Major Archbishop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_V Canon 152]&lt;/ref&gt; In the official bulletins and news media of the Holy See, these appointments are published as decisions of the Eastern Church in question, not of the Pope. The procedure for appointing bishops of other Eastern Churches and those bishops of patriarchal and major archiepiscopal Churches who are to serve outside the territory of the Church in question is similar to that for Latin bishops, and the appointments are published as acts of the Pope.

The '''Battle of Gujrat''' was a decisive battle in the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]], fought on 21 February 1849, between the forces of the [[East India Company]], and a [[Sikh]] army in rebellion against the Company's control of the [[Sikh Empire]], represented by the child Maharaja [[Duleep Singh]] who was in British custody in [[Lahore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V12_380.gif Gujrat Town - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 12, p. 374.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikh army was defeated by the [[British Army|British]] regular and [[Bengal Army]] forces of the [[British East India Company]]. After it capitulated a few days later, the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] was annexed to the East India Company's territories and Duleep Singh was deposed.

==Outbreak and course of the war==
After the British victory in the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]], the Punjab was indirectly governed by a British representative at the [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]] (court) in [[Lahore]] and Agents in several of the regions. The Sikh Army, the [[Khalsa]], was kept in being and used to keep order in the Punjab and [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West Frontier]] Region. The Khalsa regarded itself as betrayed rather than defeated in the first war, and several of its Sardars (Generals) plotted rebellion.

However, the first outbreak came at [[Multan]] on 18 April 1848, where rebellious troops murdered a British agent (Lieutenant Patrick Vans Agnew) and expelled a Sirdar imposed as ruler by the British Resident at Lahore. The former ruler, [[Dewan Mulraj]], resumed his authority and prepared for a siege. Rather than use large forces from the British and Bengal Armies during the hot weather and [[monsoon]] seasons, the Governor General of Bengal, [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], deployed part of the Khalsa and other irregular contingents against Mulraj. On 14 September, the troops from the Khalsa besieging Multan under Sardar [[Sher Singh Attariwalla]] also rebelled. They did not join Mulraj however, but moved north along the [[Chenab River]] into the main Sikh-populated area of the Punjab to gather recruits and obtain supplies.

Late in 1848, a large British and Bengal army took the field during the cold weather season under the Commander in Chief of the Bengal Army, General Sir [[Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough|Hugh Gough]]. Gough already had a reputation, whether deserved or not, for unimaginative head-on tactics. On 22 November at [[Battle of Ramnagar|Ramnagar]], his cavalry were repulsed attacking a Sikh bridgehead on the east bank of the Chenab. Then on 13 January 1849, he launched a hasty frontal attack against Sher Singh's army at [[Battle of Chillianwala|Chillianwala]] near the [[Jhelum River]] and was driven back with heavy casualties. Several days' heavy rain followed, preventing either army from renewing the battle. After they had faced each other for three days, both withdrew.

==Prelude to the Battle==
[[File:Martens (Henry) The Battle of Goojerat, on the 21st February 1849, hand-coloured aquatint by J. Harris after Marten, image ., R. Ackermann, 1850.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Goojerat, on 21 February 1849, hand-coloured aquatint by J. Harris after Marten, image ., R. Ackermann, 1850]]
Rather than launch a counter-attack against Gough, Sher Singh's aim was to join forces with the troops under his father, Sardar [[Chattar Singh Attariwalla]]. Chattar Singh's army had been confined to the [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara region]] for several months by [[Muslim]] irregulars under British officers. At the start of 1849, Amir [[Dost Mohammed Khan]] of [[Afghanistan]] had sided with the rebellious Sikhs. His aim was to recover the area around [[Peshawar]], which had been conquered by [[Ranjit Singh]] early in the nineteenth century, but his support was half-hearted.&lt;ref name="IGI39"&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_047.gif Afghānistān - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 5, p. 39.]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, when 3,500 Afghan horsemen approached the vital fort of [[Attock]] on the [[Indus River]], its garrison of Muslim troops defected. This allowed Chattar Singh to move out of Hazara and link up with Sher Singh near [[Rawalpindi]].

On the British side, once news of Chillianwala reached Britain, Gough was almost immediately superseded. His replacement was General [[Charles James Napier]], who would require several weeks to travel from England. In the meantime, the [[Siege of Multan]] had resumed, and Mulraj was forced to surrender on 22 January. This allowed the bulk of the besieging force to reinforce Gough's army. In particular, they brought large numbers of heavy guns with them. Gough, who had now received word of his dismissal but who remained in command until formally relieved, advanced against the Sikh army. He had three infantry divisions and a large cavalry force, with 100 guns of various weights and calibres.

In spite of his successes, Sher Singh, who commanded the combined Sikh forces, was running out of strategic options. His large army was unable to find enough food. Any move north or west to obtain supplies would involve abandoning the main Sikh-populated area of the Punjab and moving into potentially hostile Muslim areas. He therefore attempted a bold outflanking move against Gough. His army moved east, intending to cross the Chenab and then move south before crossing the river again to attack Gough from the rear. When they reached the river, they found it swollen by heavy rains, and the few fords were defended by irregular Muslim cavalry under British officers, later reinforced by some of the troops marching up from Multan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Charles|authorlink = Charles Allen (writer)|title=Soldier Sahibs|publisher=Abacus|year=2000|pages=195–196|isbn=0-349-11456-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
[[File:Battle of Googerat.jpg|thumb|Map of the battle]]
Sher Singh withdrew to Gujrat, where his army hastily prepared a defensive position. The Sikhs constructed a double entrenchment, which was also protected by a ravine. Most of the artillery was grouped in a central battery, screened by hastily planted bushes. The cavalry was deployed on the flanks. Several small villages in advance of the central battery were occupied by infantry, and the houses and buildings were prepared with "loopholes" for defence.&lt;ref&gt;Hernon, p.601&lt;/ref&gt; Although the position was strong, it was exposed to British artillery fire, and the hastily erected screen of brush was not as effective as the belts of scrub and jungle which had hidden the Sikh artillery from view at Chillianwala.

Early on 21 February, Gough advanced against this position. When the Sikh artillery opened fire and disclosed their position, Gough deployed his large numbers of heavy guns against them. In a three-hour artillery duel, the Sikhs were forced to abandon their guns. Sikh and Indian sources were later to refer to the battle as the "Battle of the Guns". Once the Sikh artillery was largely silenced, the British infantry advanced. There was desperate hand-to-hand fighting for the small fortified villages of Burra Kalra and Chota Kalra.&lt;ref&gt;Hernon, p.602&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British guns were being advanced in successive "bounds", and the Sikhs broke. Gough reported after the battle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The heavy artillery continued to advance with extraordinary celerity, taking up successive forward positions, driving the enemy from those [positions] they had retired to, whilst the rapid advance and beautiful fire of the Horse Artillery and light field-batteries ... broke the ranks of the enemy at all points. The whole infantry line now rapidly advanced and drove the enemy before it; the ''nulla'' [ravine] was cleared, several villages stormed, the guns that were in position carried, the camp captured and the enemy routed in every direction&lt;ref&gt;Hernon, pp.602-603&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bengal Horse Artillery and British and Indian cavalry took up a ruthless and merciless pursuit, which turned the Sikh retreat into a rout over {{convert|12|mi|km}}.

==Aftermath==
The next day, a division under Major General [[Sir Walter Gilbert]] took up the pursuit. The remnants of Sher Singh's forces retreated across the Jhelum and into progressively rougher country for eleven days, but Sher Singh was finally forced to agree to British terms for surrender. His army, reduced to 20,000 men (mainly irregular cavalry) and 10 guns, handed over its arms at a two-day ceremony on 12 March and disbanded.

The small Afghan contingent also hastily retreated, destroying the pontoon bridge at Attock behind them. Dost Mohammed later concluded a peace with the East India Company, acknowledging their possession of the Peshawar region.&lt;ref name="IGI39"/&gt;

The Punjab was formally annexed to British territory at Lahore on 2 April.

At the end of his career, Gough had finally fought a model battle, using his vast superiority in heavy guns to drive Sher Singh's troops from their position without resorting to the bayonet as he usually did, and turning their retreat into a rout with his cavalry and horse artillery. He had also been able to operate for the first time without receiving contradictory instructions from Dalhousie. Throughout the war, Dalhousie had alternately goaded on and restrained Gough, usually at the most inconvenient moments.

After the British had withdrawn at Chillianwala, Sikh and other irregulars showed no mercy to abandoned British combatant wounded and the British at Gujrat showed no mercy to surrendered or fleeing enemies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} However, both sides' documented war records show a deep level of respect and admiration for each other fighting prowess.

'''Beit Shemesh''' ({{lang-he-n|בֵּית שֶׁמֶשׁ}},; {{lang-ar|بيت شيمش}}; {{lang-la|Bethsames}}, ''Beth Shamesh'', ''Bethshamesh'' or ''Bet shemesh'' and most often '''Beth-Shemesh''' in [[English translations of the bible|English translations]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]]) is a [[city council (Israel)|city]] located approximately {{convert|30|km|mi}} west of [[Jerusalem]] in [[Israel]]'s [[Jerusalem District]], with a population of {{Israel populations|Bet Shemesh}} in {{Israel populations|Year}}.{{Israel populations|reference}} The history of Beit Shemesh goes back to pre-biblical times. The modern city of Beit Shemesh was founded in 1950.

==History==

===Canaanite and Israelite town===
The ancient city of Beit Shemesh ("house of the sun" or "temple of the sun" in Hebrew) was originally named after the [[Canaan]]ite sun-goddess [[Shapash (Canaanite goddess)|Shemesh]], who was worshipped there in antiquity. The ruins of the ancient biblical city  are located at a site called Tel Beit Shemesh (Tell er-Rumeileh), a [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] located near the modern city.&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt; In the [[Amarna letters]] Shamash is mentioned several times, along with Addu, as one of the greatest gods: the Pharaoh is "like Addu and Shamash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DnWGAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=beth+shemesh+shamash&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Israel |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Beth-Shemesh was shared by (at least) two other places in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and one more in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;BibleHub.com, ''Beth Shemesh'', quoting [[Strong's Concordance]] etc.  [http://biblehub.com/hebrew/1053.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beit Shemesh is first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the [[Book of Joshua]],&lt;ref&gt;Joshua 15:10&lt;/ref&gt; as a city in the territory of the [[tribe of Judah]] on the border between their territory and that of the [[tribe of Dan]]. In {{bibleverse||Joshua|21:16|HE}}, this city was set aside as one of the [[13 Kohanic cities]] for the priests of the [[Levite|tribe of Levi]], the [[Kohen|Kohanim]].

Another city by the same name, Beit Shemesh, is later mentioned in {{bibleverse||Joshua|19:38|HE}}, being situated in the territory of the [[tribe of Naphtali]].

The city located in the territorial bounds of the tribe of Judah is mentioned in the 6th chapter of [[1 Samuel]] as being the first city encountered by the [[Ark of the Covenant]] on its way back from [[Philistines|Philistia]] after having been [[Philistine captivity of the Ark|captured]] by the [[Philistines]] in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|6:12-21|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone on which the Ark was placed is recorded as still being located there at the time of writing the Books of Samuel. In the [[King James Version]] this stone is described as "the great stone of Abel".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|6:18|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Books of Kings|2 Kings 14]], Beit Shemesh is again mentioned as being the site of the battle between [[Amaziah of Judah|Amaziah]] king of [[Judea]] and [[Jehoash of Israel|Jehoash]] king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]].

After the destruction of much of Judah by [[Sennacherib]] in 701 BCE, the city was abandoned for a while, but there seems to have been an attempt by a group of Judahites at resettling Beth Shemesh, judging by the refurbishing of the water reservoir in the 7th century BCE.&lt;ref name="TAU2000"/&gt; However, after the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] conquest of Judah in the early 580s, either the new Babylonian rulers, or the nearby Philistine metropolis of Ekron favoured by them, apparently put an end to the initiative by sealing and covering over the vital water reservoir,&lt;ref name="TAU2000"&gt;Shlomo Bunimovitz and Zvi Lederman, ''Beth-Shemesh: A Biblical Border City between Judah and Philistia'', Tel Aviv University, 2000  [http://www.tau.ac.il/~archpubs/projects/bethshemesh_project.html], retrieved 2016-09-01&lt;/ref&gt; which was not uncovered until 2004. During the first Jewish [[Babylonian captivity|return]], at the beginning of the [[Second Temple period]], there was no lasting revival of the city, as opposed to many other places in the vicinity such as [[Beit Guvrin, Israel|Beit Guvrin]],{{dubious|Did any settlement even exist at Bet Guvrin at the time of the Return? BG came up only after the destruction of Maresha in 40 BCE|date=January 2016}} [[Maresha]], and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}{{dubious|W/o source, it is hard to know if these places were continuously populated by Judahites remaining on the land, or by the (relatively very few) returnees from Babylon.|date=September 2016}} Consequently, the small Arab towns of Dayr Raban and [[Dayr Rafat]] used rocks for building from this very ancient source.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Byzantine period===
A monastery and other remains from the Byzantine period have been found on the tell.&lt;ref name="Dauphin"&gt;{{cite book |author=Claudine Dauphin |title=La Palestine byzantine, Peuplement et Populations, Vol. III: Catalogue |series=BAR International Series 726 |year=1998 |publisher=Archeopress |location=Oxford |page=909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Ottoman period===
{{Main article|Dayr Aban}}
In the late 19th century the area was known as 'Ain Shems or Khirbet 'Ain Shems and was used as a temporary harvest-time residence by local Arabs.&lt;ref name="SWPIII"&gt;{{cite book |author1=C. R. Conder |author2=H. H.

===1948 War===
During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the [[Egyptian Army|Egyptian army]] invaded the area and set up a fortified post, called "Mishlat" in Hebrew, on a hill overlooking Beit Shemesh, within the Arab-village [[Dayr Aban]]. The post changed hands several times during fighting. The [[Harel Brigade]] occupied part of the post for several months giving rise to the name "the joint post" or the "Mishlat HaMeshutaf" with 60 meters dividing them and the enemy forces. The Mishlat was finally taken by the Harel force in the [[Operation Ha-Har|Ha-Har offensive]] during the night of 19–20 October 1948.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Beit Shemesh is the point from which the so-called [[Convoy of 35]] set out to bring provisions to besieged [[Gush Etzion]]. On 15 January 1948 a group of 38 [[Palmach]] volunteers left [[Hartuv]] near Beit Shemesh. After one member of the group sprained his ankle, the group, now numbering 35, continued on its way. Their presence was discovered by two Arab women who encountered two scouts of the group near [[Surif]]; an earlier version, that the soldiers were discovered by an Arab shepherd who they graciously let go, was based on a eulogy written by Ben-Gurion and is apparently apocryphal).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/1.5043465 The legend of ambushed Palmach squad '35'] Haaretz, 27 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===State of Israel===
On 6 December 1950, the [[Hartuv]] [[displaced person]]s camp "[[Ma'abarot|Ma'abarat]] Har-Tuv" was established on the site of the current-day Moshav [[Naham]]. The first inhabitants were [[History of the Jews in Bulgaria|Jewish Bulgaria]]n immigrants. They were joined by more Jewish immigrants from Bulgaria, [[History of the Jews in Iran|Iran]], [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraq]], [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romania]], [[History of the Jews in Morocco|Morocco]] and [[Kurdish Jews|Kurdistan]]. In 1952 the first permanent houses were built in Beit Shemesh. Prior to 1948 the Ramat Beit Shemesh neighborhood area was the site belonging to the Arab village [[Bayt Nattif]]. This village was built on remnants of an ancient Judean town, with various remnants of Jewish settlement from the time, such as a mosaic floor, wineries and other remains, especially from the period of the [[Hasmonean]] kings and earlier. This area is currently under dispute about preservation, having been the subject of a [[grassroots]] campaign.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In its early years, Beit Shemesh came to typify the "[[Development town|Development Town]]" with a largely [[North Africa]]n immigrant population. In 1977, following a writeup in [[Haaretz]] newspaper, Beit Shemesh was perceived as the main outpost for [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud]] party. He promised to rehabilitate neighborhoods and when Likud came to power that year, investment in the city increased.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

When the city was built in the 1950s, it was initially settled by [[olim|new immigrants]] from [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. In the 1990s, the city saw a large influx of new immigrants from the former [[Soviet Union]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[English-speaking countries]], turning it into a major center for Anglo immigrants. Considerable numbers have come from [[North America]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]]. This population tends to be Orthodox, educated and from middle income groups. At the same time, Orthodox Jews from within Israel also began moving to the city, seeking roomier, low-cost housing.&lt;ref name=times&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-growing-pains-of-beit-shemesh/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forward1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Building a Bit of America in Beit Shemesh |author=Nathan Jeffay|url=http://forward.com/articles/14949/ |newspaper=The Jewish Daily Forward|date=15 January 2009|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a city councillor, there were no [[Haredi Judaism|Haredim]] in Beit Shemesh before the 1990s.&lt;ref name="GuardianOct2001"/&gt; Since then, Beit Shemesh has become increasingly [[Orthodox Judaism|religious]], with a large Haredi sector. Many [[synagogue]]s and [[yeshiva]]s have been built in the city. Religious communities represented in Beit Shemesh include [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]], [[Shomer Emunim (Hasidic dynasty)|Shomer Emunim]], [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] and [[Neturei Karta]]. In 2011 Haredim made up 40% of the population, of which an estimated 50 or 60 families with great influence are militant.&lt;ref name="GuardianOct2001"/&gt; According to statistics published by the municipality, 63% of the city's schoolchildren in 2010 were Haredim.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt; 75% of the children entering the first grade in the 2012/2013 academic year will be registered in official Haredi institutions.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.411748"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/three-quarters-of-beit-shemesh-first-graders-will-attend-ultra-orthodox-schools-next-year-1.411748| title= Three quarters of Beit Shemesh first-graders will attend ultra-Orthodox schools next year| work=[[Haaretz]]| author=Ettinger, Yair| date= 8 February 2012| accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Beit Shemesh is expected to reach 150,000 in 2020.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/black-and-white-in-color-1.312923| title= Black and white in color| work=[[Haaretz]]| author=Ettinger, Yair| date= 8 September 2010| accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban development==
{{See also|Ramat Beit Shemesh}}
Two new areas, the Nahala UMenucha neighborhood, and Ramat Beit Shemesh, were built in the 1990s, doubling the size of the city.

[[Ramat Beit Shemesh]] ("Beit Shemesh Heights") is an expansion that lies directly adjacent to, and to the south of, the original part of Beit Shemesh, colloquially referred to as "Old Beit Shemesh". It is located on a hill overlooking the old town. Ramat Beit Shemesh has a large, diverse Orthodox population. Originally, it consisted of two areas: ''Ramat Beit Shemesh Alef'' and ''Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet''. In ''Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet'', families belonging to [[Eda Haredit]] constitute the majority.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt; In 2002, following tensions between the Haredi and non-religious population, plans were drawn up to build another secular neighborhood, HaShachar. In 2007, [[Ramat Shilo]], considered a [[subdistrict]] of Ramat Beit Shemesh, with both [[Dati Leumi]] and Haredi residents was built. In 2009, it was announced that a new neighborhood, ''[[Ramat_Beit_Shemesh#Ramat_Beit_Shemesh_Gimmel|Ramat Beit Shemesh Gimmel]]'', would be built as a largely Haredi neighborhood on a large block of state-owned land bordering southern Beit Shemesh.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt; In 2016 the Israeli Land Authority published tenders for 3,268 new apartments, to be built in the newly proposed areas of ''Ramat Beit Shemesh Dalet and Hey.'' According to plans, ultimately there are to be 8,300 new apartments in ''RBS Dalet'' alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/374066/tender-publicized-for-3268-housing-units-in-beit-shemesh.html|title=Tender Publicized for 3,268 Housing Units in Beit Shemesh |date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beit Shemesh also has an [[urban kibbutz]] affiliated with the [[Kibbutz Movement]], Tamuz, founded in 1987.

The large English-speaking community is concentrated in Ramat Beit Shemesh Alef, as well as in the Sheinfeld, Nofei Aviv, Migdal HaMayim and Givat Sharett neighborhoods of "Old Beit Shemesh".
[[File:View of Beit Shemesh.jpg|thumb|Beit Shemesh as seen from Tzora (Zorah) mountain]]

Beit Shemesh is developing rapidly, and under a current masterplan approved by the Israeli government in 2017, Beit Shemesh will double in population, to more than 200,000 residents, with 17,000 new housing units built along with 130 acres zoned as new commercial space for businesses and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;http://hamodia.com/2017/04/03/netanyahu-beit-shemesh-will-double-size/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-beit-shemesh-to-double-in-size-1001184442&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that the city could be home to as many as 250,000 residents by 2025. A new commercial center in the Ramat Beit Shemesh neighborhood is planned to be the city's largest.&lt;ref&gt;https://real-invest.co.il/?p=3558&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local government==
The mayor of Beit Shemesh, Moshe Abutbul, is a member of [[Shas]]. The deputy-mayor, Shmuel Greenberg, is a member of [[United Torah Judaism]] (UTJ).&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.411748"/&gt; ''Haaretz'' quotes Abutbul as saying: "Beit Shemesh is not a Haredi city and will not be one."&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt; In the 2009 elections, Shas and UTJ won nine seats in the 21-seat municipal council, one seat went to a new Haredi party called Tov.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt;

Formerly a Likud stronghold, in the 2006 Knesset elections United Torah Judaism became the city's strongest party, with 22.2 percent of the votes and Shas getting 19.9 percent. In 2009 Likud regained its primacy, obtaining 22.2 percent of the votes, and Shas also gained, garnering 20.9 percent, with United Torah Judaism a close third at 20.6 percent. Eda Haredit boycott the elections.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt;

===2013 municipal elections===
During the municipal elections held on 22 October 2013, acting on several anonymous tips, police raided several private residences and recovered 200 ID cards and disguising materials such as hats, glasses and wigs which law enforcement suspected were used or going to be used for fraudulent voting. Additionally, eight people were arrested on suspicion for engaging and coordinating fraudulent voting activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/200-fake-IDs-seized-in-Beit-Shemesh-in-attempted-voter-fraud-329446 200 IDs seized in Beit Shemesh in suspected voter fraud] The Jerusalem Post, 22 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2013 a three judge panel of the Jerusalem District Court nullified the results of the October municipal elections due to voter fraud and ordered a new election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Court-orders-new-elections-in-Beit-Shemesh-nullifies-old-results-due-to-massive-fraud-336240 Court orders new elections in Beit Shemesh] The Jerusalem Post, 26 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an unprecedented 76% voter turnout rate, incumbent mayor Moshe Abutbul beat contender Eli Cohen with a 51% majority vote during the reelection which took place on 11 March 2014.

The city has [[Association football|soccer]] teams including juniors, seniors and over-35s teams and boasted a franchise in the [[Israel Baseball League]]. The [[Bet Shemesh Blue Sox|Beit Shemesh Blue Sox]] represented Beit Shemesh in the league's only season, though they played their games at [[Kibbutz Gezer Field|Gezer Field]] in [[Kibbutz]] Gezer due to a lack of proper facilities in Beit Shemesh. There is also a very active Little League in Beit Shemesh and Ramat Beit Shemesh, with over 300 members.

{{main article|Island of Peace massacre}}
On 13 March 1997, seven 13 and 14-year-old girls from Beit Shemesh's [[AMIT]] Feurst School were killed at the "[[Island of Peace]]" site in [[Naharayim]] by a [[Jordanian Armed Forces|Jordanian soldier]] while they were visiting the joint Israeli and Jordanian tourist resort under [[Jordan]]ian rule on a class trip.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordanian Soldier Kills 7 Israeli Schoolgirls |author=Serge Schmemann |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/14/world/jordanian-soldier-kills-7-israeli-schoolgirls.html?scp=cse&amp;pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |date=13 March 1997 |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] of Jordan went to Beit Shemesh a few days after the massacre to extend his condolences and ask forgiveness in the name of his country, a step which was seen as both courageous and touching.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

==Gender issues and inter-communal tensions==
In 2004 the Israel Association of Ethiopian Jews claimed that Ethiopian Jews working for the municipality were being paid below-minimum wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/beit-shemesh-program-pays-ethiopian-immigrants-less-than-minimum-wage-1.145260|title=Beit shemesh program pays Ethiopian immigrants less than minimum wage|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=27 December 2004 | accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the opening of Orot Banot [[National Religious|national-religious]] girls’ school in September 2011, groups of Haredi extremists gathered in front of the school, calling the girls names and spitting at them when they headed to and from school.

==Archaeology==
[[File:Beit Shemesh - New and Old.jpg|thumb|Old wall of the ancient ruin, Beit Shemesh]]
[[File:Mb gate tbs.png|thumb|right|Middle Bronze gate system unearthed at Tel Beth-Shemesh]]

In 1971, excavations at Givat Sharett conducted by Israeli archaeologist Claire Epstein revealed a residential settlement of the Middle Bronze Age, including a temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/epstein-claire |title=Claire Epstein, Jewish Women Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most ancient [[History of ferrous metallurgy|iron workshop]] in the world was discovered in Beit Shemesh in 2003. The only remnants of a [[Defensive wall|fortified city]] with an advanced water system, from the time of the early [[Kingdom of Judah]] was found here. The bones of animals found in the 12th–11th centuries BCE layer indicate a diet typical of the [[Israelites]] who inhabited the hill country in this period. These together with the pottery finds indicate the cultural influences on the inhabitants of this border town. However, it is not possible to determine their specific ethnic identity, which could be [[Canaan]]ite, [[Philistine]] or [[Israelite]].&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt;

In August 2012 archaeologists from [[Tel Aviv University]] announced the discovery of a circular stone seal, approximately 15 millimetres in diameter. The seal was found on the floor of a house at Beit Shemesh and is dated to the 12th century BCE. According to [[Haaretz]], "excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University say they do not suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal."&lt;ref name="Hasson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasson|first=Nir|title=National Seal found by Israeli archeologists may give substance to Samson legend|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/seal-found-by-israeli-archeologists-may-give-substance-to-samson-legend-1.454504|accessdate=3 September 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=30 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal bones found nearby may also be a clue to boundary disputes between different cultures. Pig bones have been found a few kilometres from Beit Shemesh, but only a few have been found actually at Beit Shemesh and at some point during the 11th century BCE it appears that the local population stopped eating pig. Haaretz reports that "According to Bunimovitz, when the pork-eating Philistines arrived in the country from the Aegean, the local people stopped eating pork to differentiate themselves from the newcomers."&lt;ref name="Hasson"/&gt;

In 2014, archaeologists Irene Zilberbod and Tehila Libman announced the nearby discovery of a large compound from the Byzantine period that was most probably a monastery.&lt;ref name=Monastery&gt;{{cite news | title = Archaeologists discover impressive Byzantine-era compound near Beit Shemesh | author = Nir Hasson | newspaper = Haaretz | date = 20 September 2014 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium-1.616721}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised a residential area and an industrial area with wine and olive presses.&lt;ref name=Monastery/&gt; The remains of buildings with two or three stories and impressive mosaic floors were discovered.&lt;ref name=Monastery/&gt; The compound ceased to function in the early Muslim period and was subsequently occupied by other residents.&lt;ref name=Monastery/&gt;
The excavations were continuing with additional finds through late 2017.&lt;ref name="JPostMonasteryDecember2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Artifacts-from-1500-year-old-monastery-and-church-unearthed-in-Beit-Shemesh-518558 |title= Artifacts from 1,500-year-old Monastery and Church unearthed in Beit Shemesh |author= Daniel K.

In 2005, the [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] decided to put all military ministry training at the same location. While it was authorized, funding was not part of the BRAC, and the Air Force departed Ft Jackson in 2012, currently leaving only the Army and Navy at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Center. &lt;ref name=NCSCgrad /&gt;

The purpose of the AFCC was to have closer cooperation among the three chaplain corps and to share instruction and training. While that was the goal, the core curriculums were maintained by the three service schools and a joint program of instruction (POI) was never created. &lt;ref name=NCSCgrad /&gt;

The U.S. Army Chaplain School was approved on 9 February 1918.

==Chaplain Candidate==
[[File:Chaplain Candidate Branch Insignia.png|thumb|110px|Chaplain Candidate Insignia]]
Due to a revision of DA PAM 611-21 (Military Occupational Classification and Structure) Effective October 1, 2013, Chaplain Candidates, previously belonging to the Staff Specialist Branch until ordination have worn the Staff Specialist insignia in lieu of religious denomination insignia. The transition from the Staff Specialist Branch to the Chaplain Branch left the candidates without an authorized branch insignia. Responding to the need, Chief of Chaplains Chaplain (Major General) [[Donald L. Rutherford]] submitted a request for collar insignia which was approved by HQDA, G-1 on 23 February 2012. The design for the collar insignia was authorized on 18 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=15287&amp;CategoryId=9362&amp;grp=2&amp;menu=Uniformed%20Services&amp;ps=24&amp;p=0&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christianity and other religions''' documents [[Christianity]]'s relationship with other world religions, and the differences and similarities.

==Christian views on religious pluralism==

===Classical Christian view ===
Evangelical Christians believe that [[religious pluralism]] is heresy and contradicts the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegospelcoalition.org/about/foundation-documents/confessional/ Foundation Documents: Confessional Statement] By [[The Gospel Coalition]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christians have argued that religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept. Maximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Some, but by no means all, Christians hold such pluralism to be logically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianministriesintl.org/articles/12.html Defending Salvation Through Christ Alone] By Jason Carlson, Christian Ministries International&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholicism]] believes that while it is the fullest and most complete revelation of God to Man, other Christian denominations have also received genuine revelation from God, although partial and incomplete.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}

===Calvinist Christian views===
Although [[Calvinist]]s believe God and the truth of God cannot be plural, they also believe that those civil ordinances of man which restrain man from evil and encourage toward good, are ordinances of God (regardless of the religion, or lack of it, of those who wield that power). Christians are obligated to be at peace with all men, as far as it is up to them, and to submit to governments for the Lord's sake, and to pray for enemies.

Calvinism is not pacifistic and Calvinists have been involved in religious wars, notably the [[French Wars of Religion]] and the [[English Civil War]]. Some of the first parts of modern Europe to practice religious tolerance had Calvinistic populations, notably the Netherlands.

===Eastern Orthodox views===
{{See also|Eastern Orthodoxy and Judaism}}

===Modern (post-Enlightenment) Christian views===
In recent years, some Christian groups have become more open to religious pluralism; this has led to many cases of reconciliation between Christians and people of other faiths. The liberalization of many Seminaries and theological institutions, particularly in regards to the rejection of the notion that the Bible is an infallible document, has led to a much more human-centered and secular movement within Mainline Christian denominations, particularly in the United States. Some Mainline churches no longer hold to [[exclusivist]] views on salvation.

In recent years there has been much to note in the way of reconciliation between some Christian groups and the Jewish people. Many modern day Christians, including many Catholics and some liberal Protestants, have developed a view of the New Testament as an extended covenant; they believe that [[Jew]]s are still in a valid relationship with God, and that Jews can avoid damnation and earn a heavenly reward. For these Christians, the New Testament extended God's original covenant to cover non-Jews. The article [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]] deals with this issue in detail.

Multiple smaller Christian groups in the US and Canada have come into being over the last 40 years, such as "Christians for Israel". Their website says that they exist in order to "expand Christian-Jewish dialogue in the broadest sense in order to improve the relationship between Christians and Jews, but also between Church and Synagogue, emphasizing Christian repentance, the purging of anti-Jewish preliminary attitudes and the false 'Replacement' theology rampant throughout Christian teachings."

A number of large Christian groups, including the Catholic Church and several large Protestant churches, have publicly declared that they will no longer [[proselytize]] Jews.

Other Modern Christian views, including some conservative [[Protestantism|Protestants]], reject the idea of the New Testament as an extended covenant, and retain the classical Christian view as described earlier.

===Modern views specific to Catholicism===
{{Main|Catholic Church and ecumenism}}
For the Catholic Church, there has been a move at reconciliation not only with Judaism, but also [[Islam]].  The [[Second Vatican Council]] states that salvation includes others who acknowledge the same creator, and explicitly lists Muslims among those (using the term [[Mohammedanism|Mohammedans]], which was the word commonly used among non-Muslims at the time).  The official Catholic position is therefore that Jews, Muslims and Christians (including churches outside of Rome's authority) all acknowledge the same God, though Jews and Muslims have not yet received the gospel while other churches are generally considered deviant to a greater or lesser degree.

The most prominent event in the way of dialogue between religions has arguably been the 1986 Peace Prayer in [[Assisi]] to which Pope [[John Paul II]], against considerable resistance also from within the [[Roman Catholic]] church, invited representatives of all world religions. John Paul II’s remarks regarding Christian denominations were found in his [[Ut unum sint]] address. This initiative was taken up by the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]], who, with the support of John Paul II, organized yearly peace meetings of religious representatives. These meetings, consisting of round tables on different issues and of a common time of prayer has done much to further understanding and friendship between religious leaders and to further concrete peace initiatives. In order to avoid the reproaches of [[syncretism]] that were leveled at the 1986 Assisi meeting where the representatives of all religions held one common prayer, the follow-up meetings saw the representatives of the different religions pray in different places according to their respective traditions.

The question of whether traditional Chinese ancestor veneration, consists of worshipping a God or veneration of a saint was important to the [[Roman Catholic]] church during the [[Chinese Rites controversy]] of the early 18th century. This dispute was between the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s who argued that Confucianism and Chinese folk religion was worship, and therefore incompatible with Catholicism, and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] who argued the reverse. The [[pope]] ultimately ruled in favor of the Dominicans, a decision which greatly reduced the role of Catholic missionaries in China. However, this decision was partially reversed by Pope [[Pius XII]] in 1939; after this, Chinese customs were no longer considered superstition or idolatry, but a way of honoring esteemed relatives (not entirely dissimilar to the Catholic practice of praying for the dead).

==Relationship with [[Sikhism]]==
Sikhs also believe in one God and follow the Ten Sikh Gurus, unlike Christians who believe in one Almighty God made up of three distinct persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Known as the Trinity). However, there is no heaven or hell in the Sikh religion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Relationship with [[Judaism]]==
{{See also|Christianity and Judaism|Judeo-Christian|Responsibility for the death of Jesus}}

Historically, the relationship between Christianity and Judaism has been strained. In the past, Christians were often taught that "the Jews" killed Christ, for which "murder" they bear a [[collective guilt]] (an interpretation which most major [[Christian denominations|denominations]] now reject). Jews meanwhile have tended to associate Christianity with various [[pogrom]]s, or in better times, with the dangers of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. [[Anti-Semitism]] has a long history in Christianity (see [[Christianity and anti-Semitism]]), and indeed is far from dead (for example, in contemporary Russia). However, since the [[Holocaust]], much dialogue aimed at [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]] has taken place, and relations have greatly improved. Today, many conservative evangelicals support [[Christian Zionism]], much to the irritation of [[Arab Christians]], based partly on the [[Millennialism|Millennialist]] belief that the modern state of [[Israel]] represents the fulfillment of [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecy]].

The phenomenon of [[Messianic Judaism]] has become something of an irritant to Jewish / Christian relations{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}. Messianic Jews—who generally seek to combine a Jewish identity with the recognition of Jesus—are rejected by mainstream Jewish groups{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, who dismiss Messianic Judaism as little more than Christianity with Jewish undertones.

The Jewish conception of the [[Jewish eschatology|messiah]] (משיח ''mashiach'' in Hebrew) holds certain similarities to that of Christians, yet there are substantial differences. According to [[Jew]]s, the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Scriptures]] contain a small number of prophecies concerning a future descendant of King [[David]], who will be anointed (Hebrew: moshiach) as the Jewish people's new leader and will establish the throne of David in Jerusalem forever. In the Jewish view, this fully human and mortal leader will rebuild the land of [[Israel]] and restore the Davidic Kingdom. This subject is covered in the section on [[Jewish eschatology]]. Some Christians have a different understanding of the term ''messiah'', and believe that Jesus is the messiah referred to in the [[Old Testament]] prophecies; that the kingdom in these prophecies was to be a [[Kingdom of God|heavenly kingdom]], not an earthly one; and that Jesus' words and actions in the New Testament provide evidence of his identity as messiah and that the remainder of [[messianic prophecy]] will be fulfilled in the [[Second Coming]]. Other Christians acknowledge the Jewish definition of ''messiah'', and hold that Jesus fulfills this, being 'fully man' (in addition to being 'fully God'), and believe that the Second Coming will establish the Kingdom of God on earth, where Jesus, as messiah and descendant from David, will reign from Jerusalem.

==Relationship with [[Islam]]==
{{See also|Christianity and Islam|Christian view of Muhammad|Christian influences in Islam}}

[[Islam]] shares a number of beliefs with Christianity. They share similar views on [[Last judgment|judgment]], heaven, hell, spirits, angels, and a [[Resurrection of the Dead|future resurrection]].  Jesus is acknowledged and respected by Muslims as a great prophet. However, while Islam relegates Jesus to a lesser status than God — "in the company of those nearest to God" in the [[Qur'an]], mainstream ([[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]]) Christianity teaches without question that Jesus is [[God the Son]], one of the three [[Hypostases]] (common English: persons) of Christianity's [[Trinity]], divinely co-equal with the [[God the Father|Father]] and the [[Holy Spirit]].

The religions both share a belief in the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], his [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]] and healings, and that he [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended bodily into heaven]]. However, Jesus is not accepted as the son by Muslims, who strictly maintain that he was a [[human being]] who was loved by God and exalted by God to ranks of the most righteous. They believe in God as a single entity, not as the Trinity accepted by the vast majority of Christians. Neither do Muslims accept Jesus' [[crucifixion]]. Since Muslims believe only in the worship of a strictly monotheistic God who never [[Incarnation|assumed human flesh]], they do not accept the use of [[icon]]s, and see this as [[shirk (idolatry)]]. Muslim influence played a part in the initiation of [[iconoclasm]] and their conquests caused the [[iconoclasm]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. For the same reason, they do not worship or pray to [[Muhammad]], [[Jesus]], or any other prophets; only to [[God]].

Adherents of Islam have historically referred to themselves, Jews, and Christians (among others) as [[People of the Book]] since they all base their religion on books that are considered to have a divine origin. Christians however neither recognize the [[Qur'an]] as a genuine book of divine revelation, nor agree with its assessment of Jesus as a mere prophet, on par with [[Muhammad]], nor for that matter accept that Muhammad was a genuine prophet.

Muslims, for their part, believe that parts of the Gospels, Torah and Jewish prophetic books have been forgotten, misinterpreted, or distorted by their followers. Based on that perspective, Muslims view the Qur'an as correcting the errors of Christianity. For example, Muslims reject belief in the [[Trinity]], or any other expression of the divinity of Jesus, as incompatible with monotheism.

Not surprisingly, the two faiths have often experienced controversy and conflict (an example being the [[Crusades]]). At the same time, much fruitful dialogue has occurred as well. The writings of Catholic theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] frequently cite those of the Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]], as well as Muslim thinker [[Averroes]] ('Ibn-Rushd).

On May 6, 2001 [[Pope John Paul II]], the first pope to pray in a [[mosque]], delivered an address at Umayyad Mosque in [[Damascus]], saying: "It is important that Muslims and Christians continue to explore philosophical and theological questions together, in order to come to a more objective and comprehensive knowledge of each other's religious beliefs. Better mutual understanding will surely lead, at the practical level, to a new way of presenting our two religions not in opposition, as has happened too often in the past, but in partnership for the good of the human family." This Mosque of Damascus is famous for containing the head of John the Baptist.

==Relations with Hinduism==
{{main|Christianity and Hinduism}}
Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity differ on fundamental beliefs on [[heaven]], [[hell]] and [[reincarnation]], to name a few. From the Hindu perspective, heaven ([[Sanskrit]] ''[[svarga]]'') and hell (''[[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]]'') are temporary places, where every [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] has to live, either for the good deeds done or for their [[sin]]s committed.

There also exist significant similarities in Christian and Hindu theology, most notably in that both religions present a trinitarian view of God. The Holy [[Trinity]] of Christianity, consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is sometimes seen as roughly analogous to the [[Trimurti]] of Hinduism, whose members -- [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]—are seen as the three principal manifestations of [[Brahman]], or Godhead.

Christian-Hindu relations are a mixed affair. On one hand, Hinduism's natural tendency has been to recognize the divine basis of various other religions, and to revere their founders and saintly practitioners. In Western countries, [[Vedanta]] has influenced some Christian thinkers, while others in the anti-[[cult]] movement have reacted against the activities of immigrant [[gurus]] and their followers. (See also: [[Pierre Johanns]], [[Abhishiktananda]], [[Bede Griffiths]], [[Dalit theology]].)

The [[Christian Ashram Movement]], a movement within [[Christianity]] in [[India]], embraces [[Vedanta]] and the teachings of the East, attempting to combine the Christian faith with the Hindu [[ashram]] model and [[Christian monasticism]] with the Hindu ''[[sannyasa]]'' tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Ashram Movement]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with [[Buddhism]]==
{{main|Buddhism and Christianity}}

In the 19th century, some scholars began to perceive similarities between Buddhist and Christian practices, e.g. in 1878 [[T.W. Rhys Davids]] wrote that the earliest missionaries to Tibet observed that similarities have been seen since the first known contact.&lt;ref name=Davids&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1878 edition, article ''Buddhism'' by T.W. Rhys Davids&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 Ernest De Bunsen made similar observations in that with the exception of the death of Jesus on the cross, and of the Christian doctrine of atonement, the most ancient Buddhist records had similarities with the Christian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Bunsen|first=Ernest|title=The Angel-Messiah of Buddhists, Essenes, and Christians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tq4oAAAAYAAJ|year=1880|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] and [[Protestantism]] came into political conflict in 19th century [[Sri Lanka]] and in Tibet c. 1904 (the Francis Younghusband Expedition). Various events have cooperated to introduce various strains of Buddhist theology and meditation to several generations of Western spiritual seekers (including some Catholic religious). Relations are generally good between both religions, except perhaps in [[South Korea]] where Christians have damaged [[Korean Buddhist temples|Buddhist temples]] and engaged in other forms of [[Religious fanaticism|Christian extremism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1390412|title = Questions for Buddhist and Christian Cooperation in Korea|journal = Buddhist-Christian Studies|volume = 17|pages = 179–195|last1 = Tedesco|first1 = Frank|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian republic of [[Kalmykia]] recognizes both [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]]/Lamaist Buddhism and Russian Orthodoxy as its official religions.

==Possible relationship with [[Zoroastrianism]] through Judaism==
&lt;!-- This section has been discussed at great length on the talk page and a vote &amp; consensus was reached; please do not edit before reviewing the discussions and talking with the community...thanks --&gt;
Many scholars{{ref|ZoroastrianismScholars}} believe the [[eschatology]] of [[Judaism]] and possibly the idea of [[monotheism]] originated in [[Zoroastrianism]], and may have been transferred to Judaism during the [[Babylonian captivity]], thus eventually influencing Christian theology. Bible scholar P.R. Ackroyd states: "the whole eschatological scheme, however, of the Last Judgment, rewards and punishments, etc., within which immortality is achieved, is manifestly Zoroastrian in origin and inspiration." {{ref|PeakesCommentary}} However, the theory is questioned by other mainstream historians and scholars. ''The Oxford History of the Biblical World'' states "There is little if any effect of Zoroastrian elements on Judaism in the Persian period."{{ref|OxfordHistoryOnZoroastrianism}}. Nevertheless, scholars such as Soloman Nigosian contend, in regarding the similar ideas of Zoroaster and later Jewish writers, that "the ideas were indigenous to Iran...it is hardly conceivable that some of the characteristic ideas and practices in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam came into being without Zoroastrian influence."{{ref|Nigosian}} The new faith (Zoroastrianism) emerged in larger Persian empires. " Zoroastrianism reflected the cosmopolitan society of the empires". During this time Zoroastrianism profoundly effected the beliefs and values of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam ("Traditions &amp; Encounters: A brief global History", Jerry H. Bentley. pg. 93). It is also possible that Zoroastrianism and later Jewish theology came from a common source.

''For more on this theory, see [[Jewish history]], [[Judaism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]].''

In the Younger [[Avesta]], three divinities of the Zoroastrian pantheon are repeatedly identified as ahuric, meaning that each, as [[Ahura]], act together in both representing and protecting [[Asha]], or the divine truth governing the universe. These three are [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Mithra]] and [[Burz]], and hence known as the "Ahuric triad."  Similarities with the Christian Trinity can be seen between Ahura Mazda and God the Father, Mithra and Christ the Logos, as well as between Burz and the Holy Spirit, both of which are associated symbolically with water.  Both Zoroastrianism and Christianity consider themselves to be monotheistic, but like all other monotheisms they have highlighted certain aspects or energies of the divine to emphasize, and these are not meant to be interpreted as separate divinities.  In both religions there are guardian [[angels]], or [[fravashi]], which are considered to be created beings and are distinct from the [[Energies of God]] or divine emanations.  The Zoroastrian term [[yazata]], however, has variously been interpreted as meaning emanations or "sparks" of the divine, or as being roughly synonymous with the term "angels."  There have been various theories on the possible relationship between these aspects of Zoroastrianism and ideas of divine emanation in [[esoteric Christianity]], Jewish [[Kabbalah]], Islamic mysticism ([[Sufism]]), and other religious systems, such as [[Gnosticism]], [[Yazidism]], and the [[Druze]], among others.

==Relationship with Paganism==
{{Main|Christianity and paganism}}

==Relationship with [[Mithraism]] and [[Sol Invictus]]==
&lt;!-- {{Contradict|section|about=whether or not Mithraism was known about before 100AD|date=March 2009}} There can be many arguments of a thing which does not make them contradictions as they are just that; arguments. Please see discussion page.--&gt;
There are many parallels between [[Mithraism]], the religion of [[Sol Invictus]], and Christianity. [[Aurelian]] is believed to have established the ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'' (Day of the Birth of Sol Invictus) as an annual festival{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} held on the day when the sun's daily [[declination]] visibly starts rising again after the [[winter solstice]], namely on December 25; the birth of the central figure was thus celebrated on the day which Christians later used to celebrate Jesus' birth (having always celebrated this at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crivoice.org/cyepiph.html ] [http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/holidays/epiphany.htm ] [http://www.navidadlatina.com/historia/ ] [https://navidad.es/la-historia-de-la-fiesta-de-navidad/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Other similarities include the stories of Christ and Mithra as children being visited by shepherds, the [[trinity]], and the immortal soul{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. Sunday itself was imposed as the official day of rest by [[Constantine I|Constantine]], who referred to it as the ''Day of the venerable Sun''{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. (Although Christians worshiped on Sunday from at least 150 years before Constantine)&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr, ''First Apology'', 67.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest attestation of Mithraism is [[Plutarch]]'s record of it being practised in 68BC by [[Cilician pirates]], the first mithraists.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html Life of Pompey]'', 24.5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]], a Christian writer who lived between the 2nd and 3rd centuries, admitted there was a strong similarity between the practises of the two faiths:
:''the devil, ... mimics even the essential portions of the divine sacraments...he baptises some, that is his own believers, ... he promises the forgiveness of sins... Mithraism, .... also celebrates the [[oblation]] of bread, and introduces a symbol of the resurrection...'' - Tertullian,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:De praescriptione haereticorum|The Prescription Against Heretics]]'', 40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Martyr]], an earlier 2nd century [[Church Father]], agreed that the similarities existed, claiming that Mithraism had copied the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref name="First Apology"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm First Apology], 66.4&lt;/ref&gt; Justin argued that the devil had invented Mithraism to mock Christianity.&lt;ref name="First Apology"/&gt; Christian apologist [[Ronald H. Nash]] stated:
:''allegations of an early Christian dependence on Mithraism have been rejected on many grounds. Mithraism had no concept of the death and resurrection of its god and no place for any concept of rebirth -- at least during its early stages...During the early stages of the cult, the notion of rebirth would have been foreign to its basic outlook...Moreover, Mithraism was basically a military cult. Therefore, one must be skeptical about suggestions that it appealed to nonmilitary people like the early Christians''. {{ref|Nash}}

==Relationship with the [[Bahá'í Faith]]==
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] believes that there is one God who sends [[Manifestation of God|divine messengers]] to guide humanity throughout time, which is called [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)]]—and is different from the Christian belief of [[Progressive revelation (Christian)]]. They believe in the divine knowledge and essence of [[Jesus]], among other messengers such as [[Muhammad]], [[Zoroaster]], [[Moses]], [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], and others. Interpretations vary, but the Bahá'í Faith is sometimes considered an [[Abrahamic faith]]. The followers of the Bahá'í Faith believe in God, as do Christians, and recognize Jesus' teachings, but they have different views of the [[Trinity]] and divinity of Jesus. The Bahá'í view of prophets is that although they have both human and divine characteristics, they are not themselves God, but rather "divine manifestations."  They also see the Trinity as symbolic where Jesus and the Holy Spirit are polished mirrors that reflect the pure light from God.  Although Bahá'ís affirm the Bible as sacred scripture, they do not consider the Bible to be wholly authentic as [[Shoghi Effendi]], the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith]], affirmed that "The Bible is not wholly authentic, and in this respect not to be compared with the Qur’án, and should be wholly subordinated to the authentic Sayings of Bahá’u’lláh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Effendi  |first= Shoghi| authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |date= 1973 |title= Directives from the Guardian | chapter= 32: BIBLE (Authenticity of the)| chapter-url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-32.html| url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/  |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bahai-library.com/uhj_old_new_testaments|title= The Bible: Extracts on the Old and New Testaments |last1= Bahá'u'lláh,  Abdu'l-Bahá,  Shoghi Effendi, and  Universal House of Justice |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Bahá'í Library Online |publisher= |access-date= November 6, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'ís share some views with Christianity regarding moral and immoral behavior. Bahá'ís condemn [[polygamy]], [[premarital sex]], and [[Homosexuality|homosexual acts]] while treating everyone, including homosexuals, with love, respect, and dignity. (See [[Homosexuality and Bahá'í Faith]].)

==Relationship with [[Scientology]]==
{{See also|Jesus in Scientology}}

Hubbard described Scientology as "the Western Anglicized continuance of many earlier forms of wisdom."&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Rhodes  | first =Ron  | title =The Challenge of the Cults and New Religions: The Essential Guide to Their History, Their Doctrine, and Our Response  | publisher =Zondervan  | year =2001  | pages =155, 164  | isbn = 978-0-310-23217-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard includes the [[teachings of Jesus]] among belief systems cited as these "earlier forms of wisdom".&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt; Jesus is recognized in Scientology as part of its "religious heritage",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Hutson | first =Steven  | title =What They Never Taught You in Sunday School: A Fresh Look at Following Jesus | publisher =[[Tate Publishing &amp; Enterprises|Tate Publishing]] | year =2006  | pages =57  | isbn = 978-1-59886-300-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; though "is seen as only one of many good teachers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Shellenberger | first = Susie  | title =One Year Devotions for Teens | publisher =Tyndale House Publishers, Inc. | year =2005 | pages =189 | isbn = 978-0-8423-6202-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 book ''Vintage Jesus: Timeless Answers to Timely Questions'', authors Mark Driscoll and Gerry Breshears write: "According to Scientology, Jesus is an "implant" forced upon a Thetan about a million years ago",&lt;ref name="driscoll"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Driscoll  | first =Mark   |author2=Gerry Breshears  | title =Vintage Jesus: Timeless Answers to Timely Questions  | publisher =Good News Publishers  | year =2008  | pages =14, 183  | isbn = 978-1-58134-975-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jack Huberman writes in ''101 People Who Are Really Screwing America'' that in Scientology Jesus is seen as having been "implanted in humanity's collective memory", by the character [[Xenu]] from [[Space opera in Scientology scripture|Scientology space opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Huberman | first =Jack  | title =101 People Who Are Really Screwing America | publisher =Nation Books | year =2006 | pages =51 | isbn = 978-1-56025-875-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological aspects==
The spread of Christianity has been international, in some cases entirely displacing the religions and altering the customs encountered among those people to whom it has come. This centuries-long process has been met with violent opposition at times, and likewise the spread of Christianity has in some cases been carried out with martial force. The relationship of Christianity to other faiths is encumbered to some extent by this history, with modern Christians, particularly in the West, expressing embarrassment over the violence in Christianity's past.

[[Conversion to Christianity|Converting adherents of other religions]] is widely accepted within Christianity. Many Christian organizations believe that they have a duty to make converts among every people. In recent years, [[ecumenism]] and dialogue between different religions has been endorsed by many official representatives of the Christian churches, as a way of effecting reconciliation between Christian people and people of other faiths, leading to many cases of reconciliation. In some cases, this endorsement is accompanied by a complete disavowal of all proselytizing efforts under the banner of [[religious pluralism]].

This is specially marked by the inauguration, or installation, of Archbishop of York Dr [[John Sentamu]] from Uganda, on November 29, 2005. Dr Sentamu is the first black African archbishop of the Church of England. He is also the first archbishop to beat bongo drums in the cathedral at his own inauguration. The newspaper Guardian, which dedicated its double middle page of the following day to a full picture of the grinning archbishop in full apparel at the porch of the cathedral, says that:
"Dr Sentamu's sermon was a stern lecture to the Church of England to grow out of being a 'judgmental and moralising' congregation of 'pew-fillers, sermon-taters, Bible readers, even born-again believers and Spirit-filled charismatics' and go out to make friends in the world. 'We have lost the joy and power that makes real disciples and we've become consumers of religion, not disciples of Jesus-Christ', he said. 'Christians, go and make friends among Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, agnostics, atheists, not for the purpose of converting them to your beliefs but for friendship, understanding, listening, hearing.' His remarks were greeted with applause, not with silence as the order of the service instructed."

A special case is the issue of [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]], in which significant reconciliation has been reached.

===Syncretism===
{{main|Christian syncretism}}
Christian converts have often carried some of their previous customs to their new faith. This on occasion has led to [[religious syncretism|syncretism]]s, that are often not accepted by mainstream Christians:
*In Cuban [[Santería]], the West African [[orisha]]s are venerated in the shape of Catholic saints.
*The Chinese [[Taiping Rebellion]] put the Bible in the place of the [[Confucian classics]].
*The [[God's Army (revolutionary group)|God's Army]] of [[Myanmar]] mixed [[Karen people|Karen]] traditions with Protestantism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5077">Within the guidelines of [[halacha]] as presented by [[chazal]] and early rabbinic authorities, '''Oral-vulvar stimulation in Halacha''' (also known as '''נשיקת אותו מקום''' lit. "kissing of that place") is the discussion of whether or not a man may orally stimulate his wife's vulva ([[cunnilingus]]) independent of whether this stimulation does or does not result in her achieving [[orgasm]].

The discussion is within the exclusive framework of a [[halacha|halachically]] permitted marital relationship and only during the time that one's wife is not in her [[Niddah]] state.

==Chazalic views==
{{main|chazal}}
[[Talmud Bavli]] (Nedarim p.&amp;nbsp;20b) quotes the majority of rabbis (who disagree with the fringe view of Yohanan Ben Dahabai) who are lenient by stating that "all that man desires to do with his wife he may" (provided she agrees&lt;ref&gt;Nedarim 20b&lt;/ref&gt;).  The Talmud goes on to bring a parable of a man who makes a meat or fish purchase, that he may cook his purchase in any way he desires.

In a varying text of kallah rabthi as printed in "battei medrashoth"&lt;ref&gt;of the cairo geniza: http://www.hebrewbooks.org/21179 vol. 1 p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Werthheimer notes the significance of the Talmud quoting both meat and fish in its parable;

Since the Torah forbids [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|cooking one's meat in milk]], a parable quoting just meat would not suffice as meat has this restrictive element whereas fish has a lesser restrictive element, thus implying that man has an enhanced level of (sexual) freedom with his wife.

The [[Rambam]] takes a somewhat lenient approach that permits oral-vulvar stimulation but at the same time discourages its actual practice&lt;ref&gt;Rambam mishna commentary to tractate sanhedrin 7:4 (
..כל מה שרוצה לעשות באשתו עושה לפי שהענין..האסור והמותר אינן בענין המרוחק והשנוא והמרוצה והאהוב ומה שראוי לעשות מדרך הצניעות  ותכלית הפרישות), עצי ארזים to shulchan aruch (Rabbi Noach Berlin, 5550) even haezer 25:1.  "ba'athi legani", A. Arbel, published 5771&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During ovulation ===

As stringent view of oral-vulvar stimulation when a woman may conceive is presented in Kallah Rabthi, one of the [[Minor tractate]] in the name of [[Rabbah]]:

{{Quote|Rabbah said.. he let go of his mouth that talks that within it was given the power to kiss and kissed the closed (i.e. the vagina that cannot kiss or talk) therefore the mouth of his offspring will have closed mouths..this applies only if she conceives from that (specific) sexual-relation"|Kallah Rabthi, ch. 1}}

== Regarding the Kohen ==
{{main|Kohen}}
The [[Mordechai HaKohen of Safed|Sifthei Kohen]] (vol. 2 p.&amp;nbsp;244) commentary to the Torah points out that the [[kohen]] personality is to be extra-scrupulous with oral-vulvar stimulation of his wife when producing offspring, as per Rabbi Yochanan's ben Dhabai's warning that it may cause a physical blemish were his wife to conceive; as a kohen is bounded by the Torah rules of [[kohanic disqualifications]], and may be disqualified from specific [[Bet HaMikdash]] services if he has a physical blemish.

== Views of the Achronim ==
{{main|Achronim}}
[[Shulchan Aruch]] (Orach Hayyim ch. 240) takes a stringent view of oral-vulvar stimulation by stating that the transgressor violates the spirit of the Torah verses of והצנע לכת ("Thou shalt walk humbly" -Micha 6:8) and בעבור תהיה יראתו על פניכם לבלתי תחטאו ("So that fear (of God) should be on your faces so that you should not sin" -Exodus 9:16) and of בל תשקצו את נפשותיכם ("Thou should not make your soul despicable" Leviticus 20:25).

== Leniencies ==
The [[Remah]]"s glosses to Shulchan Aruch (Even HaEzer ch. 25)  take a more lenient on oral-vulvar stimulation as does Rabbi [[Joel Sirkis|Yoel Sirkus]] (the "Bach") who permit it in accordance with halacha, but nonetheless discourage its practice.

Rabbi A. Arbel in his work "Ba'athi Legani" points out that the Rambam disagrees that oral-vulvar stimulation violates the spirit of the verse of בל תשקצו, as the average person – during sexual excitement – is not disgusted at the notion of orally stimulating the vulva.

A similar point of view is written by Rabbi Blumenkrants&lt;ref&gt;"baruch tzuri" Sh. Blumenkratz, Brooklyn, 5732 ch. 62&lt;/ref&gt; who states that the [[Remah]], [[Moses ben Isaac Judah Lima|Chelkath Mechokek]] and the [[Aruch HaShulchan]] all agree that one may do with his wife as one desires – including oral-vulvar stimulation – as this is not punishable according to bare-basic halahcha.

'''Daheshism''' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] الداهشية) is a spiritual message established by [[Dr. Dahesh]] (real name Salim Moussa Achi) in 1942:

On March 23, 1942, at the age of thirty three, Dr. Dahesh proclaimed in Beirut a spiritual message in which he called upon all people to embrace the ideals, the essence of their religions, not reducing their faith into external shows of pagan-like rituals and practices.  He declared his belief that humans—like all the other creatures on Earth—are subject to a cosmic law system. 

The just dispensations of this spiritual system apportion to humans their reincarnation on Earth, or in other worlds, according to their deserts. This cycle of reincarnation will come to an end only when they achieve spiritual transcendence by their own free will, integrating themselves into the spirit world. 

==Beliefs==
Proclaimed by Salim Moussa Achi ("Doctor Dahesh") on March 23, 1942, Daheshism is a spiritual doctrine whose tenets are built around the belief in a deeply mysterious, non-anthropomorphic, ever-present and watchful God. 
Daheshism teaches that all the major prophets (e.g., Abraham, Moses, David, Buddha, Jesus, and Mohammad) emanated from the same source known as The Christ. However — and as per a written directive by Doctor Dahesh — a Daheshist is obligated to respect other cultures' idea of God, to refrain from proselytizing, and never to engage in any sort of coercion. Daheshism believes in the intrinsic correlation between all the major religions: while Daheshism implies a “Unity of Religions,” it recognizes the necessity for those different religions. From a Daheshist perspective, a Christian, for example, need only become a better Christian. 

A Daheshist believes that all of creation is spread out over a multidimensional universe divided into three principal realms, each divided into 150 levels:

The utmost 150 levels make up the World of the Spirits, also known as The Divine Worlds. The highest, or purest of these Divine Worlds, are called The Heavens — the realm of God almighty. 

Daheshists believe that since no one can transgress certain limits — ever — the prospect of peering into the realm of God is therefore impossible. 

The realm of the Spirits comprises 150 levels; within these levels, dwell the Spirits. From these Spirits, extends a network of energy signatures known to the Daheshists as the Spiritual Fluids, in various degrees of loftiness, and depth, forming two subsequent realms known as Paradise, and Hell, each divided into 150 levels.

Spiritual Fluids are therefore the utmost-fundamental sentient energy building blocks, as well as the fabric and hidden consciousness of the realms of Paradise and Hell.

Daheshists believe in the existence of an equitable universal justice system that allows the Spiritual Fluids of all living — and non-living matter alike — to leave one plane of existence and reincarnate into another, according to their actions and tendencies. It is through these many cycles of reincarnation that Spiritual Fluids are given the opportunity to purify themselves in order to materialize in progressively better worlds, with the ultimate goal to become one with God. 

To a Daheshist, as sad and tragic as it may often feel, death is but a transition from one reality into another whose setting and circumstances that lie waiting are the direct consequences of one’s thoughts and actions. 
-------------------------------------------
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dahesh-portrait.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Portrait of Dr. Dahesh drawn by Marie Hadad]] --&gt;
Daheshism is summarized in the following five points:
*The existence and immortality of the spirit.
*Spiritual Fluids form the texture of the universe, and the substance of its creatures.
*Spiritual causality and just reward. (karma)
*Reincarnation.
*The essential unity of all religions.

Daheshists believe that Doctor Dahesh was, in part, a materialization of a Spiritual Fluid from THE CHRIST — the source of all the prophets, including Jesus Christ and Moses.

==Literature==
The Dahesh Heritage Center and The Daheshist Publishing Company, located on Broadway, New York, publish many books related to Dr. Dahesh's literature; Daheshism history; beliefs and news; and art-related literature as Dr. Dahesh was an avid art collector. His art collection is gathered in the [[Dahesh Museum of Art]] in New York.

The Daheshist Publishing Company also publishes the quarterly publication ''Dahesh Voice'' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] صوت داهش) in English and Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dahesh.pureconceptdesign.com/index.php/en/dahesh-voice.html Archives of ''Dahesh Voice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David A. Kerr''' (16 May 1945 – 14 April 2008) was a British scholar of Christian-Muslim relations and [[world Christianity]].

== Biography ==
Kerr was born and raised in London to Wilfred Kerr, a minister of the [[United Reformed Church]], and Agatha Jean, the daughter of Scottish [[Protestant missions in China|missionaries in China]] (1921–27). He conducted his studies in Arabic and Islamic Studies at [[SOAS, University of London]] (1963–66), theology at [[Mansfield College, Oxford]] (1966–68), and a PhD at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]] (1969–73). His doctoral work on church-state relations in [[Lebanon]] was supervised by the scholar of Middle Eastern studies, [[Albert Hourani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/jun/23/5|title=Obituary: David Kerr|last=Kerr|first=Simeon|date=22 June 2008|website=Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 2008|title=David A.

Kerr worked for a short time as a journalist with the [[BBC World Service]]. He later took up a position teaching Islamic studies at the [[Selly Oak Colleges]] (now part of the [[University of Birmingham]]) in 1973, founding the Centre for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations in 1976. In 1987, he became the director of the Duncan Black Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim studies at [[Hartford Seminary]], before returning to the UK in 1996 to succeed [[Andrew Walls]] as professor of [[World Christianity|Christianity in the Non-Western World]] and as the director of the [[Centre for the Study of World Christianity|Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 2005, he took up a post at the [[University of Lund]] as a professor of Missiology and Ecumenics. Shortly upon arriving in Sweden, he was diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] and died in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His wife, Gun Holmström, was a Finnish student in London when they first met in his father's church. They married in Finland in 1970 and had two children, Simeon and Anna.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2008/25-april/gazette/obituary-professor-david-kerr|title=Obituary: Professor David Kerr|last=Lamb|first=Christopher|date=28 April 2008|website=Church Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic work ==
Kerr was an active administrator of a number of a academic centres around the world. He was also known for his supervision of Masters and PhD students from various parts of Africa and Asia, most of whom English was not their first language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is said that while he was the director for the [[Centre for the Study of World Christianity|Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World]], he had oversight of over thirty students at a given time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stephen Goodwin comments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=Stephen R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=756yXWl_JXEC|title=World Christianity in Local Context: Essays in Memory of David A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
David belonged to that set of scholars who saw their principle task to be the education, support and development of their students; the student subsequently would be the primary witness of the scholar's work, rather than the contemporary tendency, under the pressure of publications-based funding, to issue forth a stream of books.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Kerr never produced an academic monograph himself, he was well-respected for his scholarship as can be seen in the two-volume [[Festschrift]] produced in his honour:

According to contemporary theories of consciousness, the brain is the basis of [[subjectivity|subjective experience]], [[agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[self-awareness]], and [[awareness]] of the surrounding [[nature|natural world]]. When [[brain death]] occurs, all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases. Many people who believe that death is a permanent cessation of consciousness also believe that consciousness is dependent upon the functioning of the brain. Scientific research has discovered that some areas of the brain, like the [[reticular activating system]] or the [[thalamus]], appear to be [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]] for consciousness, because [[disorders of consciousness|damage to these structures]] or their lack of function causes a loss of consciousness.

Through a naturalist analysis of the [[mind]] (an approach adopted by many philosophers of mind and neuroscientists), it is regarded as being dependent on the brain, as shown from the various effects of brain damage.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience and the soul"&gt;{{cite web

== Etymology ==
The English word "oblivion" (late 14c.) comes from the [[Old French]] ''oblivion'' (13c.) and directly from the [[Latin]] ''oblivionem'', meaning "forgetfulness; a being forgotten", which also comes from the word ''oblivisci'' ("to forget").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=oblivion|title=oblivion - Origin and meaning of oblivion by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:wikt:oblivion|Oblivion]] itself means "state of being forgotten".

==Oblivion and subjectivity==
Thomas W. Clark, founder of Center for Naturalism, wrote a paper titled "Death, Nothingness, and Subjectivity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalism.org/death.htm |title=death |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208055953/http://www.naturalism.org/death.htm |website=www.naturalism.org |archivedate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He critiqued what he saw as a flawed description of eternal oblivion as a "plunge into darkness". When some imagine their deaths (including the non-religious), they project themselves into a future [[self]] which experiences an eternal silent darkness. This is wrong, because without consciousness, there is no awareness of [[space]] and no basis for [[time]]. For Clark, in oblivion there isn't even an absence of experience, as we can only speak of experience when a subjective self exists.

According to [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] [[Giulio Tononi]], consciousness is "all we are and all we have: lose consciousness and, as far as you are concerned, your own self and the entire world dissolve into nothingness."&lt;ref name="pmid19098144"&gt;{{cite journal

==Neuroscience==
[[Steven Pinker]] explains the following in the seminar Is Science Killing the Soul, a discussion with [[Richard Dawkins]] presenting evidence against the existence of [[soul]]s. He elaborates;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/richard_dawkins-steven_pinker-is-science-killing-the-soul|title=Is science killing the soul?|date=4 July 1999|first=John|last=Brockman|website=Edge|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "Many kinds of evidence show that the mind is an entity in the physical world, part of a causal chain of physical events. If you send an electric current through the brain, you cause the person to have a vivid experience. If a part of the brain dies because of a blood clot or a burst artery or a bullet wound, a part of the person is gone — the person may lose an ability to see, think, or feel in a certain way, and the entire personality may change. The same thing happens gradually when the brain accumulates a protein called beta-amyloid in the tragic disease known as [[Alzheimer's]]. The person — the soul, if you want — gradually disappears as the brain decays from this physical process. We know that every form of mental activity — every emotion, every thought, every percept — gives off electrical, magnetic, or metabolic signals that can be recorded with increasing precision by [[positron emission tomography]], [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], [[magnetoencephalography]], and other techniques. We know that if you look at the brain under a microscope, it has a breathtaking degree of complexity — on the order of a trillion synapses — that's fully commensurate with the breathtaking complexity of human thought and experience. We know that when the brain dies, the person goes out of existence."

==Physics and death==
In his book ''The Big Picture'', physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] asserts that through physics we can demonstrate that death is equivalent to eternal oblivion. He writes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Sean M. |title=The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself |year=2016 |publisher=Penguin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x21qCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218 |isbn=9780698409767 |p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "There is a much more profound implication of accepting the Core Theory as underlying the world of our everyday experience. Namely: there is no life after death. We each have a finite time as living creatures, and when it's over, it's over. The reasoning behind such a sweeping claim is even more straightforward than the argument against [[telekinesis]] or [[astrology]]. If the particles and forces of the Core Theory are what constitute each living being, without any immaterial soul, then the information that makes up "you" is contained in the arrangement of atoms that makes up your body, including your brain. There is no place for that information to go, or any way for it to be preserved, outside your body. There are no particles or fields that could store it and take it away."

== In philosophy ==
{{primary sources|section|date=August 2017}}
In the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' (written by [[Plato]]), after [[Socrates]] is sentenced to death, he addresses the court. He ponders the nature of death, and summarizes that there are basically two opinions about it. The first is that it is a [[Metempsychosis|migration of the soul]] or [[consciousness]] from this existence into another, and that the souls of all previously deceased people will also be there. This excites Socrates, because he will be able to conduct his [[Socratic method|dialectic inquiries]] with all of the great [[Greek hero cult|Greek heroes]] and thinkers of the past. The other opinion about death is that it is oblivion, the complete cessation of consciousness, not only unable to feel but a complete lack of awareness, like a person in a deep, dreamless sleep. Socrates says that even this oblivion does not frighten him very much, because while he would be unaware, he would correspondingly be free from any pain or suffering. Indeed, Socrates says, not even the great King of Persia could say that he ever rested so soundly and peacefully as he did in a dreamless sleep.

[[Cicero]], writing three centuries later in his treatise ''[[Cato Maior de Senectute|On Old Age]]'', in the voice of [[Cato the Elder]], similarly discussed the prospects of death, frequently referring to the works of earlier Greek writers. Cicero also concluded that death was either a continuation of consciousness or cessation of it, and that if consciousness continues in some form, there is no reason to fear death; while if it is in fact eternal oblivion, he will be free of all worldly miseries, in which case he should also not be deeply troubled by death.

Similar thoughts about death were expressed by the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[poet]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Lucretius]] in his first-century BC [[Didacticism|didactic]] poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' and by the ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Epicurus]] in his ''Letter to Menoeceus'', in which he writes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/menoeceus.html|title=Epicurus - Letter to Menoeceus|first=Vincent|last=Cook|website=www.epicurus.net|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gsu.edu/~phltso/deathfrags.html|title=Epicurus and Lucretius against the dear of death|website=www2.gsu.edu|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "Accustom yourself to believing that death is nothing to us, for good and evil imply the capacity for sensation, and death is the privation of all sentience; therefore, a correct understanding that death is nothing to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable, not by adding to life a limitless time, but by taking away the yearning after immortality. For life has no terrors for him who has thoroughly understood that there are no terrors for him in ceasing to live. Foolish, therefore, is the man who says that he fears death, not because it will pain when it comes, but because it pains in the prospect. Whatever causes no annoyance when it is present causes only a groundless pain in the expectation. Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and when death is come, we are not. It is nothing, then, either to the living or to the dead, for with the living it is not and the dead exist no longer."

Paraphrasing philosopher [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]], Keith Augustine and Yonatan I. Fishman note that "the greater the damage to the brain, the greater the corresponding damage to the mind. The natural extrapolation from this pattern is all too clear — obliterate brain functioning altogether, and mental functioning too will cease".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dlRuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206 books.google.com], Augustine &amp; Fishman, 2015, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faith healing''' is the practice of prayer and gestures (such as [[laying on of hands]]) that are believed by some to elicit [[miracle|divine intervention]] in spiritual and physical healing, especially the Christian practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Faith healing|url=http://www.thearda.com/learningcenter/religiondictionary.asp#F|website=thearda.com|location=University Park, PA|publisher=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=2015-10-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101012004/http://www.thearda.com/learningcenter/religiondictionary.asp|archivedate=2016-01-01|deadurl=no}} Citing {{cite encyclopedia|year=1995|title=|editor1-last=Smith|editor1-first=Jonathan|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=William Scott|encyclopedia=The Harper Collins Dictionary of Religion|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Believers assert that the healing of disease and disability can be brought about by religious faith through prayer and/or other rituals that, according to adherents, can stimulate a [[divine presence]] and power.

Many people interpret the Bible, especially the [[New Testament]], as teaching belief in, and the practice of, faith healing. According to a 2004 ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll, 72 percent of Americans said they believe that praying to God can cure someone, even if science says the person has an incurable disease.&lt;ref name="Kalb2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalb|first=Claudia|date=2004-11-10|title=Can religion improve health?

[[File:Fallerjfa.JPG|thumb|Faith healing by Fr. Joey Faller, Pulilan, Bulacan, Philippines]]
[[File:FvfFaithhealing6177 15.JPG|thumb|Faith healing by [[Fernando Suarez]], Philippines]] 
Regarded as a Christian belief that God heals people through the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], faith healing often involves the [[laying on of hands]]. It is also called supernatural healing, divine healing, and miracle healing, among other things. Healing in the Bible is often associated with the ministry of specific individuals including [[Elijah]], [[Jesus]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]].&lt;ref name="Village" /&gt;

Christian physician Reginald B. Cherry views faith healing as a pathway of healing in which God uses both the natural and the supernatural to heal.&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;{{cite book |first= Reginald B. |last= Cherry |title= The Bible Cure |publisher= HarperOne |year= 1999 |origyear= 1998 |edition= reprint |isbn= 0062516159}}{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} Citing: {{Bibleref2|John|9:1–7}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:46–52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Being healed has been described as a privilege of accepting Christ's redemption on the cross.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|p=32}} Pentecostal writer Wilfred Graves, Jr. views the healing of the body as a physical expression of [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Wilfred, Jr. |last= Graves |authorlink= Wilfred Graves, Jr. |title= In Pursuit of Wholeness: Experiencing God's Salvation for the Total Person |page= 52 |location= Shippensburg, PA |publisher= Destiny Image |isbn= 9780768437942}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Bibleref2|Matthew|8:17|NIV}}, after describing [[Jesus exorcising at sunset]] and healing all of the sick who were brought to him, quotes these miracles as a fulfillment of the prophecy in {{bibleref2|Isaiah|53:5|NIV}}: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases."

Even those Christian writers who believe in faith healing do not all believe that one's faith presently brings about the desired healing. "[Y]our faith does not effect your healing now. When you are healed rests entirely on what the sovereign purposes of the Healer are."&lt;ref name="Charisma1"&gt;{{cite news |first= Larry |last= Keefauver |title= The myths of faith healing |date= June 17, 2009 |url= http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/charisma-channels/spiritled-living/20588-the-myths-of-faith-healing |magazine= [[Charisma (magazine)|Charisma]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511085525/http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/charisma-channels/spiritled-living/20588-the-myths-of-faith-healing |archivedate= 2009-05-11|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Keefauver cautions against allowing enthusiasm for faith healing to stir up false hopes.  "Just believing hard enough, long enough or strong enough will not strengthen you or prompt your healing. Doing mental gymnastics to 'hold on to your miracle' will not cause your healing to manifest now."&lt;ref name="Charisma1" /&gt; Those who actively lay hands on others and pray with them to be healed are usually aware that healing may not always follow immediately. Proponents of faith healing say it may come later, and it may not come in this life. "The truth is that your healing may manifest in eternity, not in time."&lt;ref name="Charisma1" /&gt;

====New Testament====
{{Religious text primary|section|date=September 2015}}
Parts of the four [[gospel]]s in the [[New Testament]] say that [[Jesus]] cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. One example is the case of "a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not better but rather grew worse."{{Bibleref2c|Mark|5:26–27}} After healing her, Jesus tells her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace! Be cured from your illness."{{Bibleref2c|Mark|5:34|GW}} At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer's faith as the means of being healed: {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:52}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|19:10}}.

Jesus endorsed the use of the medical assistance of the time (medicines of oil and wine) when he told the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]] (Luke 10:25-37), who "bound up [an injured man's] wounds, pouring on oil and wine" (verse 34) as a physician would. Jesus then told the doubting teacher of the law (who had elicited this parable by his self-justifying question, "And who is my neighbor?" in verse 29) to "go, and do likewise" in loving others with whom he would never ordinarily associate (verse 37).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thefaithfulword.org/faithhealing.html |title= Faith Healing – God's Compassion, God's Power, and God's Sovereignty: Is a Christian permitted to seek medical assistance and to use medicine? |date= December 16, 2003 |first= Craig W. |last= Booth |accessdate= 2007-05-01 |work= thefaithfulword.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The healing in the gospels is referred to as a "sign"{{Bibleref2c|John|6:2}} to prove Jesus' divinity and to foster belief in him as the Christ.{{Bibleref2c|John|4:48}} However, when asked for other types of miracles, Jesus refused some{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|12:38-42}} but granted others{{Bibleref2c|Luke|9:38–43}} in consideration of the motive of the request. Some theologians' understanding is that Jesus healed ''all'' who were present every single time.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|p=61}} Sometimes he determines whether they had faith that he would heal them.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2014}}}}

Jesus told his followers to heal the sick and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to "cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. You received free, give free".{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|10:8}}{{Bibleref2c|Mark|16:17–18}}

Jesus sternly ordered many who received healing from him: "Do not tell anyone!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|8:4}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Matthew|9:30}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|5:43}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|7:24}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|7:36}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|8:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|9:9}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|5:14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus did not approve of anyone asking for a sign just for the spectacle of it, describing such as coming from a "wicked and adulterous generation."{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|12:38–39}}

The apostle Paul believed healing is one of the special gifts of the [[Holy Spirit]],{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|12:9||1 Corinthians 12:9}} and that the possibility exists that certain persons may possess this gift to an extraordinarily high degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Price |first= Charles P. |url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560864/Faith_Healing.html |chapter= Faith Healing |title= Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia. |year= 2009 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5kwpJ3YJj?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560864/Faith_Healing.html |archivedate= 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament [[Epistle of James]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|James|5:14}} the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord.

The New Testament says that during Jesus' [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]] and after his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles.

Jesus used miracles to convince people that he was inaugurating the Messianic Age. as in Mt 12.28. Scholars have described Jesus' miracles as establishing the kingdom during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|last=Brown, et al|first=Raymond E.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1990|isbn=0-13-614934-0|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|pages=|chapter=78:20; 81:106,112,113,117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pentecostalism/Charismatic movement====
[[File:RichardRossiHealingService.JPG|right|thumb|[[Richard Rossi]] prays for the sick at one of his faith healing services, September, 1990.]]At the beginning of the 20th century, the new [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement drew participants from the [[Holiness movement]] and other movements in America that already believed in divine healing. By the 1930s, several faith healers drew large crowds and established worldwide followings.

The first Pentecostals in the modern sense appeared in [[Topeka, Kansas]], in a Bible school conducted by [[Charles Fox Parham]], a holiness teacher and former [[Methodist]] pastor. Pentecostalism achieved worldwide attention in 1906 through the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in [[Los Angeles]] led by [[William Joseph Seymour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Synan |first= Vinson |title= The Origins of the Pentecostal Movement |url= http://webapps.oru.edu/new_php/library/holyspirit/pentorg1.html |publisher= Holy Spirit Research Center, Oral Roberts University |date= 14 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smith Wigglesworth]] was also a well-known figure in the early part of the 20th century. A former English plumber turned [[evangelism|evangelist]] who lived simply and read nothing but the Bible from the time his wife taught him to read, Wigglesworth traveled around the world preaching about Jesus and performing faith healings. Wigglesworth claimed to raise several people from the dead in Jesus' name in his meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Sarah |last1=Posner |first2= Joe |last2= Conason |title= God's Profits: Faith, Fraud, and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters |publisher= Polipoint Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 0979482216 |page= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s, [[Aimee Semple McPherson]] was a controversial faith healer of growing popularity during the [[Great Depression]]. Subsequently, [[William M. Branham]] has been credited as the initiater of the post-World War II [[healing revival]]s.&lt;ref name="Anderson2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first= Allan|year=2004|title=An introduction to Pentecostalism: global charismatic Christianity|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521532808|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPbPTOi0Rk4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=58}}&lt;ref name="Harrell1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrell|first=David E.|year=1975|title=All things are possible: the healing and charismatic revivals in modern America|location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253100900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ks-Sa1mSnI8C&amp;pg=PA25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=25}} The healing revival he began led many to emulate his style and spawned a generation of faith healers. Because of this, Branham has been recognized as the "father of modern faith healers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Oral Roberts's successful use of television as a medium to gain a wider audience led others to follow suit. His former pilot, [[Kenneth Copeland]], started a healing ministry.

In 2000, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] issued "Instruction on prayers for healing" with specific norms about prayer meetings for obtaining healing,&lt;ref name="CDF2000"/&gt; which presents the Catholic Church's doctrines of sickness and healing.&lt;ref name="Ascoli2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascoli|first=Micol|year=2009|chapter=Psychotherapy or religious healing? : the 'therapeutic' cult of charismatic Catholics in Italy|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Su9Zhe3HglsC&amp;pg=PA229|editor1-last=Incayawar|editor1-first=Mario|editor2-last=Wintrob|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Bouchard|editor3-first=Lise|title=Psychiatrist and traditional healers : unwitting partners in global mental health|series=WPA series, evidence and experience in psychiatry|location=Hoboken, NJ|publisher=J.

Faith in a [[scientific discovery]] acts through the mind of a patient to bring about an improvement of symptoms, if not a cure of the disease. The patients who are cured usually suffer from [[chronic condition]]s, they either have only a [[persuasion]] that they are ill or have some physical ailment, but the patients inhibit through {{linktext|solicitude}} and worry the natural forces that would bring about a cure. This inhibition cannot be lifted until the mind is relieved by confidence in a remedy or scientific discovery that gives them a conviction of cure.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"/&gt;}} but it rejects superstitious practices which are neither compatible with Christian teaching nor compatible with scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="USCCB2009"/&gt;{{rp|at=nn11–12}}

Faith healing is reported by [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] as the result of [[intercessory prayer]] to a [[saint]] or to a person with the gift of healing. According to ''U.S. Catholic'' magazine, "Even in this skeptical, postmodern, scientific age—miracles really are possible." Three-fourths of American Catholics say they pray for miracles.&lt;ref name=Scanlon&gt;{{cite news |first= Leslie |last= Scanlon |title= It's a miracle! |magazine= U.S. Catholic |date= June 2009 |volume= 74 |issue= 6 |page= 12 |url= http://www.uscatholic.org/church/2009/05/its-miracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Cavadini, when healing is granted, "The miracle is not primarily for the person healed, but for all people, as a sign of God's work in the ultimate healing called 'salvation,' or a sign of the kingdom that is coming." Some might view their own healing as a sign they are particularly worthy or holy, while others do not deserve it.&lt;ref name=Scanlon/&gt;

The Catholic Church has a special Congregation dedicated to the careful investigation of the validity of alleged miracles attributed to prospective saints. Pope Francis tightened the rules on money and miracles in the canonization process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2016/09/23/vatican-tightens-rules-miracles-money-sainthood-cases/|title=Vatican tightens rules on miracles and money in sainthood cases|date=2016-09-23|work=Crux|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Catholic Christians believe the lives of canonized saints in the Church will reflect Christ's, many have come to expect healing miracles. While the popular conception of a miracle can be wide-ranging, the Catholic Church has a specific definition for the kind of miracle formally recognized in a canonization process.&lt;ref name=Pinches&gt;{{cite journal |last= Pinches |first= Charles |title= Miracles: A Christian theological overview |journal= [[Southern Medical Journal]] |year= 2007 |volume= 100 |issue= 12 |pages= 1236–42 |pmid= 18090969 |doi= 10.1097/SMJ.0b013e31815843cd |url= http://journals.lww.com/smajournalonline/Fulltext/2007/12000/Miracles__A_Christian_Theological_Overview.17.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', it is often said that cures at [[shrine]]s and during [[Christian pilgrimage]]s are mainly due to psychotherapy — partly to confident trust in [[Divine providence]], and partly to the strong expectancy of cure that comes over suggestible persons at these times and places.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"&gt;{{Catholic|inline=1|title=Psychotherapy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12549a.htm|first=James J.|last=Walsh|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A pre-1911 analysis of the records of cures shows that the majority of accepted cures have been in patients suffering from demonstrable physical conditions.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"/&gt;}}

Among the best-known accounts by Catholics of faith healings are those attributed to the miraculous intercession of the apparition of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] known as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] at the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] in [[France]] and the remissions of life-threatening disease claimed by those who have applied for aid to [[Saint Jude]], who is known as the "[[patron saint]] of lost causes".

====Christian Science====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
[[Christian Science]] claims that healing is possible through an understanding of the underlying spiritual perfection of God's creation.&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"/&gt; The world as humanly perceived is believed to be a distortion of spiritual reality. Christian Scientists believe that healing through prayer is possible insofar as it succeeds in correcting the distortion.&lt;ref name= "SkepDic"&gt;{{cite book |first= Robert Todd |last= Carroll |authorlink= Robert Todd Carroll |title= [[The Skeptic's Dictionary]] |edition= online |chapter= Faith Healing |chapterurl= http://www.skepdic.com/faithhealing.html |accessdate= 2014-06-25 |date= January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality.&lt;ref name= "Bergman2001"&gt;{{cite news |last= Bergman |first= Gerald |date= October 2001 |title= The Christian Science holocaust |url= http://www.theness.com/index.php/the-christian-science-holocaust/ |magazine= The New England Journal of Skepticism |volume= 4 |issue= 4 |publisher= [[New England Skeptical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Eddy, Mary Baker|1875|loc= "Prayer" pp. [http://sentinel.christianscience.com/concordapi/view?book=&amp;verbatim=1&amp;q=SH+1-17 1-17]}} Prayer works through [[love]]: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.{{efn|This is not "intercessory" prayer, but recognition of the good believed to be already present behind the illusory appearance, and gratitude for that good.

An important point in Christian Science is that effectual prayer and the moral regeneration of one's life go hand-in-hand: that "signs and wonders are wrought in the metaphysical healing of physical disease; but these signs are only to demonstrate its divine origin, to attest the reality of the higher mission of the Christ-power to take away the sins of the world."{{sfn|Eddy, Mary Baker|1875|loc= "Medicine" p. [http://sentinel.christianscience.com/concordapi/view?q=SH%20150:4-150:17 150]}} Christian Science teaches that disease is mental, a mortal fear, a mistaken belief or conviction of the necessity and power of ill-health – an ignorance of God's power and goodness. The chapter "Prayer" in ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]'' gives a full account of healing through prayer, while the testimonies at the end of the book are written by people who believe they have been healed through spiritual understanding gained from reading the book.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) has had a long history of faith healings. Many members of the LDS Church have told their stories of healing within the LDS publication, the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Miller |first= Brandon J. |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/09/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= I needed a blessing |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|The Ensign of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Ensign) |date= September 2001 |pages= 64–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Ribeiro |first= Sérgio |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2004/01/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= He restoreth my soul |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= January 2004 |pages= 70–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Heal |first= Simon |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2010/04/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= Call an ambulance! |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= April 2010 |pages= 60–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Peñate de Guerra |first= Magdalena |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2005/09/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= We rejoiced in her healing |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= September 2005 |pages= 66–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church believes healings come most often as a result of [[priesthood blessing]]s given by the laying on of hands; however, prayer often accompanied with fasting is also thought to cause healings. Healing is always attributed to be God's power. Latter-day Saints believe that the Priesthood of God, held by prophets (such as Moses) and worthy disciples of the Savior, was restored via heavenly messengers to the first prophet of this dispensation, [[Joseph Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_healings_and_miracles |title= Joseph Smith/Healings and miracles |publisher= [[FairMormon]] |work= fairmormon.org |date= May 23, 2010 |accessdate= 2010-09-20 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100201100307/http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_healings_and_miracles |archivedate= 2010-02-01 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.josephsmith.net/josephsmith/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=041579179acbff00VgnVCM1000001f5e340aRCRD&amp;locale=0 |title= Joseph Smith: Prophet of God |work= Josephsmith.net |publisher= [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS)}}{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to LDS doctrine, even though members may have the restored [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood authority]] to heal in the name of Jesus Christ, all efforts should be made to seek the appropriate medical help. [[Brigham Young]] stated this effectively, while also noting that the ultimate outcome is still dependent on the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young, Brigham|1997|loc= Chapter 34: "Strengthening the Saints Through the Gifts of the Spirit."

The organization has a panel of medical doctors who review the patient’s records looking at entries prior to the claimed miracles and entries after the miracle was claimed to have taken place. “The overall goal of GMRI is to promote an empirically grounded understanding of the physiological, emotional, and sociological effects of Christian Spiritual Healing practices.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalmri.org/index.php/about Global Medical Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; This is accomplished by applying the same rigorous standards used in other forms of medical and scientific research.

Both cases, however, are strictly limited to the body's natural abilities.

According to the [[American Cancer Society]]:
{{quote|... available scientific evidence does not support claims that faith healing can actually cure physical ailments... One review published in 1998 looked at 172 cases of deaths among children treated by faith healing instead of conventional methods. These researchers estimated that if conventional treatment had been given, the survival rate for most of these children would have been more than 90 percent, with the remainder of the children also having a good chance of survival. A more recent study found that more than 200 children had died of treatable illnesses in the United States over the past thirty years because their parents relied on spiritual healing rather than conventional medical treatment.}}

The [[American Medical Association]] considers that prayer as therapy should not be a medically reimbursable or deductible expense.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/apps/pf_new/pf_online?f_n=browse&amp;doc=policyfiles/HnE/H-185.987.HTM|title=H-185.987 Prayer Fees Reimbursed As Medical Expenses|accessdate=2008-01-17|publisher=American Medical Association}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative impact on public health===
Reliance on faith healing to the exclusion of other forms of treatment can have a public health impact when it reduces or eliminates access to modern medical techniques.{{efn|"Faith healing can cause patients to shun effective medical care." Bruce Flamm&lt;ref name='SRAM_Flamm'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inherent Dangers of Faith Healing Studies|journal=Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|date=2004|first=Bruce L.|last=Flamm|volume=8|issue=2|url=http://www.sram.org/0802/faith-healing.html|accessdate=2008-01-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816154915/http://www.sram.org/0802/faith-healing.html|archivedate=2007-08-16|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|"It is often claimed that faith healing may not work but at least does no harm. In fact, reliance on faith healing can cause serious harm and even death." Bruce Flamm&lt;ref name= "Flamm2004"/&gt;}}{{efn|"Faith-healers take from their subjects any hope of managing on their own. And they may very well take them away from legitimate treatments that could really help them." [[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} This is evident in both higher mortality rates for children&lt;ref name="AsserSwan1998"/&gt; and in reduced life expectancy for adults.&lt;ref name='JAMA longevity' /&gt; Critics have also made note of serious injury that has resulted from falsely labelled "healings", where patients erroneously consider themselves cured and cease or withdraw from treatment.&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"/&gt;{{efn|"These [discarded medications] are substances without which those people might well die."[[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} For example, at least six people have died after faith healing by their church and being told they had been healed of HIV and could stop taking their medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 25, 2011|url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16117269|title=Church tells HIV patients to stop treatment|first=Liz|last=Lane|publisher=[[Sky News]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126145744/http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16117269|archivedate=November 26, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the stated position of the AMA that "prayer as therapy should not delay access to traditional medical care".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Choosing faith healing while rejecting [[modern medicine]] can and does cause people to die needlessly.&lt;ref name=Cogan1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Cogan|title=Critical Thinking: Step by Step|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fit9rjXiLBUC&amp;pg=PA217|year=1998|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-1067-4|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian theological criticism of faith healing===
Christian theological criticism of faith healing broadly falls into two distinct levels of disagreement.

The first is widely termed the "open-but-cautious" view of the miraculous in the church today. This term is deliberately used by [[Robert L. Saucy]] in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?''.&lt;ref name="grudem et al."&gt;{{cite book |last= Saucy |first= Robert L. |authorlink= Robert L. Saucy |title= Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? |editor-last= Grudem |editor-first= Wayne |editor-link= Wayne Grudem |year= 1996 |isbn= 0310201551 |chapter= |page=}}{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Carson]] is another example of a Christian teacher who has put forward what has been described as an "open-but-cautious" view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/bio/dacarson.html |title= D.A. Carson: Biographical Sketch |work= Monergism.com |publisher= Christian Publication Resource Foundation |location= Portland, OR |accessdate= 2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dealing with the claims of [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|Warfield]], particularly "Warfield's insistence that miracles ceased,"{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} Carson asserts, "But this argument stands up only if such miraculous gifts are theologically tied exclusively to a role of attestation; and that is demonstrably not so."{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} However, while affirming that he does not expect healing to happen today, Carson is critical of aspects of the faith healing movement, "Another issue is that of immense abuses in healing practises.... The most common form of abuse is the view that since all illness is directly or indirectly attributable to the devil and his works, and since Christ by his cross has defeated the devil, and by his Spirit has given us the power to overcome him, healing is the inheritance right of all true Christians who call upon the Lord with genuine faith."{{sfn|Carson|1987|pages=174–5}}

The second level of theological disagreement with Christian faith healing goes further. Commonly referred to as [[cessationism]], its adherents either claim that faith healing will not happen today at all, or may happen today, but it would be unusual. [[Richard Gaffin]] argues for a form of cessationism in an essay alongside Saucy's in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today''? In his book ''Perspectives on Pentecost''{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2014}}}} Gaffin states of healing and related gifts that "the conclusion to be drawn is that as listed in 1 Corinthians 12(vv. 9f., 29f.) and encountered throughout the narrative in Acts, these gifts, particularly when exercised regularly by a given individual, are part of the foundational structure of the church... and so have passed out of the life of the church."{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|pages=113–4}} Gaffin qualifies this, however, by saying "At the same time, however, the sovereign will and power of God today to heal the sick, particularly in response to prayer (see e.g. James 5:14,15), ought to be acknowledged and insisted on."{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|page=114}}

===Fraud===
Skeptics of faith healers point to fraudulent practices either in the healings themselves (such as plants in the audience with fake illnesses), or concurrent with the healing work supposedly taking place and claim that faith healing is a [[quackery|quack]] practice in which the "healers" use well known non-supernatural illusions to exploit credulous people in order to obtain their gratitude, confidence and money.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} [[James Randi]]'s ''[[The Faith Healers]]'' investigates Christian evangelists such as [[Peter Popoff]], who claimed to heal sick people on stage in front of an audience. Popoff pretended to know private details about participants' lives by receiving radio transmissions from his wife who was off-stage and had gathered information from audience members prior to the show.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} According to this book, many of the leading modern evangelistic healers have engaged in deception and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/faith.html|title=Some Thoughts about Faith Healing|website=www.quackwatch.com|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also questioned how faith healers use funds that were sent to them for specific purposes.{{efn|"[Some] faith-healers have been less than careful in their use of funds sent to them for specific purposes."[[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} Physicist [[Robert L. Park]]&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; and doctor and consumer advocate [[Stephen Barrett]]&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"/&gt; have called into question the ethics of some exorbitant fees.

There have also been legal controversies. For example, in 1955 at a [[Jack Coe]] revival service in [[Miami, Florida]], Coe told the parents of a three-year-old boy that he healed their son who had polio.&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0040/6776104/33436272_clean.html |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130129191538/http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0040/6776104/33436272_clean.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= January 29, 2013 |title= Faith healer dies – Victim of bulbar polio |newspaper= [[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|Daily Courier]] |location= Yavapai County, AZ |date= December 18, 1956 |accessdate= 2007-11-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Faith-healer' dies of polio |date= December 17, 1956 |newspaper= [[The Salina Journal]] |location= Salina, KS |page= 5 |url= https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/40757536/ |subscription= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coe then told the parents to remove the boy's [[leg braces]].&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"/&gt; However, their son was not cured of polio and removing the braces left the boy in constant pain.&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Davis |first= Mike |title= Lost faith: Mother's story of healer |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&amp;dat=19560208&amp;id=AJ0yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MekFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3001,2779353 |date= February 8, 1956 |page= 7A |newspaper= [[The Miami News|The Miami Daily News]] |location= Miami, FL |accessdate= 2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, through the efforts of [[Joseph L.

===Miracles for sale===
TV personality [[Derren Brown]] produced a show on faith healing entitled "Miracles for sale" which arguably exposed the art of faith healing as a scam. In this show, Derren trained a scuba diver trainer picked from the general public to be a faith healer and took him to Texas to successfully deliver a faith healing session to a congregation.&lt;ref name="metro-derren-brown"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://metro.co.uk/2011/04/25/derren-brown-miracles-for-sale-tv-review-653303 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130215041421/http://metro.co.uk/2011/04/25/derren-brown-miracles-for-sale-tv-review-653303/ |dead-url= no |archive-date= February 15, 2013 |title= Derren Brown: Miracles For Sale was deceptively entertaining polio |newspaper= [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date= April 25, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States law==
The 1974 [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA) required states to grant religious exemptions to [[child neglect]] and [[child abuse]] laws in order to receive federal money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Merrick |first=Janna C. |year= 2003 |title= Spiritual healing, sick kids and the law: Inequities in the American healthcare system |journal= [[American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine]] |volume= 29 |issue=2-3 |pages= 269–99 |pmid= 12961808}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAPTA amendments of 1996 {{usc|42|5106i}} state:

{{quote|text=
(a) In General. – Nothing in this Act shall be construed –

"(1) as establishing a Federal requirement that a parent or legal guardian provide a child any medical service or treatment against the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian; and "(2) to require that a State find, or to prohibit a State from finding, abuse or neglect in cases in which a parent or legal guardian relies solely or partially upon spiritual means rather than medical treatment, in accordance with the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian.

"(b) State Requirement. – Notwithstanding subsection (a), a State shall, at a minimum, have in place authority under State law to permit the child protective services system of the State to pursue any legal remedies, including the authority to initiate legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, to provide medical care or treatment for a child when such care or treatment is necessary to prevent or remedy serious harm to the child, or to prevent the withholding of medically indicated treatment from children with life threatening conditions. Except with respect to the withholding of medically indicated treatments from disabled infants with life threatening conditions, case by case determinations concerning the exercise of the authority of this subsection shall be within the sole discretion of the State.}}

Thirty-one states have child-abuse religious exemptions. These are Alabama, Alaska, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |title=Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect |accessdate=2009-02-27 |publisher=[[Child Welfare Information Gateway]], [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services]] |date=April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011062659/http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- updated version (February 2011) available at url given --&gt; In six of these states, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Ohio and West Virginia, the exemptions extend to murder and manslaughter.

'''Higher consciousness''' is the consciousness of a higher Self, transcendental reality, or God. It is "the part of the human being that is capable of transcending animal instincts".{{sfn|Bunge|2001|p=341}} The concept was significantly developed in [[German Idealism]], and is a central notion in [[New age|contemporary popular spirituality]]. However, it has ancient roots, dating back to the [[Bhagvad Gita]] and Indian [[Veda]]s.

==Philosophy==

===Fichte===
Fichte distinguished the finite or empirical ego from the pure or infinite ego. The activity of this "pure ego" can be discovered by a "higher intuition".{{sfn|Whiteman|2014|p=398}}{{refn|group=note|See also Daniel Breazeale (2013), ''Thinking Through the Wissenschaftslehre: Themes from Fichte's Early Philosophy'', and [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/johann-fichte/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "Johann Gottlieb Fichte"].}}

[[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] (1762-1814) was one of the founding figures of [[German idealism]], which developed from the theoretical and ethical writings of [[Immanuel Kant]].{{sfn|Whiteman|2014|p=398}} His philosophy forms a bridge between the ideas of Kant and those of the German Idealist [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

According to Michael Whiteman, Fichte's philosophical system "is a remarkable western formulation of [[Nondualism|eastern mystical teachings]] (of [[Advaita]])."{{sfn|Whiteman|2014|p=398}}

===Schopenhauer===
In 1812 [[Schopenhauer]] started to use the term "the better consciousness", a consciousness
{{quote|...[that] lies beyond all experience and thus all reason, both theoretical and practical (instinct).{{sfn|Cartwright|2010|p=181}}}}

According to Yasuo Kamata, Schopenhauer's idea of "the better consciousness" finds its origin in [[Fichte]]'s idea of a "higher consciousness" (''höhere Bewusstsein''){{sfn|Cartwright|2010|p=181 note 5}} or "higher intuition",{{sfn|Gillespie|1996|p=194}} and also bears resemblance to [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]'s notion of "intellectual intuition".{{sfn|Cartwright|2010|p=181 note 5}} According to Schopenhauer himself, his notion of a "better consciousness" was different from Schelling's notion of "intellectual intuition", since Schelling's notion required intellectual development of the understanding, while his notion of a "better consciousness" was "like a flash of insight, with no connection to the understanding."{{sfn|Cartwright|2010|p=181 note 5}}

According to Schopenhauer,
{{quote|The better consciousness in me lifts me into a world where there is no longer personality and causality or subject or object. My hope and my belief is that this better (supersensible and extra-temporal) consciousness will become my only one, and for that reason I hope that it is not God. But if anyone wants to use the expression ''God'' symbolically for the better consciousness itself or for much that we are able to separate or name, so let it be, yet not among philosophers I would have thought.{{sfn|Cartwright|2010|p=182}}}}

==Religion==

===Faiths===
Almost all religions have a concept of higher consciousness in at least some sects. It was first mentioned in recorded human history in the Sanskrit Hindu texts, the [[Upanishads]].

===Schleiermacher===
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768-1834) made a distinction between lower and higher (self)consciousness.{{sfn|Bunge|2001|p=341}}{{sfn|Merklinger|1993|p=67}} In Schleirmacher's theology, self-consciousness contains "a feeling that points to the presence of an absolute other, God, as actively independent of the self and its 'world'."{{sfn|Merklinger|1993|p=65}} For Schleiermacher, "all particular manifestations of piety share a common essence, the sense of dependency on God as the outside 'infinite'."{{sfn|Merklinger|1993|p=65}} The feeling of dependency, or "God-consciousness", is a higher form of consciousness.{{sfn|Merklinger|1993|p=67}} This consciousness is not "God himself",{{sfn|Merklinger|1993|p=68}} since God would then no longer be "an infinite infinite, but a finite infinite, a mere projection of consciousness."{{sfn|Merklinger|1993|p=68}}

For Schleiermacher, the lower consciousness is "the animal part of mankind", which includes basic sensations such as hunger, thirst, pain and pleasure, as well as basic drives and pleasures, and {{sfn|Bunge|2001|p=341}} higher consciousness is "the part of the human being that is capable of transcending animal instincts",{{sfn|Bunge|2001|p=341}} and the "point of contact with God". Bunge describes this as {{sfn|Bunge|2001|p=341}}"the essence of being human".{{sfn|Bunge|2001|p=341}}

When this consciousness is present, "people are not alienated from God by their instincts".{{sfn|Bunge|2001|p=341}} The relation between the lower and the higher consciousness is akin to "[[Paul the Apostle|Paul's]] struggle of the spirit to overcome the flesh",{{sfn|Bunge|2001|p=341}} or the distinction between the natural and the spiritual side of human beings.{{sfn|Merklinger|1993|p=67}}

===19th century movements===
The idea of a "wider self walled in by the habits of ego-consciousness"{{sfn|Heisig|2003|p=54}}  and the search for a "higher consciousness" was manifested in 19th century movements as [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]{{sfn|Heisig|2003|p=54}} [[New Thought]]{{sfn|Heisig|2003|p=54}} [[Christian Science]],{{sfn|Heisig|2003|p=54}} and [[Transcendentalism]].{{sfn|Ladd|Anesko|Phillips|Meyers|2010|p=33-34}}

The 19th century Transcendentalists saw the entire physical world as a representation of a higher spiritual world.{{sfn|Ladd|Anesko|Phillips|Meyers|2010|p=33}} They believed that humans could elevate themselves above their animal instincts, attain a higher consciousness, and partake in this spiritual world.{{sfn|Ladd|Anesko|Phillips|Meyers|2010|p=34}}

According to Blavatsky, who founded the Theosophical Movement,
{{quote|By that higher intuition acquired by Theosophia - or God-knowledge, which carried the mind from the world of form into that of formless spirit, man has been sometimes enabled in every age and every country to perceive things in the interior or invisible world.&lt;ref name="Blavatsky" /&gt;}}

[[Blavatsky]] refers to Fichte in her explanation of Theosophy:
{{quote|Theosophy [...] prompted such men as Hegel, Fichte and Spinoza to take up the labors of the old Grecian philosophers and speculate upon the One Substance - the Deity, the Divine All proceeding from the Divine Wisdom - incomprehensible, unknown and unnamed.&lt;ref name="Blavatsky"&gt;[http://www.filosofiaesoterica.com/ler.php?id=803 Helena P. Blavatsky, ''What Is Theosophy?'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Modern spirituality===
The idea of "lower" and "higher consciousness" has gained popularity in modern popular spirituality.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996}} According to James Beverley, it lies at the heart of the [[New age|New Age movement]].{{sfn|Beverley|2009}}

[[Ken Wilber]] has tried to integrate eastern and western models of the mind, using the notion of "lower" and "higher consciousness". In his book ''The Spectrum of Consciousness'' Wilber describes consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end, and more profound types of awareness at higher levels.{{sfn|Wilber|2002|p=3–16}} In later works he describes the development of consciousness as a development from lower consciousness, through personal consciousness, to higher [[transpersonal]] consciousness.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996}}

==Cognitive science==
[[Gerald Edelman]], in his 'Theory of Consciousness', distinguishes higher consciousness, or "[[secondary consciousness]]" from "[[primary consciousness]]", defined as simple awareness that includes perception and emotion. Higher consciousness in contrast, "involves the ability to be conscious of being conscious", and "allows the recognition by a thinking subject of his or her own acts and affections".  Higher consciousness requires, at a minimal level [[Semantics|semantic]] ability, and "in its most developed form, requires linguistic ability, or the  mastery of a whole system of symbols and a grammar".{{sfn|Edelman|2004}}

== Psychotropics ==
{{Main|Psychoactive drug|Altered states of consciousness}}

Psychedelic drugs can be used to alter the brain cognition and perception, some believing this to be a state of higher consciousness and transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;Dutta 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Typical psychedelic drugs are hallucinogens including LSD, DMT (Dimethyltryptamine), cannabis, peyote, and psilocybin mushrooms.&lt;ref name="Dutta, 2012"&gt;Dutta, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wolfson, these drug-induced altered states of consciousness may result in a more long-term and positive transformation of self.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dutta, psychedelic drugs may be used for psychoanalytic therapy,&lt;ref name="Dutta, 2012"/&gt; as a means to gain access  to the higher consciousness, thereby providing patients the ability to access memories that are held deep within their mind.&lt;ref name="Dutta, 2012"/&gt;

[[Image:Leo-baeck-haus.berlin.II.JPG|thumb|The quondam building of the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums at Tucholskystraße 9 in Berlin (since 1999 named Leo-Baeck-Haus and seat of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]])]]

'''Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums''', or '''Higher Institute for Jewish Studies''', was a [[rabbi]]nical [[seminary]], established in [[Berlin]] in 1872 and closed down by the Nazi government of Germany in 1942. Upon the order of the government, the name was officially changed (1883–1923 and 1933–42) to Lehranstalt für die Wissenschaft des Judentums.

==History ==
[[Abraham Geiger]], who had been active in establishing Reform Judaism, wanted a university for Jewish studies in Berlin. Unable to become part of the [[University of Berlin]], he was involved in 1870 in creating a separate institution. Also involved were [[David Cassel]], [[Israel Lewy]] and [[Heyman Steinthal]], the Jewish "intellectuals" and professors at the University of Berlin.

Geiger's "General Introduction to the Science of Judaism," "Introduction to the Biblical Writings" and "Lectures on Pirḳe Abot" were originally delivered as lectures at the seminary. Some of the best German-Jewish teachers taught there in the spirit of the ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' movement: [[Hanoch Albeck]], [[Ismar Elbogen]], Julius Grünthal, [[Julius Guttmann]], [[Franz Rosenthal]], [[Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai|Harry Torczyner]], and [[Leo Baeck]].

[[Moritz Steinschneider]] referred to the ''Hochschule'' as a "new ghetto of Jewish learning," which he felt could ultimately not produce the standards of scholarship achieved in the university setting {{Harv|Mendes-Flohr|1998}}.

Officially the institution was not affiliated with a movement or denomination. It sought free inquiry and research without any restrictions. It stood for a conservative Judaism, but its main object was the scientific study of things Jewish, freed as far as possible from denominational disputes. There was no religious test for professors but it was assumed that all of the faculty lived according to the Jewish tradition and were fluent in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. As the school was never dependent on any religious or public organization, the board was constantly engaged in raising money from wealthy contributors, sponsors of scholarly "chairs" and scholarships.

In 1872, the first year, there were only 12 students, including four women. In 1921, there were 63 full-time and 45 part-time students enrolled in the "Hochschule". Many of the students came from the Eastern European countries, notably [[Poland]], as graduates of Orthodox [[Yeshivot]]. By 1930–33 the school had achieved so great a reputation that many non-Jews, especially [[Christian clergy]], enrolled.

Like all morning glories the plant entwines itself around structures, growing to a height of {{convert|2|–|3|m}} tall. The leaves are heart-shaped and the stems are covered with brown hairs. The [[flower]]s are trumpet-shaped, predominantly blue to purple or white, and {{convert|3|–|6|cm}} diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitats==
The plant is predisposed to moist and rich [[soil]], but can be found growing in a wide array of soil types.&lt;ref name="Richard H. Uva 1997 Pp. 214-217"&gt;Richard H. Uva, Joseph C. Neal and Joseph M. Ditomaso, ''Weeds of The Northeast'', (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1997), Pp. 214-217.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] throughout warm temperate and subtropical regions of the world. Although it is often considered a noxious weed, ''Ipomoea purpurea'' is also grown for its beautiful purple and white flowers and has many [[cultivar]]s. Common cultivars include ''I. purpurea'' 'Crimson Rambler' (red-violet blossoms with white throats), 'Grandpa Ott's,' 'Kniola's Black Knight,' and 'Star of Yelta' (blossoms in varying shades of deep purple with white or pale pink throats) and 'Milky Way' (white blossoms with mauve accents).

==Chemistry==
The triangular seeds may have some history of use as a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]; they, like ''[[Ipomoea tricolor]]'' may contain [[Ergine|LSA]].&lt;ref name="Richard H. Uva 1997 Pp. 214-217"/&gt; Effects are reported to be somewhat similar to those of [[LSD]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Savage, Willis W. Harman and James Fadiman, [http://diseyes.lycaeum.org/olo/glory.txt ''Ipomoea purpurea'': A Naturally Occurring Psychedelic]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flower color===
Acylated [[cyanidin]] glycosides can be isolated from violet-blue flowers of ''I. purpurea''. These anthocyanins were all based on cyanidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucoside, acylated with caffeic acid and/or p-coumaric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acylated cyanidin glycosides in the violet-blue flowers of ''Ipomoea purpurea''|author=Norio Saito, Fumi Tatsuzawa, Kyoko Yoda, Masato Yokoi, Kichiji Kasahara, Shigeru Iida, Atsushi Shigihara and Toshio Honda|journal=[[Phytochemistry (journal)|Phytochemistry]]|date=November 1995|volume=40|issue=4|pages=1283–1289|doi=10.1016/0031-9422(95)00369-I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acylated [[pelargonidin]] glycosides can be isolated from the red-purple flowers of ''I. purpurea''.

===Toxic treatments===
Commercial morning glory seeds are commonly treated with toxic [[methylmercury]] which serves as a preservative and a cumulative neurotoxic poison that is considered useful by some to discourage recreational use of them. There is no legal requirement in the United States to disclose to buyers that seeds have been treated with a toxic heavy metal compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunn Chace |first=Teri |date=2015 |title=Seeing Seeds: A Journey into the World of Seedheads, Pods, and Fruit |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlfVCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=methylmercury+morning+glory#v=onepage&amp;q=methylmercury%20morning%20glory&amp;f=false |location=Portland OR |publisher=Timber Press |page= |isbn=1604694920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book Substances of Abuse, in addition to methylmercury, the seeds are commonly coated with a chemical that cannot be removed with washing that is designed to cause unpleasant physical symptoms such as nausea and abdominal pain. The book states that this chemical is also toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Potter |first=James |date=2008 |title=Substances of Abuse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WU73eJAIDI4C&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=methylmercury+morning+glory |location=Redding CA |publisher=Jubilee Enterprises |page=157 |isbn=1930327463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Davies''' (John Davies of Nercwys) (born at Llanerch, in the parish of Llanarmon yn Ial 26 May, 1799 and baptised in the Parish Church on 31 May, 1799 the family moved to Rhos Ithel, Nercwys in about 1800 where he died on 5 March 1879) was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist minister, preacher and writer. His parents were Joseph and Eleanor Davies Nee Parry. Although an itinerant preacher his home remained in [[Nercwys]] area of [[Flintshire]], hence the place name was used as an additional epithet to differentiate him from others named John Davies. He grew up living in the [[Mold]] area. At the age of 16, in 1815, he is known to have become a member of [[Mold]] Methodist Society. A few years later he began preaching, and in 1834 was ordained.

His writings include a commentary on the [[Book of Proverbs]] (1869).

He died in March 1879.

'''Kurdification''' is a cultural change in which non-ethnic Kurds or/and non-ethnic Kurdish area becomes [[Kurds|Kurdish]]. This can happen both naturally (as seen in [[Turkish Kurdistan]]) and deliberately (as seen in Iraq after [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|the invasion of Iraq]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Ali,  Pratt|first=Nadje Sadig, Nicola Christine|title=What kind of liberation?: women and the occupation of Iraq|year=2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25729-0|pages=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KnoG_52Jh8C&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Preti Taneja, Minority Rights Group International|title=Assimilation, exodus, eradication: Iraq's minority communities since 2003|year=2007|publisher=Minority Rights Group International|pages=19|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,4565c22553,4565c25f653,469cbf9d0,0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=10562 "Overcrowding and Kurdification threaten Christians in northern Iraq"] (AsiaNews, October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNHCR’s ELIGIBILITY GUIDELINES FOR  ASSESSING THE INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION  NEEDS OF IRAQI ASYLUM-SEEKERS|page=11|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/46deb05557.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caucasian refugees (1860s-1910s)===
{{main|Chechen Kurds}}
When refugees from Caucasus reached the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople decided not to settle these in Kurdistan due to the extreme poverty and lack of material resources for the refugees. Yet after some time, the Ottomans started seeing the refugees as a chance to diminish the Kurdish claim to the region and allowed the refugees to settle in the region.&lt;ref name="klein" &gt;{{cite book|author1=Janet Klein|title=The Margins of Empire: Kurdish Militias in the Ottoman Tribal Zone|date=2011|isbn=9780804777759}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, Circassian refugees from the [[Shapsug]] tribe arrived in the Kurdish areas of [[Ahlat]] and [[Adilcevaz]] and settled in the three Kurdish villages of Yoğurtyemez, Xanik (Çukurtarla), Develik and founded the village of Koxiş (Yolçatı).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unutulmuş Ahlat Çerkesleri-1|url=http://www.cerkesfed.org/2016/08/16/unutulmus-ahlat-cerkesleri-1/|accessdate=11 December 2016|agency=Cerkes-Fed|date=16 August 2016|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first big wave of Caucasian refugees to Kurdistan was in 1864 when 15,000 to 20,000 refugees settled in [[Sarıkamış]], founding new villages and settling in abandoned Greek and Armenian villages.&lt;ref name="chochievkoc" &gt;{{cite journal|author1=Georgi Chochiev and Bekir Koç|title=Migrants from the North Caucasus in Eastern Anatolia: Some Notes on Their Settlement and Adaptation|journal=Journal of Asian History|date=2006|volume=40|issue=183|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; These refugees included [[Circassians]], [[Chechens]], [[Laks (Caucasus)|Laks]] and [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kars - Index Anatolicus|url=http://nisanyanmap.com/?y=&amp;t=Kars&amp;u=1&amp;ua=0|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest group of refugees were Circassias who fled the [[Circassia]] region (part of the [[Russian Empire]]) during the [[ethnic cleansing of Circassians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anita L.

Chechens and [[Ingushs]] mostly settled in [[Varto]] area, in the villages of Arincik (Kıyıbaşı),  Çarbuhur (Bağiçi), Tepeköy, Artet (Serinova), Ulusırt and Arinç (Çöğürlü),&lt;ref name="checheningush" &gt;{{cite book|title=Caucasian battlefields : a history of the wars on the Turco-Caucasian border, 1828-1921|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=104|isbn=9781108013352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avars who settled in Kayalık village,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Varto - Index Anatolicus|url=http://nisanyanmap.com/?y=&amp;t=Varto&amp;u=1&amp;ua=0|publisher=Index Anatolicus|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Circassians of the [[Kabardians|Kabardian]] tribe founded the village of Narlı Çerkezleri (Eskinarlı) in [[Pazarcık]] area.&lt;ref name="list" /&gt;  There is also a [[Georgians|Georgian]] village in [[Diyarbakir Province]].&lt;ref name="georgian" &gt;{{cite web|title=Ortayazı Köyü/Ergani/Diyarbakır|url=http://www.gdd.org.tr/koydetay.asp?id=47|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From early stage on, these Caucasians went through a process of kurdification and thereby had Kurdish as their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmet Buran Ph.D., Türkiye'de Diller ve Etnik Gruplar, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cerkes" &gt;{{cite book|author1=Yeldar Barış Kalkan|title=Çerkes halkı ve sorunları: Çerkes tarih, kültür, coğrafya ve siyasetine sınıfsal yaklaşım|date=2006|page=175|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dursun Gümüşoğlu|title=Anadolu'da bir köy: Eskikonak : antropolojik inceleme|date=2008|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Until 2011 (end of main U.S. military presence)===

On 21 August 2006, Shabak Democratic Party leader Hunain Qaddo, proposed the creation of a separate province within the borders of the Nineveh Plain, in order to combat the Arabization and Kurdification of Iraqi minorities. The Iraqi government voted against the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06BAGHDAD3283_a.html|title=Cable: 06BAGHDAD3283_a|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ismail|first1=Mirza|title=The Kurdish Threat to The Yezidis of North Iraq|url=http://www.aina.org/guesteds/20081201015903.htm|publisher=Assyrian International News Agency|accessdate=26 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223112315/http://www.aina.org/guesteds/20081201015903.htm|archivedate=2008-12-23|date=2008-12-01|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jihadology.net/2015/01/12/hizballah-cavalcade-quwat-sahl-ninawa-iraqs-shia-shabak-get-their-own-militia/|title=Hizballah Cavalcade: Quwat Sahl Nīnawā: Iraq’s Shia Shabak Get Their Own Militia|work=JIHADOLOGY: A clearinghouse for jihādī primary source material, original analysis, and translation service|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/guesteds/20050828120403.htm|title=Iraq's Shabaks Are Being Oppressed By Kurds|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/06/tastekin-iraqi-turkmen-isis-kirkuk-mosul-arms-itf.html|title=Iraqi Turkmen take up arms in Kirkuk - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/10/a-yazidi-super-hero-who-won-t-go-away.html|title=The Hero Yazidis Hope Will Save Them|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/inside-the-christian-militias-defending-the-nineveh-plains-fe4a10babeed|title=Inside the Christian Militias Defending the Nineveh Plains — War Is Boring|author=Matt Cetti-Roberts|work=Medium|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restoreninevehnow.org/?page_id=153|title=The Nineveh Plain Protection Units|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There have been reports that some Arabs are being displaced in previously mixed Kurdish-Arab villages in Northern Iraq.&lt;ref name="rebeccacollard/makhmour"/&gt;

The Kurdish government defended the Kurdification with the [[Kirkuk status referendum#The Iraqi Constitution|implementation of article 140 of the Iraqi constitution]] which ensured the restoration of the situation as it was before [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Anfal genocide|genocide]] and [[Arabization]] policies against the Kurdish population during the [[Al-Anfal Campaign]] and the [[Persecution of Feyli Kurds under Saddam Hussein|Kurdish Feyli genocide]].

Intensified tensions between Kurds and [[Sunni Arabs]] led to violent clashes between both of them since Saddam's Arabization and genocide campaigns against the Kurdish population in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. On 21 August 2006, Shabak Democratic Party leader Hunain Qaddo proposed the creation of a separate province within the borders of the [[Nineveh plains|Nineveh Plains]], in order to combat the "Arabization" and "Kurdification" of Iraqi minorities. The Iraqi government voted against the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06BAGHDAD3283_a.html|title=Cable: 06BAGHDAD3283_a|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jihadology.net/2015/01/12/hizballah-cavalcade-quwat-sahl-ninawa-iraqs-shia-shabak-get-their-own-militia/|title=Hizballah Cavalcade: Quwat Sahl Nīnawā: Iraq’s Shia Shabak Get Their Own Militia|work=JIHADOLOGY: A clearinghouse for jihādī primary source material, original analysis, and translation service|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/10/a-yazidi-super-hero-who-won-t-go-away.html|title=The Hero Yazidis Hope Will Save Them|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/inside-the-christian-militias-defending-the-nineveh-plains-fe4a10babeed|title=Inside the Christian Militias Defending the Nineveh Plains — War Is Boring|author=Matt Cetti-Roberts|work=Medium|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 2011===

Kurdification or re-Kurdification (post-Saddam) has been an open policy of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq since 2003, according to Gareth Stansfield, a professor of Middle East politics at the University of Exeter.&lt;ref name="rebeccacollard/makhmour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3182347/kurds-sunni-arabs-iraq-isis-erbil/|title=Kurds and Sunni Arabs Fall Out in the Wake of ISIS Fight|author=Rebecca Collard / Makhmour|work=TIME.com|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Assyrians sources claimed that the Kurds have clear plans for the annexation of the Nineveh Plains to the Kurdish control and it is claimed by Assyrian activists that they have "always sent their followers to international forums to interrupt international protection for Assyrians".&lt;ref name="middleeastmonitor.com"&gt;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/articles/middle-east/14007-assyrians-need-protection-from-islamisation-and-kurdification&lt;/ref&gt; The Hareetz newspaper had reported on 24 December 2014 that the Kurds object to the establishment of a protected Christian enclave, because they want to annex the Nineveh Valley, most of whose residents are Christians.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/articles/middle-east/14007-assyrians-need-protection-from-islamisation-and-kurdification, Haaretz newspaper on 24 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aina.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20110930190835.htm|title=Assyrians of Iraq and the Nineveh Plain Conspiracy|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian activist from the Assyrian Patriotic Movement claimed that the entire Assyrian Triangle (between Greater Zab and the River Tigris) has been "occupied by Kurdish intruders".&lt;ref name="middleeastmonitor.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aina.org"/&gt; Some Assyrians in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq also complained that construction plans are "aimed at affecting a demographic change that divides Assyrian blocs". Also some Yazidis, Shabaks and Turkmens have reported that they are facing a policy of cultural and security control against them, especially in areas which belonged to the Kurds before Saddam's [[Al-Anfal Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/09/iraq-kurdistan-region-protect-minority-rights.html|title=Iraqi Kurdistan Must Ensure Minority Rights - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, David Romano, Professor of Middle East Politics, said that without the [[YPG]] and [[Peshmerga]], the Assyrians of northern Syria and Iraq would likely all be dead, lying in some [[Jihadism|jihadist]]-dug mass grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=http://rudaw.net/english/opinion/21012016?ctl00_phMainContainer_phMain_ControlComments1_gvCommentsChangePage=3_20|url=http://rudaw.net/english/opinion/21012016?ctl00_phMainContainer_phMain_ControlComments1_gvCommentsChangePage=3_20|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=rudaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that the Kurdish militia (Peshmerga) quickly abandoned their positions at the beginning of the [[ISIL]] occupation of the city of [[Mosul]], and that the Peshmerga, who had disarmed Assyrians and left them defenseless, retreated without informing the indigenous Christian population, leaving them uninformed and unarmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Ned|last2=Coles|first2=Isabel|last3=Salman|first3=Raheem|title=Special Report: How Mosul fell - An Iraqi general disputes Baghdad's story|url=http:// uk.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-gharawi-spe- cial-report-idUSKCN0I30Z820141014|agency=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|date=14/10/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum published news which argued that the Yazidis have frequently been pressured to assimilate to both Arab and Kurdish ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/cases/iraq/background/people-of-the-book|title=The People of the Book and the Hierarchy of Discrimination|website=www.ushmm.org|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources have stated that Yazidis already speak [[Northern Kurdish]] which is one of the two major dialects of Kurdish language. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yezidisinternational.org/abouttheyezidipeople/glossary/|title=Yezidi Language|work=Yezidis|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraqi civil war]], Iraqi army troops fled their posts around the Nineveh Plains while ISIL attacked. Later, [[Kurdistan Regional Government|KRG]] forces, with the support of coalition airstrikes, captured these areas from ISIL. Since then, there have been disputes between pro-government Assyrians and Kurds, as the former have either asked the Kurds to leave or promised them autonomy.

In 2011, some Yazidi activists voiced their "concern over forced assimilation into Kurdish identity". Some have accused the Kurdish and Iraqi parties of diverting US $12 million of reconstruction funds allocated for Yazidi areas in [[Sinjar|Jebel Sinjar]] to a Kurdish village and marginalizing them politically.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; According to Sweden-based economist David Ghanim, the goal of some tactics of the KRG had been to push [[Shabak people|Shabak]] and [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] communities to identify as [[Kurds]], which has been strongly denied by KRG authorities. He also claimed that the Kurdish authorities are working to impose Kurdish identity on the Yazidis and the Shabaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghanim|first1=David|title=Iraq's Dysfunctional Democracy|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZ076ls9unQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Iraq%27s+Dysfunctional+Democracy&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qsHsU9n8I4rmyQPLs4DYCg&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Iraq's%20Dysfunctional%20Democracy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian International News Agency claimed that the Kurds have annexed Assyrian, Yazidi and Shabak villages and which now under Kurdish Control in North Iraq,&lt;ref name="aina.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20140614185547.htm|title=Assyrian, Yezidi and Shabak Villages Are Now Under Kurdish Control in North Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20150810104756.htm|title=Kurds Build Cemetery, Park in Heart of Assyrian Area in Turkey|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in Iraqi Kurdistan, Assyrian politicians of some towns have been replaced with Kurdish ones.&lt;ref name="aina.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20140614185547.htm|title=Assyrian, Yezidi and Shabak Villages Are Now Under Kurdish Control in North Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syria==

Assyrians have claimed that Kurdish nationalists have enforced revisionist curricula in schools with a Kurdish-nationalist bias. This is controversial since it has been noted they ""alter historical and geographical facts"", including Assyrian place names which are changed to Kurdish names, and students are taught that King Nebuchadnezzar from the Old Testament married a Kurdish woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article155513600/Ein-Krieg-um-Schulbuecher-bestimmt-Syriens-Zukunft.html WELT] [http://www.aina.org/news/20160524145527.htm AINA]. According to Aboona, due to the very obscure history of the Kurds and the lack of historical sources, ""Kurds have been forced to look for what they wanted in others' nations sources" [such as Assyrian history]. "Most of the inhabitants of today's Kurdistan region were Christians and were later displaced or absorbed by Kurdish tribes. The scholarly consensus is that Kurdish tribes were living in nomadic and pastoral societys, living in their tents, divided into tribes and subtribes, and were "less disposed to adopt civilisation than the Persians or Turks". Between 1055 and 1536, many Assyrian worship centers in northern and northeastern ancient Assyrian "were raided and attacked by Kurds who killed, looted and enslaved the indigenous population." "During these times Kurds were moving into Assyrian regions." Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. . {{ISBN|978-1-60497-583-3}}. page 89-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish news claimed that Ossama Telcu, member of the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces]], had claimed that the PYD forces set ablaze civil registry and land registry buildings in Manbij shortly after taking city from ISIL. According to Turkish AA source, PYD forces set ablaze civil registry and land registry buildings in [[Manbij]]. In addition, it was claimed that the PYD had also been sending away Sunni Arabs and [[Syrian Turkmens|Turkmen]] residents who want to return to their homes in [[Manbij]] on the pretext that ISIL has planted mines inside the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/syria-pyd-accused-of-changing-demography-in-manbij/628495|title=Syria: PYD accused of changing demography in Manbij|publisher= Anadolu Agency|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.antiwar.com/2016/08/14/kurds-accused-of-changing-demography-in-manbij/|title=Kurds Accused of Changing Demography in Manbij|publisher= Antiwar.com|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/12/report-u-s-backed-kurdish-rebels-may-have-committed-war-crimes-in-syria/?postshare=7521444690898402|title=Report: U.S.-backed Kurdish rebels may have committed war crimes in Syria|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Reuters, Kurdish and US sources reported that civilians had returned to their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands return to Manbij after IS militants flee city|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-manbij-idUSKCN10O0S2|accessdate=12 September 2016|work=Reuters|date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohammed Marwa''' (died 1980), best known by his nickname '''Maitatsine''' (and less commonly, as ''AllahTatsine''), was a controversial preacher in [[Nigeria]]. ''Maitatsine'' is a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word meaning "the one who damns" and refers to his curse-laden public speeches against the Nigerian state.&lt;ref name=adesoji&gt;{{cite journal | title = Between Maitatsine and Boko Haram: Islamic Fundamentalism and the Response of the Nigerian State | journal = Africa Today | date = Summer 2011 | first = Abimbola | last = Adesoji | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 98–119, 136| id = | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/883393210?accountid=10475 | accessdate = 2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
He was originally from [[Maroua|Marwa]] in northern [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name=Lubeck&gt;{{cite journal|title=Islamic Protest under Semi-Industrial Capitalism: 'Yan Tatsine Explained|author=Paul M. Lubeck|journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute |volume=55 |issue=4 |year=1985 |pages=369–389 |jstor=1160172}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his education he moved to [[Kano, Nigeria]] in about 1945, where he became known for his controversial preachings on the [[Qur'an]].  Although a Koranic scholar, he seemingly rejected the [[hadith]] and the [[sunnah]] and regarded the reading of any other book but the Koran as [[paganism]].  Maitatsine spoke against the use of radios, watches, bicycles, cars and the possession of more money than necessary.&lt;ref name='kastfelt1989'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Rumours of Maitatsine: A Note on Political Culture in Northern Nigeria | journal = African Affairs | year = 1989 | first = Niels | last = Kastfelt | volume = 88 | issue = 350 | pages = 83–90 | url = http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/content/88/350/83.extract | accessdate = 2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='pham'/&gt;  

The British [[Colonial Nigeria|colonial authorities]] sent him into [[exile]], but he returned to Kano shortly after [[Nigerian Independence|independence]]. By 1972 he had a notable and increasingly militant following known as ''[[Yan Tatsine]]''.&lt;ref name='pham'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worlddefensereview.com/pham101906.shtml |title=In Nigeria False Prophets Are Real Problems |accessdate=2011-11-21 |last=Pham |first=J.

His preaching attracted largely a following of youths, unemployed migrants, and those who felt that mainstream Muslim teachers were not doing enough for their communities.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  By December 1980, continued Yan Tatsine attacks on other religious figures and police forced the Nigerian army to become involved.  Subsequent armed clashes led to the deaths of around 5,000 people, including Maitatsine himself.&lt;ref name='pham'/&gt;  Maitatsine died shortly after sustaining injuries in the clashes either from his wounds or from a heart attack.&lt;ref name='hiskett'&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Maitatsine Riots in Kano, 1980: An Assessment | journal = Journal of Religion in Africa | date = October 1987 | first = Mervyn | last = Hiskett | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 209–23 | jstor = 1580875 | doi=10.1163/157006687x00145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2010 article published by the [[Sunday Trust]] magazine the military cremated Maitatsine's remains, which now rest in a bottle kept at a police laboratory in Kano.&lt;ref name="sundayTrust20101226"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sundaytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5631:maitatsine-30-years-after-kanos-most-deadly-violence&amp;catid=44:feature&amp;Itemid=135 | title=Maitatsine: 30 Years After Kano’s Most Deadly Violence | publisher=Daily Trust | work=Sunday Trust | date=2010-12-26 | accessdate=May 25, 2012 | author=Adamu,  Lawan Danjuma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Despite Mohammed Marwa's death, Yan Tatsine riots continued into the early 1980s. In October 1982 riots erupted in [[Bulumkuttu]], near [[Maidaguri]],&lt;ref name=Omotosho/&gt; and in [[Kaduna]],&lt;ref name=Omotosho/&gt; to where many Yan Tatsine adherents had moved after 1980.  Over 3,000 people died.  Some survivors of these altercations moved to [[Yola, Nigeria|Yola]], and in early 1984 more violent uprisings occurred in that city.&lt;ref name=Omotosho/&gt;  In this round of rioting, [[Musa Makaniki]], a close disciple of Maitatsine, emerged as a leader and Marwa's successor.&lt;ref name='pham'/&gt;&lt;ref name='hiskett'/&gt;  Ultimately more than 1,000 people died in Yola and roughly half of the city's 60,000 inhabitants were left homeless.  Makaniki fled to his hometown of [[Gombe, Nigeria|Gombe]],&lt;ref name=Omotosho&gt;[http://unilorin.edu.ng/publications/omotoshoao/Religious%20Violence%20in%20Nigeria.pdf Religious Violence in Nigeria – the Causes and Solutions: an Islamic Perspective], A. O. Omotosho. Swedish Missiological Theme 2003, P. 15-31.&lt;/ref&gt; where more Yan Tatsine riots occurred in April 1985.  After the deaths of several hundred people Makaniki retreated to Cameroon, where he remained until 2004 when he was arrested in Nigeria.&lt;ref name='pham'/&gt;

The Islamist Quranist group [[Kala Kato]] are an off-shoot of the Yan Tatsine.

Some analysts view the terrorist group [[Boko Haram]] as an extension of the Maitatsine riots.&lt;ref name='cfrBackgrounder'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cfr.org/africa/boko-haram/p25739 | title = Backgrounder: Boko Haram | accessdate = 2011-09-01 | last = Johnson | first = Toni | date = 31 August 2011 | publisher = Council on Foreign Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxism|Philosophy}}

Various Marxist authors have focused on Marx's method of analysis and presentation (historical materialist and logically dialectical) as key factors both in understanding the range and incisiveness of [[Karl Marx]]'s theoretical writing in general and ''{{lang|de|[[Das Kapital]]}}'' in particular. One of the clearest and most instructive examples of this is his discussion of ''the value-form'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]] 'The Value-Form' [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm Appendix] to the 1st German edition of Capital, Volume 1, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; which acts as a primary guide or key to understanding the logical argument as it develops throughout the volumes of ''{{lang|de|Das Kapital}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl &amp; Engels, Frederick [1983] ''Letters on ‘Capital’'' New Park&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx himself presents a simplified explanation in the Appendix to the first German edition of ''{{lang|de|Das Kapital}}'' published in English translation in ''[[Capital &amp; Class]]''. The need for this appendix was suggested by Engels&lt;ref name="June16_1867"&gt;Engels to Marx, June 16, 1867 ''Letters on ‘Capital’''&lt;/ref&gt; and there is an exchange of correspondence&lt;ref name="June16_1867"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx to Engels, June 22, 1867 ''Letters on ‘Capital’''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engels to Marx, June 24, 1867 ''Letters on ‘Capital’''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx to Engels, June 27, 1867 ''Letters on ‘Capital’''&lt;/ref&gt; concerning its purpose and form.

The two principal components of marxist science are the dialectical method of logical deduction and genetic synthesis and its application to the evolution of real social history. While in each of these areas considered separately there are at least a number of scholarly works, there are few examples of substantial exegesis and fewer still successful applications of marxian method to the fundamental obstacles to class-consciousness today. This is reflected both at the general level of lack of understanding of the social nature of technological change embodied in Marx's theory of the value-form, reflected in widespread ignorance of the detail of the 'rational kernel' of Hegel's dialectic&lt;ref&gt;HEGEL's Logic [1975] Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; whose the principal 'forms of being' Marx used to structure the whole of the work on 'Capital'. His analytical evolution of the relation between subjective and objective development and their qualitative and quantitatively measured forms and functions which make up the logical skeleton in his presentation are almost universally ignored. Compare Hegel's Logic&lt;ref&gt;Hegel's Logic [1975] Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; for instance with Marx the value-form.&lt;ref&gt;Marx The value-form [1976]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than any other twentieth century marxist Lenin selfconsciously assimilated the fundamentals of this methodological approach (to the careful study of which he returned at the most critical political moments&lt;ref&gt;Lenin [1908] Collected Works v14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenin [1914-16] Collected Works v38&lt;/ref&gt; and set about the task of applying it to the 'burning questions of our movement'. His appreciation of the importance of the knowledge of real social movements is apparent from his studies: The development of Capitalism in Russia and his Notebooks on Imperialism.

Lukacs' revolutionary career is made more problematic by his intellectual capitulation to the pressures of stalinism. The essays from his period of active revolutionary leadership however are of unparalleled importance for their reassertion of Hegel's contribution to marxism. In addition his critical review of Bukharin published as Technology &amp; Social Relations&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, Ben (September–October 1966). "Introduction to Lukács on Bukharin". New Left Review. New Left Review. I (39).&lt;/ref&gt; remains of seminal importance as one of the few direct attempts to deal with the problem of the methodological degeneration of communist theory on this question utilising an adequate level of theoretical and historical understanding.

Rubin's 'Essays'&lt;ref&gt;Isaak Illich Rubin [1972] Essays on Marx’s Theory of Value Black &amp; Red&lt;/ref&gt; shared this appreciation of the weakness of communist theory (as did the work of KORSCH&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Korsch]] ''Three Essays on Marxism'' Pluto 1971&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; JAKUBOWSKI&lt;ref&gt;Franz Jakubowski 1976 'Ideology and Superstructure in Historical Materialism' Allison &amp; Busby&lt;/ref&gt;) but with the exceptions of [[Henryk Grossman]]'s work at the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research, and [[Evgeny Preobrazhensky]]'s New Economics, Rubin was in this period almost alone in articulating the central methodological content embodied in Marx's theoretical concepts. Roman Rosdolsky's valuable study The making of Marx's 'Capital' which re-emphasises the importance of use-value in Marx's two-fold analysis, was a result of his discovery of one of the rare copies of Grundrisse Marx's previously unpublished rough draft for 'Capital'.

Whereas Lenin had come to his understanding of the importance of Hegel's Logic by extensive study, Grossman's emphasis grew out of the need to re-articulate the structural method of 'Capital' in dealing with imperialism at the necessary level of theory. Rosdolsky was however able to read Marx directly asserting his enormous debt to Hegel and exploring out-loud the methodological problems of the relation between the investigation and presentation of his 'critique'.

Lukacs in 1930 had a similar experience in his reading of the then recently deciphered Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 on which he subsequently commented: "the overwhelming effect produced in me by Marx's statement that objectivity was the primary material attribute of all things and relations...that objectification is a natural means by which man masters the world and as such can be either a positive or a negative fact...it became clear to us that even the best and most capable Marxists, like Plekhanov and Mehring, had not had a sufficiently profound grasp of the universal nature of Marxism. They failed, therefore, to understand that Marx confronts us with the necessity of erecting a systematic aesthetics on the foundations of dialectical materialism.".&lt;ref&gt;Lukac's History and Class Consciousness [1971] p.xxxvi-ii&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this period that Lukacs began his twin study of The Young Hegel and The Destruction of Reason on the one hand looking at the contribution Hegel made to the rational scientific basis of dialectical materialism and on the other how in a direct reaction to the development of Marxism the irrationalist elements of Hegel's thought were promoted and the revolutionary critical element dismembered in the process of the degeneration of bourgeois philosophy.

The immediate post-war period produced little that was marxist by these criteria, with perhaps the sole exception of [[Paul Mattick]]'s essays which defended the orthodox theoretical marxism, particularly on the issue of Marx's theory of crisis, against revisionists such as [[Paul Sweezy]]. Mattick's essay Technology and the Mixed Economy (1966) was a rare articulation of the limitations and social origin of the drive for labour productivity. Mattick drew substantially on Grossman's 1929 study The law of accumulation and the breakdown of capitalism defending its analysis against Sweezy 1942] and other anti-marxists who sought to eradicate the connection between capitalist accumulation and the theory of crises. Mattick argued that despite the appearance of the post-war boom capitalism would continue to retard the development of productive forces and that the limits to capital accumulation would reassert themselves. Until Grossman's work becomes fully available in English, Mattick's Economic Crisis and Crisis Theory remains the most readily available articulation of the necessity of revolutionary theory for today's conditions. The 1970s saw a resurgence of marxist studies which sought to assimilate the theoretical gains which had been lost to working class politics in the middle decades of the twentieth century.

Drawing on these and other forgotten works in the marxist tradition and a renewed study of the methodologically explicit drafts and early writings and correspondence of Marx, a tendency began to emerge which struggled to return theoretically to an authentic "Marx's Marxism" and come to terms with the outstanding problems facing marxist critique of capitalist society in the second half of the twentieth century. Unfortunately the political hiatus caused by the largely unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union, resulted in a widespread fragmentation and demoralisation even amongst those marxist writers who were critical of the stalinist state formations.

The nature of the Soviet Union, the political tenacity and character of stalinism itself, an explanation of the political hold of and contemporary forms of Reformism in the working class and the restatement of the fundamentals of the marxist struggle against the state, and the bourgeois ideological weapons of nationalism, imperialism and the oppression of nations and nationalities, racial and women's oppression and the economic role of the family under capitalism. This tendency has yet to re-articulate Marx's critique of ideological power of the politics of productivity theoretically in challenging the revisionist acceptance of technological mystification.

==Speaking and debates==
[[File:Matt Dillahunty2.jpg|thumb|Matt Dillahunty, speaking at the [[American Atheists]] Convention 2011]]
Dillahunty is a proponent of debates, both formal and informal, as a very effective way of conveying information. "I am absolutely convinced from my experience and the evidence that I've gathered over the years of doing this that they are incredibly valuable."&lt;ref name="debate"/&gt;  He has spoken at atheist and [[freethought]] conferences around the country and debated numerous [[Christian apologetics |Christian apologists]], including [[Ray Comfort]] (on ''The Atheist Experience''),&lt;ref name="debate"/&gt; and [[David Robertson (Free Church Minister)|David Robertson]] on [[Premier Christian Radio]]'s ''Unbelievable''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://radiopublic.com/unbelievable-WkKEkx/ep/s1!867f48b3d6923eea4b0e18ad018e73117dfc0188 Why I am not an atheist (debate 1 of 2)]; RadioPublic; February, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://radiopublic.com/unbelievable-WkKEkx/ep/s1!80265c41921911c11962bd797ca414a45a49809a Why I am not a Christian (debate 2 of 2)]; RadioPublic; February, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2014 [[American Atheists]] convention in Salt Lake City, he gave a workshop that outlined some key ideas in effective debating: "Take the opponent seriously: 'The audience has to sense that I can perfectly understand their views, and have rejected them.' Use logic: 'I tell them that I can write a better book than the Bible. Simple: I copy it word for word, except the parts about slavery.' And don't forget emotion: 'It is theater. That is my advantage with a Baptist background over someone like [[Richard Dawkins]], although he knows more about science.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/3683060/2014/07/03/Onder-ongelovigen.dhtml |title=Onder ongelovigen |author=Bas den Hond |work=[[Trouw]] |publisher=[[De Persgroep]] |date=3 June 2014 |accessdate=3 June 2014|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also stated that he is willing to say "I don't know" in a debate, a "scary concept" to some of his audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Heather|last=Adams|date=March 17, 2014|publisher=[[KBIA|KBIA mid-Missouri public radio]]|url=http://kbia.org/post/mu-skeptics-group-brings-big-name-atheists-campus|title=MU skeptics group brings big-name atheists to campus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="debate"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyBSKZ3BpQI |title=Matt Dillahunty - The Value of Debates |date=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on morality==
One of Dillahunty's recurring themes has been the superiority of [[secular morality]] over [[religious morality]]. His key contentions on the issue are that secular moral systems are inclusive, dynamic, encourage change, and serve the interests of the participants, whereas religious moral systems serve only the interests of an external authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blip.tv/the-atheist-experience-tv-show/matt-dillahunty-the-superiority-of-secular-morality-4192742 |title=Matt Dillahunty: The Superiority of Secular Morality |date=September 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717155131/http://blip.tv/the-atheist-experience-tv-show/matt-dillahunty-the-superiority-of-secular-morality-4192742 |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Collin Boots&lt;!-- with credit given to Matt Dillahunty--&gt; | title=The superiority of secular morality: Why do we think religion is required for morality when godless morality may well serve us better?|newspaper=[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]|date=April 30, 2014 | url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2014/04/secular-morality}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He touched on the subject again at a lecture at the 2013 American Atheists Convention in Austin: "They say we're immoral, when we're the only ones who understand that morality is derived from [[empathy]], fairness, cooperation, and the physical facts about interacting in this universe. They've broken their moral compass and sacrificed their humanity on the altar of religion. They say we're lost and broken and in need of salvation, when we're the ones who are free."&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EDoEzOymkk |title=AACON 2013 Matt Dillahunty speaks on Skepticism and Atheism |date=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dillahunty holds the view that advocating infinite reward or punishment for finite deeds is "morally inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyken|first1=J.

==Advocacy of reproductive rights==
[[File:Matt Dillahunty – Rethinking Debates (2014 National Convention).webm|thumb|Matt Dillahunty speaking about debating at the American Atheist National Convention 2014.]]
Dillahunty has advocated for [[reproductive rights]]. After hearing that [[Secular Pro-Life]] set up a table at the 2012 [[American Atheists]] convention, Dillahunty challenged a representative of the organization to a public debate on the issue. The debate took place at the 2012 Texas Freethought Convention, with Dillahunty debating Kristine Kruszelnicki. Dillahunty used [[Bodily integrity|bodily autonomy]] as his primary argument for abortion rights, which is based on [[Judith Jarvis Thompson]]'s essay on the subject, "[[A Defense of Abortion]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P78_V1Z9CO4 |title=Abortion Debate at Texas Freethought Convention, Matt Dillahunty vs. Kristine Kruszelnicki |date=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Dillahunty debated Clinton Wilcox, who is not a member of Secular Pro-Life, though the debate was advertised on their blog. The aftermath led to a falling out with the organization, and Dillahunty announced in a Facebook post that he would not debate them in public again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/matt-dillahunty/debates-delusions-and-dishonesty-why-i-have-no-respect-for-kelsey-hazzard-and-sp/10152770027383902 |title=Debates, Delusions and Dishonesty - Why I have no respect for Kelsey Hazzard and SPL |date=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Beth Presswood later appeared on [[Amanda Marcotte]]'s podcast ''RH Reality Check'' to explain the events of the preceding years, and said that "the optics of a [[cisgender|cis male]] without a womb" debating women's rights is not what he wanted to advocate, and would let others take the lead in public on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/reality-cast/2014/04/14/secular-anti-choicers-and-vance-mcallister/ |title=Is Secular Anti-Choice a Thing? And How Big a Hypocrite Is Rep. Vance McAllister? |date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism==
[[File:QEDCon Day One-39 (16682468904).jpg|thumb|Dillahunty at QED 2015, a [[list of skeptical conferences|skeptical conference]] in [[Manchester]].]]
Advocacy of the primacy of [[skepticism]] is another of Dillahunty's recurring themes. He said at the American Atheists convention in Austin in 2013 that the closest thing he has to a motto is "to believe as many true things and as few false things as possible," taking his inspiration from [[David Hume]]. In the same lecture, he said that being a skeptic is the most important identifier of who he is. In addition, Dillahunty said that skepticism has something to say about untested religious claims, and that philosophical skepticism will lead to atheism.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; 
He sees atheism as a subset of skepticism, and he does not see why skepticism should not address religious claims, something that has become a point of controversy in the skeptic community. Dillahunty rhetorically asked, "how popular would psychics be, how popular would ghosts be, if there wasn't this monolithic idea that 70-80% of the population believe, that within each of us is an eternal soul that leaves the body when we're dead and either goes on to some afterlife or lingers around here on the earth?...If you teach people about what we know, about what most likely happens when we die, they will strive to treat people better while they're alive, and their grief will be lessened because they understand reality." He admonished "don't just do skepticism with the goal of getting it right, do it with the goal of not being able to get it wrong." In an interview published by the [[Norwegian Humanist Association]], he said he doesn't see why religious claims about reality should be treated any differently by skeptics than conspiracy theories and allegations about [[alien visitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tåpelig av skeptikere å frede religion—Matt Dillahunty har omvendt mange amerikanere til ateisme. Men han er først og fremst skeptiker, og ser på ateisme er en nødvendig konsekvens.|work=Fritanke.no|trans-title="It is foolish for skeptics to spare religion": Matt Dillahunty has converted many Americans to atheism.

===Gumball analogy===
Dillahunty's explanation of the [[philosophical burden of proof]] is presented in his gumball analogy. For a hypothetical jar filled with a large number of gumballs, any positive claim about whether there were an odd or even number of gumballs would be dubious without further supporting evidence. Therefore, not believing the claim "the number of gumballs is even" without evidence does not mean believing that the number is, in fact, odd. Likewise, not believing the claim "there is a god" without evidence does not mean believing that there isn't one. This demonstrates that the common retort "what is your proof that there is no god?" is in fact a fallacious shifting of the burden of proof.&lt;ref name=Burden&gt;{{cite book|author1=Armin Navabi|editor1-last=Hise|editor1-first=Nicki|title=Why There Is No God|date=6 October 2014|publisher=Atheist Republic|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qW2-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22matt+dillahunty%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5F88VezpCsqggwT49ICQAg&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22matt%20dillahunty%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2011, Dillahunty was awarded the Atheist of the Year award, nicknamed the "Hitchie" for [[Christopher Hitchens]], by Staks Rosch writing for [[Examiner.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ex-evangelista recebe o prêmio de "ateu do ano"|trans-title=Ex-evangelist receives the Atheist of the Year award|work=Gospel Prime|language=Portuguese|url=http://noticias.gospelprime.com.br/ex-evangelista-recebe-o-premio-de-ateu-do-ano/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Staks|last=Rosch|title=The 2011 Hitchie Award winner is… | publisher=[[Examiner.com]] | work= Atheism Examiner| date=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award process involved Rosch's readers voting for nominees he selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=What Makes a Great Atheist?|date=January 5, 2012 |first=Leah |last=Libresco | work=[[Patheos]] Catholic channel | url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unequallyyoked/2012/01/what-makes-a-great-atheist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tokenism Is Not Inclusivity|first=Greta |last=Christina|authorlink=Greta Christina|work=Greta Christina's blog|publisher=freethoughtblogs.com|date=January 5, 2012|url=http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2012/01/05/tokenism-is-not-inclusivity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Token women|work=Butterflies and Wheels (blog)|first=Ophelia |last=Benson|authorlink=Ophelia Benson|date=January 5, 2012|publisher=freethoughtblogs.com|url=http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2012/01/token-women/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various '''meditative postures''' have been used in [[meditation]]. Sitting, supine (lying), and standing&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{Cite web| last = Marshall | first = Chris | title = Paradoxes of Standing Meditation | url = http://www.martialdevelopment.com/blog/four-paradoxes-of-standing-meditation/ | accessdate = 2007-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; postures are used.

The bodily positions applied during Yoga are found at the Wikipedia page [[Asana]]. Most well known in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] traditions, as well as in their modern forms, are the [[Lotus position|full-lotus]], [[half-lotus]], [[Burma|Burmese]], and [[kneeling]] positions.

Meditation can also be practiced while walking, such as [[kinhin]], or doing simple repetitive tasks, as in Zen [[Samu (Zen)|samu]], or work which encourages mindfulness.


==Cross-legged postures==
[[File:Meditation, Shimla.jpg|thumb]]
Cross legged sitting helps create a stable base for meditation. Several seated asanas are practiced such as [[full-lotus]], [[half-lotus]], easy crossed legs, or [[siddhasana]] ("perfect pose"). Sitting on the heels is possible, among other positions. [[Zafu|Seated meditation cushions]] are often used to help extend meditative time and serve to elevate the hips and spine into proper alignment

Sitting cross-legged (or upon one's knees) for extended periods when one is not sufficiently limber, can result in a range of [[ergonomic]] complaints called "meditator's knee". These are common and may be endured for long periods of time in extensive meditation retreats,&lt;ref&gt;Insight Yoga with Sarah Powers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Three Pillars of Zen, edited by Philip Kapleau&lt;/ref&gt; however caution is often advised, and the guidance of an instructor or 'guru' is often sought extensively.

In the full-lotus, half-lotus and Burmese positions, used in Buddhism and Hinduism, it is often said&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; that the [[vertebral column|spinal column]] must be kept "straight," that is, the individual should sit erect but relaxed, by balancing the torso such that the spinal column supports it in a natural way. One should feel comfortable and rest in a simple and unstrained way.

Sitting on a cushion that elevates the pelvis as high as or higher than the knees and then slightly rolling the pelvis forward makes it easier to keep the spine upright. It is said in multiple traditions that the chin should be slightly tucked in, the tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, lips lightly pressed together shoulders back.

Those traditions related to [[kundalini yoga]], take a less formal approach. While the basic practice in these traditions is also to sit still quietly in a traditional posture, they emphasize the possibility of [[kriyas]]&amp;nbsp;– spontaneous yogic postures, changes in breathing patterns or emotional states, or perhaps repetitive physical movements such as swaying, etc., which may naturally arise as the practitioner sits in meditation, and which should not be resisted but rather allowed to express themselves to enhance the natural flow of energy through the body. This is said to help purify the [[nadis]] and ultimately deepen one's meditative practice.&lt;ref name=smith1986_p69&gt;Smith 1986, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-legged postures, especially those such as the full-lotus, may be difficult due to a lack of familiarization. Most Westerners are not used to sitting in cross-legged positions for extended periods of time. For this reason Westerners are often advised to use a chair or a bench until they are ready for the traditional cross-legged positions. Yoga and stretching also are applicable as a means of developing the flexibility needed for the cross-legged postures.

If practiced routinely and done correctly, full-lotus is easy to maintain for long periods of time without discomfort, as muscular effort is used only keep the spine balanced, and not to support the weight of the torso.  Often this posture is explained as a way of encouraging the circulation of what some call "spiritual energy," the "vital breath", the "life force" (Sanskrit ''[[prana]]'', Chinese ''[[qi]]'', Latin ''spiritus'') or the [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]]. It is said that one's meditation will not be as good if one's posture is not so good.&lt;ref&gt;both Lama Gursam, a yogi raised in a Tibetan monastery, and Khenpo Nyima Gyaltsen, a teacher at the Drikung Kagyu college, have told me this&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other postures== 
[[File:Walking meditation.jpg|thumb|right|Bas-relief in [[Sukhothai Historical Park|Sukhothai]], [[Thailand]] depicting monks during walking meditation.]]
In various traditions people meditate by sitting on a chair, flat-footed and without back support (as in [[New Thought]]); sitting on a stool (as in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]]); or walking (in [[Therevada]] Buddhism); or walking in mindfulness, which is known as [[kinhin]] (in [[Zen]] Buddhism).

==Hand gestures and position==
Various hand-gestures or [[mudra]]s may be prescribed in meditation. In [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] mudras carry symbolic meaning. According to Yogic philosophy the mudras affect consciousness, mood and energy.

For instance in Buddhist meditation the hands are often held with the right resting atop the left and thumbs touching. Some traditions hold say that each finger is associated with a different sensitivity and that the finger endings, lock into mudras, create subtle energy shifts due to these different energy circuit connections. Pressing on finger endings also stimulates brain sections relating to different qualities&amp;nbsp;– which a practitioner may want to enhance through meditation to invoke specific effects or changes. Other traditions hold that the right on top of left symbolizes the state of samsara while many common depictions of The Buddha have that he holds his left on top of right, due to his enlightenment.

==Eye focus and gaze==
In some schools such as [[Zen]], the eyes are half-closed and half-open, looking slightly downward. In others such as [[Brahma Kumaris]], the eyes are kept fully open. In other traditions the eyelids are kept 1/10 or barely open depending on what [[drishti (yoga)|drishti]] the meditation instructs. [[Drishti (yoga)|Drishti]] refers to eye focus in [[kundalini yoga]] and means "vision" or "insight" in [[Sanskrit]]. Pictures of saints in meditation may reflect different eye postures, and different meditations may call for staring into a saint's eyes, a candle flame, or some other object of focus, which is known as [[trataka]] meditation.

In Sufism, meditating ([[muraqaba]]) with the eyes closed is called [[Varood (Sufism)|Varood]] and keeping them open is known as [[Shahood]] or [[Fa'tha]].

Often such details are shared by more than one religion, even in cases where mutual influence seems unlikely. One example is "navel-gazing," which is apparently attested to within Eastern Orthodoxy as well as Chinese [[qigong]] practice. Another is the practice of focusing on the breath, found in Orthodox Christianity, [[Sufism]], and numerous Indic traditions.

'''Meekness''' is an attribute of human nature and behavior. It has been defined several ways: [[Righteousness|righteous]], [[Humility|humble]], teachable, and [[Patience|patient under suffering]], long suffering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/meekness The Free Dictionary, ''Meekness'']&lt;/ref&gt; willing to follow gospel teachings; an attribute of a true disciple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/meek-meekness?lang=eng&amp;letter=m LDS.org Guide to the Scriptures, ''meekness'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/03/meekness-a-dimension-of-true-discipleship?lang=eng Neal A. Maxwell, Meekness -- A Dimension of True Discipleship, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meekness has been contrasted with humility as referring to behavior towards others, whereas humility refers to an attitude towards oneself&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Cochran, ''Receptive Human Virtues'' (2011) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; – meekness meaning restraining one's own power,&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;Matthew (1806). ''A Discourse Concerning Meekness.'' Hilliard&lt;/ref&gt; so as to allow room for others.&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Bassett, ''Doctrinal Insight to the Book of Mormon'' (2008) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
*The Israelite Apostle Paul gave an example of meek behavior when writing to Timothy: "The servant of the Lord must be gentle, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves." ([[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Tim.]] 2:24–25)
*[[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]] explained: "Meekness takes injuries like pills, not chewing, but swallowing them down." This indicates that meekness allows a person to overlook or forgive perceived insults or offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/meekness The Free Dictionary, ''Usages of meekness'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*The meek feature in the [[Beatitudes]], and were linked thereby to the classical virtue of [[magnanimity]] by [[Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Titus, ''Resilience and the Virtue of Fortitude'' (2006) p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
*A meek behavior is presented as being opposite to "the natural man" (i.e. one who acts strictly according to desires of the body): 'Put off the natural man and become meek.' ([[Book of Mormon]], Mosiah 3:19), and in 3 Nephi 12:5 when Jesus Christ appears to the people of ancient America after his Ascension to Heaven and teaches them the beatitudes.

*LDS Apostle Elder David A. Bednar said in April 2018, "Meekness is a defining attribute of the Redeemer and is distinguished by righteous responsiveness, willing submissiveness, and strong self-restraint." He further said, "Whereas humility generally denotes dependence upon God and the constant need for His guidance and support, a distinguishing characteristic of meekness is a particular spiritual receptivity to learning both from the Holy Ghost and from people who may seem less capable, experienced, or educated, who may not hold important positions, or who otherwise may not appear to have much to contribute."&lt;ref&gt;David A. Bednar (April 2018). [https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2018/04/meek-and-lowly-of-heart?lang=eng "Meek and Lowly of Heart"]. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
*[[Beethoven]] rejected meekness and equality in favor of cultural [[elitism]]: “''Power'' is the moral principle of those who excel others”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Maynard Solomon, ''Beethoven Essays'' (1988) p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nietzsche]] rejected Christian meekness as part of a parasitic revolt by the low against the lofty, the manly, and the high.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufman ed., ''The Portable Nietzsche'' (1987) p. 626-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other traditions==
*[[Buddhism]], like Christianity, strongly values meekness&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Carman, ''Majesty and Meekness'' (1994) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; – the Buddha himself (in an earlier life) featuring as the 'Preacher of Meekness' who patiently had his limbs lopped off by a jealous king without complaining.&lt;ref&gt;D. Schlinghoff, ''Studies in the Ajanta Paintings'' (1987) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Taoism]] valorized the qualities of submission and non-contention.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lau ed., ''Lao Tzu'' (1963) p. 25-9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Book of Numbers]] chapter 12 verse 3: Now the man [[Moses]] was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.
* In [[Islam]], faqr, sometimes translated as "''poverty''", is one of the central attitudes in a  [[Faqeer]]. It was also one of the attributes of the Prophet. He said "faqr is my pride". In a spiritual sense, faqr is defined as the absence of desire for wealth, recognition or for the blessings of the otherworld. One of the aspects of one who has embodied the true essence of faqr, is that the mystic will never ask anything of anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam |author=Annemarie Schimmel |page=121 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |orig-year=1975 |format=reprint |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8078-9976-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is for one to ask someone else for anything they would be relying on a created being. To receive something from that same being would produce gratitude in the heart which would be geared toward the giver, not towards God.&lt;ref name= Faqr&gt;Khadim Sultan-ul-Faqr, Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman (2015). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=what+is+faqr&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20is%20faqr&amp;f=false ''Sultan Bahoo: The Life and Teachings''], page 145. Sultan-ul-Faqr Publications, Lahore. {{isbn|978-969-9795-18-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal analogues==
*The classical Greek word used to translate meekness was that for a horse that had been tamed and bridled.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Bergland, ''The Journeys of Robert Williams'' ( 2010) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;
*The buffalo was to the Buddhists a lesson in meekness.&lt;ref&gt;D. Schlinghoff, ''Studies in the Ajanta Paintings'' (1987) p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
*Meekness is used to characterise the nature of Tess in [[Tess of the D'Urbervilles]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Bloom, ''Thomas Hardy'' (2010) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Heroine of ''[[Possession (novel)|Possession: A Romance]]'' judges the hero as "a gentle and unthreatening being. Meek, she thought drowsily, turning out the light. Meek."&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (1991) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Novak''' (September 9, 1933 – February 17, 2017) was an American [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] philosopher, journalist, novelist,&lt;!-- An unsourced designation as "traitor" (previously found here) is contentious – as it is unsubstantiated by citation and by this wiki article itself and does not constitute common knowledge – and is about a living person. --&gt; and diplomat. The author of more than forty books on the philosophy and theology of culture, Novak is most widely known for his book ''[[The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism]]'' (1982). In 1993 Novak was honored with an honorary doctorate degree at [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees Honorary Doctorate Degrees at [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] ] (in Guatemala City, Guatemala). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501000000/https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees |date=May 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to his commitment to the idea of liberty. In 1994 he was awarded the [[Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion]], which included a million-dollar purse awarded at Buckingham Palace. He wrote books and articles focused on [[capitalism]], religion, and the [[Democratization|politics of democratization]].

Novak served as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] in 1981 and 1982 and led the U.S. delegation to the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/scholar/44|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228212504/http://www.aei.org/scholar/44|archive-date=28 February 2010|work=American Enterprise Institute|title=SCHOLARS &amp; FELLOWS – Michael Novak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Novak served on the board of directors of the now-defunct [[Coalition for a Democratic Majority]], a conservative anti-Communist faction of the Democratic Party, which sought to influence Democratic Party policies in the same direction that the [[Committee on the Present Danger]] later did. Novak was George Frederick Jewett Scholar in Religion, Philosophy, and Public Policy at the [[American Enterprise Institute]]. In 2004, he claimed to be a lifelong Democrat, while noting that he has supported many Republican candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Review]], retrieved January 1, 2009 from [http://www.nationalreview.com/novak/novak200409071420.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education, and family==
Novak was born in 1933 in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], to a Slovak-American family, the son of Irene (Sakmar) and Michael J. Novak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ku.sk/en/index.php/about-the-university/press/news-releases-/556-michael-novak-awarded-by-the-honorary-degree |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804201839/http://www.ku.sk/en/index.php/about-the-university/press/news-releases-/556-michael-novak-awarded-by-the-honorary-degree |archivedate=August 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelnovak.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=Biography.welcome |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716225418/http://www.michaelnovak.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=Biography.welcome |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Karen Laub-Novak, a professional artist and illustrator, who died of cancer in August 2009. They have three children (Richard, Tanya, and Jana) and four grandchildren.

Novak earned  a B.A. ''summa cum laude'' in philosophy and English from [[Stonehill College]] in 1956, a [[Bachelor of Sacred Theology|Sacrae Theologiae Baccalaureus]] (a degree in [[theology]]), from the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]] in 1958 and
an M.A. in history and philosophy of religion from [[Harvard University]] in 1966.
Novak attended Harvard University to study philosophy and religion, intending to obtain a doctorate in philosophy of religion. Novak stated that he thought the philosophy department was too focused on analytic philosophy, neglecting religion {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. He left Harvard after receiving his M.A., and began work as a writer.

==Early writings==

=== Second Vatican Council ===

Novak worked as a correspondent for the [[National Catholic Reporter]] during the second session of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in Rome, where he also got the opportunity to fulfill a book contract for a fellow reporter who was not able to complete the project.  The result was Novak's second book, ''The Open Church'', a journalistic account of the events of the second session of the Council.

His writings at the time were criticized by the more Conservative factions in the Church, and apostolic delegate [[Egidio Vagnozzi]] advised US Churchmen to silence him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839400,00.html Less Ecumenism, Please]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early books==
Early in his career, Novak published two novels: ''The Tiber Was Silver'' (1961) and ''Naked I Leave'' (1970). At the time, he considered the modest $600 advance to be "a fortune."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Novak (1999) [http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9904/articles/novak.html "Controversial Engagements"], ''First Things'' (April 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stanford years==
Novak's friendship with the [[Presbyterian]] [[theologian]] [[Robert McAfee Brown]] during the [[Second Vatican Council]] led to a teaching post at [[Stanford University]], where he became the first [[Roman Catholic]] to teach in the [[Humanities]] program. Novak taught at [[Stanford University]] from 1965 to 1968, during the key years of student revolt throughout California.  During this period, he wrote ''A Time to Build'' (1967), discussing problems of belief and unbelief, [[ecumenism]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[war]]. In 1968, he signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''A Theology for Radical Politics'' (1969), Novak makes theological arguments in support of the New Left student movement, which he urged to advance the renewal of the human spirit rather than merely to reform social institutions.  His book ''Politics: Realism and Imagination'' includes accounts of visiting American Vietnam War deserters in France ("Desertion"), the birth and development of the student movement at Stanford ("Green Shoots of Counter-Culture") and philosophical essays on [[nihilism]] and [[Marxism]].

==SUNY Old Westbury==
Novak left Stanford for a post as dean of a new "experimental" school at the newly founded [[State University of New York at Old Westbury]], [[Long Island]].

Novak's writings during this period included the philosophical essay ''The Experience of Nothingness'' (1970, republished in 1998), in which he cautioned the New Left that utopianism could lead to alienation and rootlessness&lt;!-- Suggestion: "and detailed the experience of formlessness that had become common in the West"? --&gt;. Novak's novel ''Naked I Leave'' (1970) chronicles his experiences in California and in the Second Vatican Council and his journey from seminarian to reporter.

==Later career==
After serving at Old Westbury/SUNY from 1969 to 1972, Novak launched the humanities program at the Rockefeller Foundation in 1973–1974. In 1976, he accepted a tenured position at Syracuse University as University Professor and Ledden-Watson Distinguished Professor of Religion. In the fall semesters of 1987 and 1988, Novak held the W. Harold and Martha Welch chair as Professor of American Studies at the University of Notre Dame.

In the spring of 1978, Novak joined the [[American Enterprise Institute]] for Social Policy Research as a Resident Scholar, a position he held for more than a decade. He would later stay with the American Enterprise Institute as the George Frederick Jewett Chair of Religion, Philosophy, and Public Policy, and as the Institute's Director of Social and Political Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Biography at the American Enterprise Institute, retrieved May 25, 2008 from {{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/scholars/filter.all,scholarID.44/scholar2.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417193336/http://www.aei.org/scholars/filter.all,scholarID.44/scholar2.asp |archivedate=April 17, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Novak was a frequent contributor to magazines and journals including ''[[First Things]]'' and ''[[National Review]]''. In 1994, he was a signer of the document [[Evangelicals and Catholics Together]]. On December 12, 2007 Novak declared his support for the presidential candidacy of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref name=romney&gt;{{cite news| last=Novak| first=Michael| title=Why I Decided to Support Mitt Romney| date=2007-12-12| accessdate=2009-10-20| publisher=[[National Review]]| url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTc5NjdiNWVhNThmZDJhZWYwMzM4ZmIyNjgxM2MwODI=| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311222551/http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTc5NjdiNWVhNThmZDJhZWYwMzM4ZmIyNjgxM2MwODI=| archivedate=March 11, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he authored an article entitled 'The Moral Imperative of a Free Economy' in ''[[The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs]]'', published by the [[George W. Bush Presidential Center]].

Novak was a founding board member of the [[Institute on Religion and Democracy]]. He was also a founding member of the [[Board of Trustees]] of [[Ave Maria University]] and was a member of the [[Ave Maria Mutual Funds]] Catholic Advisory Board. A portrait of Novak by [[Igor Babailov]] hangs in the Canizaro Library on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Igor Babilov's Oil-on-canvas portrait of Michael Novak, retrieved December 17, 2012 from [http://www.russianamericanacademyofart.com/Novak.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 he joined the [[Tim and Steph Busch School of Business and Economics]] of the [[Catholic University of America]] as a distinguished visiting professor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/scholars/filter.all,scholarID.44/scholar2.asp Michael Novak joins Catholic University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417193336/http://www.aei.org/scholars/filter.all,scholarID.44/scholar2.asp |date=April 17, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Novak died of complications from [[colon cancer]] February 17, 2017 in Washington, D.C. at the age of 83.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/michael-novak-theologian-who-made-a-spiritual-case-for-capitalism-dies-at-83/2017/02/17/fa38989c-f212-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html|title=Michael Novak, theologian who made a spiritual case for capitalism, dies at 83|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/michael-novak-dead-catholic-scholar.html|title=Michael Novak, Catholic Scholar Who Championed Capitalism, Dies at 83|last=Grimes|first=William|date=2017-02-19|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-21|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Multidimensional Measurement of Religiousness/Spirituality for Use in Health Research''''' is a report, originally published in 1999, by a [[Fetzer Institute]] / [[National Institute on Aging]] working group on the measurement of religion and spirituality.&lt;ref name=workgroup/&gt; A revised version with a new preface was published in 2003. The book presents a series of 12 self-report questionnaire measures, each focused on a particular aspect of religiousness or spirituality, along with reviews of underlying theory and supporting research. The book's purpose is to provide validated measures of spiritual and religious factors in health research. The book includes the '''Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality''' ('''BMMRS'''), a practical measure with selected items from the 12 previous chapters.

The book has been widely cited in health and behavioral science research,&lt;ref name=psycinfocount/&gt; and several subsequent publications have been partially or entirely dedicated to evaluating and critiquing the measures.&lt;ref

==Topics covered==
Both editions contain an introduction, followed by 12 chapters, each on the measurement of a particular aspect ("domain") of religion or spirituality. Combining all these questions gives the  Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality. (MMRS). Concluding pages of each edition select items for a briefer 38-item version of the questionnaire ('''BMMRS'''), along with data from a US national survey that incorporated many of its items.

'''''Background and purpose'''''. The Introduction states the book is responding to "a growing body of literature.... indicat&lt;nowiki&gt;[ing]&lt;/nowiki&gt; that various dimensions of religiousness and spirituality may enhance subjective states of well-being... lower levels of depression and psychological distress... and reduce morbidity and mortality.... elicit&lt;nowiki&gt;[ing]&lt;/nowiki&gt; considerable attention from medical researchers in epidemiology, psychology, sociology, gerontology, and other fields" (p.&amp;nbsp;1). However,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Health researchers who seek to include religious or spiritual domains in their studies typically confront various problems. Few health researchers have a scholarly background in religiousness/spirituality and most are not acquainted with the long history of attempts to conceptualize and measure multiple dimensions of religiousness... &lt;nowiki&gt;[and]&lt;/nowiki&gt; we currently have no widely used and validated set of standard measures for key religious/spiritual domains to recommend to interested health researchers (pp. 1-2)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, "the [[National Institute on Aging|NIA]] and the [[Fetzer Institute]] established a core working group to:
::*Identify those domains of religiousness/spirituality most likely to impact health
::*Suggest potential mechanisms whereby these variables might operate; and
::*Provide a short multidimensional survey for use in clinical research." (p. 2)

'''''Plausibility of health effects'''''. The Introduction described a variety of "potential mechanisms" by which religiou/spirituality might affect health. These include "behavioral mechanisms" (e.g., less drug abuse), "social mechanisms" (e.g., community ties), "psychological mechanisms" (e.g., emotional support or [[Psychology of Religion and Coping (book)|religious coping]]), and physiological mechanisms" (e.g., prayer or meditation that elicits a "relaxation response") (pp.&amp;nbsp;3–4).

'''''Cultural orientation'''''. The Introduction also noted that "While many of the items have a strong Judeo-Christian focus... the group also proposed a number of items relevant to the growing proportion of Americans who engage in spiritual activities outside the content of churches and synagogues" (p.&amp;nbsp;3).

'''''Domain-focused chapters'''''. The titles of the 12 domain-focused chapters, each written by one of the committee members,&lt;ref name=workgroup/&gt; are shown in the adjacent table. A sample question from each chapter's questionnaire measure is also shown in the table.

'''''Brief measure'''''. The final chapter contains a "short form" (BMMRS) with 36 items mostly drawn from the longer measures that appear in the previous 12 chapters (see table). Two additional items elicit a respondent's overall self-ranking (e.g., "To what extent to you consider yourself a spiritual person?", with a similar question about being a "religious person").&lt;ref&gt;Responses are 1) very spiritual, 2) moderately spiritual, 3) slightly spiritual, or 4) not spiritual at all. The other question asks "To what extent do you consider yourself a religious person?" (p. 88).&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter is entitled:
:*Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality: 1999

'''''Survey data'''''. The appendix contains results from administering the BMMRS to a US nationally representative sample, through the [[General Social Survey]], in 1998. For example, it was found that 24.4 percent of US adults reported engaging in private prayer "more than once a day", and 9.0 percent reported engaging in meditation "more than once a day" (p.&amp;nbsp;92). The appendix is entitled:
:*Appendix A: Additional Psychometric and Population Distribution Data

In the ''[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]'', [[Harold G. Koenig]] wrote that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Fetzer Institute’s Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality is rapidly becoming the standard measure of religiousness/spirituality in the spirituality and health field overall, given its comprehensive nature... There also exist national norms for the short version of this instrument (p. 352&lt;ref name=koenig08/&gt;).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, he expressed concern that some items for some of the domains of the BMMRS might be "contaminated": "Among its spirituality subscales are meaning, values, and forgiveness subscales &lt;nowiki&gt;[containing]&lt;/nowiki&gt; items such as... 'Knowing that I am a part of something greater than myself gives meaning to my life'... &lt;nowiki&gt;[and]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 'It is easy for me to admit that I am wrong,' ... these positive traits could very well be the outcome or the results of spirituality. However, should they be part of the definition itself?... completely secular persons and atheists may experience these things as frequently or more frequently than so called 'spiritual persons" (p.&amp;nbsp;352&lt;ref name=koenig08/&gt;). Others have empirically tested this issue for the BMMRSs Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale finding that it is composed of two factors - theism and civility — with many people who eschew religion and spirituality scoring highly on civility.&lt;ref&gt;Schuurmans-Stekhoven, J. B. (2013). “As a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats”: Does the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale encapsulate separable theistic and civility components? Social Indicators Research, 110(1), 131-146.[[doi:10.1007/s11205-011-9920-8]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Research on Aging'', Idler and other working group members reported results of in-depth analyses of data from administering the BMMRS in the 1998 [[General Social Survey]]. The various BMMRS questions "had the expected relationships with other measures of &lt;nowiki&gt;[religious]&lt;/nowiki&gt; concepts. Overall, the instrument has the appropriate characteristics of reliability and validity to be used in further research." (p.&amp;nbsp;356&lt;ref name=idler03/&gt;). Another analysis of the same data suggested that the BMMRS "is useful for
multiethnic research," and that the daily spirituality and values/beliefs scales could benefit by being combined (p.&amp;nbsp;446&lt;ref name=neff06/&gt;).

Several researchers evaluated how well the BMMRS appeared to work when given to different populations. One study concluded that "most BMMRS measures are reliable and valid for use among adolescents" (p.&amp;nbsp;439&lt;ref name=harris08/&gt;). Another found that the "BMMRS is a viable multifactor measure of &lt;nowiki&gt;[religion/spirituality]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for use with young adults" when the "wording on some items was slightly altered to be more inclusive of various religious traditions" (pp.&amp;nbsp;106, 110&lt;ref name=masters09/&gt;). A third reported that in a sample of midwestern US college students, "despite having a collection of items from 12 different domains, these items really constitute two major areas of interest: one relating to spiritual experiences and the other to religious involvements" (p.&amp;nbsp;194&lt;ref name=piedmont06/&gt;). In a population of patients undergoing rehabilitation, it appears that "the BMMRS assesses distinct positive and negative aspects of religiousness and spirituality that may be best conceptualized... as... (a) Spiritual Experiences... (b) Religious Practices... (c) Congregational Support; and (d) Forgiveness" (p.&amp;nbsp;146&lt;ref name=johnstonejrh09/&gt;). Findings from Southern US adults suggested that the MMRS appears best at measuring "3 primary factors (Meaning, Spirituality, Religious Practices and Organized Religiousness) and 2 secondary factors (Guilt vs. God’s Grace, and Loving/Forgiving God)" (p.&amp;nbsp;181&lt;ref name=stewart06/&gt;).

[[John Traphagan]], in ''Research on Aging'', examined how the book can "raise questions about the extent to which basic ideas associated with the study of Judeo-Christian religions are meaningful in contexts such as Japan" and other Asian countries (p.&amp;nbsp;387&lt;ref name=traphagan05/&gt;). He argued that questions suggested for many of the 12 domains are irrelevant to understanding religiousness/spirituality in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;For example, "questions such as 'If I hear a sermon, I usually think about things that I have done wrong' (Fetzer Report 1999:36) are unlikely to be useful in Japan, because there is no tradition of confession and no sense of a need to confess one’s transgressions in order to achieve salvation. Sermons are not an important part of most religious gatherings, and when they do occur, they are not generally focused on moral behavior" (p. 404).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few MMRS domains held promise. For example, with regard to religious coping, he stated that "certain kinds of ritual performance in Japan can be understood in terms of coping mechanisms, and this is an area identified in the Fetzer report that holds promise for cross-cultural research (at least in relation to Japan)" (p.&amp;nbsp;405&lt;ref name=traphagan05/&gt;).

According to the book's 2003 preface, the Fetzer Institute continues to receive requests for the booklet, and at that time had distributed 2,000 print copies and 1200 internet downloads. The preface reports that "the most popular subscales being used are the Religious/Spiritual Coping and the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scales (DSES). One fourth of respondents have used the booklet in either a course that they teach, in a seminar, or in a symposium." (p. ii)

==Editions==
[[Fetzer Institute]] published the original paperbound edition in 1999, and published a paperbound "reprint" in 2003 that contained a new preface. The 2003 edition is also available for downloading without charge from the Fetzer Institute website (see external links). The two editions are:

''The Tribune.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Swami was born in [[North India]] on the twelfth night of the waxing moon in the month of [[Agrahayana|Margasirsa]], according to the Vedic calendar. Showing deep inclination towards [[spirituality]]&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh K Dhiman (2015-01-11)[http://www.theindiapost.com/articles/his-tryst-with-truth/ "His Tryst With Truth"] ''The India Post.''&lt;/ref&gt; from an early age, Swami studied a range of Vedic and astrological  texts, eventually becoming a professional astrologer during his teen years.  Quitting his job as a part-time editor for a weekly business newspaper, he left for [[Australia]] to pursue tertiary education and later acquired Australian citizenship.

== Education and early career ==
In 2000, Swami graduated with a Bachelor of Business from [[University of Western Sydney]] and later, in 2002, acquired Master of Business Administration at [[University of Technology Sydney]]. Later he started a software business in Australia and expanded its operations to USA, Canada, UK and India over the next six years.&lt;ref&gt;Meera Bhardwaj (2014-12-30) [http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/A-Monk%E2%80%99s-Memoir-of-Spiritual-Pursuits/2014/12/30/article2594104.ece "A Monk’s Memoir of Spiritual Pursuits"]. ''The New Indian Express.''&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with various companies. Swami later moved back to India and acquired a healthcare company.

== Renunciation and spiritual journey==

On 15 March 2010, Swami renounced his material wealth&lt;ref&gt;Medha Shri Dahiya (2016-05-07) [http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/om-swami-a-mystic-brings-to-you-a-new-book-on-kundalini/story-h8vnQQzllJpp7xFuBJIFYO.html "Meet The Swami Who Wields a Pen"]''Hindustan Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; and left for his spiritual journey quietly. Heading straight to [[Varanasi|Kashi]], he was initiated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=If Truth Be Told|publisher=Harper Element|isbn=9789351368069|page=112|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WQ6iBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT112}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the path of renunciation by a Naga saint in a little village some eighty kilometers away from Varanasi.&lt;ref&gt;Nikhil Varma (2014-12-23) [http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/society/om-swami-talks-about-his-journey-from-heading-a-company-to-becoming-a-monk/article6719299.ece "A monk's take"]''The Hindu.''&lt;/ref&gt; After spending four and a half months there, Swami left for the Himalayas where he spent the next thirteen months in intense meditation in complete isolation and solitude. During the days of his intense practice, he meditated for up to 22 hours every day including straight 10-hour stretches. &lt;ref&gt;Vidya Iyenger (2016-12-23) [http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/columns/you/the-monk-who-sold-his-porsche/articleshow/56125288.cms "The Monk Who Sold His Porsche"]''Bangalore Mirror.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==
Swami gives his own perspective on enlightenment in his book ''If Truth Be Told''. "Enlightenment does not mean you have to live like a pauper. It does not mean you have to subject yourself to a life of hardship and abstinence. On the contrary, to be enlightened means to live in the light of love, compassion and truthfulness".&lt;ref name =ThePioneer&gt;(2015-01-11) [http://www.dailypioneer.com/sunday-edition/agenda/special/the-ultimate-realization.html "The Ultimate Realization"] ''The Pioneer.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary work ==
''If Truth Be Told: A Monk's Memoir'' is his self-written memoir, published by [[Harper Collins]] in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;City Air News (2015-01-08)[http://cityairnews.com/content/book-titled-%E2%80%9Cif-truth-be-told-%E2%80%93-monk%E2%80%99s-memoir%E2%80%9D-om-swami-released "If Truth Be Told-A Monk's Memoir"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Specttrum News (2015-01-08)[http://cityairnews.com/content/book-titled-%E2%80%9Cif-truth-be-told-%E2%80%93-monk%E2%80%99s-memoir%E2%80%9D-om-swami-released "If Truth Be Told-A Monk's Memoir"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was listed as number 6 in the top 10 non fiction books in the country as reported by [[The Financial Express (India)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12821">'''Opus Sanctorum Angelorum''' (English: "Work of the Holy Angels"), more commonly known as '''Opus Angelorum''' (English: "Work of the Angels"; German: "Engelwerk"), is a [[Roman Catholic]] association which promotes devotion to [[angels]]. According to [[Pope]] [[Benedict XVI]] (2008) it was a public association of the Church in conformity with traditional doctrine and with the directives of the Holy See. It spreads devotion to the Holy Angels among the faithful, exhorts them to pray for priests, and promotes love for Christ in His Passion and union with it.&lt;ref name=CDF/&gt;

The association is active particularly in [[Austria]], where it originated, and in [[Germany]], but also in [[Portugal]], [[Brazil]],  [[Mexico]], [[India]], the [[Philippines]], [[Italy]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opusangelorum.org/HistoryORC/Orderofcanonsregular.html Order of the Canons Regular of the Holy Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes lay members, religious sisters and priests. Critics keep calling it a [[sect]] inside the Roman Catholic Church in spite of having been approved papally in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/aichach/Ingo-Dollinger-ist-tot-id41742436.html Christian Lichtenstern: ''Ingo Dollinger ist tot.''] [[Augsburger Allgemeine]], 16 of June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It was often linked to the [[Catholic Scouts of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20161126004653/http://www.mainwelle.fm/news/realschule-auerbach-weitere-beweise-fuer-engelwerk-naehe-und-kondom-verteil-aktion-lassen-die ''Realschule Auerbach: Weitere Beweise für Engelwerk-Nähe und Kondom-Verteil-Aktion lassen die Schule nicht zur Ruhe kommen.''] [[Radio Mainwelle]], 13 of November 2001, retrieved from [[archive.org]] 26 of October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fr.de/politik/engelwerk-zurueck-im-schoss-der-kirche-a-977161 Jörg Schindler: ''Zurück im Schoß der Kirche.''] [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], 10 of October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Schneider: ''Sex-Streit von Auerbach: Wird er unterschätzt?'' [[Abendzeitung]] vom 9.&amp;nbsp;November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heiner Boberski: ''Das Engelwerk. Theorie und Praxis des Opus Sanctorum Angelorum.'' Otto Müller Verlag Salzburg 1993, pages 230 to 233. {{ISBN|3-7013-0853-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The association was founded in 1949 by a group of priests and seminarians in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, to seek the aid of the angels in support of the Church and the priesthood and for the salvation of souls.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.engelwerk.at/ueberuns/geschichte/geschichte.html Werk der Hl. Engel: Wer wir sind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013061250/http://www.engelwerk.at/ueberuns/geschichte/geschichte.html |date=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association drew inspiration from the accounts that [[Gabriele Bitterlich]] (1896-1978) gave of her [[private revelation]]s. She claimed to have received visions of the angels, including their names and their functions.

==Controversies==
===Vatican===

Some of Mrs Bitterlich's followers were circulating sensational theories of "spiritual warfare" between angels and demons, based on her writings.&lt;ref name=CNA&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/controversial-angels-religious-order-given-vatican-ok/ Controversial angels' order given Vatican OK]&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the controversy over these theories, Cardinal [[Joseph Höffner]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]], wrote on 1 December 1977, shortly before the death of Mrs Bitterlich, to ask the [[Holy See]] to institute an enquiry.

The [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] carried out the requested investigation and responded on 24 September 1983 with a [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19830924_card-hoffner_lt.html letter], known by its [[incipit]], ''Litteris diei'', which laid down:
#In fostering devotion to the Holy Angels, Opus Angelorum must respect the teaching of the Church and of the Holy Fathers and Doctors. In particular, it is not to spread a form of devotion to the Angels using the "names" derived from the alleged private revelation attributed to Mrs  Gabriele Bitterlich, nor may it use those names in any prayers of the community.
#Opus Angelorum is not to demand or even propose to its members what is called the Promise of Secrecy, although with regard to the internal affairs of the Opus Angelorum, it is lawful to maintain the discretion that befits members of the Church's institutes.
# The Opus Angelorum and its members will strictly observe the norms of the [[liturgy]], especially regarding the [[Eucharist]]. This holds in particular for the so-called "Communion of expiation".

This was followed up by a [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19920606_opus-angelorum_lt.html decree of 6 June 1992], which repeated the contents of the 1983 letter and, in view of incorrect interpretation and application of that letter, laid down the following rules:
#The theories originating from the alleged revelations of Mrs Gabriele Bitterlich concerning the world of the angels and their personal names, groupings and functions cannot be taught or in any way, whether explicitly or implicitly, be used in the organization and structure of the Opus Angelorum, such as its worship, prayers, spiritual formation, public or private spirituality, ministry and apostolate. The same rule holds for any other Church-approved institute or association.
#The various forms of acts of consecration to the angels used in the Opus Angelorum are prohibited
# Also prohibited are the so-called distance administration of the sacraments and the insertion into the [[Eucharist]]ic [[liturgy]] and the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] of texts, prayers and rites directly or indirectly related to the aforesaid theories.
#Exorcisms may be carried out only in line with the Church's norms and discipline on the matter, and with the use of formulas approved by the Church.
#A Delegate with special faculties, appointed by the Holy See, will in contact with the bishops oversee and promote  the application of these norms. He will also clarify and determine the relations between the Opus Angelorum and the Order of the Canons Regular of the Holy Cross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19920606_opus-angelorum_lt.html Decree ''Litteris diei'' of 6 June 1992 on the Teaching and Particular Usages of the Opus Angelorum Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Delegate chosen was the Dominican priest, Father Benoit Duroux, who handed over to another Dominican priest, Father Daniel Ols, in March 2010.&lt;ref name=CDF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNA/&gt;

===Murder cases===
Until 2018 there were two reported cases of [[consummated]] [[murder]] linked legally to the "Work of the Holy Angels". Both murders were related to [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church]].

In [[India]]’s state of [[Kerala]], an [[exorcism]] performed by Opus Sanctorum Angelorum’s priests led to a case of [[murder]] in 1990. The involved priests had failed to report the exorcized person, who had committed [[sexual abuse of a minor|sexual abuse of minors]], to [[Law enforcement in India|Indian police]] although the report was mandatory according to [[Indian Penal Code]]. The OSA tried to justify abuse and murder with the fictitious "demons Dragon, Varina and Selithareth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=UuI7DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT157&amp;lpg=PT157&amp;dq=dragon+varina+und+selithareth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jKx3GG23Zy&amp;sig=rP1PlV7RtFuJ2jyWmtKzHsMMfjE&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH1Zjs7-HZAhXRjqQKHXUMCPIQ6AEIbjAK#v=onepage&amp;q=dragon%20varina%20und%20selithareth&amp;f=false Heiner Boberski: ''Im Reich der Engel und Dämonen.''] Published in: [[Heiner Boberski]]: ''Mächtig – Männlich –Mysteriös.''

In 1994, the high-ranking Brazilian OSA member [[Frederico Cunha]] [[Canons Regular of the Holy Cross of Coimbra|ORC]] was found guilty of first degree murder and sexual abuse of minors. Several Opus Sanctorum Angelorum priests had tried to cover up his crimes committed on the Portuguese Madeira Island in May 1992, bribing witnesses and instigating perjury. In April 1998 Cunha fled to [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he still lived in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Axtmann: ''Engelwerk: Mord auf Madeira''.

Retrieved 22 of October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2014 several [[attempt|attempts]] of killing a German priest, who had left the OSA before, have failed. He returned to common Roman Catholic spiritual welfare after his survival.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;[https://archive.is/UguMa Mariat: ''Wer hat das "Engelwerk" (Opus Angelorum) wirklich gegründet?''] [[Augsburger Allgemeine]], 1 of June 2014. Retrieved 26 of October 2018 from [[archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approval==

On 31 May 2000, a revised form of the Act of Consecration to the Angels was approved by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engelwerk.at/briefe/pdf/engelweihe.pdf Die Weihe an die heiligen Engel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314184209/http://www.engelwerk.at/briefe/pdf/engelweihe.pdf |date=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Storia/&gt;

In the year 2002, a female branch of the Canons Regular, which is known as the Sisters of the Holy Cross, was established in Innsbruck.&lt;ref name=Storia&gt;[http://www.operadeisantiangeli.org/home/storia/ Storia dell’Opera dei Santi Angeli]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, 2003, the [[Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life]] granted definitive approval to the [[Canons Regular of the Holy Cross of Coimbra]], a [[religious institute]] founded in 1131 and, after becoming defunct in the 19th century, refounded in 1977, receiving the formal approval of the [[Holy See]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opusangelorum.org/HistoryORC/Historyoforder.html History of the Order of the Holy Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; To it, in accordance with [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P29.HTM canons 677 §2] and [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P11.HTM  303] of the Code of Canon Law, the care of ''Opus Angelorum'' movement is committed.&lt;ref name=Storia/&gt;

On 7 November 2008, the same Congregation approved the statutes of the Opus Angelorum as a public association of the faithful.&lt;ref name=Storia/&gt;

On 4 November 2010, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith declared: "Today, thanks to the obedience of its members, the Opus Angelorum can be considered to be living loyally and serenely in conformity with the doctrine of the Church and with canonical and liturgical law. Therefore, in its present state, the Opus Angelorum is a public association of the Church in conformity with traditional doctrine and with the directives of the Holy See."&lt;ref name=CDF&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-30858?l=english Doctrinal Congregation's Note on Opus Angelorum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misinterpretations==

Some news sources presented the Holy See's statement of approval of the association as instead a warning to beware of  it. An example was the BBC's news item [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11699849 "Vatican warns of 'wayward' Opus Angelorum sect"]. The warning issued was not against the association but against some ex-members, who had either been expelled or who had left of their own accord, and who were endeavouring to form a rival movement that would reject the norms issued by the Holy See.

'''Overdetermination''' occurs when a single-observed effect is determined by multiple causes, any one of which alone would be sufficient to account for ("determine") the effect. That is, there are more causes present than are necessary to cause the effect. In the [[philosophy of science]], this means that more evidence is available than is necessary to justify a conclusion. Overdetermination is in contrast to [[underdetermination]], when the number or strength of causes is insufficient. 

The term "overdetermination" ({{lang-de|Überdeterminierung}}) was also used by [[Sigmund Freud]] as a key concept in his [[psychoanalysis]].

==Freud and psychoanalysis==

Freud wrote in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' that many features of dreams were usually "overdetermined," in that they were caused by multiple factors in the life of the dreamer, from the "residue of the day" (superficial memories of recent life) to deeply repressed traumas and unconscious wishes, these being "potent thoughts".  Freud favored interpretations which accounted for such features not only once, but many times, in the context of various levels and complexes of the dreamer's psyche.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. chapter 6, "The Dream-Work", section b., "The work of displacement".&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was later borrowed for a variety of other realms of thought.

==In analytic philosophy==

In contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] an event or state of affairs is said to be ''overdetermined'' if it has two or more distinct, [[sufficient causes]].   In philosophy of mind, the famous case of overdetermination is called mental-physical causal overdetermination. If we accept that a mental state (M) is realized by a physical state (P). And M can cause another mental state (M*) or another physical state (P*). Then, nomologically speaking, P can cause M* or P* too. In this way, M* or P* is both determined by M and P. In other words, both M* and P* are overdetermined. Since either M or P is sufficient for M* or P*, the problem of mental-physical causal overdetermination is the causal redundancy. 

Whereas there may unproblematically be recognised many different ''necessary'' conditions of the event's occurrence, no two distinct events may lay claim to be sufficient conditions, since this would lead to overdetermination. A much used example is that of [[firing squad]]s, the members of which simultaneously firing at and 'killing' their targets. Apparently, no one member can be said to have caused the victims' deaths, since he or she would have been killed anyway. Another example is that Billy and Suzy each throw a rock through a window, and either rock alone could have shattered the window. In this case, similar to the example of firing squads, Billy and Suzy ''together'' shatter the window and the result is not overdetermined. Or, we can say, even if these two examples are a kind of overdetermination, this kind of overdetermination is benign.

There are many problems of overdetermination. First, overdetermination is problematic in particular from the viewpoint of a standard [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] understanding of causation, according to which an event is the cause of another event if and only if the latter would not have occurred, had the former not occurred. In order to employ this formula to actual complex situations, implicit or explicit conditions need to be accepted to be circumstantial, since the list of counterfactually acceptable causes would otherwise be impractically long (e.g. the Earth's continued existence could be said to be the (necessary) cause of one drinking one's coffee). Unless a circumstance-clause is included, the putative cause to which one wishes to draw attention could never be considered sufficient, and hence not comply with the counterfactual analysis. Second, overdetermination is problematic in that we do not know how to explain where the extra causation "comes from" and "goes". This makes overdetermination mysterious.

==Richards and literature==

The [[New Critic]] [[I. A. Richards]] used the idea of overdetermination to explain the importance of [[ambiguity]] in [[rhetoric]], the [[philosophy of language]], and [[literary criticism]].

==Althusser and structuralist Marxism==

The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Louis Althusser]] imported the concept into [[Marxist political theory]] in an influential essay, "Contradiction and overdetermination." Drawing from both Freud and [[Mao Zedong]], Althusser used the idea of overdetermination as a way of thinking about the multiple, often opposed, forces active at once in any political situation, without falling into an overly simple idea of these forces being simply "contradictory."  Brewster, in Althusser et al.'s ''[[Reading Capital]]'' defines overdetermination as such:

''"the representation of dream thoughts in images privileged by their condensation of a number of thoughts in a single image (condensation), or by the transference of psychic energy from  a particularly potent thought to apparently trivial things ... [For Althusser] overdetermination of a contradiction is the reflection in it of its conditions of existence within the complex whole."''

An instance of a popular riot calling for revolution could exemplify overdetermination.  The event has to it, in capitalist culture, an over-application (determination) of agitation. The determinant contradictions (the reasons for popular revolt) are not addressed and so their great mass is "displaced" onto the singular event.

{{Ancient Greek religion|expanded=practices}}
A '''pharmakós''' ({{lang-el|φαρμακός}}, plural '''''pharmakoi''''') in [[Ancient Greek religion]] was the ritualistic sacrifice or exile of a human [[scapegoat]] or victim.

==Ritual==
A slave, a cripple or a criminal was chosen and expelled from the community at times of disaster (famine, invasion or plague) or at times of calendrical crisis. It was believed that this would bring about purification. On the first day of the [[Thargelia]], a festival of [[Apollo]] at Athens, two men, the ''Pharmakoi'', were led out as if to be sacrificed as an expiation.

Some scholia state that ''pharmakoi'' were actually sacrificed (thrown from a cliff or burned), but many modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the ''pharmakos'' (the iambic satirist [[Hipponax]]) shows the ''pharmakoi'' being beaten and stoned, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes not, depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance, a deliberate unrepentant murderer would most likely be put to death.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In ''Aesop in Delphi'' (1961), Anton Wiechers discussed the parallels between the legendary biography of [[Aesop]] (in which he is unjustly tried and executed by the Delphians) and the ''pharmakos'' ritual. For example, Aesop is grotesquely deformed, as was the ''pharmakos'' in some traditions; and Aesop was thrown from a cliff, as was the pharmakos in some traditions.

Gregory Nagy, in ''Best of the Achaeans'' (1979), compared Aesop’s ''pharmakos'' death to the “worst” of the Achaeans in the ''[[Iliad]]'', Thersites. More recently, both Daniel Ogden, ''The Crooked Kings of Ancient Greece'' (1997) and [[Todd Compton]], ''Victim of the Muses: Poet as Scapegoat, Warrior and Hero'' (2006) examine poet ''pharmakoi''. Compton surveys important poets who were exiled, executed or suffered unjust trials, either in history, legend or Greek or [[Indo-European myth]].

==Modern interpretations&lt;!--'Plato's Pharmacy' redirects here--&gt;==
[[Walter Burkert]] and [[René Girard]] have written influential modern interpretations of the ''pharmakos'' rite. Burkert shows that humans were sacrificed or expelled after being fed well, and, according to some sources, their ashes were scattered to the ocean. This was a purification ritual, a form of societal [[catharsis]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert. ''Greek Religion'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Girard likewise discusses the connection between catharsis, sacrifice, and purification.&lt;ref&gt;René Girard. ''I See Satan Fall Like Lightning'', pp. 37–38, 51, 78, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have connected the practice of [[ostracism]], in which a prominent politician was exiled from Athens after a vote using pottery pieces, with the ''pharmakos'' custom. However, the ostracism exile was only for a fixed time, as opposed to the finality of the ''pharmakos'' execution or expulsion.

Pharmakos is also used as a vital term in Derridean [[deconstruction]]. In his essay "'''Plato's Pharmacy'''"&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;''Dissemination'', translated by Barbara Johnson, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derrida]] deconstructs several texts by [[Plato]], such as ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', and reveals the inter-connection between the word chain ''pharmakeia–pharmakon–pharmakeus'' and the notably absent word ''pharmakos''. In doing so, he attacks the boundary between inside and outside, declaring that the outside (pharmakos, never uttered by Plato) is always-already present right behind the inside (''pharmakeia–pharmakon–pharmakeus''). As a concept, Pharmakos can be said to be related to other Derridian terms such as "[[Trace (philosophy)|trace]]".

'''Pranava yoga''' is [[meditation]] on the sacred mantra [[Om]], as outlined in the [[Upanishads]], the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', and the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]''. It is also called ''Aum yoga'' and ''Aum yoga meditation''. It is, simply put, fixing the mind on the sound of the mantra “[[Om|Aum]]” – the sacred syllable that both symbolizes and embodies [[Brahman]], the Absolute Reality – as the [[mantra]] is constantly repeated in unison with the breath. The purpose of pranava yoga is to become free from suffering and limitation.

The purpose is well stated in the Upanishads: “What world does he who meditates on Aum until the end of his life, win by That? If he meditates on the Supreme Being with the syllable Aum, he becomes one with the Light, he is led to the world of Brahman [the Absolute Being] Who is higher than the highest life, That Which is tranquil, unaging, immortal, fearless, and supreme.” – Prashna Upanishad 5:1,5,7

==The mantra Aum==

[[Om|Aum]], according to Hindu philosophy, is the primordial sound from which the whole universe was created. Aum, also called the Pranava, is the original Word of Power, and is recited as a mantra. A mantra is a series of verbal sounds having inherent sound-power that can produce a particular physical or psychological effect, not just something that has an assigned intellectual meaning. The word mantra derives from the Sanskrit expression ‘''mananaath thraayathe''’  which loosely means “a transforming thought”; literally, “that which, when thought, carries one across [the worldly ocean of sorrow]”. The power of a mantra lies in its ability to produce an objective, perceptible change in the yogi who repeats it correctly.

In the yoga tradition, Aum is the most sacred of holy words, the supreme mantra. Aum is also called the Pranava, a Sanskrit word which means both controller of life force (prana) and life-giver (infuser of prana). “That which causes all the pranas to prostrate themselves before and get merged in the Paramatman, so as to attain identity with Him, is for that reason known as the Pranava.” – Atharvashikha Upanishad 1:10a.&lt;ref&gt;The quotations from the Upanishads in this article are taken from ''[[The Principal Upanishads (book)|The Principal Upanishads]]'' ([[The Principal Upanishads (book)|see article]]) by S. Radhakrishnan, George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.1953&lt;/ref&gt; Aum is called the Shabda Brahman – God as Sound/Vibration. According to yoga theory, the universe has emanated from this primal movement in God. By following the thread of Aum back in meditation to more and more subtle levels of awareness, the yogi regains union with Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;* [[I. K. Taimni|Taimni, I. K.]] ''The Science of Yoga: The Yoga-Sutras of Patanjali''. Theosophical Publishing House.1965. {{ISBN|81-7059-211-9}}. [[I. K. Taimni|Dr. Taimni]] was a Physics and Chemistry professor at Allahabad University, as well as an accomplished yogi. His analysis of the principles of yoga benefit from his combination of a scientific viewpoint and a practical familiarity with the subject, rather than a merely academic knowledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pandit, M. P., ''Japa (mantra yoga)'' Lotus Press; 1 edition 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swami Sivananda Saraswati, ''Meditation on Om''. Divine Life Society. 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Upanishads ==

The Upanishads (both the major and minor) are full of references to Aum and meditation on Aum. Below is a small sampling:

* "He who utters Om with the intention ‘I shall attain Brahman’ does verily attain Brahman."  - Taittiriya Upanishad 1.8.1
* "The Self is of the nature of the Syllable Om...Meditate on Om as the Self" - Mandukya Upanishad 1.8.12, 2.2.3)
* "The form of meditation that came to manifest as the foremost of all, for the regeneration of all seekers, was the First Word, indicative of Brahman [God]: the Syllable Om. Meditation on Om should be resorted to by seekers after liberation. This Syllable is the Supreme Brahman." – Atharvashikha Upanishad 1:1,2
* "God is the Syllable Om, out of Him proceeds the Supreme Knowledge." – Svetasvatara Upanishad 4:17
* "Om is Brahman, the Primeval Being. This is the Veda which the knowers of Brahman know; through it one knows what is to be known." – Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 5.1.1
* "One should meditate on this Syllable [Om]." – Chandogya Upanishad 1.1.1
* "The Syllable Om is the bow: one's self, indeed, is the arrow. Brahman is spoken of as the target of that. It is to be hit without making a mistake. Thus one becomes united with it [Brahman] as the arrow becomes one with the target." – Mundaka Upanishad 2.2.4

== ''Bhagavad Gita'' ==

Speaking from the perspective of the Infinite Being, enumerating his major manifestation-embodiments, Krishna says: "I am the syllable Om."(Gita 7:8) He also says the same thing in 9:17 ("I am...the sacred monosyllable") and 10:25 ("Among words I am the monosyllable Om").

What to "do" with aum is then outlined by Krishna: "Engaged in the practice of concentration... uttering the monosyllable Om--the Brahman--remembering Me always, he...attains to the supreme goal. I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers Me."– ''Bhagavad Gita'' 6:13; 8:12-14&lt;ref&gt;Selections from the ''Bhagavad Gita'' from Swami Sivananda Saraswati’s translation. Divine Life Society. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'' ==
{{Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, the most ancient and authoritative text on Yoga, outlines the purpose and process of yoga as follows:

"Ishwara [God] is a particular Purusha [Spirit, Person] Who is untouched by the afflictions of life, actions, and the results and impressions produced by these actions. In Him is the highest limit of omniscience. 36 Being unconditioned by time He is teacher even of the ancients. His designator [vachaka] is the Pranava [Om]. 37 Its [[japa]] [constant repetition] and bhavanam is the way [or: should be done]. From it result [come] the disappearance of obstacles and the turning inward of consciousness. Disease, languor, doubt, carelessness, laziness, worldly-mindedness, delusion, non-achievement of a stage, instability, these cause the distraction of the mind and they are the obstacles. [Mental] pain, despair, nervousness, and agitation are the symptoms of a distracted condition of mind. For removing these obstacles [there should be] the constant practice of the one principle [the japa and bhavanam of Om]." – ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'' 1:24-32&lt;ref&gt;Selections from the Yoga Sutras from I. K. Taimni’s translation in ''The Science of Yoga: The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali''. Theosophical Publishing House. 1965.{{ISBN|81-7059-211-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aum Meditation in [[Kriya Yoga]] ==

Aum meditation is part of Kriya Yoga teachings. In addition to chanting the sound of aum, this meditation involves  inhaling and exhaling while chanting aum in a very specific mudra.

== Masters of wisdom on Aum ==

* '''[[Sri Anandamoyi Ma]]'''
“[Remembrance of the Pranava] must become so automatic that you cannot breathe without remembering It.”

“Om is the root of all sounds. Every other sound is contained in That, and It is used to take one beyond all sound.”&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Ram. Death Must Die : The Diaries of Atmananda (A Western Women's Life Long Spiritual Quest in India and its Fulfilment Through Her Guru : Shree Anandamayee Ma). {{ISBN|81-86569-19-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Sri Aurobindo]]'''
“OM is the mantra, the expressive sound-symbol of the Brahman Consciousness in its four domains from the Turiya to the external or material plane. The function of a mantra is to create vibrations in the inner consciousness that will prepare it for the realisation of what the mantra symbolises and is supposed indeed to carry within itself. The mantra OM should therefore lead towards the opening of the consciousness to the sight and feeling of the One Consciousness in all material things, in the inner being and in the supraphysical worlds, in the causal plane above now superconscient to us and, finally, the supreme liberated transcendence above all cosmic existence. The last is usually the main preoccupation with those who use the mantra.” ''Letters on Yoga'', Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;745-46

* '''[[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]]'''
“If you are a serious student of Vedic mantras, you will chant Om because Vedic mantras begin with Om. Om, or the Omkara, is Krishna. Many people are fond of chanting Omkara. That is also nice, because Omkara is Krishna. If we simply remember, ‘This Omkara is Krishna,’ then we become perfect, because the goal is to become Krishna conscious. So you can become Krishna conscious while chanting Om.”&lt;ref&gt;“The Taste of Krishna,” ''Back to Godhead'', Sept/Oct 1997, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Swami Dayananda Saraswati]]'''
“Om is the highest Name of God, and comprises many other Names of God. It should be borne in mind that Om is the Name of God exclusively–and of no other object material or spiritual–while the others are but descriptive titles and not exactly proper names.”&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028134700/http://geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3440/books.html  Satyartha Prakash]'' by Swami Dayananda Saraswati&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Kabir]]'''
“This is the Ultimate Word: but can any express its marvellous savor? He who has savored it once, he knows what joy it can give. Kabir says: Knowing it, the ignorant man becomes wise, and the wise man becomes speechless and silent.”&lt;ref&gt;''Songs of Kabir'', translated by Rabindranath Tagore. II.61&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Lahiri Mahasaya]]'''
“Constant japa of the Pranava, Omkar, Which is self-revealing, and constant focus on It as the form of Ishvara, and dedicating all actions to It as if you are not the doer yourself; is Kriya Yoga.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yoganiketan.net/ ''Patanjali's Yoga Sutras – a commentary by Shyama Charan Lahiri''.] (This book is available for free reading on the Yoga Niketan library and is also published by them)&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Avadhuta Nityananda Paramhansa]]'''
“Following the path of discrimination, let the pure mind be firmly fixed in Om.”&lt;ref&gt;Hatengdi, M.U., and Swami Chetanananda, ''Nitya Sutras: the Revelations of Nityananda from the Chidakasha Gita'', Sutra 12, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Ramakrishna|Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa]]'''
“‘What will you gain’, some sages ask, ‘by merely hearing this sound?’ You hear the roar of the ocean from a distance. By following the roar you can reach the ocean. As long as there is the roar, there must also be the ocean. By following the trail of Om you attain Brahman, of which the Word is the symbol. That Brahman has been described by the Vedas as the ultimate goal.”&lt;ref&gt;"M" (Mahendranath Gupta) ''The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna'', translated by Swami Nikhilananda, 1973 p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Ramana Maharshi]]'''
“The purport of prescribing meditation on the Pranava is this. The Pranava is Omkara…the advaita-mantra which is the essence of all mantras…. In order to get at this true significance, one should meditate on the Pranava. …The fruition of this process is samadhi which yields release [moksha], which is the state of unsurpassable bliss.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Works of Ramana Maharshi'', sixth edition 1996, p. 25,26&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''' Amit Ray '''
In the book ''Om Chanting and Meditation'':
{{quotation| Om chanting is a creative art, not just mechanical repetition of a word. Om is known as Pranava, which means new, the ever fresh. So, each uttering of Om mantra is always new, unique and fresh. We all are unique.... Therefore, our utterances of Om should be spontaneous and unique.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1426">'''Prophetic dance''' is a [[ritual dance]] in which the purpose is to obtain a communication from or to [[God]] (gods)  [[spirit]]s in order to receive a favorable response (rain and good harvests, for example). Is also present in modern [[Christian culture]], in which the term is fixed.

==Christian faith==

"Prophetic Dance" and or movements in the church can be classified in two distinct forms.
The first type most commonly used in conjunction with pageantry, presentation and performance primarily. Flags, banners, and processionals which are just a few ways to be used to minister to God. This type of ministry can have profoundly prophetic overtones but is still geared primarily for the benefit of God.
The second avenue in which prophetic dance or movement can be used is whereby the vehicle/person being used becomes the minister to and for the benefit of the people. Believers feel that dancing or any movement inspired by God can and will become His voice at that moment. They further subscribe to the belief that an experienced person not meaning in dance vocabulary but relationally with God can use this medium to heal, deliver and set people free from all types of sickness and disease. The Prophetic arts is described as God using our gifts and talents to reveal His heart.

'''Ramtha's School of Enlightenment''' ('''RSE''') is an American [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[sect]] near the rural town of [[Yelm, Washington]], U.S. The school was established in 1988 by [[J. Z. Knight]], who claims to [[Mediumship|channel]] a 35,000-year-old being called Ramtha the Enlightened One. The school's teachings are based on these channeling sessions.

==History==
In 1988, [[J. Z. Knight]] founded Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE), then called Ramtha's School of Enlightenment: The American Gnostic School, on her {{no wrap|{{convert|80|acres|adj=on}}}}&lt;ref name="olympian3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pemberton|first=Lisa|title=Behind the gates at Ramtha's School|url=http://www.theolympian.com/news/local/article25225543.html|newspaper=The Olympian|date=July 16, 2006|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; estate in [[Yelm, Washington]], U.S. A division of Knight's company JZK, Inc.,&lt;ref name="York2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=York|first=Michael|title=Historical Dictionary of New Age Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umbl7x8aYqkC&amp;pg=PA105|series=Historical Dictionaries of Religions, Philosophies, and Movements|volume=No. 49|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4873-3|pages=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; the school had around 80 staff members {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=SPLC/&gt; According to RSE's website, it is an "academy of the mind that offers retreats and workshops to people of all ages and cultures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Ramtha's School of Enlightenment|url=http://ramtha.com/content/aboutus.aspx|website=Ramtha's School of Enlightenment|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSE's private, fenced compounds are only open to staff members and students, not to the public.&lt;ref name="olympian2"/&gt;

In 2004, various Ramtha school leaders joined community groups to strongly oppose a proposed 75,000-seat NASCAR racetrack in Yelm. The proposal was withdrawn. In 2007, Knight's profits from the school's activities and from sale of books, tapes, CDs and DVDs had reportedly been around $2.6 million. In 2008, lessons were given to the public in more than 20 countries, including the [[Czech Republic]], [[Romania]] and [[Chile]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="olympian2"/&gt;

==Teachings==
{{see|JZ Knight#Teachings}}
[[File:2012-05-17 Yelm Ramtha School of Englightenment entrance.jpg|thumb|320px|Gate to Ramtha's School of Enlightenment northwest of [[Yelm, Washington]].]]

The school teaches that human beings have the capacity to utilize their inner wisdom, focus their brains, and create their own reality.&lt;ref name="olympian2"/&gt; The school's curriculum is based on the channelings by Knight of the entity Ramtha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Lydgate |title=What The #$*! is Ramtha?: The year's sleeper hit was inspired by a 35,000-year-old warrior spirit from Atlantis |url=http://wweek.com/story.php?story=5860 |work=Willamette Week|date=December 22, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309094737/http://www.wweek.com/story.php?story=5860|archivedate=March 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the school has been criticised for being a [[cult]] (see below), Knight and her followers deny such claims and say that the school is neither a [[religion]] nor a cult.&lt;ref name="whitebook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Judy Zebra|title=Ramtha: The White Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gz78a6_iDlAC&amp;pg=PA28|date=January 27, 2005|origyear=1999|publisher=JZK Publishing|location=Yelm, Washington|isbn=978-1-57873-045-2|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramtha.com/html/media/faqs/school/school-religion.stm|title=Media: Is it a school or a religion?|website=Ramtha's School of Englightenment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401080232/http://www.ramtha.com/html/media/faqs/school/school-religion.stm|archivedate=April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramtha.com/html/aboutus/about-jz.stm|title=About Us: Greetings from JZ Knight|website=Ramtha's School of Englightenment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308043731/http://ramtha.com/html/aboutus/about-jz.stm|archivedate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramtha's School of Enlightenment teachings have been described as part of the [[New Age]] movement (the school itself claims to be outside it). A controversial religious scholar, [[J. Gordon Melton]], wrote a book countering this argument called ''Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom''.

Lessons in the school's compounds sometimes include wine drinking,&lt;ref name="cunningham"/&gt; tobacco pipe smoking and dancing to rock ’n’ roll music. Allegedly, it is being taught that the nitric oxide in red wine (not the alcohol), also found in pipe tobacco (not the nicotine), can help to facilitate changes in the brain as a part of the process in which to achieve these means.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Through various focus techniques, the students believe they are on their way to becoming as "enlightened" as other shamans who can alter their personal reality at will.&lt;ref name="szimhart"/&gt; The main activities towards that goal vary from specific focusing, meditation-like techniques, breathing techniques, blindfolded archery, energy healing (for one's self and for someone else), finding the heart of a maze, and many more.  The students are taught that human beings can train themselves into such powers that will allow them to levitate, raise the dead, make gold appear in their hand and predict the future. Eventually this may lead to the "ascension" of the physical body into the "light body".&lt;ref name="szimhart"/&gt;

Other skills allegedly obtained by attending the lessons include [[psychokinesis]], [[telepathy]], [[clairvoyance]], and other [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] skills,&lt;ref name="remarkable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ramtha.com/Remarkable.html|title=Remarkable Students|website=Ramtha's School of Enlightenment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726130331/http://ramtha.com/Remarkable.html|archivedate=July 26, 2011}}{{primary-inline|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|date=February 2017}} which have been criticized by various skeptics around the world.

The dialogues, and a lot of transcripts from Knight's Ramtha talks, have been compiled and published over the course of many years. Videotapes of various dialogue sessions have also been released. While some of the major themes around the school's teachings are covered in these publications, a more in-depth and systematic presentation of its philosophies and teachings are only accessible by attending a retreat in person.

==Research==
In February 1997, Knight hosted a conference of scholars who had been studying her, the students and the school for the previous year. During their research phase, they also observed Knight's Ramtha sessions and measured various physiological functions of her body. The researchers examined Ramtha’s teachings and the school's practices from a variety of perspectives, including [[physics]], [[feminism]], [[parapsychology]] and religion. Melton organized the research. In addition to the conference presenters, Knight invited the media to attend. However, Knight said she did not sponsor the conference to gain publicity or to convince her skeptics.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news|author=Maynard, Steve|title=JZ Knight to Open Ranch to Scrutiny|department=Front Page|newspaper=The News Tribune|location=Tacoma, Washington|date=February 1, 1997|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Professors at Ramtha Meeting Defend Objectivity, Integrity|author=Maynard, Steve|department=Local/State|newspaper=The News Tribune|location=Tacoma, Washington|date=February 10, 1997|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight paid the travel expenses and [[stipend]]s for the conference presenters,&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt; which caused some of Knight’s critics to suggest she had influenced their research. The researchers denied this contention to the press and, according to the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', "were offended by a suggestion that the New Age spiritualist could have tried to buy their support".&lt;ref name=SPLC&gt;{{cite news|author=Iwasaki, John|title=JZ Knight Not Faking It, Say Scholars – But They Bristle at the Idea She's Buying Them|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=February 10, 1997|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the conference proceedings, two papers were published. In 1998, [[Stanley Krippner]] published a paper on the [[psychological]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and geomagnetic results of the various studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krippner, Stanley; et al.|title=The Ramtha Phenomena: Psychological, Phenomenological, and Geomagnetic Data|journal=The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research|volume=92|issue=1|date=January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Joan Hageman published a paper examining the results of the physiological testing on Knight and six students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hageman, Joan H.; et al.|title=Sympathetic Reactivity During Meditation|journal=Subtle Energies &amp; Energy Medicine|volume=19|issue=2|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==

Ramtha's School of Enlightenment has been called a cult by various people, including her former husband Jeff Knight,&lt;ref name="jeffknight"&gt;{{cite web|title=From Abracadabra to Zombies: Ramtha (a.k.a.

He has also been called a "cult apologist" by various opposers of cults. His position was further criticized when he took the stand as a witness in the case of Knight v. Knight (1992–1995) against Jeff Knight (JZ Knight's husband at the time), by further supporting that the school is not a cult.&lt;ref name="szimhart"&gt;{{citation|last=Szimhart|first=Joe|title=Critical Study of Gordon Melton's Book on Ramtha|work=Kelebek ''[''Butterfly'']''|date=July 1998|url=http://www.kelebekler.com/cesnur/txt/ram2.htm|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2012-05-17 Yelm Ramtha School of Enlightenment sign.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Sign along [[Washington State Route 510|WA 510]]. The entrance to Ramtha's School of Enlightenment is in the background on the left.]]

Former students of the school have accused the RSE of practicing brain-washing and mind-control, as well as using intimidation and fear techniques to keep students in the school. David McCarthy, a student of the RSE between 1989 and 1996, calls Knight a "spiritual predator", and he mentions various parts of the teachings which had an intimidative character, such as the prophecy that unless students remain faithful to Ramtha, they will become prey of the "lizard people", and that the ancient figure of [[Jehovah]] would return to earth accompanied by lizard people, in a spaceship.&lt;ref name="olympian2"/&gt; The former students (including David McCarthy and Joe Szimhart) have formed an online community, Life After RSE (LARSE), to provide support for people who have quit the school and find themselves lost.&lt;ref name="cunningham"/&gt;

A further controversial issue regarding the Ramtha teachings involve the so-called "days to come", which were prophesied earth changes. Instructions reputed as coming from Ramtha were given to the students, telling them to leave the cities, find a place in the country to grow their own food and become sovereign or self-sufficient. Another instruction was told to students to build underground shelters to protect themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="szimhart"/&gt;

Various incidents within the school's grounds have been characterized as controversial. Glen Cunningham, in an interview with David McCarthy, describes how, one evening, Knight suggested that all students should stay there overnight because she said it would be "good for the energy". That was before the Great Arena (formerly used as horse stables) had been floored, and as a result there would be a lot of dust in the air. Cunningham says that there was a very old woman among the students, who begged him that she did not want to do this and she wanted to go home, but Ramtha said that she can stay under the protection of Ramtha and her bodyguard. Leaving the arena the following day, the old woman died of pneumonia (due to the dust in the air and humidity).&lt;ref name="cunningham"/&gt;

Another incident which is mentioned by both Cunningham and Joe Szimhart is the practice of running blindfolded in a large fenced field. Szimhart mentions in particular an occasion around the year 1990, in which about 1,000 blindfolded students were directed to split up and run across the field, with their hands in the "Consciousness &amp; Energy" position in front of them, and the exercise was meant to help the students overcome their fears. Szimhart recalls how many people crashed into each other, and that there were some injuries. A customer of his ended up with a deeply bruised shoulder and a big lump on his forehead. Aside from the minor injuries, a few people had to be treated at the hospital.&lt;ref name="cunningham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="szimhart"/&gt;

In 2011, Knight stated (while at the RSE supposedly channeling Ramtha), "Fuck God’s chosen people! I think they have earned enough cash to have paid their way out of the goddamned gas chambers by now", and said that Mexican people "breed like rabbits" and are "poison," that all gay men used to be Catholic priests, and that organic farmers have bad hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan|first1=Susy|title=Ramtha Riled|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2014/ramtha-riled|accessdate=February 25, 2017|magazine=Intelligence Report|volume=2014 Summer Issue|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=May 23, 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alternet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan |first=Susy |url=http://www.alternet.org/belief/ramtha-new-age-cult-leader-unleashes-drunken-racist-homophobic-rants-large-following?paging=off&amp;current_page=1#bookmark |title=Ramtha, New Age Cult Leader, Unleashes Drunken, Racist, Homophobic Rants to Large Following |work=AlterNet |date=July 9, 2014|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, videos of this were placed on the Internet by ex-students of Knight's and by the Freedom Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Austin|title=Washington Democrats Reverse Course, Shed JZ Knight Contributions|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=163750642|accessdate=February 25, 2017|work=NPR|date=October 27, 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brunner|first1=Jim|title=State Democratic Party Will Donate Money from JZ Knight after Offensive Comments|url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2012/10/26/state-democratic-party-will-donate-money-from-j-z-knight-after-offensive-comments/|accessdate=February 25, 2017|work=The Seattle Times|date=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alternet"/&gt;

'''Raoul Adolphe Georges Rigault''', born on 16 January 1846 in Paris, where he also died on 24 May 1871, was a journalist and French politician, best known for his role during the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871.

He is most notable for having saved the life of the French father of Impressionist painting, [[Auguste Renoir]], from a firing squad; for having led a ruthless, [[French Revolution]]-style (''"[[Jacobin]]"'') police operation during the Paris Commune; and for his unrelenting hatred of religion.

==Personal life==

===Upbringing===

Rigault was the son of a councilor at the [[Seine]] prefecture and attended [[École polytechnique]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===Character===

[[Image:Les_hommes_de_la_Commune.jpg|thumb|left|Raoul Rigault (Bottom-Most, Left-Most), "Les hommes de la Commune," ("The Men of the Commune,") L'Illustration, journal universel, 15 juillet 1871, unknown artist.]]

The New York Times in 1884 gives the following description of Rigault...

{{cquote|...fond of good wine, always talking, shouting, gesticulating, filling his nose with snuff, astonishing the novices with his gift of speech, almost celebrated in the Quartier des Ecoles, and much appreciated by girls of low condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website

 |year=1884

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

According to the ''Association des Amies et Amis de la Commune de Paris 1871'' (Association of Friends and Friends of the 1871 Paris Commune), Rigault was hated for being a "swagger of perversity", "scoundrel", "aristocrat of the thuggery", for making jokes about how he had improved the guilotine, for his "militant atheism," and for creating a police system of "informants and snitches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==As Revolutionary==

Rigault had been a revolutionary since his youth.  In 1866, he was arrested at a meeting of revolutionaries at the Café de la Renaissance in Saint-Michel, and in 1868, he served three months imprisonment for publishing a journal on [[Atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website
 |title=Raoul Rigault
 |publisher=Un Journal Pour La Commune, 1871–2011
 |url=https://raspou.team/1871/raoul-rigault/
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Rigault's revolutionary activity was anti-police and anti-establishment.  He had "spent long hours with a spyglass propped up on a Seine bookseller's stall, peering into the Prefecture of Police across the water," and with this information, he kept "track of the coming and going of informers and plain-clothes men," and also managed the "undoing of a particularly harsh and licentious judge, Delesvaux, who delighted in sentencing revolutionaries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting with Renoir===

While a fugitive in youth, he was hidden by [[Auguste Renoir]], the famous painter, in the forests of [[Fontainebleau]].  He would return the favor by noticing Renoir destined for the firing squad in the Paris Commune, and having Renoir immediately pardoned and released.

==As Chief of Police==

===General Procedures===

[[Image:ROUQUETTE(1871) p101 Rigault.jpg|thumb|left|Raoul Rigault Drawing, by Jules Rouquette]]

[[Image:Rigault-passport.png|thumb|right|Passport signed by Raoul Rigault for Madame de Hegermann-Lindencrone.]]

While the majority of the Commune's politicians were extremely progressive or left-wing, The New Yorker describes Rigault as "the backward-looking aspect... A socialist polemicist of appetite and charm, he became, in effect, the head of the Commune's police force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

One American woman, Madame de Hegermann-Lindencrone, held audience with Rigault as Chief of Police, and described his quarters as barren of furniture, "only the table...[and] two or three plain chairs... Just such a chamber as [[Robespierre]] might have occupied during ''his'' republic," claiming that Rigault "took advantage of the unavoidable questions that belong to the making out of a passport."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freeing of Prisoners===

Like during most revolutions, his most popular acts as police chief were those in the beginning, when he freed those imprisoned by the imperial French government, which included revolutionaries, [[anarchism|Anarchists]], and Blanquists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blanquist Obsession===

As police chief, the main occupation that Rigault worried himself with was with freeing [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], then being held by the [[monarchist]] forces of [[Versailles]].  His plan was to do a hostage trade of Archbishop [[Georges Darboy]] in exchange for Blanqui; but when this plan tragically failed, Darboy was executed by Commune forces in a stir of panic and desperation, killing one of the most reform-minded and democratically-oriented bishops of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Catholicism and Anti-Religion===

[[Image:Raoul_Rigault,_Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Raoul Rigault Drawing, by H.D. Justesse]]

If there was one issue over which the people of Paris instinctively and almost unanimously sympathized with Rigault, "this was his violent [[anticlericalism]]," according to the historian, [[Alistair Horne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher=St. Martin's Press, New York

 |chapter=Chapter 22: Return of the Jacobins
 |pages=336–7
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; As chief of police, he searched and investigated churches for evidence of sympathy with [[Versailles]] (as with most forms of Revolution in Western Europe, this evidence meant ''any hidden arms'').  The arrest of Archbishop Darboy was done at the hand of Rigault.  The following famous dialogue took place between a [[Jesuit]] and Rigault...

{{cquote|'''Rigualt''': What is your profession?

'''Priest''': Servant of God.

'''Rigault''': Where does your master live?

'''Priest''': Everywhere.

'''Rigault (to Clerk)''': Take this down: X, describing himself servant of one called God, a vagrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One historian of the Paris Commune wrote that, "Atheism was a cardinal tenet of Blanqui's faith, and his disciple Rigault was an adept at priest-baiting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

[[Image:Death_of_Raoul_Rigault.jpg|thumb|right|Execution of Raoul Rigault, Drawing by Georges Pilotell]]

After the Paris Commune, he was "simply executed with a bullet in the skull, on the street of Gay-Lussac on Wednesday, May 24, 1871."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website

&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a more detailed account, Rigault had worn his National Guard uniform that day, in order to shame those who refused to keep up the fight.  In this outfit, he was instantly picked up.  At gunpoint by a Versailles officer, he was ordered to shout, "Long Live Versailles!"  He responded, ''"You are assassins! Long live the Commune!"'' and was immediately shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8225">'''''Religio licita''''' ("permitted religion,"&lt;ref&gt;''Licita'' is the [[past participle]] of ''licet'', "is permitted, is lawful."&lt;/ref&gt; also translated as "approved religion"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a phrase used in the ''[[Apologeticus|Apologeticum]]'' of [[Tertullian]]&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''Apologeticum'' 21.1.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the special status of the [[Jews in the Roman Empire]]. It was not an official term in [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Francis Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts: The Social and Political Motivations of Lucan Theology'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 1996), p. 211, begins his analysis of the ''religio licita'' theory "by immediately scotching the idea that Rome had some process for licensing foreign religions. There is no historical support for this whatsoever; … there never was a juridical category of ''religio licita''." See also Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'', p. 35; Solomon Grayzel, "The Jews and Roman Law," ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', 59 (1968), pp. 93-117; [[Ben Witherington III]], ''The Acts of the Apostles: A Socio-rhetorical Commentary ''(Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 1997), p. 542; John J. O'Keefe, entry on "Religio licita," in ''A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it occurs in only one [[Church Fathers|patristic text]] and in no [[classical antiquity|classical]] Roman sources or inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin H. Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' (Princeton University Press, 2004, 2006), p. 449; Tessa Rajak, "Was There a Roman Charter for the Jews?" ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 74 (1984), pp. 107-123. As Stephen Wilson, ''Related Strangers: Jews and Christians, 70–170 C.E.'' (Augsburg Fortress, 1995, 2005), p. 68, has noted, ''religio licita'' "is not a Roman but a Christian concept."&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase has spawned abundant scholarly conjecture on its possible significance. Some scholars have gone so far as to imagine that all religions under the Empire had a legal status as either ''licita'' or ''illicita'', despite the absence of any ancient texts referring to these categories.&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations: Claiming a Place in Ancient Mediterranean Society'' (Augsburg Fortress, 2003), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme view has held that Tertullian's phrase means all foreign religions required a license from the Roman government.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 206, taking note of Foakes Jackson and Kirsopp Lake, B.S. Easton, and the early work of H.J. Cadbury as examples of this extreme of interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was Roman custom to permit or even encourage the subject peoples of the [[Roman province|provinces]] and foreign communities in Rome to maintain their ancestral religion, unless specific practices were regarded as disruptive or subversive:&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'', p. 449; Jörg Rüpke, "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; "A ''religio'' was ''licita'' for a particular group on the basis of tribe or nationality and traditional practices, coupled with the proviso that its rites were not offensive to the Roman people or [[List of Roman deities|its gods]]."&lt;ref&gt;W. H. C. Frend, ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1967), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian uses the phrase in a passage arguing that Christians should be granted the same [[freedom of religion|freedom to practice their religion]] as any other inhabitant of the Empire; the passage itself, and not the phrase ''religio licita'', is evidence of the general [[religious tolerance|tolerance]] afforded under [[Religion in ancient Rome|the Roman system of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Ames, "Roman Religion in the Vision of Tertullian," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism as ''licita''==
''Religio licita'' has sometimes been taken as a formal recognition or [[charter]] originating with [[Julius Caesar]] and embodied by various pieces of Roman legislation pertaining to the Jews, conceived of as a coherent policy.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian: A Study in Political Relations'' (2nd ed.; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1981), p. 539 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the various privileges and exemptions granted to the Jews were responses to specific complaints or requests, made in the context of the traditional [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage network]],&lt;ref&gt;Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations'', pp. 221–222; Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'', 13 (1994) pp. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; and had nothing to do with a supposed ''religio licita'' status.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that the Romans respected Judaism, it was because of the religion's great antiquity, ancestral tradition being regarded as a source of social and political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that "[[Roman magistrates]] treated the Jews the way they did not because they were consciously tolerant, but simply because they had no reason to hinder the free exercise of Jewish religious practices."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'' 13 (1994), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity as ''illicita''==
Some scholars have argued that Christianity was declared a ''religio illicita'' (an impermissible or illegitimate religion) by [[Domitian]] in the [[80s]] AD.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey E.M. de Ste. Croix, "Why Were the Early Christians Persecuted?" ''Past and Present'', 26 (1963), pp. 6-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this term appears nowhere, it has been conjectured that a declaration of Christianity as ''illicita'' was the legal basis for official persecutions. There was, however, "no law, either existing section of criminal law, or special legislation directed against the Christians, under which Christians were prosecuted in the first two centuries."&lt;ref&gt;J.E.A. Crake, "Early Christians and Roman Law," ''Phoenix'' 19 (1965), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome lacked a uniform policy or legal code pertaining to foreign cults,&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Barnes, "Legislation against the Christians," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 58 (1968), 50&lt;/ref&gt; and before Christian hegemony in the 4th century, there was no legal language to designate a concept analogous to "[[heresy]]" or crimes against orthodox religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, "Roman Policy," p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Constantine the Great]], [[Early Christianity|Christianity]] and other religions became tolerated with the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313. Toleration did not extend to religions that practiced [[human sacrifice]], such as [[Druidism]]. This state of affairs lasted until 380, when [[Nicene Creed|Nicene Christianity]] was adopted as the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]], after which time [[Historical_persecution_by_Christians#Roman_Empire|persecution]] of non-Christian and non-Nicene cults began. [[Priscillian]] was executed for heresy in 385, and [[Theodosius I]] began outlawing Rome's traditional religious rituals in 391.

[[File:Nandibull.jpg|thumb|17th century sculpture of a [[Nandi bull]] in [[Mysore]].]]

Numerous peoples throughout the world have at one point in time honored bulls as sacred. In [[Sumerian mythology]], [[Marduk]] is the "bull of [[Utu]]". In [[Hinduism]], [[Shiva]]'s steed is [[Nandi bull|Nandi]], the Bull. The sacred bull survives in the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. The [[bull]], whether lunar as in Mesopotamia or solar as in India, is the subject of various other cultural and [[religion|religious]] incarnations as well as modern mentions in [[New Age]] cultures.

==In prehistorical art==
[[Aurochs]] are depicted in many [[Paleolithic]] European cave paintings such as those found at [[Lascaux]] and Livernon in France. Their life force may have been thought to have magical qualities, for early carvings of the aurochs have also been found. The impressive and dangerous aurochs survived into the [[Iron Age]] in Anatolia and the Near East and were worshipped throughout that area as sacred animals; the earliest survivals of a bull worship are at neolithic [[Çatalhöyük#Culture|Çatalhöyük]].

The bull was seen in the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)#History and mythology|Taurus]] by the [[Chalcolithic]] and had marked the [[New Year]] at springtide by the [[Bronze Age]], for 4000–1700 BCE.

==In antiquity==

===Mesopotamia===
The [[Sumer]]ian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' depicts the killing by [[Gilgamesh]] and [[Enkidu]] of the [[Bull of Heaven]] as an act of defiance of the gods. From the earliest times, the bull was lunar in [[Mesopotamia]] (its horns representing the crescent moon).&lt;ref&gt;Jules Cashford, ''The Moon: Myth and Image'' 2003, begins the section "Bull and cow" pp 102ff with the simple observation, "Other animals become epiphanies of the Moon because they look like the moon.... the sharp horns of a bull or cow were seen to match the pointed curve of the waxing and waning crescents so exactly that the powers of the one were attributed to the other, each gaining the other's potency as well as their own."&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}}

===Egypt===
[[File:Hathor with sacred eye in papyrus.JPG|thumb|[[Hathor]] as a cow, wearing her necklace and showing her sacred eye on the ''[[Papyrus of Ani]]''.]]

In Egypt, the bull was worshiped as [[Apis (deity)|Apis]], the embodiment of [[Ptah]] and later of [[Osiris]]. A long series of ritually perfect bulls were identified by the god's priests, housed in the temple for their lifetime, then embalmed and encased in a giant [[sarcophagus]]. A long sequence of monolithic stone sarcophagi was housed in the [[Serapeum]], and was rediscovered by [[Auguste Mariette]] at [[Saqqara]] in 1851. The bull was also worshipped as [[Mnevis]], the embodiment of [[Atum]]-[[Ra]], in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].  ''Ka'' in Egyptian is both a religious concept of life-force/power and the word for bull.

===Eastern Anatolia===
We cannot recreate a specific context for the bull skulls with horns (''[[bucranium|bucrania]]'') preserved in an 8th millennium BCE sanctuary at [[Çatalhöyük]] in eastern Anatolia. The sacred bull of the [[Hattians]], whose elaborate standards were found at [[Alaca Höyük]] alongside those of the [[deer in mythology|sacred stag]], survived in [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] and [[Hittite mythology]] as Seri and Hurri ("Day" and "Night"), the bulls who carried the weather god [[Teshub]] on their backs or in his chariot and grazed on the ruins of cities.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes and Woolley, 1963; Vieyra, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crete===
[[File:Knossos Bull-Leaping Fresco.jpg|thumb|The [[Bull-Leaping Fresco]]: [[Knossos]]]]

Bulls were a central theme in the [[Minoan civilization]], with bull heads and bull horns used as symbols in the [[Knossos]] palace. Minoan [[fresco]]s and [[ceramic]]s depict [[bull-leaping]], in which participants of both sexes vaulted over bulls by grasping their horns.

===Iran===
The [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] texts and traditions of [[Zoroastrianism]] have several different mythological bovine creatures. One of these is [[Gavaevodata]], which is the [[Avestan]] name of a [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] "uniquely created (''-aevo.data'') cow (''gav-'')", one of [[Ahura Mazda]]'s six primordial material creations that becomes the mythological progenitor of all beneficent animal life. Another Zoroastrian mythological bovine is Hadhayans, a gigantic bull so large that it could straddle the mountains and seas that divide the [[Karshvar|seven regions of the earth]], and on whose back men could travel from one region to another. In medieval times, Hadhayans also came to be known as Srīsōk (Avestan *''Thrisaok'', "three burning places"), which derives from a legend in which three [[Fire temple#Legendary Great Fires|"Great Fires"]] were collected on the creature's back. Yet another mythological bovine is that of the unnamed creature in the ''Cow's Lament'', an allegorical hymn attributed to [[Zoroaster]] himself, in which the soul of a bovine (''geush urvan'') despairs over her lack of protection from an adequate herdsman. In the allegory, the cow represents humanity's lack of moral guidance, but in later Zoroastrianism, Geush Urvan became a [[yazata]] representing [[cattle]]. The 14th day of the month is named after her and is under her protection.

===South Asia===
Bulls also appear on seals from the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].

[[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] appears in [[Hindu mythology]] as the primary vehicle and the principal ''gana'' (follower) of [[Shiva]].

In Rig Veda, Indra was often praised as a Bull (Vrsabha – 'vrsa' means he and bha means being or uksan- a bull aged five to nine years, which is still growing or just reached its full growth), with bull being an icon of power and virile strength not just in Aryan literature but in many IE cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1000910/Sanskrit_v_rsabh%C3%A1-_Greek_%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%83%CE%B7%CE%BD_%CE%B5%CF%81%CF%83%CE%B7%CE%BD_the_spraying_bull_of_Indo-European url]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
In [[Cyprus]], bull masks made from real skulls were worn in rites. Bull-masked terracotta figurines&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and Neolithic bull-horned stone altars have been found in Cyprus.

===Levant===
The [[Canaan]]ite (and later [[Carthage|Carthaginian]]) statue to which sacrifices were burnt, either as a deity or a type of sacrifice – [[Moloch]] – was referred to as a horned man, and likened to Cronus by the Romans. There may be a connection between sacrifice to the [[Crete|Cretan]] horned man [[Minotaur]] and Cronus' himself.  Both [[Baʿal]] and [[El (deity)|El]] were associated with the bull in Ugaritic texts, as it symbolized both strength and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Miller |first=Patrick |date=2000 |title=Israelite Religion and Biblical Theology: Collected Essays |publisher=Continuum Int'l Publishing Group |isbn=1-84127-142-X|page=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cronus' son [[Zeus]] was raised on Crete in hiding from his father. Having consumed all of his own children (the gods) Cronus is fed a boulder by Zeus (to represent Zeus' own body so he appears consumed) and an emetic. His vomiting of the boulder and subsequently the other gods (his children) in the [[Titanomachy]] bears comparison with the volcanic eruption that appears to be described in Zeus' battle with Typhon in the ''[[Theogony]]''. Consequently, Cronus may be associated with the eruption of [[Thera]] through the myth of his defeat by Zeus. The later association between Canaanite religions in which child sacrifice took place [http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-25.htm Ezek. 20:25][http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-26.htm -26] and the association of child sacrifice with a horned god (as potentially on Crete and certainly in Carthage) may also be connected with the Greek myth of sending young men and women to the [[Minotaur]], a bull-headed man.

[http://biblelexicon.org/exodus/32-4.htm Exodus 32:4] "He took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt'."

[http://biblelexicon.org/exodus/32-4.htm Nehemiah 9:18] "even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!' They committed terrible blasphemies."

Calf-idols are referred to later in the [[Tanakh]], such as in the [[Book of Hosea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/hosea/10-5.htm |title=Hosea 10:5 The people who live in Samaria fear for the calf-idol of Beth Aven. Its people will mourn over it, and so will its idolatrous priests, those who had rejoiced over its splendor, because it is taken from them into exile |publisher=Bible.cc |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would seem accurate as they were a fixture of near-eastern cultures.

[[Solomon]]'s "[[Molten Sea]]" basin stood on twelve brazen bulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/1_kings/7-25.htm |title=1 Kings 7:25 The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center |publisher=Bible.cc |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/jeremiah/52-20.htm |title=Jeremiah 52:20 The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD, was more than could be weighed |publisher=Bible.cc |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young bulls were set as frontier markers at [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]] and [[Bethel]], the frontiers of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]].

Much later, in [[Abrahamic religions]], the bull motif became a bull [[demon]] or the "horned devil" in contrast and conflict to earlier traditions. The bull is familiar in [[Judeo-Christian]] cultures from the [[Biblical]] episode wherein an [[idolatry|idol]] of the [[golden calf]] (({{lang-he|עֵגֶּל הַזָהָב}}) is made by [[Aaron]] and worshipped by the Hebrews in the wilderness of the Sinai Peninsula ([[Book of Exodus]]). The text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] can be understood to refer to the idol as representing a separate god, or as representing [[Yahweh]] himself, perhaps through an association or [[religious syncretism]] with Egyptian or [[Levant]]ine bull gods, rather than a new deity in itself.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Greece===
[[File:1615 Jordaens Rape of Europa anagoria.JPG|thumb|''The Rape of Europa'', [[Jacob Jordaens]], 1615]]
[[File:The Abduction of Europa, Jean-François de Troy.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of Europa'', [[Jean François de Troy]], 1716]]

Among the [[Twelve Olympians]], [[Hera]]'s [[epithet]] ''Bo-opis'' is usually translated "ox-eyed" Hera, but the term could just as well apply if the goddess had the head of a cow, and thus the epithet reveals the presence of an earlier, though not necessarily more primitive, iconic view. ([[Heinrich Schlieman]], 1976) Classical Greeks never otherwise referred to Hera simply as the cow, though her priestess [[Io (mythology)|Io]] was so literally a heifer that she was stung by a gadfly, and it was in the form of a heifer that [[Zeus]] coupled with her. Zeus took over the earlier roles, and, in the form of a bull that came forth from the sea, abducted the high-born Phoenician [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] and brought her, significantly, to Crete.

[[Dionysus]] was another god of resurrection who was strongly linked to the bull. In a worship hymn from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], at a festival for Hera, [[Dionysus]] is also invited to come as a bull, "with bull-foot raging." "Quite frequently he is portrayed with bull horns, and in [[Cyzicus|Kyzikos]] he has a tauromorphic image," [[Walter Burkert]] relates, and refers also to an archaic myth in which Dionysus is slaughtered as a bull calf and impiously eaten by the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985 pp. 64, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Greeks, the bull was strongly linked to the [[Cretan Bull]]: [[Theseus]] of Athens had to capture the ancient sacred bull of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]] (the ''"Marathonian bull"'') before he faced the [[Minotaur]] (Greek for ''"Bull of Minos"''), who the Greeks imagined as a man with the head of a bull at the center of the [[labyrinth]]. Minotaur was fabled to be born of the Queen and a bull, bringing the king to build the labyrinth to hide his family's shame. Living in solitude made the boy wild and ferocious, unable to be tamed or beaten. Yet [[Walter Burkert]]'s constant warning is, "It is hazardous to project Greek tradition directly into the [[Bronze Age]]."&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985 p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Only one Minoan image of a bull-headed man has been found, a tiny [[Minoan sealstone]] currently held in the Archaeological Museum of [[Chania]].

In the Classical period of Greece, the bull and other animals identified with deities were separated as their ''agalma'', a kind of heraldic show-piece that concretely signified their numinous presence.

===Roman Empire===
[[File:BritishMuseumMithras.jpg|thumb|[[Tauroctony]] of Mithras at the [[British Museum]], London.]]
[[File:FaneBull.jpg|thumb|Bull used as a heraldic crest, here for the Fane family, [[Earls of Westmorland]]. (Great Britain, this example 18th or 19th century, but inherited early 17th century from a much earlier use of the idiom by the [[Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland|Neville]] family).]]

The religious practices of the [[Roman Empire]] of the 2nd to 4th centuries included the ''[[taurobolium]]'', in which a bull was sacrificed for the well being of the people and the state. Around the mid-2nd century, the practice became identified with the worship of [[Magna Mater]], but was not previously associated only with that cult ([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|''cultus'']]). Public taurobolia, enlisting the benevolence of Magna Mater on behalf of the emperor, became common in Italy and Gaul, Hispania and Africa. The last public taurobolium for which there is an inscription was carried out at [[Maktar|Mactar in Numidia]] at the close of the 3rd century. It was performed in honor of the emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]].

Another Roman [[mystery cult]] in which a sacrificial bull played a role was that of the 1st–4th century [[Mithraic Mysteries]]. In the so-called "[[tauroctony]]" artwork of that cult ([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|''cultus'']]), and which appears in all its temples, the god [[Mithras]] is seen to slay a sacrificial bull. Although there has been a great deal of speculation on the subject, the myth (i.e. the "mystery", the understanding of which was the basis of the cult) that the scene was intended to represent remains unknown. Because the scene is accompanied by a great number of astrological allusions, the bull is generally assumed to represent the constellation of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. The basic elements of the tauroctony scene were originally associated with [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the Greek goddess of victory.

[[Macrobius]] lists the bull as an animal sacred to the god [[Neto (deity)|Neto/Neito]], possibly being sacrifices to the deity.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', Book I, XIX&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celts===
A prominent zoomorphic deity type is the divine bull. [[Tarvos Trigaranus]] ("bull with three cranes") is pictured on reliefs from the cathedral at [[Trier]], [[Germany]], and at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] de [[Paris]]. In [[Irish mythology]], the [[Donn Cuailnge]] plays a central role in the epic ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' ("The [[Cattle raiding|Cattle Raid]] of Cooley"), which features the hero [[Cú Chulainn]], which were collected in the seventh century ''[[Lebor na hUidre]]'' ("Book of the Dun Cow").

[[Pliny the Elder]], writing in the first century, describes a religious ceremony in [[Gaul]] in which white-clad [[druid]]s climbed a sacred [[oak]], cut down the [[Viscum album|mistletoe]] growing on it, sacrificed two white bulls and used the mistletoe to cure infertility:&lt;ref name="GreenExploring18-19"&gt;Miranda J. Green. (2005) ''Exploring the world of the druids.'' London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-28571-3}}. Page 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The druids — that is what they call their magicians — hold nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and a tree on which it is growing, provided it is [[Quercus macrolepis|Valonia oak]]…. Mistletoe is rare and when found it is gathered with great ceremony, and particularly on the [[lunar phase|sixth day of the moon]]….Hailing the [[moon]] in a native word that means ‘[[panacea|healing all things]],’ they prepare a ritual [[sacrifice]] and [[banquet]] beneath a tree and bring up two white bulls, whose [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s are bound for the first time on this occasion. A [[priest]] arrayed in white [[vestment]]s climbs the tree and, with a golden [[sickle]], cuts down the mistletoe, which is caught in a white [[cloak]]. Then finally they kill the victims, praying to a [[deity|god]] to render his gift propitious to those on whom he has bestowed it. They believe that mistletoe given in drink will impart fertility to any animal that is barren and that it is an [[antidote]] to all poisons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)]], XVI, 95&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Medieval and modern and other uses==
The practice of [[bullfighting]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[southern France]] are connected with the legends of [[Saturnin]] of [[Toulouse]] and his protégé in [[Pamplona]], [[Fermin]]. These are inseparably linked to bull-sacrifices by the vivid manner of their martyrdoms set by Christian [[hagiography]] in the third century.

In some Christian traditions, [[Nativity scene#Animals in nativity scenes|Nativity scene]]s are carved or assembled at [[Christmas]] time.  Many show a bull or an [[ox]] near the baby [[Jesus]], lying in a manger. Traditional songs of Christmas often tell of the bull and the donkey warming the infant with their breath. This refers (or, at least, is referred) to the beginning of the book of the prophet Isaiah, where he says: "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib." (Isaiah 1:3)

[[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] ([[Latin]] for "the Bull") is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]], which means it is crossed by the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the [[northern hemisphere]]'s winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the [[Early Bronze Age]] when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring [[equinox]]. Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced various bull figures in the mythologies of Ancient [[Sumerian religion|Sumer]], [[Akkadian religion|Akkad]], [[Assyrian religion|Assyria]], [[Babylonian religion|Babylon]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek religion|Greece]], and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Rome]].

In many historical societies, the position of [[kingship]] carries a [[Sacred|sacral]] meaning, that is, it is identical with that of a [[high priest]] and [[judge]]. The concept of [[theocracy]] is related, although a '''sacred king''' need not necessarily rule through his religious authority; rather, the temporal position has a religious significance.

== History ==
[[Sir James George Frazer]] identified - or invented - the concept of the sacred king in his study ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915), the title of which refers to the myth of the [[Rex Nemorensis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.bartleby.com/196/|title= The Golden Bough|last= Frazer|first= James George, Sir|publisher= New York: The Macmillan Co|year= 1922|isbn= |location= Bartleby.com|pages= |at= http://www.bartleby.com/196/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer gives numerous examples, cited below, and was an inspiration for the [[myth and ritual school]].&lt;ref&gt;R Fraser ed., ''The Golden Bough'' (Oxford 2009) p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; However, "the [[myth and ritual]], or myth-ritualist, theory" is disputed;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Myth: A Very Short Introduction|last= Segal|first= Robert A.|publisher= Oxford UP|year= 2004|isbn= |location= Oxford|pages= 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; many scholars now believe that myth and ritual share common [[paradigms]], but not that one developed from the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Poetics of Myth|last= Meletinsky|first= Eleazar Moiseevich|publisher= Routledge|year= 2000|isbn= 0-415-92898-2|location= |pages= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Frazer, the notion has [[prehistoric religion|prehistoric roots]] and occurs worldwide, on [[Java]] as in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], with [[shaman]]-kings credited with [[Rainmaking (ritual)|rainmaking]] and assuring [[Fertile (disambiguation) | fertility]] and good fortune. The king might also be designated to suffer and atone for his people, meaning that the sacral king could be the pre-ordained victim in a [[human sacrifice]], either killed at the end of his term in the position, or sacrificed in a time of crisis (e.g. the [[Blót]] of [[Domalde]]).

The [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] flogged a newly-selected king (''[[Ashantehene]]'') before [[enthronement|enthroning]] him.

From the [[Ancient Near Eastern religion|Bronze Age in the Near East]], the enthronement and [[anointment]] of a [[Monarchy|monarch]] is a central religious ritual, reflected in the titles "[[Messiah]]" or "[[Christ]]", which became separated from worldly kingship. Thus [[Sargon of Akkad]] described himself as "deputy of [[Ishtar]]",{{cn|date=August 2017}} just as the modern [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Pope]] takes the role of the "[[Vicar of Christ]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Vicar of Christ|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings are styled as [[shepherd]]s from earliest times, e.g., the term applied to [[Ensí|Sumerian princes]] such as [[Lugalbanda]] in the 3rd millennium BCE. The image of the shepherd combines the themes of [[leadership]] and the responsibility to supply food and protection, as well as superiority.

As the mediator between the people and the divine, the sacral king was credited with special wisdom (e.g. [[Solomon]] or [[Gilgamesh]]) or vision (e.g. via [[oneiromancy]]).

== Study ==
Study of the concept was introduced by [[Sir James George Frazer]] in his influential book ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915); sacral kingship plays a role in [[Romanticism]] and [[Esotericism]] (e.g. [[Julius Evola]]) and some currents of [[Neopaganism]] ([[Theodism]]).
The school of [[Pan-Babylonianism]] derived much of the religion described in the [[Hebrew Bible]] from cults of sacral kingship in ancient [[Babylonia]].

The so-called British and Scandinavian cult-historical schools maintained that the king personified a god and stood at the center of the national or tribal religion. The English "myth and ritual school" concentrated on anthropology and folklore, while the Scandinavian "Uppsala school" emphasized Semitological study.

=== Frazer's interpretation ===
A sacred king, according to the systematic interpretation of [[mythology]] developed by Frazer in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (published 1890), was a [[monarch|king]] who represented a [[solar deity]] in a periodically re-enacted [[fertility rite]]. Frazer seized upon the notion of a substitute king and made him the keystone of his theory of a universal, pan-[[Europe]]an, and indeed worldwide fertility myth, in which a consort for the [[Goddess]] was annually replaced. According to Frazer, the sacred king represented the spirit of vegetation, a divine [[John Barleycorn]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} He came into being in the spring, reigned during the summer, and ritually died at harvest time, only to be reborn at the [[winter solstice]] to wax and rule again. The spirit of vegetation was therefore a "[[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]]". [[Osiris]], [[Adonis]], [[Dionysus]], [[Attis]] and many other familiar figures from [[Greek mythology]] and [[classical antiquity]] were re-interpreted in this mold. The sacred king, the human embodiment of the dying and reviving vegetation god, was supposed to have originally been an individual chosen to rule for a time, but whose fate was to suffer as a [[sacrifice]], to be offered back to the earth so that a new king could rule for a time in his stead.

Especially in Europe during Frazer's early twentieth century heyday, it launched a [[cottage industry]] of amateurs looking for "[[paganism|pagan]] survivals" in such things as traditional [[fair]]s, [[maypole]]s, and folk arts like [[Morris dance|morris dancing]]. It was widely influential in [[literature]], being alluded to by [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ezra Pound]], and in [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'', among other works.

[[Robert Graves]] used Frazer's work in ''The Greek Myths'' and made it one of the foundations of his own personal mythology in ''[[The White Goddess]]'', and in the fictional ''[[Seven Days in New Crete]]'' he depicted a future in which the institution of a sacrificial sacred King is revived. [[Margaret Murray]], the principal theorist of [[witchcraft]] as a "pagan survival," used Frazer's work to propose the thesis that many [[Kings of England]] who died as kings, most notably [[William II of England|William Rufus]], were secret pagans and [[witch]]es, whose deaths were the re-enactment of the [[human sacrifice]] that stood at the centre of Frazer's myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Divine King in England: a study in anthropology|last=Murray|first=Margaret Alice|publisher=London, Faber &amp; Faber|year=1954|isbn=9780404184285|location=British Library|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An idea used by [[fantasy writer]] [[Katherine Kurtz]] in her novel ''Lammas Night''.

Sahaja Yoga is not only the name of the movement, but also the [[meditation]] technique the movement teaches and the state of awareness that is said to be achieved by the technique.&lt;ref name="WIPO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2001/d2001-0467.html|title=Administrative Panel Decision 'Vishwa Nirmala Dharma a.k.a.

Srivastava described Sahaja Yoga as the pure, universal religion integrating all other religions.&lt;ref name="Coney Socialising Processes" /&gt; She also claimed that she herself was a divine incarnation,&lt;ref name="inform" /&gt; more precisely an incarnation of the Holy Ghost, or the Adi Shakti of the Hindu tradition, the great mother goddess who had come to save humanity.&lt;ref name="Coney Socialising Processes" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is also how she is regarded by most of her devotees.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Fit with other religions==

The teachings, practices and beliefs of Sahaja Yoga are mainly Hindu-based, with a predominance of elements from mystical traditions, as well as local customs of India.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney Socialising Processes" /&gt; There are however important elements of Christian origin, such as the eternal battle between good and evil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney Socialising Processes" /&gt; References to a variety of other religious, spiritual, mystical as well as modern scientific frameworks are also interwoven in Srivastava's teachings, although to a lesser degree.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney Socialising Processes" /&gt;

==Countries where active==

Sahaja Yoga ashrams are present in diverse countries which include the following : [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Kuwait]], [[Nigeria]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States|United States of America]], but are not limited to the aforementioned countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahajayoga.org/worldwidecontacts/|title=Sahaja Yoga Worldwide Contacts - Locate Sahaja Yoga Near You|website=www.sahajayoga.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning of the name ==
The word '[[Sahaja]]' in Sanskrit has two components: 'Saha' meaning 'with you' and 'ja' meaning 'born'.&lt;ref name="inform"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inform.ac/node/8|title=Meditation and Mindfulness|last=INFORM staff|first=|date=|year=|website=INFORM - the information network on religious movements|publisher=|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Dictionary of Buddhism'' gives the literal translation of Sahaja as "innate" and defines it as "denoting the natural presence of enlightenment (bodhi) or purity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2004|title=Sahaja|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Buddhism|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198605607.001.0001/acref-9780198605607-e-1532|isbn=9780191726538}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yoga]] means ''union'' or ''yoking'' and refers to a spiritual path or a state of spiritual absorption. According to a book published by the movement, Sahaja Yoga means ''spontaneous'' and ''born with you'' meaning that the kundalini is born within us and can be awakened spontaneously, without effort.&lt;ref name="Sahaja Yoga Book 1" /&gt;

The term 'Sahaja Yoga' goes back at least to the 15th Century Indian mystic [[Kabir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ray|first=Nihar Ranjan|date=October 2000|title=The concept of 'Sahaj' in Guru Nanak’s theology|url=http://www.sikhreview.org/october2000/theology.htm|journal=The Sikh Review|volume=48|number=562|accessdate=2011-11-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927011616/http://www.sikhreview.org/october2000/theology.htm|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been used to refer to [[Surat Shabd Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sar Bachan: An Abstract of the Teachings of Soami Ji Maharaj, the Founder of the Radha Soami System of Philosophy and Spiritual Science: The Yoga of the Sound Current|publisher=Radha Soami Satsang Beas|others=Translated by Sardar Sewa Singh and Julian P.

In 2000, the term 'Sahaja Yoga' was trademarked in the United States by Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tess2.uspto.gov|title=Sahaja Yoga|publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|work=[[Trademark Electronic Search System]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before starting Sahaja Yoga, its founder Nirmala Srivastava earned a reputation as a faith healer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans, Mystics and Doctors: A Psychological Inquiry into India and Its Healing Traditions|last=Kakar|first=Sudhir|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1982|isbn=0-226-42279-8|location=Chicago|pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a small group of devotees around her, she began spreading her message of Sahaja Yoga in India in the year 1970. As she moved with her husband to London, UK, she continued her work there, and year by year the movement grew and spread throughout Europe, by the mid-80's reaching North America. In 1989, Srivastava made her first trip to Russia and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of American religions|last=Melton|first=J. Gordon|publisher=Gale|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7876-6384-1|edition=8th|location=Detroit|pages=1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Srivastava charged no money, insisting that her lesson was a birthright which should be freely available to all. "There can be no peace in the world until there is peace within," she said.&lt;ref name="funding" &gt;{{cite news |first= Michael |last= Posner |url= http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20110311.OBDEVIATL/BDAStory/BDA/deaths |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |title= Spiritual leader founded Sahaja yoga movement |date= 11 March 2011 |accessdate= 2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
&lt;!-- this isn't in the reference provided Sahaja yogis respect and accept people from all religions and believe that the state achieved through self-realization makes the truth behind all religions apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sahajayoga.org/questionsandanswers/#religions |title= Questions And Answers&amp;nbsp;– Self Realization through Sahaja Yoga |website= sahajayoga.org |publisher= Vishwa Nirmala Dharma |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
Sahaja Yoga beliefs are seen by the organisation as a re-discovered ancient knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sahaja-europe.net/ |title= Home Page |website= sahaja-europe.net |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that should be treated respectfully and scientifically, like a hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahajayoga.org.au/2007/12/05/the-subtle-system-of-sahaja-yoga/ |title=The subtle system of Sahaja Yoga |website=sahajayoga.org.au |date=5 December 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112124757/http://www.sahajayoga.org.au/2007/12/05/the-subtle-system-of-sahaja-yoga/ |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy }}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if found by experiments as truth, should be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.irelandyoga.org/talks/sahaja-yoga-in-detail/ |title= Sahaja Yoga in Detail |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091231061311/http://www.irelandyoga.org/talks/sahaja-yoga-in-detail/ |archivedate= 2009-12-31 |website= irelandyoga.org |publisher= The Life Eternal Trust}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi is considered to be an "avatar" by many of her followers and as a carrier of the divine presence which leads some critics to find the organization as cultic.
&lt;!-- reference incomplete The technique itself is said to be already researched and does not require further development.{{refn|group=n|[[Nirmala Srivastava]] stated at a conference, "I call Sahaja Yoga as meta science because the method of science is not employed in Sahaja Yoga, e. g. in the medical science when we want to search something then we take a hypothesis. We think possibly this might be the solution of a particular disease... Unless we know what are we made of and what is our inner being, and how these diseases are caused, we will not be able to do some thing accurately. Specially allopathic medicines are very heat creating. So we have to take something to neutralise the heat that is also another blind alley, Sahaja Yoga is a meta science. Here you do not have to research anything. It is already researched and we do not have to go working hard for it for years"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Srivastava |first= Nirmala |authorlink= Nirmala Srivastava |work= Doctor's Conference |date= 7 August 1993 |location= Moscow}}{{Full|date=September 2013}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}{{Page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} --&gt; 
Advanced concepts are not generally taught until a beginner is understood to have gained enough knowledge of their own subtle system through actual experience. Without direct experience of the meditation, some people have reported difficulties understanding or proceeding to the more advanced material. Sociologist, Judith Coney, for example, reported facing a challenge in getting behind what she called "the public facade".{{refn|group=n|name= "Socializing_Processes_p214"|Judith Coney wrote in her book ''Sahaja Yoga: Socializing Processes in a South Asian New Religious Movement'', "Finally, throughout the study I faced the challenge of getting Sahaja yogis to let me get behind the public facade. This was achieved with varying degrees of success. On one fortunate occasion, for instance, I attended a national puja, after which there was an extremely frank and revealing discussion of why Sahaja Yoga had been seen as a cult in a particular press article and of the level of secrecy in the group. There I listened to a number of speakers talk about the ways in which they disguised some of their beliefs when in contact with non-members."{{sfn|Coney|1999|p=214}}}} She described Sahaja yogis as adopting a low profile with uncommitted individuals to avoid unnecessary conflict.&lt;ref name=children_in_new_religions&gt;{{cite book |first= Judith |last= Coney |chapter= |title= Children in New Religions |editor1-first= Susan J. |editor1-last= Palmer |editor2-first= Charlotte |editor2-last= Hardman |publisher= [[Rutgers University Press]] |year= 1999 |pages= |isbn= 9780813526201 |ref= {{SfnRef|Coney|1999b}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sahaja Yoga also states that spreading Sahaja Yoga techniques should be free for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sahajayoga.org.uk/ |title= Sahaja Yoga Meditation |website= sahajayoga.org.uk |accessdate= 2011-03-19|publisher= Life Eternal Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Coney observed that the movement tolerates a variety of world views and levels of commitment with some practitioners choosing to remain on the periphery.{{sfn|Coney|1999|p=}}

===The Subtle System – Chakras and Nadis===
[[File:DiagrammaChakraKundalini.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Chakra Kundalini Diagram]]
Sahaja Yoga believes that in addition to our physical body there is a [[subtle body]] composed of [[nadis]] (channels) and [[chakras]] (energy centres). There is no biomedical evidence of chakras.&lt;ref name= "Shermer 2002"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]] |publisher= ABC-CLIO |isbn= 9781576076538|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA538 538] |editor-last= Shermer |editor-first= Michael |editor-link= Michael Shermer |volume= 1 |year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar writes that [[Nirmala Srivastava]]'s additions to this widespread traditional '[[tantra|tantric]]' model include giving it a scientific, neurological veneer, an elaboration of the health aspects and an introduction of notions of traditional Christian morality.{{refn|group=n|Sudhir Kakar wrote in his book ''Shamans, Mystics and Doctors'', "Essentially, Mataji's model of the human psyche is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} the traditional tantric and hatha yoga notions of the subtle body, with its 'nerves' and 'centers,' and fuelled by a pervasive 'subtle energy' that courses through both the human and the divine, through the body and the cosmos. Mataji's contributions to this ancient model are not strikingly original: as a former medical student she has sought to give it a scientific, neurological veneer; as a former faith healer, she has elaborated upon those aspects of the model that are concerned with sickness and health; as someone born into an Indian Christian family she has tried to introduce notions of traditional Christian morality into an otherwise amoral Hindu view of the psyche."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kakar |first= Sudhir |year= 1984 |title= Shamans, Mystics and Doctors: A Psychological Inquiry into India and Its Healing Traditions |isbn= 0226422798 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=b_EBs3A7Z1YC&amp;pg=PA196 196] |publisher= [[University of Chicago Press]] |ref= {{SfnRef|Kakar|1984}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Nirmala Srivastava equates the Sushumna [[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]] with the parasympathetic nervous system, the Ida nadi with the left and the Pingala nadi with the right sides of the sympathetic nervous system.

===Kundalini, Self-Realization and vibratory awareness===
Sahaja Yoga believes that the [[chakras]] can be balanced by awakening the [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]] in the [[sacrum|sacrum bone]], which is conceived of as a normally dormant 'mother' energy. [[Nirmala Srivastava]] has said that the kundalini is the reflection within us of the [[Holy Spirit]] or Adi (Primordial) [[Shakti]]. She has said that kundalini "is the desire of God.... and the desire of God is the [[Shakti]]"&lt;ref name="sahajayoga1"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url= http://www.sahajayoga.com.au/book_one/ch-3-the-instrument/ |title= Sahaja Yoga Intro Book |chapter= Ch. 3: The Instrument |website= Sahajayoga.com.au |accessdate= 2011-03-19}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[yoga]] is impossible without kundalini awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tnmeditation.org/ |title= Sahaja Yoga-Tamil Nadu: Meditation |website= tnmeditation.org |accessdate= 2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the kundalini rises through these centres, the qualities of the chakras are said to begin manifesting spontaneously. Most illnesses are said to be a result of damage to the chakras, and kundalini is said to repair them.&lt;ref name="sahajayoga1"/&gt;

According to Sahaja Yoga, once the [[sahasrara]] (topmost) chakra is pierced by the kundalini, a person will feel a cool breeze on top of their head and/or on their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sahajayoga.org/whatissy/kundalini_self_realization.asp |title= Kundalini And Self Realization |website= sahajayoga.org |publisher= Vishwa Nirmala Dharma |accessdate= 2011-03-19}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chakras and nadis are believed by Sahaja Yoga to have associated places on the hands. Sensations of heat or coolness in the hands, head and/or body are used to make purported diagnoses of imbalances in the different chakras and nadis.&lt;ref name="sahajayoga2"&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.sahajayoga.com.au/book_one/ch-2-the-experience/ |title= Sahaja Yoga Intro Book |chapter= Ch. 2: The Experience |website= Sahajayoga.com.au |accessdate= 2011-03-19 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110217203539/http://www.sahajayoga.com.au/book_one/ch-2-the-experience/ |archivedate= 17 February 2011 |df= dmy-all }}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.sahajayoga.com.au/literature/SAHAJA%20YOGA%20Book%20One%20-%20Sahaja%20Yoga%204.html |title= Sahaja Yoga Intro Book |chapter= Ch. 4: The Nadis |website= sahajayoga.com.au |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930015849/http://www.sahajayoga.com.au/literature/SAHAJA%20YOGA%20Book%20One%20-%20Sahaja%20Yoga%204.html |archivedate=2011-09-30}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sahajayoga.ca/ChakraPresentation/subtlesystem.htm |title= Subtle System |website= Sahajayoga.ca |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sensations (referred to as 'vibrations') are interpreted in Sahaja Yoga as indicating [[Self-Realization]] or an "encounter with Reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahajayoga.org.in/SelfRealization.asp |title=Sahaja Yoga&amp;nbsp;– Self Realization |website= Sahajayoga.org.in |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vibrations sensed are believed to be an objective divine energy that can even be caught on camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahajayoga.org/divine_energy.asp |title=Shri Mataji Radiates A Divine Energy |website=sahajayoga.org |publisher=Vishwa Nirmala Dharma |accessdate=2011-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203161703/http://www.sahajayoga.org/divine_energy.asp |archivedate=3 December 2011 |df=dmy }}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Sahaja Yoga belief is that upon self-realization, the practitioner may also experience thoughtless awareness (Nirvichar [[Samādhi]]).&lt;ref name=syintro /&gt;

==Organization==
'''Vishwa Nirmala Dharma''' (trans: Universal Pure Religion, also known as '''Sahaja Yoga International''') is the organizational part of the movement. It is a registered organisation in countries such as Colombia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mininteriorjusticia.gov.co/adminFiles/REGISTRO%20PUBLICO%20ENTIDADES%20RELIGIOSAS%2030-06-2004%20.xls |title= Registro Publico Entidades Religiosas 30-06-2004 |trans-title= Public Registry of Religious Entities |publisher= [[Ministry of the Interior and Justice (Colombia)|Ministry of the Interior and Justice]]: Republic of Colombia |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010408/http://www.mininteriorjusticia.gov.co/adminFiles/REGISTRO%20PUBLICO%20ENTIDADES%20RELIGIOSAS%2030-06-2004%20.xls |archivedate= 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States of America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/b5ngo.htm |title= List of ECOSOC/Beijing and New Accredited NGOs that attended the special session of the General Assembly |website= un.org |publisher= [[United Nations]] |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71367.htm |title= Austria - 2006 Report on International Religious Freedom |publisher= [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]: [[United States Department of State|US Dept. of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is registered as a religion in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahajayoga.org/swan/view/swan_526_2006.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910213600/http://www.sahajayoga.org/swan/view/swan_526_2006.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 September 2012 |title=Religion in Spain |website=sahajayoga.org |publisher=Vishwa Nirmala Dharma |department=Sahaja Worldwide News and Announcements (SWAN) |date=19 July 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--source shows the legal documents --&gt;

In addition to directly promoting Sahaja Yoga, the council promotes Sahaja culture, runs schools, a health centre, a youth movement, and a project for the rehabilitation of "destitute women and orphaned children".

=== Membership statistics ===
There are no available statistical data about Sahaja Yoga membership. In 2001, the number of core members worldwide were estimated to 10,000, in addition to which around 100,000 practitioners more or less in the periphery were estimated to be found.&lt;ref name="inform" /&gt; There are varying reports about the movement's distribution worldwide. According to the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja Yoga World Foundation, Sahaja Yoga centers are established in over 95 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shrimataji.org/site/life/biography-from-nirmala-srivastava-to-shri-mataji.html|title=From Nimala Srivastava to Shri Mataji|last=Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja Yoga World Foundation|first=|date=2017-05-07|website=Shri Mataji: A Life Dedicated to Humanity|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a news article in Indian Express published on the occasion of Srivastava's death in 2011, however, Sahaja Yoga centers were told to be found in over 140 countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Yuvashakti===
Sahaja Yoga's youth movement is called "Yuvashakti" (also "Nirmal Shakti Yuva Sangha"), from the Sanskrit words Yuva (Youth) and [[Shakti]] (Power).

The movement is active in forums such as the World Youth Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.youthlink.org/globalguide.pdf |title= Guide to the Global Youth Movement |website= youthlink.org |editor-first= Jonah |editor-last= Wittkamper |year= 2002 |publisher= Global Youth Action Network |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051222200027/http://www.youthlink.org/globalguide.pdf |archivedate= 2005-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TakingITGlobal]] which aim at discussing global issues, and ways of solving them.

The Yuvashakti participated in the 2000 "Civil Society &amp; Governance Project"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ids.ac.uk/ids/civsoc/final/india/ind7.doc |title= Case Study Civil Society &amp; Governance Project |date=February 2000 |first= Vinita |last= Tatke |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040103160620/http://www.ids.ac.uk/ids/civsoc/final/india/ind7.doc |archivedate= 2004-01-03 |accessdate= 6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they were "instrumental in reaching out to women from the poor communities and providing them with work".

===Vishwa Nirmal Prem ashram===
The ''Vishwa Nirmala Prem Ashram'' is a not-for profit project by the NGO '''Vishwa Nirmala Dharma''' (Sahaja Yoga International) located in Noida, [[Delhi]], [[India]], opened in 2003. The ashram is a "facility where women and girls are rehabilitated by being taught meditation and other skills that help them overcome trauma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-11-16/edit-page/27827906_1_girls-drunken-man-mother  |title= A New Childhood |first= Arshiya |last= Khanna |newspaper= [[The Times of India]] |date= 16 Nov 2006 |accessdate= 2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|magazine=Blossom Times |volume=1 |issue=3 |date=31 August 2007 |url=http://www.blossomtimes.org/site/pdf/BlossomTimes_issue3.pdf |title=An interview with Gisela Matzer |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926011530/http://www.blossomtimes.org/site/pdf/BlossomTimes_issue3.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
The methods for practising Sahaja Yoga are made available free of charge to those interested. According to the official Sahaja Yoga website there is a fee for attending international [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s to cover costs and voluntary [[dakshina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahajayoga.org/swan/view/swan_358_2005.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120915070213/http://www.sahajayoga.org/swan/view/swan_358_2005.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 September 2012 |title=Puja/Dakshina Costs |website=sahajayoga.org |publisher=Vishwa Nirmala Dharma |department=Sahaja Worldwide Announcements and News (SWAN) |date=20 July 2005 |accessdate=2011-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author [[David V. Barrett]], "Shri Mataji neither charged for her lectures nor for her ability to give Self Realization, nor does one have to become a member of this organisation. She insisted that one cannot pay for enlightenment and she continued to denounce the [[false self]]-proclaimed 'gurus' who are more interested in the seekers' purse than their spiritual ascent".  However, the movement had been criticised because of encouragement of its members to make donations to pay the travel charges for Mataji's visits to their respective countries.&lt;ref name=barrett&gt;{{cite book |last= Barrett |first= David V. |authorlink= David V. Barrett |title= The New Believers |publisher= Cassell |year= 2001 |isbn= 0304355925 |pages= 297–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--this isn't a refutation to the previous line
Sahaja Yoga leaders have denied this, pointing out that their group is  recognised in both the US and Russia, that all members are free to come and go as they please. They admit that members are asked for voluntary contributions to events and projects, but that the money does not go to the founder herself. A current member of 25 years said: "All the organisation owns is a few properties in various countries. If we were into making money, that would be a pretty feeble return."&lt;ref name=eveningstandard/&gt; --&gt;

==Cult allegations and refutations==

Judith Coney found that most people who leave the movement voluntarily still had positive things to say about it.{{refn|group=n|name="Socializing_Processes_p214"}}{{sfn|Coney|1999|p=184}} A smaller group of ex-members have made complaints against the movement which have been reported in the press. In 2001, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that certain ex-members say "that Sahaja Yoga is a cult which aims to control the minds of its members" and ex-members claim that the organisation insists all family ties are broken and all communication with them cease. The article further details a number of beliefs - including that crying children are possessed by daemons, that negative and positive vibrations need 'clearing', advocates husbands slapping their spouses and hides many of the more occult practices from new members - including the high costs for participating in rituals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/shri-who-must-be-obeyed-9263416.html|title=Shri who must be obeyed|date=2001-07-13|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]'' reported that some critics who feel that the group is a cult have started their own websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NzMxNTk4 |title=Hundreds fill weekend with devotion, bliss |newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]] |first=John |last=Chadwick |date=24 July 2005 |location=[[Bergen County, New Jersey]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320154926/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NzMxNTk4 |archivedate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, Sahaja yogis in one centre reflected on the ways in which some of their beliefs are disguised when in contact with non-members. Coney described this discussion as a "frank and revealing".{{refn|group=n|name="Socializing_Processes_p214"}}

A 2008 court case in Brussels ruled that Sahaja Yoga had been wrongly labelled as a cult by a Belgian state authority and awarded the group compensation.&lt;ref name= "HRWF2008"&gt;{{Cite conference |last1= Fautré |first1= Willy |last2= [[Human Rights Without Frontiers]] (HRWF) |title= Religious intolerance in the OSCE space |conference= OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting: Working Session 10: Tolerance and Non-discrimination |publisher= [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) |date= 6 October 2008 |location= Warsaw |page= |ref= {{SfnRef|Fautré, HRWF|2008}} |url= http://www.osce.org/odihr/34018?download=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sahaja Yoga is geen sekte |url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/989/Binnenland/article/detail/255219/2008/04/25/Sahaja-Yoga-is-geen-sekte.dhtml |newspaper=[[De Morgen]] |date=22 July 2008 |trans-title=Sahaja Yoga is not a cult |language=Dutch |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Auteur: jav |url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=dmf20062006_009 |trans-title= Sahaja Yoga is not a cult |title= Sahaja Yoga is geen sekte |newspaper= [[De Standaard]] |language= nl |date=19 June 2006 |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''[[De Morgen]]'' reported that the Belgian Department of State Security monitors how often politicians are contacted and lobbied by organisations. The list of organisations includes Sahaja Yoga, as well as [[Scientology]] and [[The Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= [[De Morgen]] |title= Staatsveiligheid houdt Wetstraat in de gaten |trans-title= State keeps an eye Wetstraat |first1= Buxant |last1= Martin |first2= Steven |last2= Samyn |date= 2 February 2013 |url= http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/989/Binnenland/article/detail/1572744/2013/02/02/Staatsveiligheid-houdt-Wetstraat-in-de-gaten.dhtml |language= nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, The ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' reported that Sahaja Yoga has been "described as a dangerous cult" and "has a dissident website created by former members". The reporter, John Crace, wrote about an event he attended and noted that a Sahaja Yoga representative asked him to feel free to talk to whomever he wanted. He remarked, "Either their openness is a PR [[charm offensive]], or they genuinely have nothing to hide." He proposed that "one of the key definitions of a cult is the rigour with which it strives to recruit new members" and concluded that there was no aggressive recruitment squeeze.&lt;ref name=eveningstandard&gt;{{cite news |title= Monday night with the divine mother |newspaper= [[London Evening Standard]] |date= 18 July 2001 |first= John |last= Crace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 [[INFORM]] leaflet says that the emphasis on complete devotion has led to problems and controversy. There is a culture amongst a minority of Sahaja yogis to believe that those who deviate in particular ways may be possessed by 'negativity' or may be said to be mentally abnormal. Those who fight the pressure to follow the Guru's suggestions and radically change their lifestyle risk being expelled. It is claimed that this may bring problems for those who still believe in the power of the Guru and fear 'losing vibrations'.&lt;ref name="inform" /&gt; This expulsion is not enforced but is something understood socially and other yogis are not expected to change the way they react to those who have been expelled. It is also not a permanent expulsion; there have been cases of returning Sahaja yogis following brief periods 'out'.

[[David V. Barrett]] wrote that some former members say that they were expelled from the movement because they "resisted influence that Mataji had over their lives". According to Barrett, the movement's founder's degree of control over members' lives has given rise to concerns.&lt;ref name=barrett/&gt; The Austrian Ministry for Environment, Youth and Family states that "Sahaja Yoga" regards Nirmala Srivastava as an authority who cannot be questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Sekten!

==Sahaja meditation and associated research==

In the [[meditation]] practice of the Sahaja movement the focus is on thoughts ceasing.
&lt;ref&gt;"...real meditation, which is a state of thoughtless awareness" http://www.sahajayogaportal.org/en/meditation/how-to-meditate.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sahajdhyana.blogspot.co.uk/p/four-meditations-guided-by-shri-mataji.html|title=Four meditations guided by Shri Mataji.|website=sahajdhyana.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;"How to do meditation, many people ask. Don’t do anything, to just go into thoughtless awareness. Try to go to the thoughtless awareness. If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness, you’ve done your job, because that’s the point where you are with the truth, with the reality, with the joy, with everything that is so fundamental." https://tricitiesmeditation.com/founder/on-thoughtless-awareness/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;"Mentally, you may initially find that your thoughts wander to the past or are planning future events. Try to watch them and let them go. Some time later, you can get to the interval between two thoughts and reach a state of deep meditation, that is, complete thoughtlessness." https://sahajayogaarmenia.wordpress.com/meditation-armenia/&lt;/ref&gt;

A study comparing practitioners of Sahaja Yoga meditation with a group of non-meditators doing a simple relaxation exercise measured a drop in skin temperature in the meditators compared to a rise in skin temperature in the non-meditators as they relaxed. The researchers noted that all other meditation studies that have observed skin temperature have recorded increases and none has recorded a decrease in skin temperature. This suggests that Sahaja Yoga meditation, being a mental silence approach, may differ both experientially and physiologically from simple relaxation.&lt;ref name="Manocha et al"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manocha |first1=Ramesh |last2=Black |first2=Deborah |last3=Spiro |first3=David |last4=Ryan |first4=Jake |last5=Stough |first5=Con |date=March 2010 |title=Changing Definitions of Meditation – Is there a Physiological Corollary?

&lt;ref&gt;One study has led to suggestions that Sahaja meditation involves 'switching off' irrelevant brain networks for the maintenance of focused internalized attention and inhibition of inappropriate information.

[[File:Lupinus pilosus (Zachi Evenor for Wiki).jpg|thumb|right|Blue Lupines at Tel Socho]]
'''Sokho''', alternate spellings: '''Sokhoh''', '''Sochoh''', '''Soco''', '''Sokoh''', Hebrew: שוכה ,שוכו ,שכה, is the name given to two ancient towns in the territorial domain of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], the remains of both having been identified.  

Both towns were given the name ''Shuweikah'' in Arabic, a diminutive of the Arabic ''shawk'', "thorn." One is located to the south of [[Hebron]] and has been identified with the twin ruins known as ''Khirbet Shuwaikah Fauka'' and ''Tahta'' (Upper and Lower Shuwaikah), 6 km southwest of [[As-Samu|Eshtamoa]] in the Hebron Hills district ({{Bibleref2|Joshua 15:48}}). The other ruin is the more popular of the two, situated on a hilltop overlooking the [[Valley of Elah|Elah Valley]] between [[Adullam]] and [[Azekah]] ({{Bibleref2|Joshua 15:35}}), in the lower stratum of the [[Judean Hills|Judaean hills]]. The site, occupied as early as the Iron Age, was visited by [[Claude Conder]] in 1881, who writes that it was already a ruin in his days, with two wells in the valley towards the west.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 410 in: {{cite book|last1=Conder|first1=C.R.|authorlink1=Claude Reignier Conder|last2=Kitchener|first2=H.H.|authorlink2=Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|year=1883|url=https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/410/mode/2up|title=The Survey of Western Palestine: Memoirs of the Topography, Orography, Hydrography, and Archaeology|location=London|publisher=[[Palestine Exploration Fund|Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund]]|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third town by this name, [[ Shuwaykah]], was located in the Hefer region ({{Bibleref2|1 Kings 4:10}}), north of [[Tulkarm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Klein (scholar)|S. Klein]], ''Qovetz'': Journal of the Jewish Palestinian Exploration Society, 2nd year, volumes 1–4, article: ''On the Kings of Canaan'' (Heb. לפרשת מלכי כנען), Jerusalem 1934–1935, p. 41 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
Although listed in Joshua 15:35 as being a city in the plain, it is actually partly in the hill country, partly in the plain. The [[Philistines]] encamped between Sokho and Azekah in the [[Valley of Elah|Elah Valley]] before [[Goliath]]'s historic encounter with [[David]], the son of Jesse ({{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 17:1}}). David slew the Philistine giant with a stone slung from a shepherd's sling. [[Rehoboam]] fortified the place ({{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 11:7}}), but it is not clear which of the two sites is referred to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution= |title= The Anchor Bible Dictionary|editor-last1=Freedman |editor-first1=David Noel |editor-last2= |editor-first2=  |editor-link= David Noel Freedman|volume= 6 |publisher= |place =New York|page=s.v. Socho |year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socho was one of the cities occupied temporarily by the Philistines in the time of [[Ahaz]] ({{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 28:18}}).

The word "Sokho" appears on certain [[LMLK seal]]s during the [[Kingdom of Judah|Judean monarchy]], believed by many scholars to be one of four cities that acted in some administrative capacity.

The [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] [[Rabbi]] [[Antigonus of Sokho]], mentioned in ''Ethics of the Fathers'' ([[Pirkei Avot]] 1:3), likely came from the Hebron-region town. Rabbi Levi Sukia, of the first generation of [[Amoraim]], also came from Sokho (Jerusalem Talmud, Eruvim).

In [[Byzantine]] times, [[Eusebius]] described  Sokho (Σοκχωθ) as a double village at the ninth milestone between [[Eleutheropolis]] (Bet Guvrin) and Jerusalem (Eusebius, Onom. 156:18 ff.), which would correspond to the Elah Valley location. The 6th-century [[Madaba Map]] also depicts Sokho (Σωκω).

==Givat HaTurmusim==
{{main|Socoh (Shephelah)}}
[[File:Cave-like cistern at Tel-Socho (Khirbet Shuweikah) - 2 Feb. 2015.JPG|thumb|Ancient cistern at Tel Socho]]

The hill of Tel Sokho is now known as "''Givat HaTurmosim''," or "Hill of the [[Lupinus pilosus|Lupines]]."  In late March, the entire hill is covered with wild blue Mountain lupines (''[[Lupinus pilosus]]'') and becomes a popular outing destination for Israeli families. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000096482.htm The Valley of Elah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208155727/http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000096482.htm |date=2006-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The hill is surrounded by precipitous slopes on its north side, making it almost impassable. Trails ascend the mountain on its northwestern side and southeastern sides. The [[Valley of Elah|Elah Valley]] runs in a westerly-easterly direction on its north side, the hilltop affording a good view of the valley below. 
On the elevated plateau, one can see the foundations of ancient dwellings carved into the bedrock with individual chambers divided by broken stone protuberances. Caves and grottos dot the landscape, and cisterns are carved deep into the rock. Oak trees, fig trees and terebinths grow on the mountainside and piles of large ashlar boulders, covered with lichen, attest to the presence of a defensive wall around the city in antiquity. According to the biblical narrative, when [[Joshua]] captured the city from the Canaanites, the city and environs became the inheritance of Judah.
==Archaeology==
Excavations at the foot of the northern slope exposed a Byzantine building from the fifth–sixth centuries. Remains from Iron Age II were uncovered in another dig at the foot of the northern slope, and walls dating to the Middle Bronze Age were discovered in probe trenches. Potsherds dating to the Late Bronze Age and later periods were gathered, along with a terracotta figurine of reddish brown clay depicting a naked woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=1728 Israel Antiquities Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of a preëxilic stamp with the imprint ''[[LMLK seal|La-melekh]]'' ('''למלך''') and where Sokho is named with another three cities has led archaeologists to conclude that Sokho may have served as an administrative or storage center. One of the wells to the west in the valley, mentioned by Claude Conder, was destroyed with explosives by Arab infiltrators (''mistanenim'') in 1956, never being rebuilt.  An intensive survey conducted in 2010 included an examination of Middle Bronze and Iron Age burial caves, as well as slag from a pottery workshop (which probably dates to the Crusader/Mamluk period).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Hasel, Michael G. |author2=Garfinkel, Yosef | author3=Weiss, Shifra |title=Socoh of the Judean Shephelah: The 2010 Survey | publisher=Eisenbrauns Inc. | location=Winona Lake, Indiana | date=2017 | isbn=9781575067667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sophia''''' is an academic journal devoted to professional pursuits in [[philosophy, metaphysics]], [[religion]] and moral thinking, founded in 1962 by Max Charlesworth and Graeme de Graaf. From 2001 Sophia was published by [[Ashgate Publishing]] in collaboration with the Australasian Society for Philosophy of Religion and Theology, and Australasian Society for Asian and Comparative Philosophy (University of Melbourne and Deakin University respectively). The journal has since moved to [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] in Dordrecht, with its editorial office split between Melbourne, Australia and both coasts of the United States. The Editors-in-Chief are [[Purushottama Bilimoria]], [[Patrick Hutchings]], and [[Jay Garfield]].

Together with the [[Australasian Journal of Philosophy]], it is one of the most prominent Australasian (meaning, Australia, New Zealand, The Pacific, Singapore, &amp; H K) journals in the areas of philosophy, ethics and religion It prides itself in its rigorously scholarly profile, which is reflected in the international composition of its editorial board and the diverse philosophical traditions in which its contributors work, ranging from analytic, continental, to Asian/cross-cultural, feminist and indigenous concerns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6068">A '''sports chaplain''' provides [[pastoral care]] for the [[sportsperson|sports person]] and the broader [[sports]] community including the [[Coach (sport)|coach]]es, administrators and their families.

[[Chaplain]]s to sports communities have existed since the middle of the 20th century and have significantly grown in the past 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] have well established [[Christian]] sports chaplaincy [[Christian ministry|ministries]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982 a congress held in [[Hong Kong]] on sports [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] saw sports chaplains and those interested in Mission to people engaged in sports come together from around the world including recognised representatives from North and South America, [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the sub-continent and [[Australasia]]. It was this congress that created the inspiration to further develop or initiate national sports missions and sports chaplains.   

Sports chaplains consist of people from many different walks of life. Most commonly, the chaplains are ministers or full-time Christian workers but always, chaplaincy work is done without charge or any financial remuneration.  Often, sports chaplains to a particular sport are former participants of that sport.  This helps the chaplain to not only provide spiritual support and guidance to a player, but gives them the ability to empathize and relate to some of the challenges facing the participant with whom they are ministering.

There were 193 multi-faith sports chaplains at the London 2012 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
The USA have various sport related chaplaincy organizations. Along with major Denominations, Ministries such as [[Athletes in Action]] and [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]] also provide chaplains to various sports at the [[college athletics|collegiate]] and [[professional sports|professional]] levels.  Every major professional sport in the United States has at least some sports chaplaincy. Some sports are more coordinated, like Major League Baseball (see www.baseballchapel.org), but most are far more loosely structured with each chaplain having a program that best suits their team and individual situation.  Every [[MLB]], [[NFL]], [[NBA]] &amp; [[Major League Soccer]] franchise has a chaplain.  Due to financial constraints, very few chaplains travel with their teams.  In some cases, especially when an individual coach understands the value of the chaplain to their team, the coach may invite the chaplain to come on a road trip.  This happens far more frequently when a team is traveling a short distance to a neighboring city by bus or motor coach, but in some cases, coaches have paid (out of their own pocket) to bring a chaplain on a road trip. 

In recent years, much more work is being done by chaplains in specific sports to coordinate and work together so that their players can have support and encouragement from a chaplain even when they are “on the road”. 

In addition, the US Olympic Team travels with one or more chaplains, primarily to provide emotional support to the athletes.

== United Kingdom ==
Sports Chaplaincy UK, formerly known as SCORE was established in 1991 under the guidance and direction of the [[Baptist Union of Great Britain]] to use the specialist experience of one of their ministers to pioneer sports chaplaincy and sports ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Called Sports Chaplaincy UK since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk/about-us/history/&lt;/ref&gt; the Christian charity seeks to resource over 250&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; chaplains in a variety of sports and situations. Their chaplains are mainly in [[association football|football]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[cricket]] and [[horseracing]].  They supplied over 40 chaplains to serve at the [[London2012]]  [[Olympics]].  All offer pastoral and spiritual support in a sensitive, non-judgement, non-sectarian way. All work with integrity and professionalism amongst the whole community of their clubs - the players, coaches, organisation and support staff. There is a real sense of affirmation and endorsement from the widest spectrum of the sports world, from the chaplains' work and involvement.

== Australia ==
As a direct result of the Hong Kong 1982 Congress on Sports Mission, pioneered by [[Mark Tronson]], the Australian Heads of Churches approved a Sports Chaplaincy mission, which was named the 'Sports and Leisure Ministry' (SLM). It was initially housed within the well established InterChurch Trade and Industry Mission (ITIM). In 1985 Australian Heads of Churches gave SLM its independence and in 1987 its Heads of Churches appointed board members adopted [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]]. In 2000 Heads of Churches released its founder, Mark Tronson, to establish Well-Being Australia, specialising in athlete [[respite care|respite]]. Five years later in 2005 SLM changed its name to Sports Chaplaincy Australia (SCA). 

As a result of its solid foundation under Australian Heads of Churches, SLM (now SCA) has seen many professional sports in [[Australia]] adopt sport chaplains. Over 180 chaplains now serve in sports and sport organizations such as [[cricket]], [[motor racing]], [[tennis]], [[rugby league]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[soccer]], [[golf]], [[yachting]], [[skiing]], [[netball]], [[rodeo]] and [[horse racing]], the [[Australian Institute of Sport]], and State Institutes of Sport.

[[File:Shiva Musée Guimet 22971.jpg|thumb|A Cambodian [[Shiva]] head showing a third eye.]]
The '''third eye''' (also called the '''mind's eye''', or '''inner eye''') is a mystical and [[esoteric]] concept of a speculative invisible eye which provides perception beyond ordinary sight.&lt;ref name=MMM&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Myth and Magic&amp;nbsp;– Volume 19|year=1994|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York, NY|isbn=0839360355|page=2606|editor=Richard Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious overview==
In certain dharmic spiritual traditions the third eye refers to the [[ajna]] (or brow) [[chakra]].&lt;ref name=Saraswati&gt;{{cite book|last=Saraswati|first=Swami Satyananda Saraswati|title=Kundalini iuuuggTantra|year=2001|publisher=Yoga I Publications Trust|location=Bihar, India|isbn=978-8185787152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third eye refers to the gate that leads to inner realms and spaces of [[higher consciousness]]. In [[New Age]] spirituality, the third eye often [[symbol]]izes a state of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] or the evocation of [[mental image]]s having deeply personal [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[psychological]] significance. The third eye is often associated with [[vision (religion)|religious visions]], [[clairvoyance]], the ability to observe [[chakra]]s and [[aura (paranormal)|auras]],&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Chakras'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA:1927 Theosophical Publishing House Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[precognition]], and [[out-of-body experience]]s. People who are claimed to have the capacity to utilize their third eyes are sometimes known as ''seers''.  In [[Hinduism]], the third eye is said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows. 

In [[Taoism]] and many traditional Chinese religious sects such as Chan (called [[Zen]] in Japanese), "third eye training" involves focusing attention on the point between the eyebrows with the eyes closed, and while the body is in various [[qigong]] postures. The goal of this training is to allow students to tune into the correct "vibration" of the universe and gain a solid foundation on which to reach more advanced meditation levels. Taoism teaches that the third eye, also called the [[mind's eye]], is situated between the two physical eyes, and expands up to the middle of the forehead when opened. Taoism claims that the third eye is one of the main energy centers of the body located at the sixth [[Chakra]], forming a part of the main meridian, the line separating left and right hemispheres of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The doctrine of the elixir by R.B. Jefferson Coombe Springs Press 1982 chapter 4. The Archaic Anatomy of Individual Organs.&lt;/ref&gt; In Taoist alchemical traditions, the third eye is the frontal part of the "Upper Dan Tien" (upper cinnabar field) and is given the evocative name "muddy pellet".

According to the Christian teaching of Father [[Richard Rohr]], the concept of the third eye is a metaphor for non-dualistic thinking; the way the mystics see. In Rohr's concept, mystics employ the first eye (sensory input such as sight) and the second eye (the eye of reason, meditation, and reflection), "but they know not to confuse knowledge with depth, or mere correct information with the transformation of consciousness itself. The mystical gaze builds upon the first two eyes—and yet goes further." Rohr refers to this level of awareness as "having the mind of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Rohr, Richard "The Naked Now: Learning to See as the Mystics See", The Crossroad Publishing Company, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8245-2543-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8245-2543-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[H.P. Blavatsky]]&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Blavatsky, ''[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd-hp.htm The Secret Doctrine]'', Vol. 2, 1888, {{ISBN|1-55700-124-3}}, pp. 289-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the third eye is in fact the partially dormant [[pineal gland]], which resides between the two hemispheres of the brain. [[Reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s sense light via a third [[parietal eye]]—a structure associated with the pineal gland—which serves to regulate their [[circadian rhythm]]s, and for navigation, as it can sense the polarization of light. [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claimed that by extending an "etheric tube" from the third eye, it is possible to develop microscopic and telescopic vision.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"/&gt;  It has been asserted by Stephen Phillips that the third eye's microscopic vision is capable of observing objects as small as [[quark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Stephen ''Extrasensory Perception of Quarks'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA 1980 Theosophical Publishing House {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0227-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this belief, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye in the back of the head with a physical and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland.&lt;ref name="Helena Petrovna Blavatsky 1993"&gt;Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'' vol. II, (Wheaton, IL: Theosophical Publishing House, 1993), 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Rick Strassman]] has hypothesized that the pineal gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] (dimethyltryptamine), an [[entheogen]] which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death.&lt;ref name="strassman"&gt;{{cite book |title=DMT: The Spirit Molecule. A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences |last=Strassman |first=Rick J. |authorlink=Rick Strassman |year=2001 |publisher=Park Street |location=Rochester, Vt |isbn=978-0-89281-927-0}} ({{cite web | url=http://rickstrassman.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=60 | title=Chapter summaries | accessdate=27 February 2012}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
The use of the phrase ''mind's eye'' does not imply that there is a single or unitary place in the mind or brain where visual consciousness occurs.  Philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]] have critiqued this view.&lt;ref&gt;''Consciousness Explained'', Daniel C. Dennett, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1991.  {{ISBN|0-316-18065-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others, such as [[Johnjoe McFadden]] of the [[University of Surrey]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the New Zealand-based neurobiologist [[Susan Pockett]],  propose that the brain's [[electromagnetic field]] is consciousness itself, thus causing the perception of a unitary location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unisci.com/stories/20022/0516026.htm Our Conscious Mind Could Be An Electromagnetic Field], UniSci.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surrey.ac.uk/qe/pdfs/cemi_theory_paper.pdf Synchronous Firing and Its Influence on the Brain's Electromagnetic Field: Evidence for an Electromagnetic Field Theory of Consciousness], J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18306">[[File:Traditional dogon masque.jpg|thumb|[[Dogon people|Dogon]] ceremonial mask in use]]
Ritual and ceremonial [[mask]]s are an essential feature of the traditional culture of the peoples of a part of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], e.g. roughly between the Sahara and the [[Kalahari Desert]]. While the specific implications associated  to ritual masks widely vary in different cultures, some traits are common to most [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]]. For instance, masks usually have a spiritual and religious meaning and they are used in ritual dances and social and religious events, and a special status is attributed to the artists that create masks to those that wear them in ceremonies. In most cases, mask-making is an art that is passed on from father to son, along with the knowledge of the symbolic meanings conveyed by such masks. African masks come in all different [[colours]], such as red, black, orange, and brown. 
[[File:African countries where masks are used.jpg|left|thumb|African countries where masks are used traditionally]]
'''Traditional African masks''' are one of the elements of great African art that have most evidently influenced [[Europe]] and [[Western art]] in general; in the 20th century, artistic movements such as [[cubism]], [[fauvism]] and [[expressionism]] have often taken inspiration from vast and diverse heritage of African masks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsnap.org/category/fauvism/ Fauvism] at Art Snap&lt;/ref&gt; Influences of this heritage can also be found in other traditions such as [[South America|South-]] and [[Central America]]n masked [[Carnival]] parades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crawfurd.dk/africa/carnival.htm A Short History of Carnival with a Touch of Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:Fang Ngil Berlin IIIC6000.jpg|thumb|Ngil mask from [[Gabon]] or [[Cameroon]]; wood colored with kaolin (chiny clay); by [[Fang people]]; [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] (Germany). Worn with full costume in a night masquerade to settle disputes and quell misbehavior, this calm visage was terrifying to wrong-doers]]

In most traditional African cultures, the person who wears a ritual mask conceptually loses his or her human life and turns into the spirit represented by the mask itself( it is sad).&lt;ref&gt;This idea has been literally portrayed in the well-known novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' by [[Nigeria]]n writer [[Chinua Achebe]]. While the author hints at  the same novel, masked elders are particularly hostile towards the missionaries, a symbolical representation of the opposition of traditional Nigerian culture (as represented by the mask-spirits) and the new values brought along by European Christians.&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation of the mask wearer into a spirit usually relies on other practices, such as specific types of music and dance, or ritual costumes that contribute to conceal the mask-wearer's human identity. The mask wearer thus becomes a sort of [[Mediumship|medium]] that allows for a dialogue between the community and the spirits (usually [[veneration of the dead|those of the dead]] or nature-related spirits). Masked dances are a part of most traditional African ceremonies related to [[wedding]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[initiation rite]]s, and so on. Some of the most complex rituals that have been studied by scholars are found in Nigerian cultures such as those of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Edo people|Edo]] peoples, that bear some resemblances to the Western notion of [[theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Analogies between Nigerian ceremonies and the [[theatre of Ancient Greece]] (as well as the Western theatre in general) have been developed by the [[Nobel Prize]] winning Nigerian writer [[Wole Soyinka]]. Soyinka wrote [[drama]]s based on the Yoruba traditions and, conversely, he has "africanized" classical works of the Western theatre such as [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]'' or [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 


Since every mask has a specific spiritual meaning, most traditions comprise several different traditional masks. The traditional religion of the [[Dogon people]] of [[Mali]], for example, comprises three main cults (the ''Awa'' or cult of the dead, the ''Bini'' or cult of the communication with the spirits, and the ''Lebe'' or cult of nature); each of these has its pantheon of spirits, corresponding to 78 different types of masks overall. It is often the case that the artistic quality and complexity of a mask reflects the relative importance of the portrayed spirit in the systems of beliefs of a particular people; for example, simpler masks such as the ''kple kple'' of the [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]] people of [[Côte d'Ivoire]] (essentially a circle with minimal eyes, mouth and horns) are associated to minor spirits.&lt;ref name="Virginia" /&gt;

==Subject and style==
African masks are usually shaped after a human face or some animal's [[Snout|muzzle]], albeit rendered in a sometimes highly abstract form. The inherent lack of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in African masks (and African art in general) is justified by the fact that most African cultures clearly distinguish the essence of a subject from its looks, the former, rather than the latter, being the actual subject of artistical representation. An extreme example is given by ''nwantantay'' masks of the [[Bwa people]] ([[Burkina Faso]]) that represent the flying spirits of the forest; since these spirits are deemed to be invisible, the corresponding masks are shaped after abstract, purely geometrical forms.
[[File:Masques BaKongo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kongo people|BaKongo]] masks from the [[Bas-Congo|Kongo Central region]]]]
[[File:Makurian dancing mask.jpg|thumb|160px|Zoomorphic mask as depicted on a [[Makuria]]n mural from [[Old Dongola]] (12th/13th century)]]
Stylish elements in a mask's looks are codified by the tradition and may either identify a specific community or convey specific meanings. For example, both the Bwa and the [[Buna people]] of Burkina Faso have [[hawk]] masks, with the shape of the beak identifying a mask as either Bwa or Buna. In both cases, the hawk's wings are decorated with geometric patterns that have moral meanings; saw-shaped lines represent the hard path followed by ancestors, while chequered patterns represent the interaction of opposites (male-female, night-day, and so on)&lt;ref name="Essortment"&gt;See ''African Masks Symbolism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Traits representing moral values are found in many cultures. Masks from the [[Senufo people]] of [[Ivory Coast]], for example, have their eyes half closed, symbolizing a peaceful attitude, self-control, and patience. In [[Sierra Leone]] and elsewhere, small eyes and mouth represent [[humility]], and a wide, protruding forehead represents wisdom. In Gabon, large chins and mouths represent authority and strength.&lt;ref name=Essortment/&gt; The [[Grebo (ethnic group)|Grebo]] of the Ivory Coast carve masks with round eyes to represent alertness and anger, with the straight nose to represent unwillingness to retreat.&lt;ref name="Essortment"/&gt;

===Animals===
[[File:Ngond masque.jpg|thumb|A mask of the [[Mitsogo]] people of Gabon]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 60.144 Mask Wabele or Wo.jpg|thumb|right|Wabele mask, Senufo people, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Animals are common subjects in African masks. Animal masks might actually represent the spirit of animals, so that the mask-wearer becomes a medium to speak to animals themselves (e.g. to ask wild beasts to stay away from the village); in many cases, nevertheless, an animal is also (sometimes mainly) a symbol of specific virtues. Common animal subjects include the [[African buffalo|buffalo]] (usually representing strength, as in the Baoulé culture),&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks&gt;See ''African Masks''&lt;/ref&gt; [[crocodile]], hawk, [[hyena]], [[warthog]] and [[antelope]]. Antelopes have a fundamental role in many cultures of the Mali area (for example in Dogon and [[Bambara people|Bambara]] culture) as representatives of [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Many agricultural societies and associations in Mali have a stylized representation of an antelope in their symbols.&lt;/ref&gt; Dogon antelope masks are highly abstract, with a general rectangular shape and many horns (a representation of abundant harvest. Bambara antelope masks (called ''chiwara'') have long horns representing the thriving growth of [[millet]], [[legs]] (representing roots), long ears (representing the songs sung by the working women at harvest time), and a saw-shaped line that represents the path followed by the Sun between [[solstice]]s.&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks/&gt; A 12th/13th century mural from [[Old Dongola]], the capital of the [[Nubians|Nubian]] kingdom of [[Makuria]], depicts dancing masks decorated with [[cowrie]] shells imitating some animal with long snouts and big ears.{{sfn|Martens-Czarnecka|2008|p=120}}

A common variation on the animal-mask theme is the composition of several distinct animal traits in a single mask, sometimes along with human traits. Merging distinct animal traits together is sometimes a means to represent unusual, exceptional virtue or high status. For example, the Poro [[secret society|secret societies]] of the [[Senufo people]] of the Ivory Coast have masks that celebrate the exceptional power of the society by merging three different "danger" symbols: antelope horns, crocodile teeth, and warthog fangs.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;See ''Icons of Power''&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known example is that of ''kifwebe'' masks of the [[Songye people]] ([[Congo basin]]), that mix the stripes of a [[zebra]] (or [[okapi]]), the teeth of a [[crocodile]], the eyes of a [[chameleon]], the mouth of an [[aardvark]], the crest of a rooster, the feathers of an [[owl]] and more.&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks/&gt;

===Feminine beauty===
[[File:Bete mask p1070041.jpg|thumb|Doei (or Kwere), female ancestor mask, [[Tanzania]]|left]]
Another common subject of African masks is a woman's face, usually based on a specific culture's [[ideal of feminine beauty]]. Female masks of the [[Punu people]] of Gabon, for example, have long curved eyelashes, almond-shaped eyes, thin chin, and traditional ornaments on their cheeks, as all these are considered good-looking traits.&lt;ref name=Virginia&gt;See ''Faces of the Spirit''&lt;/ref&gt; Feminine masks of the [[Baga people]] have [[Scarification|ornamental scars]] and breasts. In many cases, wearing masks that represent feminine beauty is strictly reserved to men.&lt;ref name=Essortment/&gt;

One of the well-known representations of female beauty is the ''[[Idia]]'' mask of [[Benin]]. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask on his hip during special ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;See Bortolot&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancestors masks (masks of the dead)===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1582 Mwaash aMbooy Mask.jpg|thumb|right|Mwaash aMbooy Mask [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
As the [[Veneration of the dead|veneration of defunct ancestors]] is a fundamental element of most African traditional cultures, it is not surprising that the dead is also a common subject for masks. Masks referring to dead ancestors are most often shaped after a [[human skull]]. A well-known example is the ''mwana pwo'' (literally, "young woman") of the [[Chokwe people]] ([[Angola]]), that mixes elements referring to feminine beauty (well-proportioned oval face, small nose and chin) and other referring to death (sunken eye sockets, cracked skin, and tears); it represents a female ancestor who died young, venerated in rites such as [[circumcision]] rites and ceremonies associated to the renewal of life.&lt;ref&gt;A male variant of this mask is called ''cihongo''.&lt;/ref&gt; As veneration of the dead is most often associated to fertility and reproduction, many dead-ancestor masks also have sexual symbols; the ''ndeemba'' mask of the [[Yaka people]] (Angola and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]]), for example, is shaped after a skull complemented with a phallic-shaped nose.&lt;ref name=Virginia2&gt;See ''Images of Ancestors''&lt;/ref&gt;

A special class of ancestor masks are those related to notable, historical or legendary people. The ''mwaash ambooy'' mask of the [[Kuba people]] (DR Congo), for example, representing  the legendary founder of the [[Kuba Kingdom]], Woot, while the ''mgady amwaash'' mask represents his wife Mweel.&lt;ref name=Rulers&gt;See ''Portraits of Rulers''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials and structure==

The most commonly used material for masks is wood, although a wide variety of other elements can be used, including light stone such as [[steatite]], metals such as [[copper]] or [[bronze]], different types of [[fabric]], [[pottery]], and more. Some masks are painted (for example using [[ochre]] or other natural colorants). A wide array of ornamental items can be applied to the mask surface; example include animal [[hair]], horns, or teeth, [[sea shell]]s, [[seed]]s, straws, egg shell, and feathers. For example, animal hair or straws are often used for a mask's hair or beard.

The general structure of a mask varies depending on the way it is intended to be worn. The most common type applies to the wearer's face, like most Western (e.g., carnival) masks. Others are worn like hats on the top of the wearer's head; examples include those of the Ekhoi people of Nigeria and Bwa people of Burkina Faso, as well as the famous ''chiwara'' masks of the Bambara people.&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks/&gt; Some masks (for example those of the [[Sande society]] of [[Liberia]] and the [[Mende people]] of Sierra Leone, that are made from hollow tree stumps) are worn like helmets covering both the head and face. Some African cultures have mask-like ornaments that are worn on the chest rather than the head of face; this includes those used by the [[Makonde people]] of [[East Africa]] in ''ndimu'' ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Rebirth&gt;See ''Physical characteristics of African Tribal Masks''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercially-produced masks==
[[File:Commercial masks mwenge.jpg|thumb|Commercial masks for sale a in a shop in the [[Mwenge]] Makonde market, [[Dar es Salaam]]|left]]
As African masks are largely appreciated by Europeans, they are widely commercialized and sold in most tourist-oriented markets and shops in Africa (as well as "ethnic" shops in the [[Western World]]). As a consequence, the traditional art of mask-making has gradually ceased to be a privileged, status-related practice, and mass production of masks has become widespread. While, in most cases, commercial masks are (more or less faithful) reproductions of traditional masks, this connection is weakening over time, as the logics of mass-production make it harder to identify the actual geographical and cultural origins of the masks found in such venues as curio shops and tourist markets. For example, the [[Okahandja]] market in [[Namibia]] mostly sells masks that are produced in [[Zimbabwe]] (as they are cheaper and more easily available than local masks), and, in turn, Zimbabwean mask-makers reproduce masks from virtually everywhere in Africa rather than from their own local heritage.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Namibia'', [[Lonely Planet]] 2007, {{ISBN|978-88-6040-119-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reynard-the-fox.jpg|thumb|The trickster figure [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]] as depicted in an 1869 children's book by [[Michel Rodange]]]]
In [[mythology]], and in the study of [[folklore]] and [[religion]], a '''trickster''' is a character in a story ([[God (male deity)|god]], [[goddess]], [[spiritual being|spirit]], [[man]], [[woman]], or [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphisation]]), which exhibits a great degree of intellect or secret knowledge, and uses it to play tricks or otherwise disobey normal rules and conventional behaviour.

==Mythology==
Tricksters are [[archetype|archetypal]] characters who appear in the myths of many different cultures. [[Lewis Hyde]] describes the trickster as a "boundary-crosser".&lt;ref name=Hyde&gt;Hyde, Lewis. ''Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth, and Art''. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The trickster crosses and often breaks both physical and societal rules. Tricksters "...violate principles of social and natural order, playfully disrupting normal life and then re-establishing it on a new basis."&lt;ref name=Mattick&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/15/reviews/980215.15mattict.html|last=Mattick|first=Paul|title=Hotfoots of the Gods|work=New York Times|date=February 15, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the bending/breaking of rules takes the form of tricks or thievery. Tricksters can be [[wikt:cunning|cunning]] or foolish or both. The trickster openly questions and mocks authority. They are usually male characters, and are fond of breaking rules, boasting, and playing tricks on both humans and gods.

All cultures have tales of the trickster, a crafty creature who uses cunning to get food, steal precious possessions, or simply cause mischief. In some Greek myths [[Hermes]] plays the trickster. He is the patron of thieves and the inventor of lying, a gift he passed on to [[Autolycus]], who in turn passed it on to [[Odysseus]].&lt;ref name=Hyde/&gt;  In [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] folktales, the trickster and the [[culture hero]] are often combined.

[[File:How loki wrought mischief in Asgard by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|[[Loki]] cuts the hair of the goddess [[Sif]].]]

Frequently the trickster figure exhibits gender and [[shapeshifting|form]] variability. In [[Norse mythology]] the mischief-maker is [[Loki]], who is also a shape shifter. Loki also exhibits gender variability, in one case even becoming pregnant. He [[Loki#Gylfaginning|becomes a mare]] who later gives birth to Odin's eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]].

British scholar Evan Brown suggested that [[Jacob]] in the Bible has many of the characteristics of the trickster:&lt;blockquote&gt;The tricks Jacob plays on his twin brother [[Esau]], his father [[Isaac]] and his father-in-law [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] are immoral by conventional standards, designed to cheat other people and gain material and social advantages he is not entitled to. Nevertheless, the Biblical narrative clearly takes Jacob's side and the reader is invited to laugh and admire Jacob's ingenuity–as is the case with the tricksters of other cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Evan. ''The Bible in the Context of World Culture'', Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a wide variety of African language communities, the rabbit, or hare, is the trickster. In West Africa (and thence into the Caribbean via the slave trade), the spider ([[Anansi]]) is often the trickster.

==Archetype==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Remember11]] --&gt;
{{Further|List of fictional tricksters}}
The trickster or clown is an example of a [[Jungian archetype]].  In modern literature the trickster survives as a character archetype, not necessarily supernatural or divine, sometimes no more than a [[stock character]].  Often too, the trickster is distinct in a story by his acting as a sort of catalyst, in that his antics are the cause of other characters' discomfiture, but he himself is left untouched.  A once-famous example of this was the character [[Froggy the Gremlin]] on the early children's television show "Andy's Gang".  A cigar-puffing puppet, Froggy induced the adult humans around him to engage in ridiculous and self-destructive hi-jinks.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, R. L. "[http://home.earthlink.net/~christmascamel/id5.html Remembering Andy Devine]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In later folklore, the trickster/clown is incarnated as a clever, mischievous man or creature, who tries to survive the dangers and challenges of the world using trickery and deceit as a defense.  He also is known for entertaining people as a clown does. For example, many typical [[fairy tale]]s have the king who wants to find the best groom for his daughter by ordering several trials.  No brave and valiant prince or knight manages to win them, until a poor and simple peasant comes.  With the help of his wits and cleverness, instead of fighting, he evades or fools monsters and villains and dangers with unorthodox manners.  Therefore, the most unlikely candidate passes the trials and receives the reward.  More modern and obvious examples of that type include [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Pippi Longstocking]].

==Role in African American literature==
Modern African American literary criticism has turned the trickster figure into an example of how it is possible to overcome a system of oppression from within. For years, [[African American literature]] was discounted by the greater community of American literary criticism while its authors were still obligated to use the language and the rhetoric of the very system that relegated African Americans and other minorities to the ostracized position of the cultural "other." The central question became one of how to overcome this system when the only words available were created and defined by the oppressors. As [[Audre Lorde]] explained, the problem was that "the master's tools [would] never dismantle the master's house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorde|first=Audre|chapter=Age, Race, Class, and Sex|title=Literary Theory: An Anthology|editor1-first=Julie|editor1-last=Rivkin|editor2-first=Michael|editor2-last=Ryan|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2004|page=859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his writings of the late 1980s, [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] presents the concept of [[Signifyin']]. Wound up in this theory is the idea that the "master's house" can be "dismantled" using his "tools" if the tools are used in a new or unconventional way. To demonstrate this process, Gates cites the interactions found in African American narrative poetry between the trickster, [[the Signifying Monkey]], and his oppressor, the Lion.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=990}} According to Gates, the "Signifying Monkey" is the "New World figuration" and "functional equivalent" of the Eshu trickster figure of African Yoruba mythology.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|pp=988–989}} The Lion functions as the authoritative figure in his classical role of "King of the Jungle."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} He is the one who commands the Signifying Monkey's movements. Yet the Monkey is able to outwit the Lion continually in these narratives through his usage of figurative language. According to Gates, "[T]he Signifying Monkey is able to signify upon the Lion because the Lion does not understand the Monkey's discourse…The monkey speaks figuratively, in a symbolic code; the lion interprets or reads literally and suffers the consequences of his folly..."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} In this way, the Monkey uses the same language as the Lion, but he uses it on a level that the Lion cannot comprehend. This usually leads to the Lion's "trounc[ing]" at the hands of a third party, the Elephant.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=990}} The net effect of all of this is "the reversal of [the Lion's] status as the King of the Jungle."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} In this way, the "master's house" is dismantled when his own tools are turned against him.

[[File:Br'er Rabbit and Tar-Baby.jpg|thumb|left|[[Br'er Rabbit]] is a trickster character who succeeds through his wits rather than through strength.]]
Following in this tradition, critics since Gates have come to assert that another popular African American folk trickster, [[Br'er Rabbit]] (a contraction of "Brother Rabbit"), uses clever language to perform the same kind of rebellious societal deconstruction as the Signifying Monkey. Brer Rabbit is the "creative way that the slave community responded to the oppressor's failure to address them as human beings created in the image of God."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=131}} The figurative representative of this slave community, Brer Rabbit is the hero with a "fragile body but a deceptively strong mind" that allows him to "create [his] own symbols in defiance of the perverted logic of the oppressor."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=131}} By twisting language to create these symbols, Brer Rabbit not only was the "personification of the ethic of self-preservation" for the slave community, but also "an alternative response to their oppressor's false doctrine of anthropology."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=158}} Through his language of trickery, Brer Rabbit outwits his oppressors, deconstructing, in small ways, the hierarchy of subjugation to which his weak body forces him to physically conform.

Before Gates, there was some precedent for the analysis of African American folk heroes as destructive agents of an oppressive hierarchical system. In the 1920s and 1930s, [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]] engaged in an epistolary correspondence.&lt;ref name=North77&gt;North, Michael, ''The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth-Century Literature'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Both writers signed the letters with pseudonyms adopted from the [[Uncle Remus]] tales; Eliot was "[[Virginia opossum|Possum]];" Pound was "[[Tar Baby]]." Pound and Eliot wrote in the same "African slave" dialect of the tales. Pound, writing later of the series of letters, distinguished the language from "the Queen's English, the language of public propriety."&lt;ref name=North77 /&gt; This rebellion against proper language came as part of "collaboration" between Pound and Eliot "against the London literary establishment and the language that it used."&lt;ref name=North77 /&gt; Although Pound and Eliot were not attempting to overthrow an establishment as expansive as the one oppressing the African American slave community, they were actively trying to establish for themselves a new kind of literary freedom. In their usage of the [[Uncle Remus]] trickster figures' names and dialects, they display an early understanding of the way in which cleverly manipulated language can dismantle a restrictive hierarchy.

African American literary criticism and folktales are not the only place in the American literary tradition that tricksters are to be found combating subjugation from within an oppressive system. In ''When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote'', the argument is posited that the Brer Rabbit stories were derived from a mixture of African and [[Native American mythology]], thus attributing part of the credit for the formation of the tales and wiles of Brer Rabbit to "Indian captivity narratives" and the rabbit trickster found in [[Cherokee mythology]].&lt;ref name="Brennan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brennan|first=Jonathan|chapter=Introduction: Recognition of the African-Native American Literary Tradition|title=When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote: African–Native American Literature|editor-last=Brennan|editor-first=Jonathan|location=Urbana and Chicago|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baringer|first=Sandra K.|chapter=Brer Rabbit and His Cherokee Cousin: Moving Beyond the Appropriation Paradigm|title=When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote: African–Native American Literature|editor-last=Brennan|editor-first=Jonathan|location=Urbana and Chicago|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In arguing for a merged "African–Native American folklore", the idea is forwarded that certain shared "cultural affinities" between African Americans and Native Americans allowed both groups "through the trickster tales…survive[d] European American cultural and political domination."&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt;

==In Native American tradition==
While the trickster crosses various cultural traditions, there are significant differences between tricksters in the traditions of different parts of the world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many native traditions held [[clown]]s and tricksters as essential to any contact with the [[sacred]]. People could not pray until they had laughed, because [[laughter]] opens and frees from rigid preconception. Humans had to have tricksters within the most sacred [[ceremonies]] for fear that they forget the sacred comes through upset, reversal, surprise. The trickster in most native traditions is essential to creation, to birth.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd Gibbens, Professor of English at [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]; quoted [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] in ''[[Napalm and Silly Putty]]'' by George Carlin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Native American tricksters should not be confused with the European fictional [[picaro]].  One of the most important distinctions is that "we can see in the Native American trickster an openness to life's multiplicity and paradoxes largely missing in the modern Euro-American moral tradition".{{sfnp|Ballinger|1991|p=21}} In some stories the Native American trickster is foolish and other times wise. He can be a hero in one tale and a villain in the next.

In many Native American and First Nations mythologies, the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote spirit]] ([[Southwestern United States]]) or [[Raven (mythology)|Raven spirit]] ([[Pacific Northwest]]) stole fire from the gods ([[star]]s, [[moon]], and/or [[sun]]). Both are usually seen as jokesters and pranksters. In Native American creation stories, when Coyote teaches humans how to catch salmon, he makes the first fish weir out of logs and branches.&lt;ref name=Hyde/&gt;

Wakdjunga in [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] mythology is an example of the trickster archetype.

===Coyote===
{{Main article|Coyote (mythology)}}
[[File:Coyoteinacanoe.png|thumb|left|upright|Coyote often has the role of trickster as well as a clown in traditional stories.]]
The Coyote mythos is one of the most popular among western Native American cultures, especially among [[indigenous peoples of California]] and [[indigenous peoples of the Great Basin|the Great Basin]].

According to [[Crow religion|Crow]] (and other Plains) tradition, Old Man Coyote impersonates the Creator: "Old Man Coyote took up a handful of mud and out of it made people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumca.org/goldrush/fever04-ci.html "Gold Fever California on the Eve- California Indians", Oakland Museum of California]&lt;/ref&gt; He also bestowed names on buffalo, deer, elk, antelopes, and bear. According to A. Hultkranz, the impersonation of Coyote as Creator is a result of a taboo, a mythic substitute to the religious notion of the Great Spirit whose name was too dangerous and/or sacred to use apart from at special ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[Chelan (tribe)|Chelan]] myths, Coyote belongs to the animal people but he is at the same time "a power just like the Creator, the head of all the creatures." while still being a subject of the Creator who can punish him or remove his powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voices of the Winds: Native American Legends|last1=Edmonds|last2=Clark|first1=Margot|first2=Ella E.|publisher=Castle Books|year=2003|isbn=0785817166|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pacific Northwest tradition, Coyote is mostly mentioned as a messenger, or minor power.

As the culture hero, Coyote appears in various mythic traditions, but generally with the same magical powers of transformation, resurrection, and "medicine". He is engaged in changing the ways of rivers, creating new landscapes and getting sacred things for people. Of mention is the tradition of Coyote fighting against monsters. According to Wasco tradition, Coyote was the hero to fight and kill [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]], the killer of people, but he could do that not because of his personal power, but due to the help of the Spirit Chief. In some stories, Multnomah Falls came to be by Coyote's efforts; in others, it is done by Raven.

More often than not Coyote is a trickster, but always different. In some stories, he is a noble trickster: "Coyote takes water from the Frog people... because it is not right that one people have all the water." In others, he is malicious: "Coyote determined to bring harm to Duck. He took Duck's wife and children, whom he treated badly."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==In Internet and multimedia studies==
In online environments there has been a link between the trickster and [[Internet trolling]]. Some have said that a trickster is a type of online community character.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. &amp; Greenhill, A. (2002). "Tribalism, Conflict and Shape-shifting Identities in Online Communities." In the Proceedings of the 13th Australasia Conference on Information Systems, Melbourne Australia, 7–9 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. and Greenhill, A. (2009). "[http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2235/ Conflict and Identity Shape Shifting in an Online Financial Community]", ''Information Systems Journal'', (19:5), pp. 461–478. {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2008.00301.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">"'''Viruses of the Mind'''" is an essay by British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], first published in the book ''Dennett and His Critics: Demystifying Mind'' (1993).  Dawkins originally wrote the essay in 1991 and delivered it as a [[Voltaire Lecture]] on 6 November 1992 at the [[Conway Hall Humanist Centre]].  The essay discusses how religion can be viewed as a [[meme]], an idea previously expressed by Dawkins in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976).  Dawkins analyzes the propagation of religious ideas and behaviors as a memetic virus, analogous to how  [[virus|biological]] and [[computer virus]]es spread.  The essay was later published in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and its ideas are further explored in the television programme, ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'' (2006).

==Content==
Dawkins defines the "symptoms" of being infected by the "virus of religion", providing examples for most of them, and tries to define a connection between the elements of religion and its survival value (invoking [[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi]]'s [[handicap principle]] of [[sexual selection]], applied to believers of a religion). Dawkins also describes religious beliefs as "mind-parasites", and as "gangs &lt;nowiki&gt;[that]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will come to constitute a package, which may be sufficiently stable to deserve a collective name such as Roman Catholicism ... or ... component parts to a single virus".

Dawkins suggests that religious belief in the "faith-sufferer" typically shows the following elements:
* It is impelled by some deep, inner conviction that something is true, or right, or virtuous: a conviction that doesn't seem to owe anything to [[evidence]] or reason, but which, nevertheless, the believer feels as totally compelling and convincing.
* The believer typically makes a positive virtue of faith's being strong and unshakable, despite it not being based upon evidence.
* There is a conviction that "mystery", ''per se'', is a good thing; the belief that it is not a virtue to solve mysteries but to enjoy them and revel in their insolubility.
* There may be intolerant behaviour towards perceived rival faiths, in extreme cases even the killing of opponents or advocating of their deaths. Believers  may be similarly violent in disposition towards [[Apostasy|apostates]] or [[Heresy|heretics]], even if those espouse only a slightly different version of the faith.
* The particular convictions that the believer holds, while having nothing to do with evidence, are likely to resemble those of the believer's parents.
* If the believer is one of the rare exceptions who follows a different religion from his parents, the explanation may be cultural transmission from a charismatic individual.
* The internal sensations of the 'faith-sufferer' may be reminiscent of those more ordinarily associated with sexual love.

Dawkins stresses his claim that religious beliefs do not spread as a result of evidence in their support, but typically by cultural transmission, in most cases from parents or from charismatic individuals. He refers to this as involving "[[epidemiology]], not evidence". Further Dawkins distinguishes this process from the spread of scientific ideas, which, he suggests, is constrained by the requirement to conform with certain virtues of standard methodology: "testability, evidential support, precision, quantifiability, consistency, intersubjectivity, repeatability, universality, progressiveness, independence of cultural milieu, and so on". He points out that faith "spreads despite a total lack of every single one of these virtues".

==Critical reactions==
[[Alister McGrath]], a Christian theologian, has also commented critically on Dawkins' analysis, suggesting that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' p. 125 quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] is support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p.  126&lt;/ref&gt; that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than Darwinian,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests there is no evidence that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' (pp. 137–138)&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also cites a metareview of 100 studies and argues that "If religion is reported as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the field, how can it conceivably be regarded as analogous to a virus?"&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 136 citing Koenig and Cohen ''The Link between Religion and Health'' OUP 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}

'''Vrikshasana''' ({{IPAc-en|v|r|ɪ|k|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|s|ə|n|ə|}} {{respell|vrik|SHAH|sə-nə}};{{sfn|Budilovsky|Adamson|2000|p=150}} {{lang-sa|वृक्षासन}}; [[IAST]]: ''vṛkṣāsana'') or '''Tree Pose'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/496 | title = Yoga Journal - Tree Pose | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[asana]].

== Etymology ==

The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''vriksa'' or ''vriksha'' (वृक्ष, vṛkṣa) meaning "tree",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/asana-vinyasa-series/surya-namaskara-a-sun-salutation/item/urdhva-vrikshasana-426/ | title = Urdhva Vrikshasana - AshtangaYoga.info | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''asana'' (आसन) meaning "posture".&lt;ref name="Sinha1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinha|first=S.C.|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zzRvh1fRzEC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=1 June 1996|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|isbn=978-81-7041-293-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

From [[Tadasana]], weight is not good shifted to one leg, for example, starting with the left leg. The entire sole of the foot remains in contact with the floor. The right knee is bent and the right foot placed on the left inner thigh, or in half lotus position. In either foot placement, the hips should be open, with the right knee pointing towards the right, not forward. With the toes of the right foot pointing directly down, the left foot, center of the pelvis, shoulders and head are all [[vertical direction|vertically aligned]]. Hands are typically held above the head either pointed directly upwards and unclasped, or clasped together in [[anjali mudra]].

The asana is typically held for 20 to 60 seconds to stretch the spine, returning to tadasana while exhaling, then repeating standing on the opposite leg.{{sfn|Silva|Methta|1990|p=21}}

== Benefits ==

This asana improves:
* [[Balance (ability)|balance]]{{sfn|Iyengar|1979|p=62}}
* [[Gracefulness|Poise]]{{sfn|Iyengar|1979|p=62}}
* [[Human position|posture]]{{sfn|Hewitt|1983|p=35}}{{sfn|Iyengar|1979|p=62}}
* concentration{{sfn|Hewitt|1983}}
* increases the range of motion in the hips{{sfn|Hewitt|1983|p=35}}
* deepens the [[thorax]]{{sfn|Hewitt|1983|p=35}}
* strengthens  the ankles{{sfn|Hewitt|1983|p=35}}
* tones the muscles of the legs, back and chest{{sfn|Hewitt|1983|p=35}}

== Beginner's tip ==

Focus the gaze on a small specific point, known in yoga as a drishti. This is ideally something directly ahead which does not move. Engage the standing foot by lifting the arch and pressing down through the lateral edge. Check that weight is distributed through the ball of the large toe, the ball of the small toe, and the heel. Draw in the navel to improve core stability and posture. Faults include leaning to one side, twisting, pushing one hip out; bending or rotating the supporting knee outwards; looking downwards and lacking concentration.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre (1996) Yoga, Mind and Body (DK, London)&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}
