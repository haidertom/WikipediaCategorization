In mathematics, the term '''''adjoint''''' applies in several situations. Several of these share a similar formalism: if ''A'' is adjoint to ''B'', then there is typically some formula of the type
:(''Ax'', ''y'') = (''x'', ''By'').

Specifically, '''adjoint''' or '''adjunction''' may mean:
*[[Transpose of a linear map|Adjoint of a linear map]], also called its transpose
*[[Hermitian adjoint]] (adjoint of a linear operator) in functional analysis
*[[Adjoint endomorphism]] of a Lie algebra
*[[Adjoint representation of a Lie group]]
*[[Adjoint functors]] in category theory
*[[Adjunction (category theory)]]
*[[Adjunction (field theory)]]
*[[Adjunction formula (algebraic geometry)]]
*[[Adjunction space]] in topology
*[[Conjugate transpose]] of a matrix in linear algebra
*[[Adjugate matrix]], related to its inverse
*[[Adjoint equation]]
*The upper and lower adjoints of a [[Galois connection]] in order theory
*For the adjoint of a differential operator with general polynomial coefficients see [[differential operator#Operator methods|differential operator]] 
*[[Kleisli adjunction]]
*[[Monoidal adjunction]]
*[[Quillen adjunction]]
*[[Axiom of adjunction]] in set theory

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4262">In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], an '''ansatz''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ae|n|s|ae|t|s}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʔanzats|lang}}, meaning: "initial placement of a tool at a work piece", plural '''ansätze''' {{IPAc-en|'|ae|n|s|ɛ|t|s|ə}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʔanzɛtsə|lang}} or '''ansatzes''') is an educated guess&lt;ref name="Gershenfeld 1999"&gt;In his book on "The Nature of Mathematical Modelling", Neil Gershenfeld introduces ''ansatz'', with interpretation "a trial answer", to be an important technique for solving differential equations. Gershenfeld 1999, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; that is verified later by its results.

==Use==
An ansatz is the establishment of the starting equation(s), the theorem(s), or the value(s) describing a mathematical or physical problem or solution. It can take into consideration [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]].  After an ansatz has been established (constituting nothing more than an assumption), the equations are solved for the general function of interest (constituting a confirmation of the assumption).

==Examples==
Given a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of experimental data that looks to be [[Cluster analysis|clustered]] about a line, a linear ansatz could be made to find the [[parameter]]s of the line by a [[least squares]] curve fit. [[Calculus of variations|Variational]] [[approximation]] methods use ansätze and then fit the parameters.

Another example could be the mass, energy, and entropy balance equations that, considered simultaneous for purposes of the elementary operations of [[linear algebra]], are the ''ansatz'' to most basic problems of [[thermodynamics]].

Another example of an ansatz is to suppose the solutions of a homogeneous linear [[differential equation]] and [[difference equation]] to have, respectively, exponential and power form. More generally, one can guess a particular solution of a system of equations and test such an ansatz by direct substitution of the solution in the system of equations.

The '''British Society for the History of Mathematics''' ('''BSHM''') was founded in 1971 to promote research into the [[history of mathematics]] at all levels and to further the use of the history of [[mathematics education|mathematics in education]].

The BSHM is concerned with all periods and cultures, and with all aspects of mathematics.  It participates in the [[Joint Mathematical Council]] of the United Kingdom.

The '''BSHM Bulletin''', or the ''Journal of the British Society for the History of Mathematics'', is published on behalf of BSHM by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/17498430.asp BSHM Bulletin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312113240/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/17498430.asp |date=12 March 2010 }}, [[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Articles cover local mathematical history, the use of history of mathematics in education, and individual interests.

== Neumann Prize ==

The Neumann prize is awarded biennially by the BSHM for "a book in English (including books in translation) dealing with the history of mathematics and aimed at a broad audience."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bshm.ac.uk/neumann-prize Neumann prize]&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was named in honour of [[Peter M. Neumann]], who is a longstanding supporter of and contributor to the society. It carries an award of £600.The previous winners are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1991">In the area of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[group theory]], the '''diameter''' of a [[finite group]] is a measure of its complexity.

Consider a finite group &lt;math&gt;\left(G,\circ\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and any [[generating set of a group|set of generators]] {{mvar|S}}. Define &lt;math&gt;D_S&lt;/math&gt; to be the [[graph diameter]] of the [[Cayley graph]] &lt;math&gt;\Lambda=\left(G,S\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the diameter of &lt;math&gt;\left(G,\circ\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the largest value of &lt;math&gt;D_S&lt;/math&gt; taken over all generating sets {{mvar|S}}.

For instance, every finite [[cyclic group]] of order {{mvar|s}}, the Cayley graph for a generating set with one generator is an {{mvar|s}}-vertex [[cycle graph]]. The diameter of this graph, and of the group, is &lt;math&gt;\lfloor s/2\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{diam}(G) \leqslant \left(\log|G|\right)^{\mathcal{O}(1)}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10079">'''Ethics in mathematics''' is a field of [[applied ethics]], the inquiry into ethical aspects of the applications of [[mathematics]]. It deals with the professional responsibilities of [[mathematicians]] whose work influences decisions with major consequences, such as in law, finance, the military, and environmental science.

==Need for ethics in the mathematics profession==
Mathematicians in industrial, scientific, military and intelligence roles crucially influence decisions with large consequences. For example, complex calculations were needed for the success of the [[Manhattan Project]], while the overextended use of the [[Copula (probability theory)|Gaussian copula]] formula to price derivatives before the [[Global Financial Crisis]] of 2008 has been called "the formula that killed Wall Street",&lt;ref&gt;Felix Salmon, [https://www.wired.com/2009/02/wp-quant/ Recipe for disaster: the formula that killed Wall Street"], ''Wired''23 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory of global warming depends on the reliability of [[climate models|mathematical models of climate]]. For the same reason as in [[medical ethics]] and [[engineering ethics]], the high impact of the consequences of decisions imposes serious ethical obligations on practitioners to consider the rights and wrongs of their advice and decisions.

==Disasters and scandals involving the use of mathematics==
These illustrate the major consequences of numerical mistakes and hence the need for ethical care.
* The [[Club of Rome]]'s 1972 mathematical-model based predictions in ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' of widespread collapse of the world system by the end of the century.
* [[Sally Clark|Wrongful conviction of Sally Clark]] (1999), An English solicitor, Sally Clark, was wrongfully convicted of murdering her two children – each of whom had died due to [[sudden infant death syndrome]] – due to a fundamental statistical error in the testimony of an "expert".&lt;br&gt;The error was further compounded by the "[[prosecutor's fallacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1432762/Misleading-statistics-were-presented-as-facts-in-Sally-Clark-trial.html Derbyshire, D., "Misleading statistics were presented as facts in Sally Clark trial", ''The Telegraph'', (12 June 2003).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical issues in the mathematical profession==
Mathematicians in professional roles in finance and similar work have a particular responsibility to ensure they use the best methods and data to reach the right answer, as the prestige of mathematics is high and others rely on mathematical results which they cannot fully understand. Other ethical issues are shared with [[information economy]] professionals in general, such as [[duty of care]], [[confidentiality]] of information, [[whistleblowing]], and avoiding [[conflict of interest]].

==Misuse of statistics==
{{Main|Misuse of statistics}}
Much of mathematics as used in applications involves the drawing of conclusions from quantitative data. It is recognised that there are many difficulties in reaching and communicating such conclusions accurately, honestly and with due regard to the uncertainties that remain. It is easy for a statistician to mislead clients whose understanding of data and inference is less developed, so statisticians have professional responsibilities to act fairly.

==Ethics in pure mathematical research==
The [[American Mathematical Society]] publishes a code of ethical guidelines for mathematical researchers. The responsibilities of researchers include being knowledgeable in the field, avoiding plagiarism and giving credit, to publish without unreasonable delay, and to correct errors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/policy-statements/sec-ethics American Mathematical Society Policy Statement on Ethical Guidelines], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Mathematical Society]] Ethics Committee also publishes a code of practice relating to the publication, editing and refereeing of research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euro-math-soc.eu/system/files/uploads/COP-approved.pdf Code of Practice – European Mathematical Society].&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that as pure mathematical research is relatively harmless, it raises few urgent ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Reuben Hersh]], [http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1068&amp;context=hmnj Mathematics and ethics], ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'' 12 (3) (1990), 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that raises the question of whether and why pure mathematics is ethically worth doing, given that it consumes the lives of many highly intelligent people who could be making more immediately useful contributions.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]], [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF03024064 Ethics of mathematics], ''Mathematical Intelligencer'' 13 (1) (1991), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching ethics in mathematics==
Courses in the ethics of mathematics remain rare. The [[University of New South Wales]] taught a compulsory course on Professional Issues and Ethics in Mathematics in its mathematics degrees from 1998 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, [http://www.austms.org.au/Publ/Gazette/2005/May05/franklin.pdf A “Professional issues and ethics in mathematics” course], ''Gazette of the Australian Mathematical Society'' 32 (2005), 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''European Women in Mathematics (EWM)''' is an international professional organization dedicated to supporting women's engagement in mathematics. Its goals include encouraging women to study mathematics and providing visibility to women mathematicians.  It is the "first and best known" of several organizations devoted to women in mathematics in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Caroline|last=Series|authorlink=Caroline Series|title=European Level Organisations for Women Mathematicians|url=http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2013-12-90.pdf|magazine=EMS Newsletter|publisher=European Mathematical Society|volume=90|date=December 2013|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2025">In applied mathematics, the '''fast sweeping method''' is a [[numerical method]] for solving [[boundary value problem]]s of the [[Eikonal equation]].

: &lt;math&gt;|\nabla u(\mathbf{x})| = \frac 1 {f(\mathbf{x})} \text{ for } \mathbf{x} \in \Omega 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \text{ for } \mathbf{x} \in \partial \Omega  
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Omega &lt;/math&gt; is an open set in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is a function with positive values, &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega &lt;/math&gt; is a well-behaved boundary of the open set and &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; norm.

The fast sweeping method is an iterative method which uses upwind difference for discretization and uses [[Gauss–Seidel method|Gauss–Seidel iterations]] with alternating sweeping ordering to solve the discretized Eikonal equation on a rectangular grid. The origins of this approach lie in [[control theory]].  Although fast sweeping methods have existed in control theory, it was first proposed for Eikonal equations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Hongkai|date=2005-01-01|title=A fast sweeping method for Eikonal equations|url=http://www.ams.org/mcom/2005-74-250/S0025-5718-04-01678-3/|journal=Mathematics of Computation|volume=74|issue=250|pages=603–627|doi=10.1090/S0025-5718-04-01678-3|issn=0025-5718}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Hongkai Zhao, an applied mathematician at the [[University of California, Irvine]].

The term '''fractal expressionism''' was coined by physicist-artist Richard Taylor and co-authors to distinguish fractal art generated directly by artists from fractal art generated using mathematics and/or computers.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Fractals are patterns that repeat at increasingly fine scales and are prevalent in natural scenery (examples include clouds, rivers, and mountains).&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, BB, The Fractal Geometry of Nature, WH Freedman, New York, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Fractal expressionism implies a direct expression of nature's patterns in an art work.

== Jackson Pollock's poured paintings ==

The initial studies of fractal expressionism focused on the poured paintings by the American artist [[Jackson Pollock]] (1912-1956), whose work has traditionally been associated with the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist movement]].&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature"&gt;[Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor1999physicsworld"&gt;["Fractals Determine Date of Paintings." Physics World 04 June 1999: n. pag. Web. &lt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/1999/jun/04/fractals-determine-date-of-paintings&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock’s patterns had previously been referred to as “natural” and “organic”, inviting speculation by author John Briggs in 1992 that Pollock's work featured fractals.&lt;ref&gt;John Briggs, Fractals, Touchstone Publishers, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Taylor built a pendulum device called the Pollockizer which painted fractal patterns bearing a similarity to Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Computer analysis of Pollock's work published by Taylor et al.  in a 1999 Nature article found that Pollock's painted patterns have characteristics that match those displayed by nature's fractals (specifically, they demonstrate a statistical [[self-similarity]] quantified by a non-integer dimension over a magnification range of 1.5-2 orders of magnitude).  This analysis supported clues (see below) that Pollock's patterns are fractal and reflect "the fingerprint of nature".&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature" /&gt;

Taylor noted several similarities between Pollock's painting style and the processes used by nature to construct its landscapes.  For instance, he cites Pollock's propensity to revisit paintings that he had not adjusted in several weeks as being comparable to cyclic processes in nature, such as the seasons or the tides.&lt;ref name="artbook"&gt;[Taylor, Richard. "Fractal Expressionism—Where Art Meets Science." Art and Complexity. Ed. John Casti and Anders Karlqvist. 1st ed. Greenwich: JAI, 2003. 117-44. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Taylor observed several visual similarities between the patterns produced by nature and those produced by Pollock as he painted.  He points out that Pollock abandoned the use of a traditional frame for his paintings, preferring instead to roll out his canvas on the floor; this, Taylor asserts, is more compatible with how nature works than traditional painting techniques because the patterns in nature's scenery are not artificially bounded.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;

The perceived similarities between the processes and patterns involved in Pollock's paintings and those of nature compelled Taylor to posit that the same "basic trademark" of nature's pattern construction also appears in Pollock's work.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;  Since some natural fractals are generated by a process known as "chaos",&lt;ref name="chaosbook"&gt;[Cvitanovic´, Predrag, Roberto Artuso, Ronnie Mainieri, and Gábor Vattay. Chaos: Classical and Quantum. Copenhagen: Niels Bohr Institute, 2016. ChaosBook.org. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; including fractals in human physiology,&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Bassingthwaighte et al, Fractal Physiology, Oxford University press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor believed that Pollock's painting process might also have been chaotic, and could therefore leave behind a fractal pattern.  Taylor's hypothesis seems to be reflected in Pollock's statement "I am nature", which he made when asked if nature was a source of inspiration for his work.&lt;ref name="krasner"&gt;Krasner, Lee. "Lee Krasner Oral History." Interview by Dorothy Seckler. Archives of American Art. Smithsonian, 19 May 2005. Web. 30 Dec. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Pollock is also quoted as stating "No chaos, damn it",  in response to a Time magazine article that referred to his paintings as "chaotic".&lt;ref name="nochaos"&gt;[Karmel, Pepe, ed. Jackson Pollock: Key Interviews, Articles and Reviews. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;   However, chaos theory was not understood until after Pollock's death, so he could not have been referring to the chaotic systems in nature but rather its common usage to mean disorder. In the famous film footage of [[Hans Namuth]],&lt;ref name="[https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/ sfmoma]"&gt;[Jackson Pollock: Paintings Have a Life of Their Own. Perf. Jackson Pollock. SFMOMA. SFMOMA, n.d. Web. &lt;https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock says his paintings are no accident, and that he was able to control the flow of paint onto the canvas.

Taylor points to two aspects of Pollock's painting process that have the potential to introduce fractal patterns. The first is Pollock's motion as he moved around the canvas, which Taylor hypothesized followed a Levy flight, a type of chaotic motion that is known to leave behind a fractal pattern.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"&gt;[Mandelbrot, Benoit B. The Fractal Geometry of Nature. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1982. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, a number of studies have shown that the motions associated with human balance have fractal characteristics. The second source of chaos could be introduced through Pollock's pouring technique.  Falling fluid has the capability of changing from a non-chaotic to a chaotic flow, meaning that Pollock could have introduced a chaotic flow of paint as he dripped it onto the canvas.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt; Although the fractal characteristics of human balance and falling liquid are generated on Pollock's painting time and length scales, physicist [[Predrag Cvitanovic]] notes that it would be quite an artistic challenge to control them: such parameters "are in no sense observable and measurable on the length-scales and time-scales dominated by chaotic dynamics".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Since Taylor's initial Pollock analysis in 1999, more than ten research groups have used various forms of fractal analysis to successfully quantify Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Mureika, C.C. Dyer, G.C. Cupchik, “Multifractal Structure in Nonrepresentational Art”, Physical Review E, vol. 72, 046101-1-15 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C. Redies, J 2007"&gt;C. Redies, J. Hasenstein and J.

Lee, S 2007"/&gt; Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (who invented the term fractal) and art theorist Francis O’Connor (the chief Pollock scholar) are well known advocates of fractal expressionism.&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"&gt;J. Rehmeyer, “Fractal or Fake?”, ScienceNews, vol. 171, 122-123, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see o'conner's website&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relationship between fractal expressionism and fractal fluency ==

Fractal expressionism is related to fractal fluency&lt;ref&gt;23 Taylor, RP, and Spehar B, Fractal Fleuncy: An Intimate Relationship Between the Brain and Processing of Fractal Stimuli, In: The Fractal Geometry of the Brain. New York: Springer; 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; because the latter provides an appealing motivation for why artists such as Pollock might aspire to Fractal Expressionism.  Fractal fluency is a neuroscience model that proposes that, through exposure to nature’s fractal scenery, people’s visual systems have adapted to efficiently process fractals with ease. This adaptation occurs at many stages of the visual system, from the way people’s eyes move to which regions of the brain get activated. Fluency puts the viewer in a ‘comfort zone’ so inducing an aesthetic experience. Neuroscience experiments have shown that Pollock’s paintings induce the same positive physiological responses in the observer as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals.&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"&gt;R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar, P. Van Donkelaar and C.M. Hagerhall, “Perceptual and Physiological Responses to Jackson Pollock’s Fractals,” Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, vol. 5 1- 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of fractal fluency and the associated aesthetics, other artists might be expected to display fractal expressionism. One year before Taylor’s publication, mathematician Richard Voss quantified Chinese art using fractal analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"&gt;R. Voss, Fractal Image Encoding and Analysis, Springer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other groups have used computer analysis to identify fractal content in a number of Western and Eastern artists,&lt;ref name="C. Redies, J 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D.J. Field, 2008"/&gt; most recently in Pollock’s colleague Willem De Kooning’s work.&lt;ref&gt;A. Forsythe et al, Journal of Neurophysiology, vol. 31, 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above analyzed works, symbolic representations of fractals can be found in cultures across the continents spanning several centuries, including Roman, Egyptian, Aztec, Incan and Mayan civilizations. They frequently predate patterns named after the mathematicians who subsequently developed their visual characteristics. For example, although von Koch is famous for developing The Koch Curve in 1904, a similar shape featuring repeating triangles was first used to depict waves in friezes by Hellenic artists (300 B.C.E.). In the 13th century, repetition of triangles in Cosmati Mosaics generated a shape later known in mathematics as The Sierpinski Triangle (named after Sierpinski’s 1915 pattern). Triangular repetitions are also found in the 12th century pulpit of The Ravello Cathedral in Italy. The lavish artwork within The Book of Kells (circa 800 C.E.) and the sculpted arabesques in The Jain Dilwara Temple in Mount Abu, India (1031 C.E.) also both reveal stunning examples of exact fractals. The artistic works of Leonardo da Vinci and Katsushika Hokusai serve as more recent examples from Europe and Asia, each reproducing the recurring patterns that they saw in nature. Da Vinci’s sketch of turbulence in water, The Deluge (1571–1518), was composed of small swirls within larger swirls of water. In The Great Wave off Kanagawa (1830–1833), Hokusai portrayed a wave crashing on a shore with small waves on top of a large wave. Other woodcuts from the same period also feature repeating patterns at several size scales: The Ghost of Kohada Koheiji shows fissures in a skull and The Falls At Mt. Kurokami features branching channels in a waterfall.

== The use of fractals to authenticate art and the associated controversy ==

Voss's 1998 study of Chinese art was the first demonstration of using fractal analysis to distinguish between the works of different artists.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"/&gt; Following Taylor's 1999 Pollock publication, Art conservator Jim Coddington proposed that fractal analysis should be explored as a technique to help authenticate Pollock paintings. In 2005, Taylor and colleagues published a fractal analysis of 14 authentic and 37 imitation Pollocks suggesting that, when combined with other techniques, fractal analysis might be useful for authenticating Pollock's work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Authenticating Pollock Paintings Using Fractal Geometry”, Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 28, 695-702 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, The Pollock-Krasner Foundation requested a fractal analysis to be used for the first time in an authenticity dispute,&lt;ref&gt;A Abbott, Fractals and art: In the hands of a master, Nature 439, 648-650 (9 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis identified “significant deviations from Pollock’s characteristics.” Taylor cautioned that the results should be “coupled with other important information such as provenance, connoisseurship and materials analysis.” Two years later, materials scientists showed that pigments on the paintings dated from after Pollock’s death.
 
In 2006, the use of fractals to authenticate Pollocks stirred controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Jones-Smith et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings”Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E9-10, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings” Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E10-11, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt; This controversy was triggered by physicists Katherine Jones-Smith and Harsh Mathur who claimed that the fractal characteristics identified by Taylor et al. are also present in crude sketches made in [[Adobe Photoshop]],&lt;ref name="kate2006nature"&gt;[Jones-Smith, Katherine. "Revisiting Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 444.7119 (2006): E9-E10. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; and deliberately fraudulent poured paintings made by other artists&lt;ref name="kate2006nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="physrevE"&gt;[ Jones-Smith, Katherine, Harsh Mathur, and Lawrence M. Krauss. "Drip paintings and fractal analysis." Physical Review E 79.4 (2009): 046111. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Jones-Smith and Mathur, labeling Pollock's paintings as "fractal" is meaningless, because the same characteristics are found in other non-fractal images. However, Taylor's rebuttal published in Nature&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"/&gt; showed that Taylor's group's fractal analysis could distinguish between Pollock paintings and the crude sketches, and identified further limitations in Jones-Smith and Mathur's analysis.

Jones-Smith and Mathur raised a valid concern applicable to all forms of fractal expressionism: are art works too small for the painted patterns to repeat over sufficient magnifications to assume the visual characteristics of fractals? In the case of Pollock paintings, the largest range used by Taylor et al. to determine each fractal parameter in a Pollock painting is less than two orders of magnitude in magnification. Nature's fractals repeat over limited magnification ranges (typically just over one order of magnitude), prompting scientists to debate what range is required to reliably establish fractal behavior.&lt;ref name="Ave/Man"&gt;[Avnir, David, Ofer Biham, Daniel M. Lidar, and Ofer Malcai. "Is the Geometry of Nature Fractal?" Science 279.5347 (1998): 39-40. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot refused to include a required magnification range in his definition of fractals and instead noted that it is the range necessary to generate the properties associated with fractal repetition. In the case of Pollock's work, this would be the magnification range necessary for the patterns to generate the fractal aesthetics. Neuroscience experiments have shown that this magnification range is less than two orders and that Pollock’s paintings do indeed induce the same physiological responses as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"/&gt; Mandelbrot concluded "I do believe that Pollocks are fractal."&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt;

At the time of the controversy, Coddington summarized as follows: “Fractal geometry has begun to play an important role in the authentication of the work of Jackson Pollock. We believe such analyses are necessary for pushing the field forward.”&lt;ref&gt;(J. Coddington et al, Proceedings SPIE, vol. 6810, 68100F 1-12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent results, In 2015, by computer scientist Lior Shamir showed that, when combined with other pattern parameters, fractal analysis can be used to distinguish between real and imitation Pollocks with 93% accuracy. He found that the fractal parameters were the most powerful contributors to the detection accuracy&lt;ref&gt;L. Shamar, “What Makes a Pollock Pollock: A Machine Vision Approach”, International Journal of Arts and Technology, vol. 8, 1-10, (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geometry template''' is a piece of clear plastic with cut-out shapes for use in [[mathematics]] and other subjects in [[primary school]] through [[secondary school]].  It also has various measurements on its sides to be used like a [[ruler]]. In Australia, popular brands include Mathomat and MathAid.  

==Brands==
===Mathomat and Mathaid===
Mathomat is a trademark used for a plastic stencil developed in Australia by Craig Young in 1969, who originally worked as an engineering tradesperson in the [[Government Aircraft Factories]] (GAF) in Melbourne before retraining and working as head of mathematics in a secondary school in Melbourne. Young designed Mathomat to address what he perceived as limitations of traditional mathematics drawing sets in classrooms, mainly caused by students losing parts of the sets. The Mathomat stencil has a large number of geometric shapes stencils combined with the functions of a [[Technical drawing tool|technical drawing set]] (rulers, set squares, protractor and circles stencils to replace a compass). 

The template made use [[polycarbonate]] – a new type of thermoplastic polymer when Mathomat first came out – which was strong and transparent enough to allow for a large number of stencil shapes to be included in its design without breaking or tearing. The first template was exhibited in 1970 at a mathematics conference in Melbourne along with a series of popular mathematics teaching lesson plan; it became an immediate success with a large number of schools specifying it as a required students purchase. As of 2017, the stencil is widely specified in Australian schools, chiefly for students at early secondary school level. The manufacturing of Mathomat was taken over in 1989 by the W&amp;G drawing instrument company, which had a factory in Melbourne for manufacture of technical drawing instruments. Young also developed MathAid, which was initially produced by him when he was living in [[Ringwood, Victoria]]. He later sold the company.

W&amp;G published a series of teacher resource books for Mathomat authored by various teachers and academics who were interested in Mathomat as a teaching product.

His major work was [[Dasadhyayi]], a commentary on the first ten chapters of the astrological text [[Brihat Jataka]] composed by [[Varahamihira|Varāhamihira]] (505 – 587 [[BCE|CE]]). This is considered to be the most important of the 70 known commentaries on this text.&lt;ref name="Joseph"/&gt; Bhaṭṭathiri had also authored another important work in astrology titled ''Muhūrttaratnaṃ''. [[Paramesvara]] (ca.1380–1460), an astronomer of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics known for the introduction of the ''Dṛggaṇita'' system of astronomical computations, had composed an extensive commentary on this work. In this commentary Paramesvara had indicated that he was a grandson of a disciple of the author of ''Muhūrttaratnaṃ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Govonda Bhattathiri|title=Muhurtha Rathnam (Sri Parameshwarakritha Vyakhyopetham)|editor=A.

It is then a matter of selecting which terms in '''A''' are non-zero and assigning their values. The model completion becomes an [[Mathematical optimization|optimisation]] problem to determine the non-zero values in '''A''' that minimizes the error terms '''m(f,p,Ac)''' over the data.&lt;ref name="Bohlin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" &gt;Kojovic, T., and Whiten W. J., 1994.

== Model completion ==

Once a selection of non-zero values is made, the remaining coefficients in '''A''' can be determined by minimizing '''''m''(''f'',''p'',''Ac'')''' over the data with respect to the nonzero values in '''A''', typically by [[non-linear least squares]]. Selection of the nonzero terms can be done by optimization methods such as [[simulated annealing]] and [[evolutionary algorithms]]. Also the [[non-linear least squares]] can provide accuracy estimates&lt;ref name="Press07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash87" /&gt; for the elements of '''A''' that can be used to determine if they are significantly different from zero, thus providing a method of [[Model selection|term selection]].&lt;ref name="Linhart86"&gt;{{cite book|first=H. |last=Linhart|first2=W. |last2=Zucchini|title=Model selection|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=fzDm34Z8ctUC}}|year=1986|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-83722-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller02"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan |last=Miller|title=Subset Selection in Regression|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=V-vLBQAAQBAJ}}|date=15 April 2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-3593-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes possible to calculate values of '''q''' for each data set, directly or by [[non-linear least squares]]. Then the more efficient [[linear regression]] can be used to predict '''q''' using '''c'''  thus selecting the non-zero values in '''A''' and estimating their values. Once the non-zero values are located [[non-linear least squares]] can be used on the original model '''m(f,p,Ac)''' to refine these values .&lt;ref name="Whiten71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"/&gt;

A third method is [[model inversion]],&lt;ref name="Whiten13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"/&gt; which converts the non-linear '''m'''('''f''','''p''','''Ac''') into an approximate linear form in the elements of '''A''', that can be examined using efficient term selection&lt;ref name="Linhart86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller02"/&gt; and evaluation of the linear regression.&lt;ref name="Lawson96"/&gt;  For the simple case of a single '''q''' value ('''q''' = '''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c''') and an estimate '''q*''' of '''q'''. Putting d'''q'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c'''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;'''q*''' gives

: '''m(f,p,a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c) = m(f,p,q* + '''d'''q) ≈ m(f,p.q*) + '''d'''q m’(f,p,q*) = m(f,p.q*) + (a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c − q*) m’(f,p,q*)'''

so that '''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is now in a linear position with all other terms known, and thus can be analyzed by [[linear regression]] techniques. For more than one parameter the method extends in a direct manner.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt; After checking that the model has been improved this process can be repeated until convergence. This approach has the advantages that it does not need the parameters '''q''' to be able to be determined from an individual data set and the linear regression is on the original error terms&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;

== Model validation ==

Where sufficient data is available, division of the data into a separate model construction set and one or two [[Cross-validation (statistics)|evaluation sets]] is recommended. This can be repeated using multiple selections of the construction set and the [[Bootstrap aggregating|resulting models averaged]] or used to evaluate prediction differences.

A statistical test such as [[Chi-squared distribution|chi-squared]] on the residuals is not particularly useful.&lt;ref name="Deming2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=William Edwards | last = Deming|title=Out of the Crisis p272|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LA15eDlOPgoC |page=272}}|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54115-2| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chi squared test requires known standard deviations which are seldom available, and failed tests give no indication of how to improve the model&lt;ref name="Press07" /&gt;

An attempt to predict the residuals '''m(, )''' with the operating conditions '''c''' using linear regression will show if the residuals can be predicted.&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"/&gt; Residuals that cannot be predicted offer little prospect of improving the model using the current operating conditions.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt; Terms that do predict the residuals are prospective terms to incorporate into the model to improve its performance.&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" /&gt;

The model inversion technique above can be used as a method of determining whether a model can be improved. In this case selection of nonzero terms is not so important and linear prediction can be done using the significant [[eigenvectors]] of the [[Design matrix|regression matrix]]. The values in '''A''' determined in this manner need to be substituted into the nonlinear model to assess improvements in the model errors. The absence of a significant improvement indicates the available data is not able to improve the current model form using the defined parameters.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt; Extra parameters can be inserted into the model to make this test more comprehensive.

This page gives some very general background to the mathematical idea of [[topos]]. This is an aspect of [[category theory]], and has a reputation for being abstruse. The level of abstraction involved cannot be reduced beyond a certain point; but on the other hand context can be given. This is partly in terms of historical development, but also to some extent an explanation of differing attitudes to category theory. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==In the school of Grothendieck==
During the latter part of the 1950s, the foundations of [[algebraic geometry]] were being rewritten; and it is here that the origins of the '''topos''' concept are to be found. At that time the [[Weil conjectures]] were an outstanding motivation to research. As we now know, the route towards their proof, and other advances, lay in the construction of [[étale cohomology]].

With the benefit of hindsight, it can be said that algebraic geometry had been wrestling with two problems for a long time. The first was to do with its '''''points''''': back in the days of [[projective geometry]] it was clear that the absence of 'enough' points on an [[algebraic variety]] was a barrier to having a good geometric theory (in which it was somewhat like a [[Compact space|compact]] [[manifold]]). There was also the difficulty, that was clear as soon as [[topology]] took form in the first half of the twentieth century, that the topology of algebraic varieties had 'too few' open sets. 

The question of points was close to resolution by 1950; [[Alexander Grothendieck]] took a sweeping step (invoking the [[Yoneda lemma]]) that disposed of it &amp;mdash; naturally at a cost, that every variety or more general ''[[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]'' should become a [[functor]]. It wasn't possible to ''add'' open sets, though. The way forward was otherwise.

The topos definition first appeared somewhat obliquely, in or about 1960. General problems of so-called '[[descent (category theory)|descent]]' in algebraic geometry were considered, at the same period when the [[fundamental group]] was generalised to the algebraic geometry setting (as a [[pro-finite group]]). In the light of later work (c. 1970), 'descent' is part of the theory of [[comonad]]s; here we can see one way in which the Grothendieck school bifurcates in its approach from the 'pure' category theorists, a theme that is important for the understanding of how the topos concept was later treated.

There was perhaps a more direct route available: the [[abelian category]] concept had been introduced by Grothendieck in his foundational work on [[homological algebra]], to unify categories of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of abelian groups, and of [[module (mathematics)|modules]]. An abelian category is supposed to be closed under certain category-theoretic operations &amp;mdash; by using this kind of definition one can focus entirely on [[structure (category theory)|structure]], saying nothing at all about the nature of the objects involved. This type of definition can be traced back, in one line, to the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] concept of the 1930s. It was a possible question to ask, around 1957, for a purely category-theoretic characterisation of categories of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of ''sets'', the case of sheaves of abelian groups having been subsumed by Grothendieck's work (the [[Tohoku paper|''Tohoku'' paper]]).

Such a definition of a topos was eventually given five years later, around 1962, by Grothendieck and [[Jean-Louis Verdier|Verdier]] (see Verdier's Bourbaki seminar ''Analysis Situs''). The characterisation was by means of categories 'with enough [[colimit]]s', and applied to what is now called a [[Grothendieck topos]]. The theory was rounded out by establishing that a Grothendieck topos was a category of sheaves, where now the word ''sheaf'' had acquired an extended meaning, since it involved a [[Grothendieck topology]].

The idea of a Grothendieck topology (also known as a ''site'') has been characterised by [[John Tate]] as a bold pun on the two senses of [[Riemann surface]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Technically speaking it enabled the construction of the sought-after étale cohomology (as well as other refined theories such as [[flat cohomology]] and [[crystalline cohomology]]). At this point &amp;mdash; about 1964 &amp;mdash; the developments powered by algebraic geometry had largely run their course. The 'open set' discussion had effectively been summed up in the conclusion that varieties had a rich enough ''site'' of open sets in [[Ramification (mathematics)|unramified]] covers of their (ordinary) [[Zariski topology|Zariski-open sets]].

==From pure category theory to categorical logic==
{{See|categorical logic}}

The current definition of [[topos]] goes back to [[William Lawvere]] and Myles Tierney. While the timing follows closely on from that described above, as a matter of history, the attitude is different, and the definition is more inclusive. That is, there are examples of '''toposes''' that are not '''Grothendieck topos'''. What is more, these may be of interest for a number of logical disciplines.

Lawvere and Tierney's definition picks out the central role in topos theory of the '''[[sub-object classifier]]'''. In the usual category of sets, this is the two-element set of Boolean [[truth-value]]s, '''true''' and '''false'''. It is almost tautologous to say that the subsets of a given set ''X'' are ''the same as'' (just as good as) the functions on ''X'' to any such given two-element set: fix the 'first' element and make a subset ''Y'' correspond to the function sending ''Y'' there and its complement in ''X'' to the other element.

Now sub-object classifiers can be found in [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory. Still tautologously, though certainly more abstractly, for a [[topological space]] ''X'' there is a direct description of a sheaf on ''X'' that plays the role with respect to all sheaves of sets on ''X''. Its set of sections over an open set ''U'' of ''X'' is just the set of open subsets of ''U''. The [[sheaf (mathematics)|space associated with a sheaf]], for it, is more difficult to describe.

Lawvere and Tierney therefore formulated '''axioms for a topos''' that assumed a sub-object classifier, and some limit conditions (to make a [[cartesian-closed category]], at least). For a while this notion of topos was called 'elementary topos'.

Once the idea of a connection with logic was formulated, there were several developments 'testing' the new theory:

* models of set theory corresponding to proofs of the independence of the [[axiom of choice]] and [[continuum hypothesis]] by Cohen's method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]].
* recognition of the connection with [[Kripke semantics]], the [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] [[existential quantifier]] and [[intuitionistic type theory]].
* combining these, discussion of the [[intuitionistic theory of real numbers]], by sheaf models.

==Position of topos theory==
There was some irony that in the pushing through of [[David Hilbert]]'s long-range programme a natural home for [[intuitionistic logic]]'s central ideas was found: Hilbert had detested the school of [[L. E. J. Brouwer]]. Existence as 'local' existence in the sheaf-theoretic sense, now going by the name of [[Kripke–Joyal semantics]], is a good match. On the other hand Brouwer's long efforts on 'species', as he called the intuitionistic theory of reals, are presumably in some way subsumed and deprived of status beyond the historical. There is a theory of the real numbers in each topos, and so no one master intuitionist theory.

The later work on [[étale cohomology]] has tended to suggest that the full, general topos theory isn't required. On the other hand, other sites are used, and the Grothendieck topos has taken its place within homological algebra.

The Lawvere programme was to write higher-order logic in terms of category theory. That this can be done cleanly is shown by the book treatment by [[Joachim Lambek]] and [[P. J. Scott]]. What results is essentially an intuitionistic (i.e. [[constructive logic]]) theory, its content being clarified by the existence of a ''free topos''. That is a set theory, in a broad sense, but also something belonging to the realm of pure [[syntax]]. The structure on its sub-object classifier is that of a [[Heyting algebra]]. To get a more classical set theory one can look at toposes in which it is moreover a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], or specialising even further, at those with just two truth-values.  In that book, the talk is about [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]]; but in fact this can be read as foundational [[computer science]] (which is not mentioned). If one wants to discuss set-theoretic operations, such as the formation of the image (range) of a function, a topos is guaranteed to be able to express this, entirely constructively.

It also produced a more accessible spin-off in [[pointless topology]], where the ''locale'' concept isolates some of more accessible insights found by treating ''topos'' as a significant development of ''topological space''. The slogan is 'points come later': this brings discussion full circle on this page. The point of view is written up in Peter Johnstone's ''Stone Spaces'', which has been called by a leader in the field of computer science 'a treatise on [[extensionality]]'. The extensional is treated in mathematics as ambient - it is not something about which mathematicians really expect to have a theory. Perhaps this is why topos theory has been treated as an oddity; it goes beyond what the traditionally geometric way of thinking allows. The needs of thoroughly intensional theories such as untyped [[lambda calculus]] have been met in [[denotational semantics]]. Topos theory has long looked like a possible 'master theory' in this area.

==Summary==
The ''topos'' concept arose in algebraic geometry, as a consequence of combining the concept of ''sheaf'' and ''closure under categorical operations''. It plays a certain definite role in cohomology theories.

The subsequent developments associated with logic are more interdisciplinary. They include examples drawing on [[homotopy theory]] ([[classifying topos]]es). They involve links between category theory and mathematical logic, and also (as a high-level, organisational discussion) between category theory and theoretical computer science based on [[type theory]]. Granted the general view of [[Saunders Mac Lane]] about ''ubiquity'' of concepts, this gives them a definite status. A 'killer application' is [[étale cohomology]].

[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (ε = 1/ω)]]

In [[mathematics]], '''infinitesimals''' are things so small that there is no way to measure them. The insight with exploiting infinitesimals was that entities could still retain certain specific properties, such as [[angle]] or [[slope]], even though these entities were quantitatively small.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/#1&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''infinitesimal'' comes from a 17th-century [[New Latin|Modern Latin]] coinage ''infinitesimus'', which originally referred to the "[[Infinity|infinite]][[Ordinal number (linguistics)|-th]]" item in a sequence.  
Infinitesimals are a basic ingredient in the procedures of infinitesimal [[calculus]] as developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], including the [[law of continuity]] and the [[transcendental law of homogeneity]]. In common speech, an infinitesimal object is an object that is smaller than any feasible measurement, but not zero in size—or, so small that it cannot be distinguished from zero by any available means. Hence, when used as an adjective, "infinitesimal" means "extremely small".  To give it a meaning, it usually must be compared to another infinitesimal object in the same context (as in a [[derivative]]).  Infinitely many infinitesimals are summed to produce an [[integral]].

The concept of infinitesimals was originally introduced around 1670 by either [[Nicolaus Mercator]] or [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

I. SCIAMVS 2 (2001), 9–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In his formal published treatises, Archimedes solved the same problem using the [[method of exhaustion]].  The 15th century saw the work of [[Nicholas of Cusa]], further developed in the 17th century by [[Johannes Kepler]], in particular calculation of area of a circle by representing the latter as an infinite-sided polygon. [[Simon Stevin]]'s work on decimal representation of all numbers in the 16th century prepared the ground for the real continuum. [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]]'s method of indivisibles led to an extension of the results of the classical authors.  The method of indivisibles related to geometrical figures as being composed of entities of [[codimension]] 1. [[John Wallis]]'s infinitesimals differed from indivisibles in that he would decompose geometrical figures into infinitely thin building blocks of the same dimension as the figure, preparing the ground for general methods of the integral calculus.  He exploited an infinitesimal denoted [[1/∞]] in area calculations.

The use of infinitesimals by Leibniz relied upon heuristic principles, such as the law of continuity: what succeeds for the finite numbers succeeds also for the infinite numbers and vice versa; and the transcendental law of homogeneity that specifies procedures for replacing expressions involving inassignable quantities, by expressions involving only assignable ones. The 18th century saw routine use of infinitesimals by mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] exploited infinitesimals both in defining [[continuous function|continuity]] in his ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'', and in defining an early form of a [[Dirac delta function]].  As Cantor and Dedekind were developing more abstract versions of Stevin's continuum, [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]] wrote a series of papers on infinitesimal-enriched continua based on growth rates of functions.  Du Bois-Reymond's work inspired both [[Émile Borel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]].  Borel explicitly linked du Bois-Reymond's work to Cauchy's work on rates of growth of infinitesimals.  Skolem developed the first non-standard models of arithmetic in 1934.  A mathematical implementation of both the law of continuity and infinitesimals was achieved by [[Abraham Robinson]] in 1961, who developed [[non-standard analysis]] based on earlier work by [[Edwin Hewitt]] in 1948 and [[Jerzy Łoś]] in 1955.  The [[hyperreal number|hyperreals]] implement an infinitesimal-enriched continuum and the [[transfer principle]] implements Leibniz's law of continuity. The [[standard part function]] implements Fermat's [[adequality]].

[[Vladimir Arnold]] wrote in 1990:
:Nowadays, when teaching analysis, it is not very popular to talk about infinitesimal quantities. Consequently present-day students are not fully in command of this language. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to have command of it.&lt;ref&gt;Arnolʹd, V. I. ''Huygens and Barrow, Newton and Hooke. Pioneers in mathematical analysis and catastrophe theory from evolvents to quasicrystals''. Translated from the Russian by Eric J. F. Primrose. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, 1990. p.&amp;nbsp;27&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the infinitesimal==
The notion of infinitely small quantities was discussed by the [[Eleatic School]]. The [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] (c.287 BC–c.212 BC), in ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]'', was the first to propose a logically rigorous definition of infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;Archimedes, ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems''; see [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Archimedean property]] defines a number ''x'' as infinite if it satisfies the conditions |''x''|&gt;1, |''x''|&gt;1+1, |''x''|&gt;1+1+1, ..., and infinitesimal if ''x''≠0 and a similar set of conditions holds for ''x'' and the reciprocals of the positive integers. A number system is said to be Archimedean if it contains no infinite or infinitesimal members.

The English mathematician [[John Wallis]] introduced the expression 1/∞ in his 1655 book ''Treatise on the Conic Sections''. The symbol, which denotes the reciprocal, or inverse, of&amp;nbsp;[[∞]], is the symbolic representation of the mathematical concept of an infinitesimal. In his ''Treatise on the Conic Sections'' Wallis also discusses the concept of a relationship between the symbolic representation of infinitesimal 1/∞ that he introduced and the concept of infinity for which he introduced the symbol&amp;nbsp;∞. The concept suggests a [[thought experiment]] of adding an infinite number of [[parallelogram]]s of infinitesimal width to form a finite area.  This concept was the predecessor to the modern method of integration used in [[integral calculus]]. The conceptual origins of the concept of the infinitesimal 1/∞ can be traced as far back as the Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]], whose [[Zeno's dichotomy paradox]] was the first mathematical concept to consider the relationship between a finite interval and an interval approaching that of an infinitesimal-sized interval.

Infinitesimals were the subject of political and religious controversies in 17th century Europe, including a ban on infinitesimals issued by clerics in Rome in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World|author=[[Amir Alexander]]|isbn=978-0374176815|year=2014|publisher=Scientific American / Farrar, Straus and Giroux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the invention of calculus mathematicians were able to calculate tangent lines using [[Pierre de Fermat]]'s method of [[adequality]] and [[René Descartes]]' [[method of normals]].  There is debate among scholars as to whether the method was infinitesimal or algebraic in nature.  When [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] invented the [[Infinitesimal calculus|calculus]], they made use of infinitesimals, Newton's ''[[fluxion (mathematics)|fluxions]]'' and Leibniz' ''[[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]''. The use of infinitesimals was attacked as incorrect by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] in his work ''[[The Analyst]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George Berkeley, ''The Analyst; or a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician''&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians, scientists, and engineers continued to use infinitesimals to produce correct results. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the calculus was reformulated by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], [[Dedekind]], and others using the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] and [[set theory]].  
While the followers of Cantor, Dedekind, and Weierstrass sought to rid analysis of infinitesimals, and their philosophical allies like [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] declared that infinitesimals are ''pseudoconcepts'', [[Hermann Cohen]] and his [[Marburg school]] of [[neo-Kantianism]] sought to develop a working logic of infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mormann]]; [[Mikhail Katz]]. Infinitesimals as an issue of neo-Kantian philosophy of science. [[International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science|HOPOS]]: The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science 3 (2013), no. 2, 236–280. {{doi|10.1086/671348}}. {{JSTOR|10.1086/671348}}. {{arXiv|1304.1027}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mathematical study of systems containing infinitesimals continued through the work of [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Levi-Civita]], [[Giuseppe Veronese]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], and others, throughout the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, as documented by [[Philip Ehrlich]] (2006).  In the 20th century, it was found that infinitesimals could serve as a basis for calculus and analysis; see [[hyperreal number]].

==First-order properties==
In extending the real numbers to include infinite and infinitesimal quantities, one typically wishes to be as conservative as possible by not changing any of their elementary properties. This guarantees that as many familiar results as possible are still available. Typically ''elementary'' means that there is no [[quantification (logic)|quantification]] over [[set (mathematics)|sets]], but only over elements. This limitation allows statements of the form "for any number x..." For example, the axiom that states "for any number&amp;nbsp;''x'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''" would still apply. The same is true for quantification over several numbers, e.g., "for any numbers&amp;nbsp;''x'' and ''y'', ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''yx''."  However, statements of the form "for any ''set''&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;of numbers&amp;nbsp;..." may not carry over. Logic with this limitation on quantification is referred to as [[first-order logic]].

The resulting extended number system cannot agree with the reals on all properties that can be expressed by quantification over sets, because the goal is to construct a non-Archimedean system, and the Archimedean principle can be expressed by quantification over sets. One can conservatively extend any theory including reals, including set theory, to include infinitesimals, just by adding a countably infinite list of axioms that assert that a number is smaller than 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and so on. Similarly, the [[Complete metric space|completeness]] property cannot be expected to carry over, because the reals are the unique complete ordered field up to isomorphism.

We can distinguish three levels at which a nonarchimedean number system could have first-order properties compatible with those of the reals:

# An [[ordered field]] obeys all the usual axioms of the real number system that can be stated in first-order logic. For example, the [[commutativity]] axiom ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'' holds.
# A [[real closed field]] has all the first-order properties of the real number system, regardless of whether they are usually taken as axiomatic, for statements involving the basic ordered-field relations +,&amp;nbsp;×, and&amp;nbsp;≤. This is a stronger condition than obeying the ordered-field axioms.  More specifically, one includes additional first-order properties, such as the existence of a root for every odd-degree polynomial. For example, every number must have a [[cube root]].
# The system could have all the first-order properties of the real number system for statements involving ''any'' relations (regardless of whether those relations can be expressed using&amp;nbsp;+,&amp;nbsp;×, and&amp;nbsp;≤). For example, there would have to be a [[sine]] function that is well defined for infinite inputs; the same is true for every real function.

Systems in category 1, at the weak end of the spectrum, are relatively easy to construct, but do not allow a full treatment of classical analysis using infinitesimals in the spirit of Newton and Leibniz. For example, the [[transcendental functions]] are defined in terms of infinite limiting processes, and therefore there is typically no way to define them in first-order logic. Increasing the analytic strength of the system by passing to categories&amp;nbsp;2 and&amp;nbsp;3, we find that the flavor of the treatment tends to become less constructive, and it becomes more difficult to say anything concrete about the hierarchical structure of infinities and infinitesimals.

==Number systems that include infinitesimals==

===Formal series===

====Laurent series====
An example from category 1 above is the field of [[Laurent series]] with a finite number of negative-power terms. For example, the Laurent series consisting only of the constant term 1 is identified with the real number&amp;nbsp;1, and the series with only the linear term&amp;nbsp;''x'' is thought of as the simplest infinitesimal, from which the other infinitesimals are constructed. Dictionary ordering is used, which is equivalent to considering higher powers of&amp;nbsp;''x'' as negligible compared to lower powers. [[David O. Tall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jonhoyle.com/MAAseaway/Infinitesimals.html |title=Infinitesimals in Modern Mathematics |publisher=Jonhoyle.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713115815/http://www.jonhoyle.com/MAAseaway/Infinitesimals.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to this system as the super-reals, not to be confused with the [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin. Since a Taylor series evaluated with a Laurent series as its argument is still a Laurent series, the system can be used to do calculus on transcendental functions if they are analytic. These infinitesimals have different first-order properties than the reals because, for example, the basic infinitesimal&amp;nbsp;''x'' does not have a square root.

====The Levi-Civita field====
The [[Levi-Civita field]] is similar to the Laurent series, but is algebraically closed. For example, the basic infinitesimal x has a square root. This field is rich enough to allow a significant amount of analysis to be done, but its elements can still be represented on a computer in the same sense that real numbers can be represented in floating point.&lt;ref&gt;Khodr Shamseddine, "Analysis on the Levi-Civia Field: A Brief Overview," http://www.uwec.edu/surepam/media/RS-Overview.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transseries====
The field of [[transseries]] is larger than the Levi-Civita field.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Edgar, "Transseries for Beginners," http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~edgar/preprints/trans_begin/&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a transseries is:

:&lt;math&gt;e^\sqrt{\ln\ln x}+\ln\ln x+\sum_{j=0}^\infty e^x x^{-j},&lt;/math&gt;

where for purposes of ordering ''x'' is considered infinite.

===Surreal numbers===
Conway's [[surreal numbers]] fall into category 2. They are a system designed to be as rich as possible in different sizes of numbers, but not necessarily for convenience in doing analysis. Certain transcendental functions can be carried over to the surreals, including logarithms and exponentials, but most, e.g., the sine function, cannot{{fact|date=May 2017}}&lt;!--this seems dubious, see [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/91337/uniformizing-the-surcomplex-unit-circle] In any case, to make the assertion clear, one should be make precise what it is to be expected from such extensions --&gt;. The existence of any particular surreal number, even one that has a direct counterpart in the reals, is not known a priori, and must be proved.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

===Hyperreals===
{{Main article|Hyperreal number}}
The most widespread technique for handling infinitesimals is the hyperreals, developed by [[Abraham Robinson]] in the 1960s. They fall into category 3 above, having been designed that way so all of classical analysis can be carried over from the reals. This property of being able to carry over all relations in a natural way is known as the [[transfer principle]], proved by [[Jerzy Łoś]] in 1955.  For example, the transcendental function sin has a natural counterpart *sin that takes a hyperreal input and gives a hyperreal output, and similarly the set of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; has a natural counterpart &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, which contains both finite and infinite integers. A proposition such as &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \sin n\pi=0&lt;/math&gt; carries over to the hyperreals as &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in {}^*\mathbb{N}, {}^*\!\!\sin n\pi=0&lt;/math&gt; .

===Superreals===
The [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin is a generalization of the hyperreals. It is different from the super-real system defined by [[David O. Tall|David Tall]].

===Dual numbers===
{{Main article|Dual number}}
In [[linear algebra]], the [[dual number]]s extend the reals by adjoining one infinitesimal, the new element ε with the property ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 (that is, ε is [[nilpotent]]). Every dual number has the form ''z'' = ''a'' + ''b''ε with ''a'' and ''b'' being uniquely determined real numbers.

One application of dual numbers is [[automatic differentiation]]. This application can be generalized to polynomials in n variables, using the [[Exterior algebra]] of an n-dimensional vector space.

===Smooth infinitesimal analysis ===
{{Main article|Smooth infinitesimal analysis}}
[[Synthetic differential geometry]] or [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] have roots in [[category theory]]. This approach departs from the classical logic used in conventional mathematics by denying the general applicability of the [[law of excluded middle]] – i.e., ''not'' (''a'' ≠ ''b'') does not have to mean ''a'' = ''b''. A ''nilsquare'' or ''[[nilpotent]]'' infinitesimal can then be defined. This is a number ''x'' where ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 is true, but ''x'' = 0 need not be true at the same time.  Since the background logic is [[intuitionistic logic]], it is not immediately clear how to classify this system with regard to classes 1, 2, and 3.  Intuitionistic analogues of these classes would have to be developed first.

==Infinitesimal delta functions==
[[Cauchy]] used an infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to write down a unit impulse, infinitely tall and narrow Dirac-type delta function &lt;math&gt;\delta_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\int F(x)\delta_\alpha(x) = F(0)&lt;/math&gt; in a number of articles in 1827, see Laugwitz (1989).  Cauchy defined an infinitesimal in 1821 (Cours d'Analyse) in terms of a sequence tending to zero.  Namely, such a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in Cauchy's and [[Lazare Carnot]]'s terminology.

Modern set-theoretic approaches allow one to define infinitesimals via the [[ultrapower]] construction, where a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in the sense of an equivalence class modulo a relation defined in terms of a suitable [[ultrafilter]]. The article by Yamashita (2007) contains a bibliography on modern [[Dirac delta function]]s in the context of an infinitesimal-enriched continuum provided by the [[hyperreal number|hyperreals]].

==Logical properties==
The method of constructing infinitesimals of the kind used in nonstandard analysis depends on the [[Model theory|model]] and which collection of [[axiom]]s are used. We consider here systems where infinitesimals can be shown to exist.

In 1936 [[Anatoly Maltsev|Maltsev]] proved the [[compactness theorem]]. This theorem is fundamental for the existence of infinitesimals as it proves that it is possible to formalise them. A consequence of this theorem is that if there is a number system in which it is true that for any positive integer ''n'' there is a positive number ''x'' such that 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/''n'', then there exists an extension of that number system in which it is true that there exists a positive number ''x'' such that for any positive integer ''n'' we have 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/''n''. The possibility to switch  "for any" and "there exists" is crucial. The first statement is true in the real numbers as given in [[ZFC]] [[set theory]] : for any positive integer ''n'' it is possible to find a real number between 1/''n'' and zero, but this real number depends on ''n''. Here, one chooses ''n'' first, then one finds the corresponding ''x''. In the second expression, the statement says that there is an  ''x'' (at least one), chosen first, which is between 0 and 1/''n'' for any ''n''. In this case ''x'' is infinitesimal. This is not true in the real numbers ('''R''') given by ZFC. Nonetheless, the theorem proves that there is a model (a number system) in which this is true. The question is: what is this model? What are its properties? Is there only one such model?

There are in fact many ways to construct such a [[dimension|one-dimensional]] [[linear order|linearly ordered]] set of numbers, but fundamentally, there are two different approaches:

: 1) Extend the number system so that it contains more numbers than the real numbers.

: 2) Extend the axioms (or extend the language) so that the distinction between the infinitesimals and non-infinitesimals can be made in the real numbers themselves.

In 1960, [[Abraham Robinson]] provided an answer following the first approach. The extended set is called the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]] and contains numbers less in absolute value than any positive real number. The method may be considered relatively complex but it does prove that infinitesimals exist in the universe of ZFC set theory. The real numbers are called standard numbers and the new non-real hyperreals are called [[Non-standard analysis|nonstandard]].

In 1977 [[Edward Nelson]] provided an answer following the second approach. The extended axioms are IST, which stands either for [[Internal set theory]] or for the initials of the three extra axioms: Idealization, Standardization, Transfer. In this system we consider that the language is extended in such a way that we can express facts about infinitesimals. The real numbers are either standard or nonstandard. An infinitesimal is a nonstandard real number that is less, in absolute value, than any positive standard real number.

In 2006 Karel Hrbacek developed an extension of Nelson's approach in which the real numbers are stratified in (infinitely) many levels; i.e., in the coarsest level there are no infinitesimals nor unlimited numbers. Infinitesimals are in a finer level and there are also infinitesimals with respect to this new level and so on.

==Infinitesimals in teaching==
Calculus textbooks based on infinitesimals include the classic ''[[Calculus Made Easy]]'' by [[Silvanus P. Thompson]] (bearing the motto "What one fool can do another can"&lt;ref&gt;Available online at 
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33283&lt;/ref&gt;) and the German text ''Mathematik fur Mittlere Technische Fachschulen der Maschinenindustrie'' by R Neuendorff.&lt;ref&gt;R Neuendorff (1912) ''Lehrbuch der Mathematik fur Mittlere Technische Fachschulen der Maschinenindustrie'', Verlag Julius Springer, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneering works based on [[Abraham Robinson]]'s infinitesimals include texts by [[Stroyan]] (dating from 1972) and [[Howard Jerome Keisler]] ([[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]). Students easily relate to the intuitive notion of an infinitesimal difference 1-"[[0.999...]]", where  "0.999..." differs from its standard meaning as the real number 1, and is reinterpreted as an infinite terminating extended decimal that is strictly less than 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ely |first=Robert |year=2010 |title=Nonstandard student conceptions about infinitesimals |journal=[[Journal for Research in Mathematics Education]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=117–146 |jstor=20720128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.umt.edu/tmme/vol7no1/TMME_vol7no1_2010_article1_pp.3_30.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207075126/http://www.math.umt.edu/tmme/vol7no1/TMME_vol7no1_2010_article1_pp.3_30.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another elementary calculus text that uses the theory of infinitesimals as developed by Robinson is ''Infinitesimal Calculus'' by Henle and Kleinberg, originally published in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infinitesimal Calculus|last=Henle|first=James|last2=Kleinberg|first2=Eugene|publisher=The MIT Press, rereleased by Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors introduce the language of first order logic, and demonstrate the construction of a first order model of the hyperreal numbers.  The text provides an introduction to the basics of integral and differential calculus in one dimension, including sequences and series of functions.  In an Appendix, they also treat the extension of their model to the ''hyperhyper''reals, and demonstrate some applications for the extended model.

==Functions tending to zero==
In a related but somewhat different sense, which evolved from the original definition of "infinitesimal" as an infinitely small quantity, the term has also been used to refer to a function tending to zero.  More precisely, Loomis and Sternberg's ''Advanced Calculus'' defines the function class of infinitesimals, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}&lt;/math&gt;, as a subset of functions &lt;math&gt;f:V\to W&lt;/math&gt; between normed vector spaces by &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0, 
(\forall \epsilon&gt;0) (\exists \delta&gt;0)
\ \backepsilon\ ||\xi||&lt;\delta\implies
||f(\xi)||&lt;\epsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;/blockquote&gt;as well as two related classes &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{O},\mathfrak{o}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Big O notation|Big-O notation]]) by &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{O}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0,\ (\exist r&gt;0,c&gt;0)\ \backepsilon\  
||\xi||&lt; r \implies ||f(\xi)||\leq c||
\xi||\}&lt;/math&gt;, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{o}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0,\ \lim_{||\xi||\to 0} ||f(\xi)|| / ||\xi|| = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/LoomisL.H.SternbergS.AdvancedCalculusRevisedEditionJonesAndBartlett|title=Advanced Calculus|last=Loomis|first=Lynn Harold|last2=Sternberg|first2=Shlomo|publisher=World Scientific|year=2014|isbn=978-981-4583-92-3|location=Hackensack, N.J.|pages=138–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The set inclusions &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{o}(V,W)\subsetneq\mathfrak{O}(V,W)\subsetneq\mathfrak{I}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt;generally hold.  That the inclusions are proper is demonstrated by the real-valued functions of a real variable &lt;math&gt;f:x\mapsto |x|^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g:x\mapsto x &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h:x\mapsto x^2 &lt;/math&gt;:  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;f,g,h\in\mathfrak{I}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}),\  g,h\in\mathfrak{O}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}),\ 
h\in\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;f,g\notin\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\notin\mathfrak{O}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;As an application of these definitions, a mapping &lt;math&gt;F:V\to W&lt;/math&gt; between normed vector spaces is defined to be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in V&lt;/math&gt; if there is a &lt;math&gt;T\in\mathrm{Hom}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt; [i.e, a bounded linear map &lt;math&gt;V\to W&lt;/math&gt;] such that &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;[F(\alpha+\xi)-F(\alpha)]-T(\xi)\in \mathfrak{o}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;in a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  If such a map exists, it is unique; this map is called the ''differential'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;dF_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;This notation is not to be confused with the many other distinct usages of ''d'' in calculus that are all loosely related to the classical notion of the differential as "taking an infinitesimally small piece of something": ''(1)'' in the expression&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\, d\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt; indicates Riemann-Stieltjes integration with respect to the integrator function &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; ''(2)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;\int f\, d\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d\mu&lt;/math&gt; symbolizes Lebesgue integration with respect to a measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;; ''(3)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}^n} f\; dV&lt;/math&gt;, ''dV'' indicates integration with respect to volume; ''(4)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_n}&lt;/math&gt;, the letter ''d'' represents the exterior derivative operator, and so on....&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the traditional notation for the classical (though logically flawed) notion of a differential as an infinitely small "piece" of ''F''.  This definition represents a generalization of the usual definition of differentiability for vector-valued functions of (open subsets of) Euclidean spaces.

==Array of random variables==
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]] and let &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. An array &lt;math&gt;\{X_{n,k}:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}\mid 1\le k\le k_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; of [[random variable]]s is called infinitesimal if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we have:&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal |last=Barczyk|first=Adam |last2=Janssen|first2=Arnold |last3=Pauly|first3=Markus |year=2011 |title=The Asymptotics of L-statistics for non-i.i.d. variables with heavy tails|journal=[[Probability and mathematical statistics]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=285–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\max_{1\le k\le k_{n}}\mathbb{P}\{\omega\in\Omega\mid \vert X_{n,k}(\omega)\vert\geq\epsilon\}\to 0\text{ as } n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; 
The notion of infinitesimal array is essential in some central limit theorems and it is easily seen by monotonicity of the expectation operator that any array satisfying [[Lindeberg's condition]] is infinitesimal, thus playing an important role in [[Central limit theorem#Lindeberg CLT|Lindeberg's Central Limit Theorem]] (a generalization of the [[central limit theorem]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3975">In [[mathematics]], the concept of '''irreducibility''' is used in several ways.

* A [[polynomial]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] may be an [[irreducible polynomial]] if it cannot be factored over that field.
* In [[abstract algebra]], '''irreducible''' can be an abbreviation for [[irreducible element]] of an [[integral domain]]; for example an [[irreducible polynomial]].
*  In [[representation theory]], an '''[[irreducible representation]]''' is a nontrivial [[representation theory|representation]] with no nontrivial proper subrepresentations. Similarly, an '''irreducible module''' is another name for a [[simple module]].
* [[Absolutely irreducible]] is a term applied to mean [[irreducible]], even after any [[finite extension]] of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of coefficients.  It applies in various situations, for example to irreducibility of a [[linear representation]], or of an [[algebraic variety]]; where it means just the same as ''irreducible over an [[algebraic closure]]''.
* In [[commutative algebra]], a [[commutative ring]] ''R'' is irreducible if its [[prime spectrum]], that is, the topological space Spec ''R'', is an [[irreducible topological space]].
* A [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is irreducible if it is not [[similar matrix|similar]] via a [[permutation matrix|permutation]] to a [[block matrix|block]] [[upper triangular matrix]] (that has more than one block of positive size).  (Replacing non-zero entries in the matrix by one, and viewing the matrix as the adjacency matrix of a [[directed graph]], the matrix is irreducible if and only if such directed graph is [[Connectivity (graph theory)|strongly connected]].)
* Also, a [[Markov chain]] is [[Markov chain#Reducibility|irreducible]] if there is a non-zero probability of transitioning (even if in more than one step) from any state to any other state.
* In the theory of [[manifold]]s, an ''n''-manifold is [[irreducible manifold|irreducible]] if any embedded (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-sphere bounds an embedded ''n''-ball.  Implicit in this definition is the use of a suitable [[category (mathematics)|category]], such as the category of differentiable manifolds or the category of piecewise-linear manifolds. The notions of irreducibility in algebra and manifold theory are related.  An ''n''-manifold is called [[Connected sum|prime]], if it cannot be written as a [[connected sum]] of two ''n''-manifolds (neither of which is an ''n''-sphere). An irreducible manifold is thus prime, although the converse does not hold.  From an algebraist's perspective, prime manifolds should be called "irreducible"; however, the topologist (in particular the [[3-manifold]] topologist) finds the definition above more useful.  The only compact, connected 3-manifolds that are prime but not irreducible are the trivial 2-sphere bundle over ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the twisted 2-sphere bundle over ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  See, for example, [[Prime decomposition (3-manifold)]].
* A [[topological space]] is [[irreducible space|irreducible]] if it is not the union of two proper closed subsets. This notion is used in [[algebraic geometry]], where spaces are equipped with the [[Zariski topology]]; it is not of much significance for [[Hausdorff space]]s. See also [[irreducible component]], [[algebraic variety]].
* In [[universal algebra]], irreducible can refer to the inability to represent an [[algebraic structure]] as a composition of simpler structures using a product construction; for example [[subdirectly irreducible]].
* A [[3-manifold]] is [[P²-irreducible]] if it is irreducible and contains no [[2-sided]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb RP^2&lt;/math&gt; ([[real projective plane]]).
* An [[irreducible fraction]] (or fraction in lowest terms) is a [[vulgar fraction]] in which the [[numerator]] and [[denominator]] are smaller than those in any other equivalent fraction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7394">In [[mathematics]], the '''Iverson bracket''', named after [[Kenneth E. Iverson]]&lt;!-- mentioned here so it's clear that it's an upper-case 'i' not an 'l'. --&gt;, is a notation that 
generalises the [[Kronecker delta]]. It converts any [[Logic|logical proposition]] into a number that is 1 if the proposition is satisfied, and 0 otherwise, and is generally written 
by putting the proposition inside square brackets:
:&lt;math&gt;[P] = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if } P \text{ is true;} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise,} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''P''}} is a [[statement (logic)|statement]] that can be true or false.

In the context of [[summation]], the notation can be used to write any sum as an infinite sum without limits: 
If &lt;math&gt;P(k)&lt;/math&gt; is any
property of the integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_kf(k)\,[P(k)] = \sum_{P(k)}f(k).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that by this convention, a summand &lt;math&gt;f(k)[\textbf{false}]&lt;/math&gt; must evaluate to 0 regardless of whether &lt;math&gt;f(k)&lt;/math&gt; is defined.
Likewise for [[Product (mathematics)|products]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_kf(k)^{[P(k)]} = \prod_{P(k)}f(k).&lt;/math&gt;

The notation was originally introduced by [[Kenneth E. Iverson]] in his programming language [[APL (programming language)|APL]],&lt;ref name=APL&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth E. Iverson|date=1962|title=A Programming Language|page=11|publisher=Wiley|url=http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APL.htm|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Graham]], [[Donald Knuth]], and [[Oren Patashnik]]. ''[[Concrete Mathematics]]'', Section 2.2: Sums and Recurrences.&lt;/ref&gt; though restricted to single relational operators enclosed in parentheses, while the generalisation to arbitrary statements,  notational restriction to square brackets, and applications to summation, was advocated by [[Donald Knuth]] to avoid ambiguity in parenthesized logical expressions.&lt;ref name=TNN&gt;Donald Knuth, "Two Notes on Notation", ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', Volume 99, Number 5, May 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;403–422. ([http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/tnn.tex.gz TeX], {{arxiv|math/9205211}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
There is a direct correspondence between arithmetic on Iverson brackets, logic, and set operations. For instance, let ''A'' and ''B'' be sets and &lt;math&gt;P(k_1,\dots)&lt;/math&gt; any property of integers; then we have

:&lt;math&gt;[P \land Q] = [P][Q], \qquad [ \neg P ] = 1 - [P].&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;[P \lor Q] = [P] + [Q] - [P][Q].&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;[k\in A]+[k\in B]=[k\in A\cup B]+[k\in A\cap B].&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;[x \in A \cap B] = [x \in A] [x \in B].&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;[\forall m \ . \ P(k,m)]= \prod_m [P(k,m)].&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;[\exists m \ . \ P(k,m)]=\min \Bigl(1,\sum_m [P(k,m)]\Bigr) = 1 - \prod_m \Bigl( 1-[P(k,m)] \Bigr).&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\# \{ m \mid P(k,m)\} =\sum_m [P(k,m)].&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

The notation allows moving boundary conditions of summations (or integrals) as a separate factor into the summand, freeing up space around the summation operator, but more importantly allowing it to be manipulated algebraically.

===Double-counting rule=== &lt;!-- is there a better name for this ? might be confused with combinatorics... --&gt;
We mechanically derive a well-known sum manipulation rule using Iverson brackets:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{k\in A}f(k)+\sum_{k\in B}f(k)
&amp;=\sum_kf(k)\,[k\in A]+\sum_kf(k)\,[k\in B]\\
&amp;=\sum_kf(k)\,([k\in A]+[k\in B])
\\&amp;=\sum_kf(k)\,([k\in A\cup B]+[k\in A\cap B])
\\&amp;=\sum_{k\in A\cup
B}f(k)\ +\sum_{k\in A\cap B}f(k).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Summation interchange===
The well-known rule &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{j=1}^n\,\sum_{k=1}^jf(j,k)=\sum_{k=1}^n\,\sum_{j=k}^nf(j,k)&lt;/math&gt; is likewise easily derived:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{j=1}^n\,\sum_{k=1}^jf(j,k)
  &amp;=\sum_{j,k}f(j,k)\,[1\leq j\leq n]\,[1\leq k\leq j]
\\&amp;=\sum_{j,k}f(j,k)\,[1\leq k\leq j\leq n]
\\&amp;=\sum_{j,k}f(j,k)\,[1\leq k\leq n]\,[k\leq j\leq n]

\\&amp;=\sum_{k=1}^n\,\sum_{j=k}^nf(j,k).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Counting===
For instance, the [[Euler phi function]] that counts the number of positive integers up to ''n'' which are [[coprime]] to ''n'' can be expressed by
: &lt;math&gt; \phi(n)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}[\gcd(i,n)=1],\qquad\text{for }n\in\mathbb N^+.&lt;/math&gt;

===Simplification of special cases===
Another use of the Iverson bracket is to simplify equations with special cases. For example, the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{1\le k\le n \atop \gcd(k,n)=1}\!\!k = \frac{1}{2}n\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;

is valid for {{math|''n'' &amp;gt; 1}} but is off by {{sfrac|1|2}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}. To get an identity valid for all positive integers {{math|''n''}} (i.e., all values for which &lt;math&gt;\phi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined), a correction term involving the Iverson bracket may be added:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{1\le k\le n \atop \gcd(k,n)=1}\!\!k = \frac{1}{2}n(\varphi(n)+[n=1])&lt;/math&gt;

===Common functions===

Many common functions, especially those with a natural piecewise definition, may be expressed in terms of the Iverson bracket.  The [[Kronecker delta]] notation is a specific case of Iverson notation when the condition is equality. That is,
: &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij} = [i=j].&lt;/math&gt;

The [[indicator function]], often denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\chi_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;, is an Iverson bracket with set membership as its condition:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}_A(x) = [x\in A]&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Heaviside step function]], [[sign function]],&lt;ref name=APL/&gt; and absolute value function and are also easily expressed in this notation:
: &lt;math&gt; H(x) = [x &gt; 0]&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; \sgn(x) = [x &gt; 0] - [x &lt; 0]&lt;/math&gt;,
and
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} |x| &amp;= x[x&gt;0]-x[x&lt;0] \\ &amp;= x([x&gt;0]-[x&lt;0]) \\ &amp;= x\cdot\sgn(x).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The comparison functions max and min (returning the larger or smaller of two arguments) may be written as
:&lt;math&gt; \max(x,y) = x[x&gt;y]+y[x\leq y]&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt; \min(x,y) = x[x\leq y]+y[x&gt; y]&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[floor and ceiling functions]] can be expressed as
: &lt;math&gt; \lfloor x \rfloor = \sum_{n} n\cdot [n \le x &lt; n+1]&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt; \lceil x \rceil = \sum_{n} n\cdot [n-1 &lt; x \le n],&lt;/math&gt;
where the index &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of summation is understood to range over all the integers.

The [[ramp function]] can be expressed
:&lt;math&gt;R(x) = x\cdot[x\geq 0].&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]] of the reals is equivalent to the following identity:
:&lt;math&gt;[a &lt; b] + [a = b] + [a &gt; b] = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[Möbius function]] has the property (and can be defined by recurrence as&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Graham]], [[Donald Knuth]], and [[Oren Patashnik]]. ''[[Concrete Mathematics]]'', Section 4.9: Phi and Mu.&lt;/ref&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d|n} \mu(d) \ = \  [n=1].&lt;/math&gt;

==Formulation in terms of usual functions==

In the 1830s, [[Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja]] used &lt;math&gt;0^{0^x}&lt;/math&gt; as a replacement for what would now be written &lt;math&gt;[x&gt;0]&lt;/math&gt;, as well as variants
such as &lt;math&gt;(1-0^{0^{-x}})(1-0^{0^{x-a}})&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;[0\leq x\leq a]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=TNN/&gt; Indeed, following the [[Zero to the power of zero|usual conventions]], those quantities are equal where defined: &lt;math&gt;0^{0^x}&lt;/math&gt; is 1 if ''x'' &gt; 0, 0 if ''x'' = 0, and undefined otherwise.

'''Javier Perez-Capdevila''' is a distinguished [[Cuba]]n scientist, internationally renowned applying mathematics to environmental management, knowledge management, economics and accounting, among other fields of science and life.
He is Senior Advisor to the Science, Technology and Environment Ministry; Guantanamo Delegation, Cuba, and Full Professor in University of Guantanamo.

== Biographical synthesis ==
He was born on February 7, 1963, in [[Guantanamo]], capital of the province. He accomplished all his studies up to the [[university]] level as a student in his natal province, graduated at the Institute of Pedagogical Sciences as a bachelor in Education in the Mathematics specialty, in 1985; he was the first and only student up to that time ever obtaining all the prizes awarded in a graduation. That way, he graduated in sports and culture, in teaching practice, as best assistant pupil, as an undergraduate instructor and of course as the most integral graduate. He received his diploma of hands of the President of Cuba Republic [[Fidel Castro Ruz]], in an act held in Havana, at the [[Karl Marx]]  theater in June 1985, in occasion of the First Graduation in Education in the Primary Teachers specialty, attended by relevant students of other specialties.&lt;ref name="uno"/&gt;

His work experience now counts more than 30 years, since he was as a pupil assistant  teacher and undergraduate instructor. He has worked as university professor, executive in education, mathematician in the Unit of Analysis and Tendencies in Health and specialist for the control of the scientific activity and technology of the Ministry of [[Science]], [[Technology]] and the Environment (CITMA), where he directs nowadays the Science and Technology Unit, in addition, he keeps his links with the university, where he has taught pre-grade courses, master´s and doctorate´s lectures. 
Being very young, a university student, he stood out at the scientific investigation's field, obtaining multiple awards and mentions at provincial and national spaces.

== Main scientific contributions ==
He has introduced several concepts in [[fuzzy mathematics]] and he has exemplified in a creative way its practical application, including: 
* Fuzzy harmonious sets&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* Fuzzy related sets&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* Fuzzy transmuting sets&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt; 
* Transmutation of a [[fuzzy set]]&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* Fuzzy transmuted set&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* Synthetic value of the elements of the fuzzy set E in correspondence with the fuzzy transmutational set O&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* A theorem that demonstrates the marginal value of that synthetic value&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* Overweight in the adjustment&lt;ref name="tres"/&gt;
* Coefficient for equal adjustment&lt;ref name="tres"/&gt;

He has also created two theories which have demonstrated applicability in practice: 
* A theory of adequation fuzzy sets with tie-breaker&lt;ref name="tres"/&gt;
* Theory of mixture of fuzzy sets&lt;ref name="cuatro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cinco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seis"/&gt;

The mixture of fuzzy sets, an operation between fuzzy sets where for the first time in worldwide mathematics was demonstrated an operation with the elements of the sets turning them into new elements. It is a new thing in mathematics, and it has universal validity.&lt;ref name="seis1"/&gt;

He demonstrated the value of diagnosis of his theory in the evaluation of work and professional competences in his first presentation, and he proved the prospective value of the mixture of fuzzy sets, demonstrating how and up to what point the natural, the technological and the human capitals can generate products.

In the field of applied mathematics he has achieved important advances regarding the evaluation of the economical effects and control of the exotic invading alien species, and he has accomplished important theoretical contributions. He has contributed to the concepts of individual benefit of an exotic invading alien species, collective benefit of an exotic invading alien species, a priori cost-benefit analysis of an exotic invading alien species, a posteriori cost-benefit analysis of an exotic invading alien species, as well as a method to accomplish those analyses.&lt;ref name="siete"/&gt;

He has also accomplished significant theoretical contributions to the applied mathematics's field at the entrepreneurial Management level, emphasizing in the precise and measurable concept of work competences;&lt;ref name="ocho"/&gt; he has also introduced the concept of maps of work competences,&lt;ref name="nueve"/&gt; a people's classification on the base of the map of work competences; he created a method to evaluate and measure the work competences taking as a starting point the human perception and constructing their map for decisión taking inside the organization.&lt;ref name="diez"/&gt;

He created a method to determine the relationship between work competences and salaries,&lt;ref name="once"/&gt; which evaluates the losses that can be generated due to the lack of competences (whether laboral or professional ). In the same way he constructed a simulating device to relate competences with productivity of the work and quality of work.

He designed a fuzzy mathematical method for the SWOT analysis, that surpasses all the limitations of the previous methods, achieving entrepreneurial precise diagnosises for strategic planning.&lt;ref name="doce"/&gt;

'''Joseph Pérès''' (31 October 1890 – 12 February 1962) was a French mathematician.

Pérès was born in [[Clermont-Ferrand]] on 31 October 1890.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Peres.html|title=Pérès biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former student of the [[Ecole Normale Superieure]], he worked in Rome with [[Vito Volterra]] and defended his doctoral thesis in 1915.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1920 he became a lecturer at the Faculty of Sciences of Strasbourg and in 1921 held the mechanics chair of the faculty of sciences of Marseille.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costabel|first=Pierre|title=Joseph Pérès (1890-1962)|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/rhs_0048-7996_1962_num_15_2_4424|journal=Revue d'histoire des sciences et de leurs applications|volume=15|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, he was appointed lecturer at the Faculty of Paris. He was elected member of the Academy of Sciences in 1942. He held the chair of mechanics in 1950 and Dean of the Faculty of Science in 1954, succeeding [[Albert Châtelet]]. During his deanship, he undertakes the creation of the Orsay campus. He was also one of the founders of the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] and its first président until his death.

In [[mathematics]], a '''limiting case''' of a [[mathematical object]] is a [[special case]] that arises when one or more components of the object take on their most extreme possible values. For example:

* In [[statistics]], the limiting case of the [[binomial distribution]] is the [[Poisson distribution]]. As the number of events tends to infinity in the binomial distribution, the random variable changes from the binomial to the Poisson distribution.
*A [[Circle#Circle as limiting case of other figures|circle is a limiting case]] of various other figures, including the [[Cartesian oval]], the [[ellipse]], the [[superellipse]], and the [[Cassini oval]]. Each type of figure is a circle for certain values of the defining parameters, and the generic figure appears more and more like a circle as the limiting values are approached.
*[[Archimedes]] calculated an approximate value of [[π]] by treating the circle as the limiting case of a [[regular polygon]] with 3 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; sides, as ''n'' gets large.
*In [[electricity and magnetism]], the [[long wavelength limit]] is the limiting case when the [[wavelength]] is much larger than the system size.
*In [[economics]], two limiting cases of a [[demand curve]] or [[supply curve]] are those in which the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] is zero (the totally inelastic case) or infinity (the infinitely elastic case).
*In [[finance]], [[continuous compounding]] is the limiting case of compound interest in which the compounding period becomes infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the limit as the number of compounding periods per year goes to infinity.

A limiting case is sometimes a [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate case]] in which some qualitative properties differ from the corresponding [[Generic property|properties of the generic case]]. For example:

*A [[Point (geometry)|point]] is a degenerate [[circle]], namely one with [[radius]] 0.
*A [[parabola]] can degenerate into two distinct or coinciding [[parallel lines]].
*An [[ellipse]] can degenerate into a single point or a [[line segment]].
*A [[hyperbola]] can degenerate into two [[intersecting lines]].

The first of the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs) was held in [[Romania]] in 1959. The oldest of the [[International Science Olympiad]]s, the [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] has since been held annually, except in 1980. That year the competition initially planned to hold in [[Mongolia]] was canceled due to soviet invasion of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Mongolia/&gt; Because the competition was initially founded for [[Eastern Europe]]an countries participating in the [[Warsaw Pact]], under the influence of the [[Eastern Bloc]],&lt;ref name="more"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imo.wolfram.com/morefacts.html|title=More IMO Facts|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the earlier IMOs were hosted only in Eastern European countries, gradually spreading to other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sms.math.nus.edu.sg/Simo/Simo.aspx|title=Singapore International Mathematical Olympiad (SIMO) Home Page|accessdate=2008-02-04|publisher=Singapore Mathematical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs and the exact dates when they took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.medallia.com/2006/07/norwegian_students_in_internat.html|title=Norwegian Students in International Mathematical Olympiad|accessdate=2008-03-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020100605/http://blog.medallia.com/2006/07/norwegian_students_in_internat.html|archivedate=2006-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first IMO was held in [[Romania]] in 1959. Seven countries entered &amp;ndash; [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], Romania and the [[Soviet Union]] &amp;ndash; with the hosts finishing as the top-ranked nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/year_country_r.aspx?year=1959|title=1st IMO 1959|accessdate=2011-06-20|publisher=International Mathematical Olympiad}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of participating countries has since risen: 14 countries took part in 1969, 50 in 1989, and 104 in 2009.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/organizers.aspx|title=Timeline|accessdate=2011-06-20|publisher=International Mathematical Olympiad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Korea]] is the only country to have been caught cheating, resulting in its disqualification at the 32nd IMO in 1991 and the 51st IMO in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=PRK|title=International Mathematical Olympiad: Democratic People's Republic of Korea|accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, [[Google]] gave €1 million to the IMO organization to help cover the costs of the events from 2011–2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/2011/01/giving-young-mathematicians-chance-to.html Google Europe Blog: Giving young mathematicians the chance to shine].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36719">In [[mathematical logic]], a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]] is given by a set of axioms in some
language. This entry lists some of the more common examples used in [[model theory]] and some of their properties.

==Preliminaries==

For every natural mathematical structure there is a  [[Signature (logic)|signature]] &amp;sigma;  listing the constants, functions, and relations of the theory together with their valences,  so that the object is naturally a [[model theory|&amp;sigma;-structure]].   Given a signature &amp;sigma; there is a unique first-order language  ''L''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt; that can be used to capture the first-order expressible facts about the &amp;sigma;-structure.

There are two common ways to specify theories:
#List or describe a set of sentences in the language ''L''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt;, called the '''axioms''' of the theory.
#Give a set of  &amp;sigma;-structures, and define a theory to be the set of sentences in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt; holding in all these models. For example, the "theory of finite fields" consists of all sentences in the language of fields that are true in all finite fields.

An L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt; theory may:
*be consistent: no proof of contradiction exists;
* be satisfiable: there exists a &amp;sigma;-structure for which the sentences of the theory are all true (by the [[completeness theorem]], satisfiability is equivalent to consistency);
*be complete: for any statement, either it or its negation is provable;
*have [[quantifier elimination]];
*[[elimination of imaginaries|eliminate imaginaries]];
* be [[finitely axiomatizable]];
*be [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]: There is an algorithm to decide which statements are provable;
*be recursively axiomatizable;
*be [[model complete]] or sub-model complete;
*be [[Morley's categoricity theorem|κ-categorical]]: All models of cardinality κ are isomorphic;
*be [[stable theory|stable]]  or unstable;
*be [[ω-stable]] (same as [[totally transcendental]] for countable theories);
*be [[superstable]]
*have an [[atomic model (mathematical logic)|atomic model]];
*have a [[prime model]];
*have a [[saturated model]].

==Pure identity theories==
The signature of the pure identity theory is empty, with no functions, constants, or relations.

'''Pure identity theory''' has no (non-logical) axioms. It is decidable.

One of the few interesting properties that can be stated in the language of pure identity theory is that of being infinite.
This is given by an infinite set of axioms stating there are at least 2 elements, there are at least 3 elements, and so on:
*∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,    ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,...
These axioms define the '''theory of an infinite set'''.

The opposite property of being finite cannot be stated in first-order logic for any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models: in fact any such  theory has infinite models by the [[compactness theorem]]. In general if a property can be stated by a finite number of sentences of first-order logic then the opposite property can also be stated in first-order logic, but if a property needs an infinite number of sentences then its opposite property cannot be stated in first-order logic.

Any statement of pure identity theory is equivalent to either σ(''N'') or to ¬σ(''N'') for some finite subset ''N'' of the non-negative integers, where σ(''N'') is the statement that the number of elements is in ''N''. It is even possible to describe all possible theories in this language as follows. Any theory is either  the theory of all sets of cardinality in ''N'' for some ''finite'' subset ''N'' of the non-negative integers, or the theory of all sets whose cardinality is not in ''N'', for some ''finite or infinite'' subset ''N'' of the non-negative integers. (There are no theories whose models are exactly sets of cardinality ''N'' if ''N'' is an infinite subset of the integers.) The complete theories are the theories of sets of cardinality ''n'' for some finite ''n'', and the theory of infinite sets.

One special case of this is the '''inconsistent theory''' defined by the axiom ∃''x'' ¬''x'' = ''x''. It is a perfectly good theory with many good properties: it is complete, decidable, finitely axiomatizable, and so on. The only problem is that it has no models at all. By Gödel's completeness theorem, it is the only theory (for any given language) with no models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Propositional and Predicate Calculus: A Model of Argument: A Model of Argument|first=Derek|last=Goldrei|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9781846282294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edqwSVJ9GGQC&amp;pg=PA265|page=265}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the same as the theory of the empty set (in versions of first-order logic that allow a model to be empty): the theory of the empty set has exactly one model, which has no elements.

==Unary relations==
A set of unary  relations ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i'' in some set ''I'' is called '''independent''' if for every two disjoint finite subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of ''I''  there is some element ''x'' such that ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is true for ''i'' in ''A'' and false for ''i'' in ''B''. Independence can be expressed by a set of first-order statements.

The '''theory of a countable number of independent unary relations''' is complete, but has no [[atomic model (mathematical logic)|atomic models]]. It is also an example of a theory that is [[superstable]] but not [[totally transcendental]].

==Equivalence relations==
The signature of [[equivalence relation]]s has one binary infix relation symbol ~, no constants, and no functions. Equivalence relations satisfy the axioms:
*'''[[Reflexive relation|Reflexivity]]''' ∀''x'' ''x''~''x'';
*'''[[Symmetric relation|Symmetry]]''' ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''x''~''y'' → ''y''~''x'';
*'''[[Transitive relation|Transitivity]]''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ∀''z'' (''x''~''y'' ∧ ''y''~''z'') → ''x''~''z''.

Some first order properties of equivalence relations are:
*~ has an infinite number of [[equivalence classes]];
*~ has exactly ''n'' equivalence classes (for any fixed positive integer ''n'');
*All equivalence classes are infinite;
*All equivalence classes have size exactly ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n'').

The theory of an equivalence relation with exactly 2 infinite [[equivalence class]]es is an easy example of a theory which is ω-categorical but not categorical for any larger [[cardinal number|cardinal]].

The equivalence relation ~ should not be confused with the [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] symbol '=': if ''x''=''y'' then ''x''~''y'', but the converse is not necessarily true. Theories of equivalence relations are not all that difficult or interesting, but often give easy examples or counterexamples for various statements.

The following constructions are sometimes used to produce examples of theories with certain [[spectrum of a theory|spectra]]; in fact by applying them to a small number of explicit theories ''T'' one gets examples of complete countable theories with all possible uncountable spectra. If ''T'' is a theory in some language, we define a new theory 2&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt; by adding a new binary relation to the language, and adding axioms stating that it is an equivalence relation, such that there are an infinite number of equivalence classes all of which are [[model theory|model]]s of ''T''. It is  possible to iterate this construction [[transfinite induction|transfinitely]]: given an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] α, define a new theory by adding an equivalence relation ''E&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each β&amp;lt;α, together with axioms stating that whenever β&amp;lt;γ then each ''E&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;'' equivalence class is the union of infinitely many ''E&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;'' equivalence classes, and each ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' equivalence class is a model of ''T''. Informally, one can visualize models of this theory as infinitely branching trees of height α with models of ''T'' attached to all leaves.

==Orders==
The signature of orders has no constants or functions, and one binary relation symbols ≤. (It is of course possible to use ≥, &amp;lt; or &amp;gt; instead as the basic relation, with the obvious minor changes to the axioms.)
We define ''x'' ≥ ''y'', ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'', ''x'' &amp;gt; ''y'' as abbreviations for ''y'' ≤ ''x'', ''x'' ≤ ''y'' ∧¬''y'' ≤ ''x'', ''y'' &amp;lt; ''x'',

Some first-order properties of orders: 
*'''Transitive''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ∀''z'' ''x'' ≤ ''y''∧''y'' ≤ ''z'' → ''x'' ≤ ''z''
*'''Reflexive''': ∀''x'' ''x ≤ ''x''
*'''Antisymmetric''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''x'' ≤ ''y'' ∧ ''y'' ≤ ''x'' → ''x'' = ''y''
*'''Partial''': Transitive∧Reflexive∧Antisymmetric;
*'''Linear''' (or '''total'''): Partial ∧ ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''x''≤''y'' ∨ ''y''≤''x''
*'''Dense''': ∀''x'' ∀''z'' ''x'' &amp;lt; ''z'' → ∃''y'' ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'' ∧ ''y'' &amp;lt; ''z''  ("Between any 2 distinct elements there is another element")
*There is a smallest element: ∃''x'' ∀''y'' ''x'' ≤ ''y''
*There is a largest element: ∃''x'' ∀''y'' ''y'' ≤ ''x''
*Every element has an immediate successor: ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ∀''z'' ''x'' &amp;lt; ''z'' ↔ ''y'' ≤ ''z''
The theory DLO of ''dense linear orders without endpoints'' (i.e. no smallest or largest element) is complete, ω-categorical, but not categorical for any uncountable cardinal. There are 3 other very similar theories: the theory of dense linear orders with a:
* Smallest but no largest element;
* Largest but no smallest element;
* Largest and smallest element.

Being '''well ordered''' ("any non-empty subset has a minimal element") is not a first-order property; the usual definition involves quantifying over all ''subsets''.

==Lattices==
[[lattice (order)|Lattices]] can be considered either as special sorts of partially ordered sets, with a signature consisting of one binary relation symbol &amp;le;, or as algebraic structures with a signature consisting of two binary operations &amp;and; and &amp;or;. The two approaches can be related  by defining  ''a''&amp;le; ''b'' to mean ''a''&amp;and;''b''=''a''.

For two binary operations the axioms for a lattice are:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
| '''[[commutative operation|Commutative]] laws:''' ||
| &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b \; a  \vee b = b \vee a &lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b\; a \wedge  b = b \wedge a &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| '''[[associativity|Associative]] laws:''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \forall c\; a \vee (b \vee c) = (a \vee b) \vee c &lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b \forall c\; a \wedge (b \wedge c) = (a \wedge b) \wedge c &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| '''[[Absorption law]]s:''' ||
| &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b \;a  \vee (a \wedge b) = a &lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \;a  \wedge (a \vee b) = a &lt;/math&gt;
|}

For one relation &amp;le; the axioms are:
*Axioms stating &amp;le; is a partial order, as above.
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \exist c\; c\le a\wedge c\le b \wedge \forall d\;d\le a\wedge d\le b \rightarrow d\le c&lt;/math&gt; (existence of c=a&amp;and;b)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \exist c\; a\le c\wedge b\le c \wedge \forall d\;a\le d\wedge b\le d \rightarrow c\le d&lt;/math&gt; (existence of c=a&amp;or;b)

First order properties include:
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y\forall z\;x \vee (y \wedge z) = (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[distributive lattice]]s)
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y\forall z\;x \vee (y \wedge (x \vee z)) = (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[modular lattice]]s)

[[Heyting algebra]]s can be defined as lattices with certain extra first-order properties.

[[Complete lattice|Completeness]] is not a first order property of lattices.

==Graphs==
{{main|Logic of graphs}}
The signature of graphs has no constants or functions, and one binary relation symbol ''R'', where ''R''(''x'',''y'') is read as "there is an edge from ''x'' to ''y''".

The axioms for the '''theory of graphs''' are
*'''Symmetric''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''R''(''x'',''y'')→ ''R''(''y'',''x'')
*'''Anti-reflexive''': ∀''x'' ¬''R''(''x'',''x'') ("no loops")

The ''theory of random graphs'' has the following extra axioms for each positive integer ''n'':
* For any two disjoint finite sets of size ''n'', there is a point joined to all points of the first set and to no points of the second set. (For each fixed ''n'', it is easy to write this statement in the language of graphs.)

The theory of random graphs is ω categorical, complete, and decidable, and its countable model is called the [[Rado graph]]. A statement in the language of graphs is true in this theory if and only if the probability that an ''n''-vertex [[random graph]] models the statement tends to 1 in the limit as ''n'' goes to infinity.

==Boolean algebras==
There are several different signatures and conventions used for '''[[Boolean algebras]]''': 
#The signature has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions ∧ and ∨ ("and" and "or"), and one unary function ¬ ("not"). This can be confusing as the functions use the same symbols as the [[propositional function]]s of first-order logic.
#In [[set theory]], a common convention is that the language has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions · and +, and one unary function &amp;minus;. The three functions have the same interpretation as the functions in the first convention. Unfortunately, this convention clashes badly with the next convention:
#In algebra, the usual  convention is that the language has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions · and +. The function · has the same meaning as ∧, but ''a''+''b'' means ''a''∨''b''∧¬(''a''∧''b''). The reason for this is that the axioms for a Boolean algebra are then just the axioms for a ring with 1 plus ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''. Unfortunately this clashes with the standard convention in set theory given above.

The axioms are:
*The axioms for a distributive lattice (see above)
*&amp;forall;a ''a''&amp;and;¬''a'' = 0, &amp;forall;a ''a''&amp;or;¬''a'' = 1 (properties of negation)
*Some authors add the extra axiom ¬0=1, to exclude the trivial algebra with one element.

Tarski proved that the theory of Boolean algebras is decidable.

We write ''x'' ≤ ''y'' as an abbreviation for ''x'' ∧ ''y'' = ''x'', and atom(''x'') as an abbreviation for ¬''x'' = 0 ∧ ∀''y'' ''y''≤''x'' → ''y'' = 0 ∨ ''y'' = ''x'', read as "''x'' is an atom", in other words a non-zero element with nothing between it and 0. Here are some first-order properties of Boolean algebras:
*'''Atomic''': ∀''x'' ''x''=0 ∨ ∃''y'' ''y''≤''x'' ∧ atom(''y'')
*'''Atomless''': ∀''x'' ¬atom(''x'')
The theory of '''atomless Boolean algebras''' is ω-categorical and complete.

For any Boolean algebra ''B'', there are several invariants defined as follows. 
*the ideal ''I''(''B'') consists of elements that are the sum of an atomic and an atomless element (an element with no atoms below it).
*The quotient algebras ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; of ''B'' are defined inductively by ''B''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=''B'', ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;/''I''(''B''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;).
*The invariant ''m''(''B'') is the smallest integer such that ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sup&gt; is trivial, or &amp;infin; if no such integer exists.
*If ''m''(''B'') is finite, the invariant ''n''(''B'') is the number of atoms of ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''(''B'')&lt;/sup&gt; if this number is finite, or &amp;infin; if this number is infinite.
*The invariant ''l''(''B'') is 0 if ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''(''B'')&lt;/sup&gt; is atomic or if ''m''(''B'') is &amp;infin;, and 1 otherwise.

Then two Boolean algebras are elementarily equivalent if and only if their invariants ''l'', ''m'', and ''n'' are the same. In other words, the values of these invariants classify the possible completions of the theory of Boolean algebras. So the possible complete theories are:
*The trivial algebra (if this is allowed; sometimes 0&amp;ne;1 is included as an axiom.)
*The theory with ''m''=&amp;infin;
*The theories with ''m'' a natural number, ''n'' a natural number or &amp;infin;, and ''l'' = 0 or 1 (with ''l'' = 0 if ''n''=0).

==Groups==
The signature of group theory has one constant 1 (the identity), one function of arity 1
(the inverse) whose value on ''t'' is denoted by ''t''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and one function 
of arity 2, which is usually omitted from terms. For any integer ''n''. ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an abbreviation for the obvious term for the ''n''th power of ''t''.

'''[[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s''' are defined by the axioms
*''Identity'': ∀''x'' 1''x'' = ''x'' ∧ ''x''1 = ''x''
*''Inverse'': ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' = ''1'' ∧ ''xx''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''1''
*''Associative'': ∀''x''∀''y''∀''z'' (''xy'')''z'' = ''x''(''yz'')

Some properties of groups that can be defined in the first-order language of groups are:
*'''Abelian''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''xy'' = ''yx''.
*'''Torsion free''': ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1→''x'' = 1, ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 → ''x'' = 1, ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 → ''x'' = 1, ...
*'''Divisible''': ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', ...
*'''Infinite''' (as in identity theory)
*'''Exponent''' ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n''): ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1
*[[Nilpotent group|Nilpotent]] of class ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n'')
*[[solvable group|Solvable]] of class ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n'')

The theory of '''abelian groups''' is decidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The theory of '''finite groups''' is the set of first-order statements in the language of groups that are true in all finite groups (there are plenty of infinite models of this theory). It is not completely trivial to find any such statement that is not true for all groups: one example is 
"given two elements of order 2, either they are conjugate or there is a non-trivial element commuting with both of them".

The properties of being finite, or free, or simple, or torsion are not first-order. More precisely, the first-order theory of all groups with one of these properties has models that do not have this property.

==Rings and fields==
The signature of (unital) rings has 2 constants 0 and 1, two binary functions + and &amp;times;, and, optionally, one unary negation function &amp;minus;.

'''[[ring (mathematics)|Ring]]s'''

Axioms: Addition makes the ring into an abelian group, multiplication is associative and has an identity 1, and multiplication is left and right distributive.

'''[[Commutative ring]]s'''

The axioms for rings plus ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''xy''=''yx''.

'''[[Field (mathematics)|Field]]s'''

The axioms for commutative rings plus ∀''x'' ¬ ''x''=0 → ∃''y'' ''xy''=1 and ¬ 1=0.   Many of the examples given here have only universal, or ''algebraic'' axioms.  The class of structures satisfying such a theory has the property of being closed under substructure.   For example, a subset of a group closed under the group actions of multiplication and inverse is again a group.  Since the signature of fields does not usually include multiplicative and additive inverse, the axioms for  inverses are not universal, and therefore a substructure of a field closed under addition and multiplication  is not always a field.   This can be remedied by adding unary inverse functions to the language.

For any positive integer ''n'' the property that all equations of degree ''n'' have a root can be expressed by a single first-order sentence:
*∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x'' (...((''x''+''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''x'' +''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''x''+...)''x''+''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0

'''[[Perfect field]]s'''

The axioms for fields, plus axioms for each prime number ''p'' stating that if p 1 = 0 (i.e. the field has [[field characteristic|characteristic]] ''p''), then every field element has a ''p''th root.

'''Algebraically closed fields of characteristic ''p'''''

The axioms for fields, plus for every positive ''n'' the axiom that all polynomials of degree ''n'' have a root, plus axioms fixing the characteristic. The classical examples of complete theories. [[Category theory|Categorical]] in all uncountable cardinals. The theory ''ACF''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; has a ''universal domain property'', in the sense that every structure ''N'' satisfying the universal axioms of  ''ACF''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is a substructure of a sufficiently large algebraically closed field  &lt;math&gt; M \models ACF_0 &lt;/math&gt;, and additionally any two such embeddings ''N'' &amp;rarr; ''M'' induce an [[automorphism]] of ''M''.

'''[[Finite field]]s'''

The theory of finite fields is the set of all first-order statements that are true in all finite fields. Significant examples of such statements can, for example, be given by applying the [[Chevalley–Warning theorem]], over the [[prime field]]s. The name is a little misleading as the theory has plenty of infinite models. Ax proved that the theory is decidable.

'''[[Formally real field]]s'''

These are fields with the axiom 
*For every positive ''n'', the axiom ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ ...+''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 → ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨ ... ∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 (0 is not a non-trivial sum of squares).

'''[[Real closed field]]s'''

Axioms: *∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''x''=''yy'' ∨ ''x''+''yy''= 0.
*For every odd positive ''n'', the axiom stating that every polynomial of degree ''n'' has a root.
*For every positive ''n'', the axiom ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ ...+''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 → ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨ ... ∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 (0 is not a non-trivial sum of squares).

The theory of real closed fields is effective and complete and therefore decidable (the [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem]]). The addition of further function symbols (e.g., the exponential function, the sine function) [[Decidability of first-order theories of the real numbers|may change decidability]]. 

''' ''p''-adic fields'''

{{harvtxt|Ax|Kochen|1965}} showed that the theory of ''p''-adic fields is decidable and gave a set of axioms for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Geometry==
Axioms for various systems of geometry usually use a typed language, with the different types corresponding to different geometric objects such as points, lines, circles, planes, and so on. The signature will often consist of binary incidence relations between objects of different types; for example, the relation that a point lies on a line. The signature may have more complicated relations; for example ordered geometry might have a ternary "betweenness" relation for 3 points, which says whether one lies between two others, or a "congruence" relation between 2 pairs of points.

Some examples of axiomatized systems of geometry include [[ordered geometry]], [[absolute geometry]], [[affine geometry]], [[Euclidean geometry]], [[projective geometry]],  and [[hyperbolic geometry]]. For each of these geometries there are many different and inequivalent systems of axioms for various dimensions. Some of these axiom systems include "completeness" axioms that are not first order.

As a typical example, the axioms for projective geometry use 2 types, points and lines, and a binary incidence relation between points and lines. If point and line variables are indicated by small and capital letter, and ''a'' incident to ''A'' is written as ''aA'', then one set of axioms is
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a\forall b\;\lnot a=b\rightarrow \exists C\; aC\land bC &lt;/math&gt; (There is a line through any 2 distinct points ''a'',''b'' ...)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a\forall b\forall  C\forall D\; \lnot a=b\land aC\land bC \land aD\land bD\rightarrow C=D&lt;/math&gt; (... which is unique)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a\forall b\forall c\forall d\forall e\forall G\forall H \;aH\land bH\land eH\land cG\land dG\land eG\rightarrow\exists f\exists I\exists J\;  aI\land cI\land fI\land bJ\land dJ\land fJ&lt;/math&gt; (Veblen's axiom: if ''ab'' and ''cd'' lie on intersecting lines, then so do ''ac'' and ''bd''.)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall A\exists b\exists c\exists d\; bA\land cA\land dA\land \lnot b=c\land \lnot b=d\land \lnot c=d &lt;/math&gt; (Every line has at least 3 points)

Euclid did not state all the axioms for Euclidean geometry explicitly, and the first complete list was given by Hilbert in [[Hilbert's axioms]]. This is not a first order axiomatization as one of Hilbert's axioms is a second order completeness axiom. [[Tarski's axioms]] are a first order axiomatization of Euclidean geometry. Tarski showed this axiom system is complete and decidable by relating it to the complete and decidable theory of real closed fields.

==Differential algebra==
* The theory DF of [[differential field]]s.
The signature is that of fields (0, 1, +, −, ×) together with a unary function ∂, the derivation.
The axioms are those for fields together with
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u\forall v\,\partial(uv) = u \,\partial v + v\, \partial u&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u\forall v\,\partial (u + v) = \partial u + \partial v\ .&lt;/math&gt;
For this theory one can add the condition that the characteristic is ''p'', a prime or zero,
to get the theory DF&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of '''differential fields of characteristic ''p'' '''(and similarly with the other theories below).

If ''K'' is a differential field then the '''field of constants''' &lt;math&gt; k = \{u \in K : \partial(u) = 0\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The theory of '''differentially perfect fields''' is the theory of differential fields together with the condition that the field of constants is perfect; in other words, for each prime ''p'' it has the axiom:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u \,\partial(u)=0 \land p 1 = 0\rightarrow \exists v\,  v^p=u&lt;/math&gt;
(There is little point in demanding that the whole field should be a [[perfect field]], because in non-zero characteristic this implies the differential is 0.)
For technical reasons to do with [[quantifier elimination]], it is sometimes more convenient to force the constant field to be perfect by adding a new symbol ''r'' to the signature with the axioms
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u \,\partial(u)=0 \land p 1 = 0 \rightarrow r(u)^p=u&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u \,\lnot \partial(u)=0\rightarrow r(u)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
* The theory of '''[[differentially closed field]]s''' (DCF) is the theory of differentially perfect fields with axioms saying that if ''f'' and ''g'' are  [[differential polynomial]]s and the [[separant]] of ''f'' is nonzero  and ''g''≠0 and  ''f'' has order greater than that of ''g'', then there is some ''x'' in the field with ''f''(''x'')=0 and ''g''(''x'')≠0.

==Addition==
The '''theory of the natural numbers with a successor function''' has signature consisting of a constant 0 and a unary function ''S'' ("successor": ''S''(''x'') is interpreted as ''x''+1), and has axioms:
# ∀x &amp;not; Sx = 0
# ∀x∀y Sx = Sy → x = y
#Let ''P''(''x'') be a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]] with a single free variable ''x''. Then the following formula is an axiom:
:(''P''(0) &amp;and; &amp;forall;''x''(''P''(''x'')&amp;rarr;''P''(''Sx''))) &amp;rarr; &amp;forall;''y'' ''P''(''y'').
The last axiom (induction) can be replaced by the axioms
*For each integer ''n''&gt;0, the axiom ∀x SSS...Sx ≠ x (with ''n'' copies of ''S'')
* ∀x &amp;not; x = 0 → ∃y Sy = x

The theory of the natural numbers with a successor function is complete and decidable, and is &amp;kappa;-categorical for uncountable &amp;kappa; but not for countable &amp;kappa;.

'''[[Presburger arithmetic]]''' is the theory of the natural numbers under addition, with signature consisting of a constant 0, a unary function ''S'', and a binary function +. It is complete and decidable. The axioms are 
# ∀x &amp;not; Sx = 0
# ∀x∀y Sx = Sy → x = y
# ∀x x + 0 = x
# ∀x∀y x + Sy = S(x + y)
#Let ''P''(''x'') be a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]] with a single free variable ''x''. Then the following formula is an axiom:
:(''P''(0) &amp;and; &amp;forall;''x''(''P''(''x'')&amp;rarr;''P''(''Sx''))) &amp;rarr; &amp;forall;''y'' ''P''(''y'').

==Arithmetic==
Many of the first order theories described above can be extended to complete recursively enumerable consistent theories. This is no longer true for most of the following theories; they can usually encode both multiplication and addition of natural numbers, and this gives them enough power to encode themselves, which implies that [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] applies and the theories can no longer be both complete and recursively enumerable (unless they are inconsistent).

The signature of a theory of arithmetic has:
*The constant 0;
*The [[unary function]], the [[successor function]], here denoted by prefix ''S'', or by prefix &amp;sigma; or postfix &amp;prime; elsewhere;
*Two [[binary function]]s, denoted by infix + and &amp;times;, called "addition" and "multiplication."
Some authors take the signature to contain a constant 1 instead of the function ''S'', then define ''S'' in the obvious way as  ''St'' = 1 + ''t''.

'''[[Robinson arithmetic]]''' (also called '''Q'''). Axioms (1) and (2) govern the distinguished element 0. (3) assures that ''S'' is an [[Injective function|injection]]. Axioms (4) and (5) are the standard recursive definition of addition; (6) and (7) do the same for multiplication.  Robinson arithmetic  can be thought of as  Peano arithmetic without induction. '''Q''' is  a weak theory for which [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] holds.
Axioms:
# ∀''x'' &amp;not; S''x'' = 0
# ∀''x'' &amp;not; ''x'' = 0 → ∃''y'' S''y'' = ''x''
# ∀''x''∀''y'' S''x'' = S''y'' → ''x'' = ''y''
# ∀''x'' ''x'' + 0 = ''x''
# ∀''x''∀''y'' ''x'' + S''y'' = S(''x'' + ''y'')
# ∀''x'' ''x'' &amp;times; 0 = 0
# ∀''x''∀''y'' ''x'' &amp;times; S''y'' = (''x'' &amp;times; ''y'') + ''x''.

'''I&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' is first order Peano arithmetic with induction restricted to [[Arithmetical hierarchy|Σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; formulas]] (for ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, ...). The theory I&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is often denoted by I&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This is a series of more and more powerful fragments of Peano arithmetic. The case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 has about the same strength as  '''[[primitive recursive arithmetic]]''' (PRA).
'''[[Exponential function arithmetic]]''' (EFA) is I&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with an axiom stating that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; exists for all ''x'' and ''y'' (with the usual properties).

'''First order [[Peano arithmetic]]''', '''PA'''. The "standard" theory of arithmetic. The axioms are the axioms of [[Robinson arithmetic]] above, together with the axiom scheme of induction:
* &lt;math&gt;\phi(0) \wedge (\forall x \phi(x) \rightarrow \phi(Sx)) \rightarrow (\forall x \phi(x))&lt;/math&gt; for any formula &amp;phi; in the language of '''PA'''. &amp;phi; may contain free variables other than ''x''.
[[Kurt Gödel]]'s  1931 paper proved that '''PA''' is incomplete, and has no consistent recursively enumerable completions.

'''Complete arithmetic''' (also known as '''true arithmetic''') is the theory of the standard model of arithmetic, the natural numbers '''N'''. It is complete but does not have a recursively enumerable set of axioms.

For the '''real numbers''', the situation is slightly different: The case that includes just addition and multiplication cannot encode the integers, and hence [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem|does not apply]]. [[Decidability of first-order theories of the real numbers|Complications]] arise when adding further function symbols (e.g., exponentiation).

==Second order arithmetic==
'''[[Second-order arithmetic]]''' can refer to a first order theory (in spite of the name) with two types of variables, thought of as varying over integers and subsets of the integers. (There is also a theory of arithmetic in second order logic that is called second order arithmetic. It has only one model, unlike the corresponding theory in first order logic, which is incomplete.) The signature will typically be the signature 0, ''S'', +, &amp;times; of arithmetic, together with a membership relation &amp;isin; between integers and subsets (though there are numerous minor variations).  The axioms are those of [[Robinson arithmetic]], together with axiom schemes of [[Mathematical induction|induction]] and [[Axiom schema of specification|comprehension]].

There are  many different subtheories of second order arithmetic that differ in which formulas are allowed in the induction and comprehension schemes. 
In order of increasing strength, five of the most common  systems
are 
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{RCA}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Recursive Comprehension
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{WKL}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Weak König's lemma
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{ACA}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Arithmetical comprehension
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{ATR}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Arithmetical Transfinite Recursion
*&lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1\mbox{-}\mathsf{CA}_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; comprehension
These are defined in detail in the articles on [[second order arithmetic]] and [[reverse mathematics]].

==Set theories==
The usual signature of set theory has one binary relation ∈, no constants, and no functions. Some of the theories below are "class theories" which have two sorts of object, sets and classes. There are three common ways of handling this in first-order logic:
#Use first-order logic with two types.
#Use ordinary first-order logic, but add a new unary predicate "Set", where "Set(''t'')" means informally "''t'' is a set".
#Use ordinary first-order logic, and instead of adding a new predicate to the language, treat "Set(''t'')" as an abbreviation for "∃''y'' ''t''∈''y''"

Some first order set theories include:
*Weak theories lacking [[powerset]]s:
**[[General set theory|S']]  (Tarski, Mostowski, and Robinson, 1953); (finitely axiomatizable)
**[[General set theory]];
**[[Kripke–Platek set theory]]; KP;
**[[Pocket set theory]]
*[[Mac Lane set theory]] and  [[elementary topos theory]]
*[[Zermelo set theory]]; Z
*[[Ackermann set theory]];
*[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]]; ZF, ZFC;
*[[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]]; NBG; (finitely axiomatizable)
*[[Morse–Kelley set theory]]; MK;
*[[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]]; TG;
*[[New Foundations]]; (finitely axiomatizable)
*[[Scott–Potter set theory]]
*[[Positive set theory]]

Some extra first order axioms that can be added to one of these (usually ZF) include:
*[[axiom of choice]], [[axiom of dependent choice]]
*[[Generalized continuum hypothesis]]
*[[Martin's axiom]] (usually together with the negation of the continuum hypothesis), [[Martin's maximum]]
*[[diamondsuit|◊]] and [[clubsuit|♣]]
*[[Axiom of constructibility]] (V=L)
*[[proper forcing axiom]]
*[[analytic determinacy]], [[projective determinacy]], [[Axiom of determinacy]]
*Many [[list of large cardinal properties|large cardinal axioms]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1278">'''List of numerical computational geometry topics''' enumerates the topics of [[computational geometry]] that deals with geometric objects as continuous entities and applies methods and algorithms of nature characteristic to [[numerical analysis]]. This area is also called "machine geometry", computer-aided geometric design, and [[geometric modelling]].

See [[List of combinatorial computational geometry topics]] for another flavor of computational geometry that states problems in terms of geometric objects as [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] entities and hence the methods of their solution are mostly theories and [[algorithm]]s of [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] character.

==Curves==
In the [[list of curves topics]], the following ones are fundamental to geometric modelling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15574">[[Probability theory]] routinely uses results from other fields of mathematics (mostly, analysis). The opposite cases, collected below, are relatively rare; however, probability theory is used systematically in [[combinatorics]] via the [[probabilistic method]]. They are particularly used for [[non-constructive]] proofs.

==Analysis==
* [[Normal number]]s exist. Moreover, [[Computable number|computable]] normal numbers [[Normal number#Properties and examples|exist]]. These non-probabilistic existence theorems follow from probabilistic results: (a) a number chosen at random (uniformly on (0,1)) is normal almost surely (which follows easily from the [[strong law of large numbers]]); (b) some probabilistic inequalities behind the strong law. The existence of a normal number follows from (a) immediately. The proof of the existence of computable normal numbers, based on (b), involves additional arguments. All known proofs use probabilistic arguments.
* [[Dvoretzky's theorem]] which states that high-dimensional convex bodies have ball-like slices is proved probabilistically. No deterministic construction is known, even for many specific bodies.
* The diameter of the [[Banach–Mazur compactum]] was calculated using a probabilistic construction. No deterministic construction is known.
* The original proof that the [[Hausdorff–Young inequality]] cannot be extended to &lt;math&gt;p &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; is probabilistic. The proof of the de Leeuw–Kahane–Katznelson theorem (which is a stronger claim) is partially probabilistic.&lt;ref&gt;Karel de Leeuw, Yitzhak Katznelson and Jean-Pierre Kahane, Sur les coefficients de Fourier des fonctions continues. (French)  C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Sér. A–B 285:16  (1977), A1001–A1003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first construction of a Salem set was probabilistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salem | first1 = Raphaël | year = 1951 | title = On singular monotonic functions whose spectrum has a given Hausdorff dimension | url = | journal = Ark. Mat. | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 353–365 | doi=10.1007/bf02591372| bibcode = 1951ArM.....1..353S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in 1981 did Kaufman give a deterministic construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = Robert | year = 1981 | title = On the theorem of Jarník and Besicovitch | url = | journal = Acta Arith | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 265–267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every continuous function on a compact interval can be uniformly approximated by polynomials, which is the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]]. A [[Bernstein polynomial#Proof|probabilistic proof]] uses the [[weak law of large numbers]]. Non-probabilistic proofs were available earlier.
* Existence of a nowhere differentiable continuous function follows easily from properties of [[Wiener process]]. A [[Weierstrass function|non-probabilistic proof]] was available earlier.
* [[Stirling's formula]] was first discovered by [[Abraham de Moivre]] in his `[[The Doctrine of Chances]]' (with a constant identified later by Stirling) in order to be used in probability theory. Several probabilistic proofs of Stirling's formula (and related results) were found in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Blyth|first1=Colin R.|last2=Pathak|first2=Pramod K.

* The only bounded harmonic functions defined on the whole plane are constant functions by [[Potential theory#Inequalities|Liouville's theorem]]. A probabilistic proof via two-dimensional [[Brownian motion]] is well known.&lt;ref name="RY"&gt;{{citation|last1=Revuz|first1=Daniel|last2=Yor|first2=Marc|year=1994|title=Continuous martingales and Brownian motion|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer}} (see Exercise (2.17) in Section V.2, page 187).&lt;/ref&gt; Non-probabilistic proofs were available earlier.
* Non-tangential boundary values&lt;ref&gt;See [[Fatou's theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; of an [[Holomorphic function|analytic]] or [[harmonic function|harmonic]] function exist at almost all boundary points of non-tangential boundedness. This result ([[Ivan Privalov|Privalov]]'s theorem), and several results of this kind, are deduced from [[Doob's martingale convergence theorems|martingale convergence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Durrett|first=Richard|author-link=Rick Durrett|year=1984|title=Brownian motion and martingales in analysis|place=California|publisher=Wadsworth|isbn=0-534-03065-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-probabilistic proofs were available earlier.
* The [[boundary Harnack principle]] is proved using Brownian motion&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Bass|first1=R.F.|author1-link=Richard F.

* [[Basel problem|Euler's Basel sum]], &lt;math&gt;
\qquad \sum_{n=1}^\infin \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6},
&lt;/math&gt; can be demonstrated by considering the expected exit time of planar Brownian motion from an infinite strip. A number of other less well-known identities can be deduced in a similar manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Markowsky|first=Greg T.|year=2011|title=On the expected exit time of planar Brownian motion from simply connected domains|journal=Electronic Communications in Probability|volume=16|pages=652–663|url=http://ecp.ejpecp.org/article/view/1653|doi=10.1214/ecp.v16-1653}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Picard theorem]] can be proved using the winding properties of planar Brownian motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Davis|first=Burgess|year=1975|title=Picard’s theorem and Brownian motion|journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society|volume=213|pages=353–362|doi=10.2307/1998050}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Davis|first=Burgess|year=1979|title=Brownian motion and analytic functions|journal=Annals of Probability|pages=913–932|doi=10.1214/aop/1176994888|volume=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fact that every [[Lipschitz function]] on the real line is differentiable almost everywhere can be proved using [[martingale convergence]].

==Combinatorics==
* A number of theorems stating existence of graphs (and other discrete structures) with desired properties are proved by the [[probabilistic method]]. Non-probabilistic proofs are available for a few of them.
* The [[maximum-minimums identity]] admits a probabilistic proof.

==Algebra==
* The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] can be proved using two-dimensional Brownian motion.&lt;ref name="RY" /&gt; Non-probabilistic proofs were available earlier.
* The [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem#Generalizations|index theorem for elliptic complexes]] is proved using probabilistic methods&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Jean-Michel Bismut|first=Jean-Michel|last=Bismut|title=The Atiyah–Singer Theorems: A Probabilistic Approach. I. The index theorem|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022123684901010|journal=J. Funct.

==Topology and geometry==
* A smooth [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] is evidently two-sided, but a non-smooth (especially, fractal) boundary can be quite complicated. It was conjectured to be two-sided in the sense that the natural projection of the [[Martin boundary]]&lt;ref&gt;As long as we have no article on [[Martin boundary]], see [[Compactification (mathematics)#Other compactification theories]].&lt;/ref&gt; to the topological boundary is at most 2 to 1 almost everywhere.&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{citation|last=Bishop|first=C.|year=1991|title=A characterization of Poissonian domains|journal=Arkiv för Matematik|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1007/BF02384328|bibcode=1991ArM....29....1B}} (see Section 6).&lt;/ref&gt; This conjecture is proved using [[Wiener process|Brownian motion]], [[Local time (mathematics)|local time]], [[Stochastic calculus|stochastic integration]], [[Coupling (probability)|coupling]], hypercontractivity etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Tsirelson|first=Boris|author-link=Boris Tsirelson|year=1997|title=Triple points: from non-Brownian filtrations to harmonic measures|journal=Geometric and Functional Analysis|publisher=Birkhauser|volume=7|issue=6|pages=1096–1142|doi=10.1007/s000390050038|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/56rd92tcftkf1c75/?p=43028bb7776b469abef8e7439f8ca086&amp;pi=2}}.

A non-probabilistic proof is found 18 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tolsa | first1 = Xavier | last2 = Volberg | first2 = Alexander | year = 2017 | title = On Tsirelson's theorem about triple points for harmonic measure | arxiv=1608.04022 | journal = International Mathematics Research Notices | doi=10.1093/imrn/rnw345}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Introduction to systolic geometry#Loewner's torus inequality|Loewner's torus inequality]] relates the area of a [[compact surface]] (topologically, a torus) to its [[Introduction to systolic geometry#Notion of systole|systole]].

* The weak halfspace theorem for [[minimal surface]]s states that any complete minimal surface of bounded curvature which is not a plane is not contained in any halfspace. This theorem is proved using a [[coupling]] between Brownian motions on minimal surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Neel | first=Robert W. |year=2008 | title=A martingale approach to minimal surfaces | journal=Journal of Functional Analysis | publisher=Elsevier | volume=256 | issue=8 | pages=2440–2472 | doi=10.1016/j.jfa.2008.06.033}}. Also [https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0556 arXiv:0805.0556].&lt;/ref&gt; A non-probabilistic proof was available earlier.

==Number theory==
* The [[normal number]] theorem (1909), due to [[Émile Borel]], could be one of the first examples of the [[probabilistic method]], providing the first proof of existence of normal numbers, with the help of the first version of the strong [[Law of large numbers#Strong law|law of large numbers]] (see also the first item of the section [[#Analysis|Analysis]]).

&lt;!-- In [[algebra]], a locally nilpotent derivation of a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is a special kind of a [[Derivation (differential algebra)|derivation]] of a ring.--&gt;

One motivation for the study of locally nilpotent derivations comes from the fact that some of the counterexamples to [[Hilbert's 14th problem]] are obtained as the kernels of a derivation on a polynomial ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Daigle |first=Daniel |title=Hilbert's Fourteenth Problem and Locally Nilpotent Derivations |url=http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~ddaigle/articles/H14survey.pdf |website=[[University of Ottawa]] |access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of characteristic zero, to give a locally nilpotent derivation on the integral domain &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, finitely generated over the field, is equivalent to giving an action of the [[additive group]] &lt;math&gt;(k,+)&lt;/math&gt; to the affine variety &lt;math&gt;X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Roughly speaking, an affine variety admitting "plenty" of actions of the additive group is considered similar to an affine space.{{vague|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name="AFKKZ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arzhantsev|first1=I.|last2=Flenner|first2=H.|last3=Kaliman|first3=S.|last4=Kutzschebauch|first4=F.|last5=Zaidenberg|first5=M.|title=Flexible varieties and automorphism groups|journal=Duke Math.

Roughly speaking, an affine variety &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be [[Flexible variety|flexible]], and thus similar to an affine space, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; admits plenty of such actions, or equivalently, if its coordinate ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[X]&lt;/math&gt; has a lot of locally nilpotent derivations.--&gt;

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Recall that a [[Derivation (differential algebra)|derivation]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a map &lt;math&gt;\partial\colon\, A\to A &lt;/math&gt; satisfying the [[product rule|Leibniz rule]] &lt;math&gt;\partial (ab)=(\partial a)b+a(\partial b)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;a,b\in A &lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] over a field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, we additionally require &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-linear, so &lt;math&gt;k\subseteq \ker \partial&lt;/math&gt;.

A derivation &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''locally nilpotent derivation'' (LND) if for every &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a positive integer  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\partial^{n}(a)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[Graded ring|graded]], we say that a locally nilpotent derivation &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; is ''homogeneous'' (of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;\deg \partial a=\deg a +d&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of locally nilpotent derivations of a ring &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this set has no obvious structure: it is neither closed under addition (e.g. if  &lt;math&gt;\partial_{1}=y\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\partial_{2}=x\tfrac{\partial}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\partial_{1},\partial_{2}\in \operatorname{LND}(k[x,y])&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;(\partial_{1}+\partial_{2})^{2}(x)=x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\partial_{1}+\partial_{2}\not\in \operatorname{LND}(k[x,y])&lt;/math&gt;) nor under multiplication by elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\in \operatorname{LND}(k[x])&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;x\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\not\in\operatorname{LND}(k[x])&lt;/math&gt;). However, if &lt;math&gt;[\partial_{1},\partial_{2}]=0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\partial_{1},\partial_{2}\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\partial_{1}+\partial_{2}\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Freudenburg" /&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;\partial\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h\in\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;h\partial\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Relation to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-actions ==
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an algebra over a field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of characteristic zero (e.g. &lt;math&gt;k=\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;). Then there is a one-to-one corresponence between the locally nilpotent &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-derviations on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Group-scheme action|actions]] of the additive group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; on the affine variety &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} A&lt;/math&gt;, as follows.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freudenburg|first1=G.|title=Algebraic theory of locally nilpotent derivations|date=2006|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-29521-1|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.10&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} A&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to an &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-algebra homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\rho\colon A\to A[t]&lt;/math&gt;. Any such &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; determines a locally nilpotnent derivation &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; by taking its derivative at zero, namely &lt;math&gt;\partial=\epsilon \circ \tfrac{d}{dt}\circ \rho,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; denotes the evaluation at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;. 
Conversely, any locally nilpotent derivation &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; determines a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\rho\colon A\to A[t]&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt; \rho=\exp (t\partial)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{t^{n}}{n!}\partial^{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that the conjugate actions correspond to conjugate derivations, i.e. if &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in \operatorname{Aut} A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\alpha\circ\partial \circ \alpha^{-1}\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exp(t\cdot \alpha\circ\partial \circ \alpha^{-1})=\alpha \circ \exp(t\partial)\circ \alpha^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

== The kernel algorithm ==
The algebra &lt;math&gt;\ker \partial&lt;/math&gt; consists of the invariants of the corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action. It is algebraically and factorially closed in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg" /&gt; A special case of [[Hilbert's fourteenth problem|Hilbert's 14th problem]] asks whether &lt;math&gt;\ker \partial&lt;/math&gt; is finitely generated, or, if &lt;math&gt;A=k[X]&lt;/math&gt;, whether the [[GIT quotient|quotient]] &lt;math&gt;X/\!/\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; is affine. By [[Zariski's finiteness theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zariski|first1=O.|title=Interprétations algébrico-géométriques du quatorzième problème de Hilbert|journal=Bull. Sci. Math. (2)|date=1954|volume=78|pages=155–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is true if &lt;math&gt;\dim X\leq 3&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, this question is highly nontrivial even for &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb{C}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n\geq 4&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;n\geq 5&lt;/math&gt; the answer, in general, is negative.&lt;ref name="derksen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Derksen|first1=H. G. J.|title=The kernel of a derivation|journal=J. Pure Appl. Algebra|date=1993|volume=84|issue=1|pages=13–16|doi=10.1016/0022-4049(93)90159-Q|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/002240499390159Q/1-s2.0-002240499390159Q-main.pdf?_tid=d1b1181a-a831-11e7-962f-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1507031938_0ee032807aa55bfa8c109ead979e3df1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case &lt;math&gt;n=4&lt;/math&gt; is open.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg" /&gt;

However, in practice it often happens that &lt;math&gt;\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt; is known to be finitely generated: notably, by the Maurer&amp;ndash;Weitzenböck theorem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seshadri|first1=C.S.|title=On a theorem of Weitzenböck in invariant theory|journal=J. Math. Kyoto Univ.|date=1962|volume=1|pages=403–409|doi=10.1215/kjm/1250525012|url=https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.kjm/1250525012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the case for ''linear'' LND's of the polynomial algebra over a field of characteristic zero (by ''linear'' we mean homogeneous of degree zero with respect to the standard grading).

Assume &lt;math&gt;\ker \partial&lt;/math&gt; is finitely generated. If &lt;math&gt;A=k[g_1,\dots, g_n]&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely generated algebra over a field of characteristic zero, then &lt;math&gt;\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt; can be computed using van den Essen's algorithm,&lt;ref name="van den Essen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=van den Essen|first1=A.|title=Polynomial automorphisms and the Jacobian conjecture|date=2000|publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag|location=Basel|isbn=3-7643-6350-9|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-0348-8440-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows. Choose a ''local slice'', i.e. an element &lt;math&gt;r\in \ker \partial^{2}\setminus \ker \partial&lt;/math&gt; and put &lt;math&gt;f=\partial r\in \ker\partial&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\pi_{r}\colon\, A\to (\ker \partial)_{f}&lt;/math&gt; be the ''Dixmier map'' given by &lt;math&gt;\pi_{r}(a)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!}\partial^{n}(a)\frac{r^{n}}{f^{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. Now for every &lt;math&gt;i=1,\dots, n&lt;/math&gt;, chose a minimal integer &lt;math&gt;m_{i}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h_{i}\colon = f^{m_{i}}\pi_{r}(g_{i})\in \ker\partial&lt;/math&gt;, put &lt;math&gt;B_{0}=k[h_{1},\dots, h_{n},f]\subseteq \ker \partial&lt;/math&gt;, and define inductively &lt;math&gt;B_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to be the subring of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt; \{h\in A: fh\in B_{i-1}\}&lt;/math&gt;. By induction, one proves that &lt;math&gt;B_{0}\subset B_{1}\subset \dots \subset\ker \partial &lt;/math&gt; are finitely generated and if &lt;math&gt;B_{i}=B_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;B_{i}=\ker \partial&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;B_{N}=\ker \partial&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. Finding the generators of each &lt;math&gt;B_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and checking whether &lt;math&gt;B_{i}=B_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is a standard computation using [[Gröbner bases]].&lt;ref name="van den Essen" /&gt;

== Slice theorem ==
Assume that &lt;math&gt;\partial\in\operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; admits a ''slice'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;s\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\partial s=1&lt;/math&gt;. The ''slice theorem''&lt;ref name="Freudenburg" /&gt; asserts that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial algebra &lt;math&gt;(\ker\partial) [s]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial=\tfrac{d}{ds}&lt;/math&gt;.

For any local slice &lt;math&gt;r\in\ker\partial \setminus \ker\partial^{2}&lt;/math&gt; we can apply the slice theorem to the [[Localization of a ring|localization]] &lt;math&gt;A_{\partial r}&lt;/math&gt;, and thus obtain that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is ''locally'' a polynomial algebra with a standard derivation. In geometric terms, if a [[geometric quotient]] &lt;math&gt;\pi\colon\,X\to X/\!/\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; is affine (e.g. when &lt;math&gt;\dim X\leq 3&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Zariski's finiteness theorem|Zariski theorem]]), then it has a Zariski-open subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic over &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;U\times \mathbb{A}^{1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; acts by translation on the second factor.

However, in general it is not true that &lt;math&gt;X\to X//\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; is locally trivial. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deveney|first1=J.|last2=Finston|first2=D.|title=A proper &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{5}&lt;/math&gt; which is not locally trivial|journal=Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.|date=1995|volume=123|issue=3|pages=651–655|doi=10.2307/2160782|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1995-123-03/S0002-9939-1995-1273487-0/S0002-9939-1995-1273487-0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; let &lt;math&gt;\partial=u\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}+v\tfrac{\partial}{\partial y}+(1+uy^2)\tfrac{\partial}{\partial z}\in \operatorname{LND}(\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,u,v])&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt; is a coordinate ring of a singular variety, and the fibers of the quotient map over singular points are two-dimensional.

If &lt;math&gt;\dim X=3&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=X\setminus U&lt;/math&gt; is a curve. To describe the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action, it is important to understand the goemetry &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. Assume further that &lt;math&gt;k=\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[Smooth variety|smooth]] and [[contractible]] (in which case &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is smooth and contractible as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaliman|first1=S|last2=Saveliev|first2=N.|title=&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_{+}&lt;/math&gt;-Actions on contractible threefolds|journal=Michigan Math.

Then [[Shulim Kaliman|Kaliman]] proved&lt;ref name="Kaliman" /&gt; that each irreducible component of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a ''polynomial curve'', i.e. its [[Normalization of an algebraic variety|normalization]] is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{1}&lt;/math&gt;. The curve &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; for the action given by Freudeburg's (2,5)-derivation (see [[#Examples|below]]) is a union of two lines in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; may not be irreducible. However, it is conjectured that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is always [[contractible]].&lt;ref name="Seattle"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaliman|first1=S.|title=Actions of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{*}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_{+}&lt;/math&gt; on affine algebraic varieties|journal=Proc.

;Example 1
The standard coordinate derivations &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt; of a polynomial algebra &lt;math&gt;k[x_1,\dots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt; are locally nilpotent.

;[[Shulim Kaliman|Kaliman]]'s theorem
Every fixed-point free action of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^{3}&lt;/math&gt; is conjugate to a translation. In other words, every &lt;math&gt;\partial \in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; such that the image of &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; generates the unit ideal (or, equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; defines a nowhere vanishing vector field), admits a slice. This results answers one of the conjectures from [[Challenging problems on affine n-space|Kraft's list]].&lt;ref name="Kaliman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaliman|first1=S.|title=Free &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_{+}&lt;/math&gt;-actions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^3&lt;/math&gt; are translations|journal=Invent.

=== Triangular derivations ===
Let &lt;math&gt;f_1,\dots,f_n&lt;/math&gt; be any system of variables of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;; that is, &lt;math&gt;A=k[f_1,\dots, f_n]&lt;/math&gt;. A derivation of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called ''[[triangular derivation|triangular]]'' with respect to this system of variables, if &lt;math&gt;\partial f_1\in k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial f_{i} \in k[f_1,\dots,f_{i-1}]&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;. A derivation is called ''triangulable'' if it is conjugate to a triangular one, or, equivalently, if it is triangular with respect to some system of variables. Every triangular derivation is locally nilpotent. The converse is true for &lt;math&gt;\leq 2&lt;/math&gt; by Rentschler's theorem above, but it is not true for &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;.

;Bass's example

L.|title=On actions of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;|journal=Algebraic groups, Utrecht 1986|pages=237–242|doi=10.1007/BFb0079241}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fixed point set of a triangulable &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;Z\times \mathbb{A}^{1}&lt;/math&gt; for some affine variety &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;; and thus cannot have an isolated singularity.

The above necessary geometrical condition was later generalized by Freudenburg.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_tr"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freudenburg|first1=G.|title=Triangulability criteria for additive group actions on affine space|journal=J.

A [[corank]] of &lt;math&gt;\partial\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal number &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; such that there exists a system of variables &lt;math&gt;f_1,\dots, f_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f_1,\dots, f_j\in\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}\partial&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; minus the corank of &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;.

We have &lt;math&gt;1\leq \operatorname{rank}\partial \leq n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}(\partial)=1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if in some coordinates, &lt;math&gt;\partial=h\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x_{n}}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;h\in k[x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_tr" /&gt;

Theorem: If &lt;math&gt;\partial\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is triangulable, then any hypersurface contained in the fixed-point set of the corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;Z\times \mathbb{A}^{\operatorname{rank} \partial}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_tr" /&gt;

In particular, LND's of maximal rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; cannot be triangulable. Such derivations do exist for &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;: the first example is the ''(2,5)-homogeneous derivation'' (see above), and it can be easily generalized to any &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Fr_(2,5)" /&gt;

A '''mathematical coincidence''' is said to occur when two expressions with no direct relationship  show a near-equality which has no apparent theoretical explanation.

For example, there is a near-equality close to the [[round number]] [[1000 (number)|1000]] between powers of 2 and powers of 10:

{{Quotation|&lt;math&gt;2^{10} = 1024 \approx 1000 = 10^3&lt;/math&gt;}}

Some mathematical coincidences are used in [[engineering]] when one expression is taken as an approximation of another.

==Introduction==
A mathematical coincidence often involves an [[integer]], and the surprising (or "coincidental") feature is the fact that a [[real number]] arising in some context is considered by some standard as a "close" approximation to a small integer or to a multiple or power of ten, or more generally, to a [[rational number]] with a small [[denominator]].  Other kinds of mathematical coincidences, such as integers simultaneously satisfying multiple seemingly unrelated criteria or coincidences regarding units of measurement, may also be considered.  In the class of those coincidences that are of a purely mathematical sort, some simply result from sometimes very deep mathematical facts, while others appear to come 'out of the blue'.

Given the [[countably infinite]] number of ways of forming mathematical expressions using a finite number of symbols, the number of symbols used and the [[Arithmetic precision|precision]] of approximate equality might be the most obvious way to assess mathematical coincidences; but there is no standard, and the [[strong law of small numbers]] is the sort of thing one has to appeal to with no formal opposing mathematical guidance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Beyond this, some sense of [[Mathematical beauty|mathematical aesthetics]] could be invoked to adjudicate the value of a mathematical coincidence, and there are in fact exceptional cases of true mathematical significance (see [[Ramanujan's constant]] below, which made it into print some years ago as a scientific [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke&lt;ref name="gardner"&gt;Reprinted as {{Cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Martin|authorlink1=Martin Gardner|title=The Colossal Book of Mathematics|year=2001|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=0-393-02023-1|pages=674–694|chapter=Six Sensational Discoveries}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  All in all, though, they are generally to be considered for their curiosity value or, perhaps, to encourage new mathematical learners at an elementary level.

==Some examples==

===Rational approximants===
Sometimes simple rational approximations are exceptionally close to interesting irrational values.  These are explainable in terms of large terms in the [[continued fraction]] representation of the irrational value, but further insight into why such improbably large terms occur is often not available.

Rational approximants (convergents of continued fractions) to ratios of logs of different numbers are often invoked as well, making coincidences between the powers of those numbers.&lt;ref name=schroeder/&gt;

Many other coincidences are combinations of numbers that put them into the form that such rational approximants provide close relationships.

====Concerning π====
* The first [[convergent (continued fraction)|convergent]] of π, [3; 7] = 22/7 = 3.1428..., was known to [[Archimedes]],&lt;ref name=beckmann/&gt; and is correct to about 0.04%.  The third convergent of π, [3; 7, 15, 1] = [[355/113]] = 3.1415929..., found by [[Zu Chongzhi]],&lt;ref&gt;

* There is a sequence of [[six nines in pi]] that begins at the 762nd decimal place of the decimal representation of pi. For a randomly chosen [[normal number]], the probability of any chosen number sequence of six digits (including 6 of a number, 658 020, or the like) occurring this early in the decimal representation is only 0.08%. Pi is conjectured, but not known, to be a normal number.
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{6}\pi\approx\varphi^2&lt;/math&gt;; correct to within 0.002%.
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{5}{6}\cdot\frac{7}{8}\cdot\dots\frac{13}{14}\cdot 15\approx\pi&lt;/math&gt;; correct to within 0.05%.

====Concerning e====
* The number 1828 repeats twice in a row after the 2nd digit in the decimal expansion of [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] and immediately after that the next digits are 459045, which show the angles of an isosceles right triangle in degrees. After that, the next 3 digits are the first 3 prime numbers, and after that is [[360 (number)|360]], the sum of all angles of a square/circle. e = 2.7 1828 1828 45 90 45 2 3 5 360....
* Related to the above, &lt;math&gt; e \approx 2721/1001 &lt;/math&gt;.  When calculating e in base 60 or 120, it is useful to find 1001 (1+1/1!+1/2! .. +1/13!).  These are exact expressions in these bases.  Also, 718 + 281 = 999, (i.e. 718 281 718 ... is 719/1001), which makes this one of the convergences to e.
* There is a sequence of "99 999 999" within the first 500,000 digits of e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=|last1=|title=The Number e to 1 Million Digits|url=https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/e.1mil|website=|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concerning base 2====
* The coincidence &lt;math&gt;2^{10} = 1024 \approx 1000 = 10^3&lt;/math&gt;, correct to 2.4%, relates to the rational approximation &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{\log10}{\log2} \approx 3.3219 \approx \frac{10}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt; 2 \approx 10^{3/10}&lt;/math&gt; to within 0.3%.  This relationship is used in engineering, for example to approximate a factor of two in [[Electric power|power]] as 3&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] (actual is 3.0103&amp;nbsp;dB – see [[Half-power point]]), or to relate a [[kibibyte]] to a [[kilobyte]]; see [[binary prefix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

* This coincidence can also be expressed as &lt;math&gt;128 = 2^7 \approx 5^3 = 125&lt;/math&gt; (eliminating common factor of &lt;math&gt;2^3&lt;/math&gt;, so also correct to 2.4%), which corresponds to the rational approximation &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{\log5}{\log2} \approx 2.3219 \approx \frac{7}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt; 2 \approx 5^{3/7}&lt;/math&gt; (also to within 0.3%). This is invoked for instance in [[shutter speed]] settings on cameras, as approximations to powers of two (128, 256, 512) in the sequence of speeds 125, 250, 500, etc.&lt;ref name=schroeder/&gt;

====Concerning musical intervals====
* The coincidence &lt;math&gt;2^{19} \approx 3^{12}&lt;/math&gt;, from &lt;math&gt;\frac{\log3}{\log2} \approx 1.5849\dots \approx \frac{19}{12}&lt;/math&gt; leads to the observation commonly used in [[music]] to relate the tuning of 7 [[semitone]]s of [[equal temperament]] to a [[perfect fifth]] of [[just intonation]]:  &lt;math&gt;2^{7/12}\approx 3/2;&lt;/math&gt;, correct to about 0.1%.  The just fifth is the basis of [[Pythagorean tuning]] and most known systems of music.  From the consequent approximation &lt;math&gt;{(3/2)}^{12}\approx 2^7,&lt;/math&gt; it follows that the [[circle of fifths]] terminates seven [[octave]]s higher than the origin.&lt;ref name=schroeder&gt;{{Cite book

* The coincidence &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[12]{2}\sqrt[7]{5} = 1.33333319\ldots \approx \frac43&lt;/math&gt; leads to the [[Schisma|rational version]] of [[12-TET]], as noted by [[Johann Kirnberger]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

* The coincidence &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[9]{0.6}\sqrt[28]{4.9} = 0.99999999754\ldots \approx 1&lt;/math&gt; leads to the very tiny interval of &lt;math&gt;2^{9}3^{-28}5^{37}7^{-18}&lt;/math&gt; (about a [[Cent (music)|millicent]] wide), which is the first [[Limit (music)|7-limit]] interval tempered out in [[103169-TET]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
* The coincidence of powers of 2, above, leads to the approximation that three major thirds concatenate to an octave, &lt;math&gt;{(5/4)}^{3} \approx {2/1}&lt;/math&gt;.  This and similar approximations in music are called [[Diesis|dieses]].

====Concerning powers of {{pi}}====

* &lt;math&gt;\pi^2\approx10;&lt;/math&gt; correct to about 1.3%.&lt;ref name="Pi"&gt;Frank Rubin, [http://www.contestcen.com/pi.htm The Contest Center – Pi].&lt;/ref&gt; This can be understood in terms of the formula for the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] &lt;math&gt;\zeta(2)=\pi^2/6.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.harvard.edu/~elkies/Misc/pi10.pdf Why is &lt;math&gt;\pi^2&lt;/math&gt; so close to 10?], [[Noam Elkies]]&lt;/ref&gt; This coincidence was used in the design of [[slide rule]]s, where the "folded" scales are folded on &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{10},&lt;/math&gt; because it is a more useful number and has the effect of folding the scales in about the same place.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
* &lt;math&gt;\pi \approx 600/191,&lt;/math&gt; The solid angle of the 120-cell of 4 dimensions is 191/600 of the 4-sphere, is very close to 1/pi.  This is also the approximation that 1 radian is 57.3 degrees.
* &lt;math&gt;\pi \approx 377/120&lt;/math&gt; This approximation is &lt;math&gt;6F_{14}/5F_{12}&lt;/math&gt;.  The polygon of 377 sides crosses a circle of diameter 120 on every edge.  As 3° 8' 30" it is an approximation to pi in sexagesimal numbers.

* &lt;math&gt;\pi^2\approx 800/81,&lt;/math&gt; If the quadrant arc is 10, the chord is 9, is known to the ancient Egyptians.  A litre represented as a cylinder of 16 inches circumference and three inches high (48 Hoppus inches) is equal to a cylinder 0.3 feet in circumference and 6 inches high, (0.045 cyl. ft) are equal with this pi.  The reflective cell of the symmetry of the [3,3,5] is equal to unity, when the radius of the 4-sphere is taken as 9.{{clarification needed|date=September 2018}}
* &lt;math&gt;\pi^3\approx 31,&lt;/math&gt; correct to 0.02%.
* &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\pi} \approx 39/22&lt;/math&gt; to 0.015%.

* &lt;math&gt;\pi\approx\left(9^2+\frac{19^2}{22}\right)^{1/4},&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;22\pi^4\approx 2143;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=wolfram/&gt; accurate to 8 decimal places (due to [[Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan|Ramanujan]]: ''Quarterly Journal of Mathematics'', XLV, 1914, pp.&amp;nbsp;350–372).  Ramanujan states that this "curious approximation" to &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; was "obtained empirically" and has no connection with the theory developed in the remainder of the paper.
:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt[4]{\frac{2143}{22}} = 3.1415926525 \dots &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt[5]{306} = 3.14155 \dots &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt[6]{\frac{17305}{18}} = 3.1415924 \dots &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt[7]{\frac{21142}{7}} = 3.14159 \dots &lt;/math&gt;
Some plausible relations hold to a high degree of accuracy, but are nevertheless coincidental. One example is

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_0^\infty \cos(2x)\prod_{n=1}^\infty \cos\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)\mathrm{d}x \approx \frac{\pi}{8}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The two sides of this expression only differ after the 42nd decimal place.&lt;ref&gt;http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/math-future.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;e^\pi - \pi\approx 19.99909998 &lt;/math&gt; is very close to 20 (Conway, Sloane, Plouffe, 1988); this is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(\pi+20)^i=-0.999 999 999 2\ldots -i\cdot 0.000 039\ldots \approx -1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=wolfram&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=AlmostInteger|title=Almost Integer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a consequence of the fact that 163 is a [[Heegner number]].

====Concerning logarithms====
* &lt;math&gt;\ln 2\approx \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{\frac{2}{5}}&lt;/math&gt;, correct to 0.00024%
* &lt;math&gt;\log_{9} 30\approx \log_{8} 25&lt;/math&gt;, [https://www.google.com/search?q=log(25)/log(8)/(log(30)/log(9))-1 within 0.000028%]. Equivalently: &lt;math&gt;\log{2}+\log{3}+\log{5}\approx \frac{4}{3} \frac{\log{3}\log{5}}{\log{2}}&lt;/math&gt; (in all bases).
* &lt;math&gt;\ln 2 \approx \sqrt{\ln \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;, correct to 0.08%
* &lt;math&gt;\ln x + \log_{10} x \approx \log_2 x&lt;/math&gt;, correct to 0.6% (for all &lt;math&gt; x &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;).

* &lt;math&gt; 6^{\phi} \approx \phi^6 \approx 18 &lt;/math&gt;  Both of these show up nicely in base 18.  In the first, the fibonacci numbers are &lt;math&gt;F_{n+6} = 18 F_n - F_{n-6}&lt;/math&gt; while the multiplication series &lt;math&gt;PF_{n+1}=PF_n \times PF_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; starting with 2, 3 runs through 18, and descends to 243/256 and 32/27.
* &lt;math&gt; 9^{\phi} \approx 35 &lt;/math&gt; shows in the logarithm-approximation log(3) / 13 ~ log(5) / 19 ~ log(7) / 23.

* In a discussion of the [[birthday problem]], the number &lt;math&gt;\lambda=\frac{1}{365}{23\choose 2}=\frac{253}{365}&lt;/math&gt; occurs, which is "amusingly" equal to &lt;math&gt;\ln(2)&lt;/math&gt; to 4 digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* &lt;math&gt;3^3+4^4+3^3+5^5=3435&lt;/math&gt;. This makes 3435 a base-10 [[Perfect digit-to-digit invariant|Münchhausen number]]. In fact, other than 0 and 1, the number 3435 is the only base-10 Münchhausen number. However, if one is willing to, for these purposes, adopt the convention that &lt;math&gt;0^0=0&lt;/math&gt;, then 438579088 is another Münchhausen number. For a few months, the number 3435 was the favorite number of [[Matt Parker]], a stand-up mathematician, but he soon "got bored" and switched his favorite number to other types of numbers, such as [[Narcissistic number|narcissistic numbers]] and [[Perfect number|perfect numbers]]. Parker vehemently disagrees with the notion that 438579088 is another Münchhausen number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Numberphile|title=3435 - Numberphile|date=2012-01-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJY74Bw8mw|accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MuenchhausenNumber.html|title=Münchhausen Number|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;(25+9)+(25 \cdot 9) = 259&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, this works so long as the latter part of the number is one less than a power of 10. For instance, &lt;math&gt;(42+9)+(42 \cdot 9) = 429&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(42+99)+(42 \cdot 99) = 4299&lt;/math&gt;.

===Numerical coincidences in numbers from the physical world===

====Length of one day====
The fifth [[hyperfactorial]]: 5⁵ × 4⁴ × 3³ × 2² × 1¹ = 86,400,000 is the number of milliseconds in 24 hours.

====Length of six weeks====
The number of seconds in six weeks, or 42 days, is exactly 10! (ten [[factorial]]) seconds (as &lt;math&gt;24 = 4!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;42 = 6 \cdot 7&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;60^2 = 5 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10&lt;/math&gt;). Many have recognized this coincidence in particular because of the [[42 (number)|importance of 42]] in [[Douglas Adams|Douglas Adams']] ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.

====Length of a century====
&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; seconds is a [[nano-]][[century]]: 100 years × 365.25 days per year (0.25 is for a leap day every fourth year) × 24 hours per day × 3600 seconds per hour = 3,155,760,000 sec ≈ ''π'' sec × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; within 0.45%.

====Speed of light====
The [[speed of light]] is (by definition) exactly 299,792,458&amp;nbsp;m/s, very close to 300,000,000&amp;nbsp;m/s. This is a pure coincidence, as the meter was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance between the Earth's pole and equator along the surface at sea level, and the Earth's circumference just happens to be about 2/15 of a light-second.&lt;ref name="Miracles"&gt;{{cite web|last=Michon|first=Gérard P.|title=Numerical Coincidences in Man-Made Numbers|url=http://www.numericana.com/answer/miracles.htm|work=Mathematical Miracles|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also roughly equal to one foot per nanosecond (the actual number is 0.9836&amp;nbsp;ft/ns).

====Earth's diameter====
The polar diameter of the Earth is equal to half a billion inches, to within 0.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid |first1=Charles |last1=Smythe |page=39 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xB0WSOokTg0C&amp;pg=PA39 |year=2004 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=1-4179-7429-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gravitational acceleration====
{{See also|Seconds pendulum}}
While not constant but varying depending on [[latitude]] and [[altitude]], the numerical value of the [[gravitational acceleration|acceleration caused by Earth's gravity]] on the surface lies between 9.74 and 9.87, which is quite close to 10. This means that as a result of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], the weight of a kilogram of mass on Earth's surface corresponds roughly to 10 [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] of force exerted on an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cracking the AP Physics B &amp; C Exam, 2004–2005 Edition |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XcX_TvhNjK0C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=approximation |isbn=0-375-76387-2 |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton Review Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is related to the aforementioned coincidence that the square of pi is close to 10. One of the early definitions of the meter was the length of a pendulum whose half swing had a period equal to one second. Since the period of the full swing of a pendulum is approximated by the equation below, algebra shows that if this definition was maintained, gravitational acceleration measured in meters per second per second would be exactly equal to &lt;math&gt;\pi^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/03/what-does-pi-have-to-do-with-gravity/|title=What Does Pi Have To Do With Gravity?|publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|date=March 8, 2013|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T \approx 2\pi \sqrt\frac{L}{g}&lt;/math&gt;

When it was discovered that the circumference of the earth was very close to 40,000,000 times this value, the meter was [[Meter#Timeline of definition|redefined]] to reflect this, as it was a more objective standard (because the gravitational acceleration varies over the surface of the Earth). This had the effect of increasing the length of the meter by less than 1%, which was within the experimental error of the time.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Another coincidence related to the gravitational acceleration ''[[gravitational acceleration|g]]'' is that its value of approximately 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to 1.03&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]/year&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which numerical value is close to 1. This is related to the fact that ''g'' is close to 10 in [[International System of Units|SI units]] (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), as mentioned above, combined with the fact that the number of seconds per year happens to be close to the numerical value of ''c''/10, with ''c'' the [[speed of light]] in m/s.  In fact, it has nothing to do with SI as ''c/g'' = 354 days, nearly, and 365/354 = 1.03.

====Rydberg constant====
The [[Rydberg constant]], when multiplied by the speed of light and expressed as a frequency, is close to &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi^2}{3}\times 10^{15}\ \text{Hz}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="Miracles"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{3.2898}41960364(17) \times 10^{15}\ \text{Hz} = R_\infty c&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rydberg constant times c in Hz|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?rydchz|work=Fundamental physical constants|publisher=NIST|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{3.2898}68133696\ldots = \frac{\pi^2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

=====Avagadro's Number=====

The pound-mole, being 1 pound / 1 amu, is 273.16*10^24, against the triple-point of water at 273.16 K.  This is interesting in terms of the pound-Celcius system.

====US customary to metric conversions====
&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{62}&lt;/math&gt; inches equals &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{62} \cdot 2.54 = 19.99997999998999998999998749998249997 \ldots&lt;/math&gt; centimeters, which is about 0.0001% less than 20 centimeters. The decimal expansion contains many nines early on.

&lt;math&gt;\ln 5&lt;/math&gt; kilometers equals &lt;math&gt;1.000058 \ldots&lt;/math&gt; miles, a difference of 9.4 cm (3.7 in).

As discovered by [[Randall Munroe]], a cubic mile is close to &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}\pi&lt;/math&gt; cubic kilometers (within 0.5%). This means that a sphere with radius ''n'' kilometers has almost exactly the same volume as a cube with sides length ''n'' miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What If?|author=Randall Munroe|year=2014|page=49|isbn=9781848549562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://what-if.xkcd.com/4/|title=A Mole of Moles|website=what-if.xkcd.com|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multiplier to convert from meters per second to miles per hour is &lt;math&gt;\approx \sqrt 5 = 2 \varphi -1&lt;/math&gt;. Accurate to within 0.04%. As a result, a 1 gram object moving at 100 miles per hour has almost exactly 1 joule of kinetic energy.

One furlong per fortnight is close to one centimetre per minute, to within 0.2%. The first is 201,168 cm/fortnights, the second 201,600 cm/fortnights.

===Fine-structure constant===
The [[fine-structure constant]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;\frac1{137}&lt;/math&gt; and was once conjectured to be precisely &lt;math&gt;\frac1{137}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac1{137.035999074\dots}&lt;/math&gt;

Although this coincidence is not as strong as some of the others in this section, it is notable that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless constant]], so this coincidence is not an artifact of the system of units being used.

A '''mathematical instrument''' is a tool or device used in the study or practice of [[mathematics]]. In [[geometry]], construction of various proofs was done using only a [[compass (drafting)|compass]] and [[straightedge]]; arguments in these proofs relied only on idealized properties of these instruments and literal construction was regarded as only an approximation. In [[applied mathematics]], mathematical instruments were used for measuring angles and distances, in [[astronomy]], [[navigation]], [[surveying]] and in the measurement of time.&lt;ref name=GLT98&gt;Gerard L'Estrange Turner ''Scientific Instruments, 1500-1900: An Introduction'' ( University of California Press, 1998) {{isbn|0520217284}} page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Astrolabe (PSF).png|thumb|right| The [[astrolabe]] was an early mathematical instrument used in astronomy and navigation.]]
Instruments such as the [[astrolabe]], the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], and others were used to measure and accurately record the relative positions and movements of planets and other celestial objects. The [[sextant]] and other related instruments were essential for navigation at sea.  

Most instruments are used within the field of [[geometry]], including the [[ruler]], [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]], [[protractor]], [[set square]], compass, [[ellipsograph]], [[T-square]] and [[opisometer]].  Others are used in [[arithmetic]] (for example the [[abacus]], [[slide rule]] and [[calculator]]) or in [[algebra]] (the [[integraph]]). In astronomy, many have said the pyramids (along with Stonehenge) were actually instruments used for tracking the stars over long periods or for the annual planting seasons.

==In schools==
The [[Oxford Set of Mathematical Instruments]] is a set of instruments used by generations of school children in the United Kingdom and around the world in mathematics and geometry lessons. It includes two set squares, a 180° protractor, a 15&amp;nbsp;cm ruler, a metal compass, a 9&amp;nbsp;cm pencil, a pencil sharpener, an eraser and a 10mm stencil.

'''Mathematical tables''' are lists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying arguments. Before [[calculator]]s were cheap and plentiful, people would use such [[table (information)|tables]] to simplify and drastically speed up [[computation]]. Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common in math and science textbooks.  Specialized tables were published for applications such as [[astronomy]], [[celestial navigation]] and [[statistics]].

==A simple example==
To compute the [[sine]] function of 75 degrees, 9 minutes, 50 seconds&lt;ref&gt;The longitude of [[Philadelphia City Hall]]&lt;/ref&gt; using a table of trigonometric functions such as the Bernegger table from 1619 illustrated here, one might simply round up to 75 degrees, 10 minutes and then find the 10 minute entry on the 75 degree page, shown above-right, which is 0.9666746.

However, this answer is only accurate to four decimal places. If one wanted greater accuracy, one could [[interpolate]] linearly as follows:

From the Bernegger table:
:sin (75° 10′) = 0.9666746
:sin (75° 9′) = 0.9666001

The difference between these values is 0.0000745.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute of arc, we multiply the difference by 50/60 to get a correction of (50/60)*0.0000745 ≈ 0.0000621; and then add that correction to sin (75° 9′) to get :

:sin (75° 9′ 50″) ≈ sin (75° 9′) + 0.0000621 = 0.9666001 + 0.0000621 = 0.9666622

A modern calculator gives sin (75° 9′ 50″) = 0.96666219991, so our interpolated answer is accurate to the 7-digit precision of the Bernegger table.

For tables with greater precision (more digits per value), higher order interpolation may be needed to get full accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abramowitz and Stegun]] Handbook of Mathematical Functions, Introduction §4&lt;/ref&gt; In the era before electronic computers, interpolating table data in this manner was the only practical way to get high accuracy values of mathematical functions needed for applications such as navigation, astronomy and surveying.

To understand the importance of accuracy in applications like navigation note that at [[sea level]] one minute of arc along the Earth's [[equator]] or a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] (indeed, any [[great circle]]) equals approximately one [[nautical mile]] ({{convert|1.852|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

==History and use==
The first tables of [[trigonometric functions]] known to be made were by [[Hipparchus]] (c.190  &amp;ndash; c.120 BCE) and [[Menelaus of Alexandria|Menelaus]] (c.70–140 CE), but both have been lost. Along with the [[Ptolemy's table of chords|surviving table of Ptolemy]] (c. 90 – c.168 CE), they were all tables of chords and not of half-chords, i.e. the [[sine]] function.&lt;ref name="mcs"/&gt; The [[Āryabhaṭa's sine table|table produced by the Indian mathematician Āryabhaṭa]] is considered the first sine table ever constructed.&lt;ref name="mcs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Trigonometric_functions.html |title=The trigonometric functions|last=J J O'Connor and E F Robertson|date=June 1996 |accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Āryabhaṭa's table remained the standard sine table of ancient India. There were continuous attempts to improve the accuracy of this table, culminating in the discovery of the [[Madhava series|power series expansions]] of the sine and cosine functions by [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] (c.1350 – c.1425), and the tabulation of a [[Madhava's sine table|sine table by Madhava]] with values accurate to seven or eight decimal places.

Tables of [[common logarithm]]s were used until the invention of computers and electronic calculators to do rapid multiplications, divisions, and exponentiations, including the extraction of ''n''th roots.

Mechanical special-purpose computers known as [[difference engine]]s were proposed in the 19th century to tabulate polynomial approximations of logarithmic functions &amp;ndash; i.e. to compute large logarithmic tables. This was motivated mainly by errors in logarithmic tables made by the [[human computer]]s of the time. Early digital computers were developed during World War II in part to produce specialized mathematical tables for aiming [[artillery]]. From 1972 onwards, with the launch and growing use of [[HP-35|scientific calculator]]s, most mathematical tables went out of use.

One of the last major efforts to construct such tables was the [[Mathematical Tables Project]] that was started in 1938 as a project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA),  employing 450 out-of-work clerks to tabulate higher mathematical functions, and lasted through World War II.

Tables of [[special functions]] are still used; for example, the use of tables of values of the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the [[normal distribution]] – so-called [[standard normal table]]s – remains commonplace today, especially in schools.

Creating tables stored in [[random-access memory]] is a common [[code optimization]] technique in computer programming, where the use of such tables  speeds up calculations in those cases where a [[Lookup table|table lookup]] is faster than the corresponding calculations (particularly if the computer in question doesn't have a hardware implementation of the calculations). In essence, one [[Space–time tradeoff|trades computing speed for the computer memory space]] required to store the tables.

==Tables of logarithms==
[[File:Logarithmorum Chilias Prima page 0-67.jpg|thumb|A page from [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]]' 1617 ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' showing the base-10 (common) logarithm of the integers 0 to 67 to fourteen decimal places.]]

Tables containing [[common logarithm]]s (base-10) were extensively used in computations prior to the advent of [[computer]]s and [[calculator]]s because logarithms convert problems of multiplication and division into much easier addition and subtraction problems. Base-10 logarithms have an additional property that is unique and useful: The common logarithm of numbers greater than one that differ only by a factor of a power of ten all have the same fractional part, known as the ''mantissa.'' Tables of common logarithms typically included only the [[significand|mantissas]]; the integer part of the logarithm, known as the ''characteristic,'' could easily be determined by counting digits in the original number.

The fractional part of the common logarithm of numbers greater than zero but less than one is just 1 minus the mantissa of the same number with the decimal point shifted to the right of the first non-zero digit. But same mantissa could be (and was) used for numbers less than one by offsetting the characteristic. Thus a single table of common logarithms can be used for the entire range of positive decimal numbers.&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Hedrick, [https://archive.org/details/logarithmictrigo00hedriala Logarithmic and Trigonometric Tables] (Macmillan, New York, 1913).&lt;/ref&gt; See [[common logarithm]] for details on the use of characteristics and mantissas.

{{Citation|title = Precalculus mathematics|author = Vivian Shaw Groza and Susanne M. Shelley|publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|year=1972|isbn=978-0-03-077670-0|page = 182|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yM_lSq1eJv8C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=%22arithmetica+integra%22+logarithm&amp;q=stifel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of logarithms was publicly propounded by [[John Napier]] in 1614, in a book entitled ''Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio'' (''Description of the Wonderful Rule of Logarithms'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Ernest William Hobson|title=John Napier and the invention of logarithms, 1614|year=1914|publisher=The University Press|location=Cambridge|url=https://archive.org/details/johnnapierinvent00hobsiala}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contained fifty-seven pages of explanatory matter and ninety pages of tables related to [[natural logarithms]]. The  English mathematician [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier in 1615, and proposed a re-scaling of [[Napier's logarithm]]s to form what is now known as the [[common logarithm|common]] or base-10 logarithms. Napier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table, and they later published, in 1617, ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' ("The First Thousand Logarithms"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a table for the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.

The computational advance available via common logarithms, the converse of powered numbers or [[exponential notation]], was such that it made calculations by hand much quicker.

In [[logic]], a '''metatheorem''' is a statement about a [[formal system]] proven in a [[metalanguage]]. Unlike theorems proved within a given formal system, a metatheorem is proved within a [[metatheory]], and may reference concepts that are present in the metatheory but not the [[object theory]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A formal system is determined by a formal language and a [[deductive system]] ([[axiom]]s and [[rules of inference]]). The formal system can be used to prove particular sentences of the formal language with that system. Metatheorems, however, are proved externally to the system in question, in its metatheory. Common metatheories used in logic are [[set theory]] (especially in [[model theory]]) and [[primitive recursive arithmetic]] (especially in [[proof theory]]). Rather than demonstrating particular sentences to be provable, metatheorems may show that each of a broad class of sentences can be proved, or show that certain sentences cannot be proved.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Examples==
Examples of metatheorems include:
* The [[deduction theorem]] for [[first-order logic]] says that a sentence of the form φ→ψ is provable from a set of axioms ''A'' if and only if the sentence ψ is provable from the system whose axioms consist of φ and all the axioms of ''A''. 
* The [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory#Class existence theorem|class existence theorem]] of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] states that for every formula whose [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s range only over sets, there is a [[Class (set theory)|class]] consisting of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s satisfying the formula.
* [[Consistency proof]]s of systems such as [[Peano arithmetic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3579">The '''Moschovakis coding lemma''' is a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] from descriptive [[set theory]] involving sets of [[real number]]s in the [[axiom of determinacy]] (the principle that every two-player integer game is determined). The lemma was developed and named after the mathematician, [[Yiannis N. Moschovakis]].

The lemma may be expressed generally as follows:

Let Γ be a non-selfdual point-class closed under ∃ ω ω and ∧ , and ≺ a Γ well-founded relation on ω ω of rank θ ∈ ON. Let R ⊆ dom( ≺ ) × ω ω be such that ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ y R ( x,y ) . Then there is a Γ set A ⊆ dom( ≺ ) × ω ω which is a choice set for R , that is: 1. ∀ α &lt; θ ∃ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ y [ | x | ≺ = α ∧ A ( x,y )] . 2. ∀ x ∀ y A ( x,y ) → [ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∧ R ( x,y )] . Proof. We may assume θ is minimal so that the theorem fails, and fix ≺ , R , and a good universal set U ⊆ ( ω ω ) 3 for the Γ subsets of ( ω ω ) 2 . Easily, θ is a limit ordinal. For δ &lt; θ , say u ∈ ω ω codes a δ -choice set provided (1) holds for α ≤ δ using A = U u , and (2) holds for A = U u where we replace x ∈ dom( ≺ ) with x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∧| x | ≺ ≤ δ . By minimality of θ , for all δ &lt; θ there are δ -choice sets. Play the game where I, II play out u,v ∈ ω ω , and II wins provided that if u codes a δ 1 -choice set for some δ 1 &lt; θ , then v codes a δ 2 -choice set for some δ 2 &gt; δ 1 . If I has a winning strategy, we get a Σ 1 1 set B of reals coding δ -choice sets for arbitrarily large δ &lt; θ . Define then A ( x,y ) ↔∃ w ∈ B U ( w,x,y ), which easily works. Suppose now τ is a winning strategy for II. From the s - m - n theorem, let s : ( ω ω ) 2 → ω ω be continuous such that for all {{lang|el|ϵ}},x,t,w, U ( s ({{lang|el|ϵ}},x ) ,t,w ) ↔ ∃ y ∃ z [ y ≺ x ∧ U ({{lang|el|ϵ}},y,z ) ∧ U ( z,t,w )]. By the recursion theorem, let {{lang|el|ϵ}} 0 be such that U ({{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ) ↔ z = τ ( s ({{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x )). A straightforward induction on | x | ≺ for x ∈ dom( ≺ ) shows that ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ ! z U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ), and ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∀ z [ U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ) → z codes a ≥| x | ≺ -choice set]. Let A ( x,y ) ↔∃ z ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ w [ U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,z,w ) ∧ U ( w,x,y )].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1794">The '''Philosophy of mathematics education''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] area of study and research based on the intersection of the fields of [[mathematics education]] and the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the latter being understood in an inclusive sense to include multidisciplinary theorizing about mathematics incorporating philosophical, sociological, anthropological, semiotic, historical, ethnomathematical, etc., perspectives. 

Some of the central questions addressed by this sub-field are:
*What is mathematics?, and what accounts have philosophers and other theorists given of it?
*How does mathematics relate to society? 
*What are the aims of teaching and learning mathematics?
*What fundamental assumptions underlie the learning and teaching mathematics? 
*How do philosophies of mathematics link with mathematics teaching and learning? 
*What is the status of mathematics education as knowledge field?

For further details see 'What is the philosophy of mathematics education?' by [[Paul Ernest]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2737">The '''Press–Schechter formalism''' is a [[mathematical model]] for predicting the number of objects (such as [[galaxies]] or [[galaxy clusters]]) of a certain mass within a given volume of the Universe. It was described in a famous [[Academic paper|paper]] by [[William H. Press]] and [[Paul L. Schechter|Paul Schechter]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974ApJ...187..425P Formation of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies by Self-Similar Gravitational Condensation], W.H. Press, P. Schechter, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the context of [[Dark matter|cold dark matter]] cosmological models,
perturbations on all scales are imprinted on the universe at very early times,
for example by quantum fluctuations during an [[Inflationary cosmology|inflationary era]].
Later, as radiation redshifts away, these become mass perturbations, and they
start to grow linearly.  Only long after that, starting with small mass scales
and advancing over time to larger mass scales, do the perturbations actually
collapse to form (for example) galaxies or clusters of galaxies, in so-called
hierarchical structure formation (see [[Physical cosmology]]).

Press and Schechter observed that the fraction of mass in collapsed objects
more massive than some mass M is related to the fraction of volume samples
in which the smoothed initial density fluctuations are above some
density threshold.  This yields a formula for the mass function (distribution
of masses) of objects at any given time.

==Result==

The Press–Schechter formalism predicts that the number of objects with mass between &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M+dM&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;N(M)dM = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(1+\frac{n}{3}\right)\frac{\bar{\rho}}{M^2}\left(\frac{M}{M^*}\right)^{\left(3+n\right)/6}\exp\left(-\left(\frac{M}{M^*}\right)^{\left(3+n\right)/3}\right)dM&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean (baryonic and dark) matter density of the universe, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the index of the power spectrum of the fluctuations in the early universe &lt;math&gt;P(k)\propto k^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M^*&lt;/math&gt; is a critical mass above which structures will form.

Qualitatively, the prediction is that the mass distribution is a power law for
small masses, with an exponential cutoff above some characteristic mass that
increases with time.  Such functions had previously been noted by Schechter
as observed [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity functions]],
and are now known as Schechter luminosity functions.  The Press-Schechter
formalism provided the first quantitative model for how such functions might
arise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11678">A [[scientific society]], the '''Quaternion Society''' was an "International Association for Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics". At its peak it consisted of about 60 mathematicians spread throughout the academic world that were experimenting with [[quaternion]]s and other [[hypercomplex number]] systems. The guiding light was [[Alexander Macfarlane]] who served as its Secretary initially, and became President in 1909. The Association published a ''Bibliography'' in 1904 and a ''Bulletin'' (annual report) from 1900 to 1913.

The ''Bulletin'' became a [[review journal]] for topics in [[vector analysis]] and [[abstract algebra]] such as the theory of [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence]]. The mathematical work reviewed pertained largely to [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] and [[linear algebra]] as the methods were in rapid development at the time.
==Genesis==
In 1895, Professor P. Molenbroek of The Hague, Holland, and Shinkichi Kimura studying at Yale put out a call for scholars to form the society in widely circulated journals: [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Kimura &amp; P. Molenbroek (1895) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v52/n1353/pdf/052545a0.pdf Friends and Fellow Workers in Quaternions] [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 52:545–6 (#1353)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science (journal)|Science]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Kimura &amp; P. Molenbroek (1895) ''To those Interested in Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics'' [[Science (journal)|Science]] 2nd Ser, 2:524&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;"Notes" [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 2:53,&amp;nbsp;182; 5:317&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giuseppe Peano]] also announced the society formation in his ''Rivista di Matematica''. 

The call to form an Association was encouraged by Macfarlane in 1896:
:The logical harmony and unification of the whole of mathematical analysis ought to be kept in view. The algebra of space ought to include the algebra of the plane as a special case, just as the algebra of the plane includes the algebra of the line…When vector analysis is developed and presented...we may expect to see many zealous cultivators, many fruitful applications, and, finally, universal diffusion...May the movement initiated by Messrs. Molenbroek and Kimura hasten the realization of this happy result.&lt;ref&gt;A. Macfarlane (1896) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1624707 Quaternions] [[Science (journal)|Science]] (2) 3:99–100, link from [[Jstor]] early content&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 the [[British Association]] met in [[Toronto]] where vector products were discussed:
:Professor [[Olaus Henrici|Henrici]] proposed a new notation to denote the different products of vectors, which consists in using square brackets for vector products and round brackets for scalar products. He likewise advocated adoption of Heaviside’s term "ort" for vector, the [[tensor of a quaternion|tensor]] of which is the number 1. Prof. A. Macfarlane read a communication on the solution of the cubic equation in which he explained how the two binomials in [[cubic function#Cardano’s method|Cardano’s formula]] may be treated as complex quantities, either circular or hyperbolic, all the roots of the cubic can then be deduced by a general method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v56/n1454/pdf/056461a0.pdf "Physics at the British Association"]  [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 56:461,2 (# 1454)&lt;/ref&gt;

A system of national secretaries was announced in the AMS Bulletin in 1899: [[Alexander MacAulay]] for Australasia, [[Victor Schlegel]] for Germany, Joly for Great Britain and Ireland, Giuseppe Peano for Italy, Kimura for Japan, [[Aleksandr Kotelnikov]] for Russia, [[F. Kraft]] for Switzerland, and [[Arthur Stafford Hathaway]] for the USA. For France the national secretary was Paul Genty, an engineer with the division of Ponts et Chaussees, and a quaternion collaborator with [[Charles-Ange Laisant]], author of ''Methode des Quaterniones'' (1881).

[[Victor Schlegel]] reported&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Schlegel]] (1899) "Internationaler Verein zur Beförderung des Studiums der Quaternionen und verwandter Systeme der Mathematik", [[Monatshefte für Mathematik]] 10(1):376&lt;/ref&gt; on the new institution in the [[Monatshefte für Mathematik]].

==Officers==
When the Society was organized in 1899, [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] was chosen as president, but he declined for reasons of poor health.

The first President was [[Robert Stawell Ball]] and [[Alexander Macfarlane]] served as Secretary and Treasurer. In 1905 [[Charles Jasper Joly]] took over as President and L. van Elfrinkhof as Treasurer while Macfarlane continued as Secretary. In 1909 Macfarlane became President, James Byrnie Shaw became Secretary, and van Elfrinkhof continued as Treasurer. The next year Macfarlane and Shaw continued in their posts while Macfarlane also absorbed the office of Treasurer. When Macfarlane died in 1913 after nearly completing the issue of the Bulletin, Shaw completed it and wound up the Association.

The rules state that the President had the power of veto.

==Bulletin==
The ''Bulletin of the Association Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics'' was issued nine times under the editorship of Alexander Macfarlane. Every issue listed the officers of the Association, governing council, rules, members, and a [[financial statement]] from the [[treasurer]]. Today [[HathiTrust]] provides access to these publications that are mainly of historical interest:

==Bibliography==
Published in 1904 at Dublin, cradle of quaternions, the 86 page ''Bibliography of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics''&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Macfarlane]] (1904) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=03030001 Bibliography of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics], weblink from [[Cornell University]] ''Historical Math Monographs''.
*[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v69/n1800/pdf/069604a0.pdf Review:''Bibliography of Quaternions''] in ''Nature'' 69:604&lt;/ref&gt; cited some one thousand references. The publication set a professional standard; for instance the ''Manual of Quaternions'' (1905) of Joly has no bibliography beyond citation of Macfarlane.
Furthermore, in 1967 when M.J. Crowe published ''[[A History of Vector Analysis]]'', he wrote in the preface (page ix) :
:''Concerning bibliography''. No formal bibliographical section has been included with this book. ... the need for a bibliography is greatly diminished by the existence of a book that lists nearly all relevant primary documents published to about 1912, this is Alexander Macfarlane’s ''Bibliography'' ...

Every year more papers and books appeared that were of interest to Association members so it was necessary to update the ''Bibliography'' with supplements in the ''Bulletin''. The categories used to group the items in the supplements give a sense of the changing focus of the Association:

==Aftermath==

In 1913 Macfarlane died, and as related by [[Dirk Struik]], the Society "became a victim of the first World War".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dirk Struik]] (1967) ''A Concise History of Mathematics'', 3rd edition, page 172, [[Dover Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

James Byrnie Shaw, the surviving officer, wrote 50 book notices for American mathematical publications.&lt;ref&gt;See author=Shaw, James Byrnie at [[Mathematical Reviews]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final article review in the ''Bulletin'' was [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=490 The Wilson and Lewis Algebra of Four-Dimensional Space] written by J. B. Shaw. He summarizes,
:This algebra is applied to the representation of the Minkowski time-space world.  It enables all analytical work to be with reals, although the geometry becomes non-Euclidean.
The article reviewed was "The space-time manifold of relativity, the non-euclidean geometry of mechanics, and electromagnetics".&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Wilson &amp; G. N. Lewis (1912) Proceedings of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] 48: 389–507&lt;/ref&gt;
However, when the [[textbook]] ''The Theory of Relativity'' by [[Ludwik Silberstein]] in 1914 was made available as an English understanding of [[Minkowski space]], the algebra of [[biquaternion]]s was applied, but without references to the British background or Macfarlane or other quaternionists of the Society. The language of quaternions had become international, providing content to [[set theory]] and expanded [[mathematical notation]], and expressing [[mathematical physics]].

'''Reaction–diffusion systems''' are mathematical models which correspond to several physical phenomena: the most common is the change in space and time of the concentration of one or more chemical substances: local [[chemical reaction]]s in which the substances are transformed into each other, and [[diffusion]] which causes the substances to spread out over a surface in space.

Reaction–diffusion systems are naturally applied in [[chemistry]]. However, the system can also describe dynamical processes of non-chemical nature. Examples are found in [[biology]], [[geology]] and [[physics]] (neutron diffusion theory) and [[ecology]]. Mathematically, reaction–diffusion systems take the form of semi-linear [[parabolic partial differential equation]]s. They can be represented in the general form

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t \boldsymbol{q} = \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{D}}} \,\nabla^2 \boldsymbol{q} + \boldsymbol{R}(\boldsymbol{q}), &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''''q'''''('''''x''''', ''t'')}} represents the unknown vector function, {{math|{{uuline|'''''D'''''}}}} is a [[diagonal matrix]] of [[diffusion coefficient]]s, and {{math|'''''R'''''}} accounts for all local reactions. The solutions of reaction–diffusion equations display a wide range of behaviours, including the formation of [[travelling wave]]s and wave-like phenomena as well as other [[Self-organization|self-organized]] [[pattern formation|patterns]] like stripes, hexagons or more intricate structure like [[dissipative soliton]]s. Such patterns have been dubbed "[[Turing pattern]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Wooley, T. E., Baker, R. E. [[Philip Maini|Maini, P. K.]], Chapter 34, ''Turing's theory of morphogenesis''. In {{cite book |author-link1 = Jack Copeland|last1 = Copeland | first1=B. Jack | authorlink2=Jonathan Bowen | last2=Bowen | first2=Jonathan P. | authorlink3=Robin Wilson (mathematician)| last3=Wilson | first3=Robin | | last4=Sprevak | first4=Mark | title=[[The Turing Guide]] | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2017 | isbn=978-0198747826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each function, for which a reaction diffusion differential equation holds, represents in fact a ''concentration variable''.

==One-component reaction–diffusion equations==
The simplest reaction–diffusion equation is in one spatial dimension in plane geometry,

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t u = D \partial^2_x u + R(u),&lt;/math&gt;

is also referred to as the [[Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov equation]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Kolmogorov et al., Moscow Univ. Bull. Math. A 1 (1937): 1{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the reaction term vanishes, then the equation represents a pure diffusion process. The corresponding equation is [[Fick's law|Fick's second law]]. The choice {{math|''R''(''u'') {{=}} ''u''(1 − ''u'')}} yields [[Fisher's equation]] that was originally used to describe the spreading of biological [[population]]s,&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Fisher, Ann. Eug. 7 (1937): 355&lt;/ref&gt; the Newell–Whitehead-Segel equation with {{math|''R''(''u'') {{=}} ''u''(1 − ''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} to describe [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]],&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Newell and J. A. Whitehead, J. Fluid Mech. 38 (1969): 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Segel, J. Fluid Mech. 38 (1969): 203&lt;/ref&gt; the more general [[Zeldovich]] equation with {{math|''R''(''u'') {{=}} ''u''(1 − ''u'')(''u'' − ''α'')}} and {{math|0 &lt; ''α'' &lt; 1}} that arises in [[combustion]] theory,&lt;ref&gt;Y. B. Zeldovich and D. A. Frank-Kamenetsky, Acta Physicochim. 9 (1938): 341&lt;/ref&gt; and its particular degenerate case with {{math|''R''(''u'') {{=}} ''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} that is sometimes referred to as the Zeldovich equation as well.&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Gilding and R. Kersner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tdIACAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Travelling Waves in Nonlinear Diffusion Convection Reaction], Birkhäuser (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of one-component systems is subject to certain restrictions as the evolution equation can also be written in the variational form

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t u=-\frac{\delta\mathfrak L}{\delta u}&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore describes a permanent decrease of the "free energy" &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak L&lt;/math&gt; given by the functional

:&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak L=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[\tfrac{D}{2} \left (\partial_xu \right )^2-V(u)\right]\text{d}x&lt;/math&gt;

with a potential {{math|''V''(''u'')}} such that {{math|''R''(''u'') {{=}} {{sfrac|d''V''(''u'')|d''u''}}.}}

[[Image:Travelling wave for Fisher equation.svg|thumb|right|A travelling wave front solution for Fisher's equation.]]  
In systems with more than one stationary homogeneous solution, a typical solution is given by travelling fronts connecting the homogeneous states. These solutions move with constant speed without changing their shape and are of the form {{math|''u''(''x'', ''t'') {{=}} ''û''(''ξ'')}} with {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} ''x'' − ''ct''}}, where {{mvar|c}} is the speed of the travelling wave. Note that while travelling waves are generically stable structures, all non-monotonous stationary solutions (e.g. localized domains composed of a front-antifront pair) are unstable. For {{math|''c'' {{=}} 0}}, there is a simple proof for this statement:&lt;ref name="fife"&gt;P. C. Fife, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FJXsCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mathematical Aspects of Reacting and Diffusing Systems], Springer (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; if {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is a stationary solution and {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') + ''ũ''(''x'', ''t'')}} is an infinitesimally perturbed solution, linear stability analysis yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_t \tilde{u}=D\partial_x^2 \tilde{u}-U(x)\tilde{u},\qquad U(x) = -R^{\prime}(u)|_{u=u_0(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;

With the ansatz {{math|''ũ'' {{=}} ''ψ''(''x'')exp(−''λt'')}} we arrive at the eigenvalue problem

:&lt;math&gt; \hat H\psi=\lambda\psi, \qquad \hat H=-D\partial_x^2+U(x),&lt;/math&gt;

of [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger type]] where negative eigenvalues result in the instability of the solution. Due to translational invariance {{math|''ψ'' {{=}} ∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is a neutral [[eigenfunction]] with the [[eigenvalue]] {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}}, and all other eigenfunctions can be sorted according to an increasing number of knots with the magnitude of the corresponding real eigenvalue increases  monotonically with the number of zeros. The eigenfunction {{math|''ψ'' {{=}} ∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} should have at least one zero, and for a non-monotonic stationary solution the corresponding eigenvalue {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}} cannot be the lowest one, thereby implying instability.

To determine the velocity {{mvar|c}} of a moving front, one may go to a moving coordinate system and look at stationary solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;D \partial^2_{\xi}\hat{u}(\xi)+ c\partial_{\xi} \hat{u}(\xi)+R(\hat{u}(\xi))=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation has a nice mechanical analogue as the motion of a mass {{mvar|D}} with position {{math|''û''}} in the course of the "time" {{mvar|ξ}} under the force {{mvar|R}} with the damping coefficient c which allows for a rather illustrative access to the construction of different types of solutions and the determination of {{mvar|c}}.

When going from one to more space dimensions, a number of statements from one-dimensional systems can still be applied. Planar or curved wave fronts are typical structures, and a new effect arises as the local velocity of a curved front becomes dependent on the local [[curvature|radius of curvature]] (this can be seen by going to [[polar coordinates]]). This phenomenon leads to the so-called curvature-driven instability.&lt;ref name="mikhailov"&gt;A. S. Mikhailov, Foundations of Synergetics I. Distributed Active Systems, Springer (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-component reaction–diffusion equations==
Two-component systems allow for a much larger range of possible phenomena than their one-component counterparts. An important idea that was first proposed by [[Alan Turing]] is that a state that is stable in the local system can become unstable in the presence of [[diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Turing, Phil. Transact. Royal Soc. B 237 (1952): 37&lt;/ref&gt;

A linear stability analysis however shows that when linearizing the general two-component system

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} \partial_t u \\ \partial_t v \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} D_u &amp;0 \\0&amp;D_v \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \partial_{xx} u\\ \partial_{xx} v \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} F(u,v)\\G(u,v)\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

a [[plane wave]] perturbation

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\boldsymbol{q}}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(\boldsymbol{x},t) = \begin{pmatrix} \tilde{u}(t)\\\tilde{v}(t) \end{pmatrix} e^{i \boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{x}} &lt;/math&gt;

of the stationary homogeneous solution will satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \partial_t \tilde{u}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t)\\ \partial_t \tilde{v}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \end{pmatrix} = -k^2\begin{pmatrix} D_u \tilde{u}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t)\\ D_v\tilde{v}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \end{pmatrix} + \boldsymbol{R}^{\prime} \begin{pmatrix}\tilde{u}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \\ \tilde{v}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Turing's idea can only be realized in four [[equivalence class]]es of systems characterized by the signs of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] {{math|'''''R'''''′}} of the reaction function. In particular, if a finite wave vector {{math|'''''k'''''}} is supposed to be the most unstable one, the Jacobian must have the signs

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} +&amp;-\\+&amp;-\end{pmatrix}, \quad \begin{pmatrix} +&amp;+\\-&amp;-\end{pmatrix}, \quad \begin{pmatrix} -&amp;+\\-&amp;+\end{pmatrix}, \quad
\begin{pmatrix} -&amp;-\\+&amp;+\end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

This class of systems is named ''activator-inhibitor system'' after its first representative: close to the ground state, one component stimulates the production of both components while the other one inhibits their growth. Its most prominent representative is the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\partial_t u &amp;= d_u^2 \,\nabla^2 u + f(u) - \sigma v, \\
\tau \partial_t v &amp;= d_v^2 \,\nabla^2 v + u - v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''u'') {{=}} ''λu'' − ''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − ''κ''}} which describes how an [[action potential]] travels through a nerve.&lt;ref name="fitzhugh"&gt;R. FitzHugh, Biophys. J. 1 (1961): 445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Nagumo et al., Proc. Inst. Radio Engin. Electr. 50 (1962): 2061&lt;/ref&gt; Here, {{math|''d&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''d&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''τ'', ''σ''}} and {{math|''λ''}} are positive constants.

When an activator-inhibitor system undergoes a change of parameters, one may pass from conditions under which a homogeneous ground state is stable to conditions under which it is linearly unstable. The corresponding [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] may be either a [[Hopf bifurcation]] to a globally oscillating homogeneous state with a dominant wave number {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}} or a ''Turing bifurcation'' to a globally patterned state with a dominant finite wave number. The latter in two spatial dimensions typically leads to stripe or hexagonal patterns.

&lt;gallery caption="Subcritical Turing bifurcation: formation of a hexagonal pattern from noisy initial conditions in the above two-component reaction-diffusion system of Fitzhugh-Nagumo type." widths="257" heights="235" perrow="3"&gt;
Image:Turing_bifurcation_1.gif| Noisy initial conditions at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Image:Turing_bifurcation_3.gif| Almost converged state at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;100.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

For the Fitzhugh-Nagumo example, the neutral stability curves marking the boundary of the linearly stable region for the Turing and Hopf bifurcation are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
q_{\text{n}}^H(k): &amp;{}\quad \frac{1}{\tau} + \left  (d_u^2 + \frac{1}{\tau} d_v^2 \right )k^2 &amp; =f^{\prime}(u_{h}),\\[6pt]
q_{\text{n}}^T(k): &amp;{}\quad \frac{\kappa}{1 + d_v^2 k^2}+ d_u^2 k^2 &amp; = f^{\prime}(u_{h}).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If the bifurcation is subcritical, often localized structures ([[dissipative solitons]]) can be observed in the [[Hysteresis|hysteretic]] region where the pattern coexists with the ground state. Other frequently encountered structures comprise pulse trains (also known as [[periodic travelling wave]]s), spiral waves and target patterns. These three solution types are also generic features of two- (or more-) component reaction-diffusion equations in which the local dynamics have a stable limit cycle&lt;ref&gt;N. Kopell and L.N. Howard, Stud. Appl. Math. 52 (1973): 291&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Three- and more-component reaction–diffusion equations==
For a variety of systems, reaction-diffusion equations with more than two components have been proposed, e.g. as models for the [[Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction]],&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Vanag and I. R. Epstein, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 (2004): 128301&lt;/ref&gt; for [[blood clotting]]&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Lobanova
and F. I. Ataullakhanov, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 (2004): 098303&lt;/ref&gt; or planar [[gas discharge]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;H.-G. Purwins et al. in: Dissipative Solitons, Lectures Notes in Physics, Ed. N. Akhmediev and A. Ankiewicz, Springer (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that systems with more components allow for a variety of phenomena not possible in systems with one or two components (e.g. stable running pulses in more than one spatial dimension without global feedback),.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Schenk et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 (1997): 3781&lt;/ref&gt; An introduction and systematic overview of the possible phenomena in dependence on the properties of the underlying system is given in.&lt;ref&gt;A. W. Liehr: ''Dissipative Solitons in Reaction Diffusion Systems. Mechanism, Dynamics, Interaction.'' Volume 70 of Springer Series in Synergetics, Springer, Berlin Heidelberg 2013, {{isbn|978-3-642-31250-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications and universality==
In recent times, reaction–diffusion systems have attracted much interest as a prototype model for [[pattern formation]]. The above-mentioned patterns (fronts, spirals, targets, hexagons, stripes and dissipative solitons) can be found in various types of reaction-diffusion systems in spite of large discrepancies e.g. in the local reaction terms. It has also been argued that reaction-diffusion processes are an essential basis for processes connected to [[morphogenesis]] in biology&lt;ref&gt;L.G. Harrison, Kinetic Theory of Living Pattern, Cambridge University Press (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; and may even be related to animal coats and skin pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;H. Meinhardt, Models of Biological Pattern Formation, Academic Press (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James D.|title=Mathematical Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-08539-4|pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other applications of reaction-diffusion equations include ecological invasions,&lt;ref&gt;E.E. Holmes et al, Ecology 75 (1994): 17&lt;/ref&gt; spread of epidemics,&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Murray et al, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 229 (1986: 111&lt;/ref&gt; tumour growth&lt;ref&gt;M.A.J. Chaplain J. Bio. Systems 3 (1995): 929&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Sherratt and M.A. Nowak, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 248 (1992): 261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Gatenby and E.T. Gawlinski, Cancer Res. 56 (1996): 5745&lt;/ref&gt; and wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Sherratt and J.D. Murray, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 241 (1990): 29&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the interest in reaction-diffusion systems is that although they are nonlinear partial differential equations, there are often possibilities for an analytical treatment.&lt;ref name="fife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mikhailov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Grindrod, Patterns and Waves: The Theory and Applications of Reaction-Diffusion Equations, Clarendon Press (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Smoller, Shock Waves and Reaction Diffusion Equations, Springer (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. S. Kerner and V. V. Osipov, Autosolitons. A New Approach to Problems of Self-Organization and Turbulence, Kluwer Academic Publishers (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiments ==
Well-controllable experiments in chemical reaction-diffusion systems have up to now been realized in three ways. First, gel reactors&lt;ref&gt;K.-J. Lee et al., Nature 369 (1994): 215&lt;/ref&gt; or filled capillary tubes&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Hamik and O. Steinbock, New J. Phys. 5 (2003): 58&lt;/ref&gt; may be used. Second, [[temperature]] pulses on [[Catalytic converter|catalytic surfaces]] have been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Rotermund et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 66 (1991): 3083&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Graham et al., J. Phys. Chem. 97 (1993): 7564&lt;/ref&gt; Third, the propagation of running nerve pulses is modelled using reaction-diffusion systems.&lt;ref name="fitzhugh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Hodgkin and A. F. Huxley, J. Physiol. 117 (1952): 500&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from these generic examples, it has turned out that under appropriate circumstances electric transport systems like plasmas&lt;ref&gt;M. Bode and H.-G. Purwins, Physica D 86 (1995): 53&lt;/ref&gt; or semiconductors&lt;ref&gt;E. Schöll, Nonlinear Spatio-Temporal Dynamics and Chaos in Semiconductors, Cambridge University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; can be described in a reaction-diffusion approach. For these systems various experiments on pattern formation have been carried out.

==Numerical treatments==
A reaction-diffusion system can be solved by using methods of [[numerical mathematics]]. There are existing several numerical treatments in research literature.&lt;ref&gt;S.Tang et al., J.Austral.Math.Soc. Ser.B 35(1993): 223-243&lt;/ref&gt; Also for complex [[geometry|geometries]] numerical solution methods are proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Isaacson | first1 = Samuel A. | last2 = Peskin | first2 = Charles S.| title = Incorporating Diffusion in Complex Geometries into Stochastic Chemical Kinetics Simulations | journal = SIAM J.

In his work ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', one of the topics treated by [[Aristotle]] is about how the study carried out by mathematicians differs from that carried out by physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lear|first1=Jonathan|title=Aristotle: the desire to understand|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Before giving a [[mathematical proof]] for the formula for the [[volume]] of a [[sphere]], [[Archimedes]] used physical reasoning to discover the solution (imagining the balancing of bodies on a scale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Mazer|title=The Ellipse: A Historical and Mathematical Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twWkDe1Y9YQC&amp;pg=SA5-PA28|date=26 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-21143-4|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the seventeenth century, many of the most important advances in mathematics appeared motivated by the study of physics, and this continued in the following centuries (although, it has already been appointed that from the nineteenth century, mathematics started to become increasingly independent from physics).&lt;ref name="post"&gt;E. J. Post, [http://www22.pair.com/csdc/pdf/philos.pdf A History of Physics as an Exercise in Philosophy, p. 76.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arkady Plotnitsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dmdUp97S4AYC&amp;pg=PA177 Niels Bohr and Complementarity: An Introduction, p. 177].&lt;/ref&gt; The creation and development of [[calculus]] were strongly linked to the needs of physics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger G.

The current situation is that the mathematical knowledge used in physics is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as in the case of [[superstring theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.particlecentral.com/strings_page.html |title=String theories |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Particle Central |publisher=Four Peaks Technologies |access-date=13 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical problems ==
Some of the problems considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] are the following:

*Explain the effectiveness of mathematics in the study of the physical world: "At this point an enigma presents itself which in all ages has agitated inquiring minds. How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" —[[Albert Einstein]], in ''Geometry and Experience'' (1921).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]], [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Einstein_geometry.html Geometry and Experience].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clearly delineate mathematics and physics: For some results or discoveries, it is difficult to say to which area they belong: to the mathematics or to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bergé, [https://books.google.com/books?id=umFTtQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Des+rythmes+au+chaos%22&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=65aEU7LAKeHL8AHc74HwBg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Des rythmes au chaos].&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is the geometry of physical space?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Carl Hatfield|title=The Natural and the Normative: Theories of Spatial Perception from Kant to Helmholtz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JikeeDbYeUQC&amp;pg=PA223|year=1990|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-08086-6|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is the origin of the axioms of mathematics?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gila Hanna|author2=Hans Niels Jahnke|author3=Helmut Pulte|title=Explanation and Proof in Mathematics: Philosophical and Educational Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bLHye8kSAwC&amp;pg=PA29|date=4 December 2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-0576-5|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*How does the already existing mathematics influence in the creation and development of [[Theoretical physics#Overview|physical theories]]?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fqxi.org/community/essay/rules |title=FQXi Community Trick or Truth: the Mysterious Connection Between Physics and Mathematics |access-date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is arithmetic ''a priori'' or synthetic? (from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], see [[Analytic–synthetic distinction]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Van Cleve Professor of Philosophy Brown University|title=Problems from Kant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6WHAgt-Mg1AC&amp;pg=PA22|date=16 July 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-534701-2|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is essentially different between doing a physical experiment to see the result and making a mathematical calculation to see the result? (from the [[Alan Turing|Turing]]–[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] debate)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ludwig Wittgenstein|author2=R. G. Bosanquet|author3=Cora Diamond|title=Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics, Cambridge, 1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4YUZVq1JSEC&amp;pg=PA96|date=15 October 1989|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-90426-9|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Do [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] imply that physical theories will always be incomplete? (from [[Stephen Hawking]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pavel|last=Pudlák|title=Logical Foundations of Mathematics and Computational Complexity: A Gentle Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obxDAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA659|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-319-00119-7|page=659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawking.org.uk/godel-and-the-end-of-physics.html Stephen Hawking. "Godel and the End of the Universe"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is math invented or discovered? (millennium-old question, raised among others by [[Mario Livio]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Mario Livio | authorlink = Mario Livio| doi =  | title = Why math works? | journal = Scientific American | volume =  | pages = 80–83 | year = August 2011 | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-math-works/| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
In recent times the two disciplines have most often been taught separately, despite all the interrelations between physics and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Karam; Pospiech; &amp; Pietrocola (2010). "[http://www.univ-reims.fr/site/evenement/girep-icpe-mptl-2010-reims-international-conference/gallery_files/site/1/90/4401/22908/29476/30505.pdf Mathematics in physics lessons: developing structural skills]"&lt;/ref&gt; This led some professional mathematicians who were also interested in [[mathematics education]], such as [[Felix Klein]], [[Richard Courant]], [[Vladimir Arnold]] and [[Morris Kline]], to strongly advocate teaching mathematics in a way more closely related to the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Stakhov "[http://www2.fisica.unlp.edu.ar/materias/algebralineal/documentos/mathharm.pdf Dirac’s Principle of Mathematical Beauty, Mathematics of Harmony]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Lesh|author2=Peter L.

The '''School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG)''' was an American academic [[think tank]] focused on the subject of reform in [[mathematics education]].  Directed by [[Edward G. Begle]] and financed by the [[National Science Foundation]], the group was created in the wake of the [[Sputnik crisis]] in 1958 and tasked with creating and implementing [[mathematics]] [[curriculum|curricula]] for [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], which it did until its termination in 1977.  The efforts of the SMSG yielded a reform in mathematics education known as [[New Math]] which was promulgated in a series of reports, culminating in a series published by [[Random House]] called the ''New Mathematical Library''.  In the early years, SMSG also produced a set of draft textbooks in typewritten paperback format for elementary, middle and high school students. 

Perhaps the most authoritative collection of materials from the School Mathematics Study Group is now housed in the [[Archives of American Mathematics]] in the [[University of Texas at Austin]]'s Center for American History.

In [[mathematics]], '''LHS''' is informal shorthand for the '''left-hand side''' of an [[equation]].  Similarly, '''RHS''' is the '''right-hand side'''. The two sides have the same value, expressed differently, since [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] is [[equivalence relation|symmetric]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_BhgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=rhs+equation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5e0lDtBkTr&amp;sig=F_b0X-tls1pEUlFiS-LTUyUuhgA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCDgKahUKEwi8nqXt7YDHAhXHxRQKHYJJBcY#v=onepage&amp;q=rhs%20equation&amp;f=false Engineering Mathematics, John Bird, p65]: definition and example of abbreviation&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, these terms may apply to an [[inequation]] or [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]; the right-hand side is everything on the right side of a [[test operator]] in an [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]], with LHS defined similarly.

==Some examples==
The expression on the right side of the "=" sign is the right side of the equation and the expression on the left of the "=" is the left side of the equation.

For example, in
:''x'' + 5 = ''y ''+ 8,
"''x'' + 5" is the '''left-hand side''' (LHS) and "''y ''+ 8" is the '''right-hand side''' (RHS).

==Homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations==
In solving mathematical equations, particularly [[linear simultaneous equations]], [[differential equation]]s and [[integral equation]]s, the terminology ''homogeneous'' is often used for equations with some [[linear operator]] ''L'' on the LHS and 0 on the RHS. In contrast, an equation with a non-zero RHS is called ''inhomogeneous'' or ''non-homogeneous'', as exemplified by

:''Lf'' = ''g'',

with ''g'' a fixed function, which equation is to be solved for ''f''. Then any solution of the inhomogeneous equation may have a solution of the homogeneous equation added to it, and still remain a solution.

For example in [[mathematical physics]], the homogeneous equation may correspond to a physical theory formulated in [[Free space|empty space]], while the inhomogeneous equation asks for more 'realistic' solutions with some matter, or charged particles.

==Syntax==
More abstractly, when using [[infix notation]]

:''T'' * ''U''

the term ''T'' stands as the '''left-hand side''' and ''U'' as the '''right-hand side''' of the [[Operation (mathematics)|operator]] *. This usage is less common, though.

'''Stratification''' has several usages in mathematics.

==In mathematical logic==
In [[mathematical logic]], '''stratification''' is any consistent assignment of numbers to [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] symbols guaranteeing that a unique formal [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of a logical theory exists. Specifically, we say that a set of [[Clause (logic)|clauses]] of the form &lt;math&gt;Q_1 \wedge \dots \wedge Q_n \wedge \neg Q_{n+1} \wedge \dots \wedge \neg Q_{n+m} \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt; is stratified if and only if
there is a stratification assignment S that fulfills the following conditions:

# If a predicate P is positively derived from a predicate Q (i.e., P is the head of a rule, and Q occurs positively in the body of the same rule), then the stratification number of P must be greater than or equal to the stratification number of Q, in short &lt;math&gt;S(P) \geq S(Q)&lt;/math&gt;.
# If a predicate P is derived from a negated predicate Q (i.e., P is the head of a rule, and Q occurs negatively in the body of the same rule), then the stratification number of P must be greater than the stratification number of Q, in short &lt;math&gt;S(P) &gt; S(Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

The notion of stratified negation leads to a very effective operational semantics for stratified programs in terms of the stratified least fixpoint, that is obtained by iteratively applying the fixpoint operator to each ''stratum'' of the program, from the lowest one up.
Stratification is not only useful for guaranteeing unique interpretation of [[Horn clause]]
theories. It has also been used by [[W.V. Quine]] (1937) to address [[Russell's paradox]], which undermined [[Frege]]'s central work ''[[Grundgesetze der Arithmetik]]'' (1902).

==In set theory==
In [[New Foundations]] (NF) and related set theories, a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in the language of first-order logic with equality and membership is said to be
'''stratified''' if and only if there is a function
&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; which sends each variable appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (considered as an item of syntax) to
a natural number (this works equally well if all integers are used) in such a way that
any atomic formula &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt; appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)+1 = \sigma(y)&lt;/math&gt; and any [[atomic formula]] &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x) = \sigma(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

It turns out that it is sufficient to require that these conditions be satisfied only when
both variables in an atomic formula are bound in the set abstract &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi\}&lt;/math&gt;
under consideration.  A set abstract satisfying this weaker condition is said to be
'''weakly stratified'''.

The stratification of [[New Foundations]] generalizes readily to languages with more
predicates and with term constructions.  Each primitive predicate needs to have specified
required displacements between values of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; at its (bound) arguments
in a (weakly) stratified formula.  In a language with term constructions, terms themselves
need to be assigned values under &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, with fixed displacements from the
values of each of their (bound) arguments in a (weakly) stratified formula.  Defined term
constructions are neatly handled by (possibly merely implicitly) using the theory
of descriptions:  a term &lt;math&gt;(\iota x.\phi)&lt;/math&gt; (the x such that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) must
be assigned the same value under &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as the variable x.

A formula is stratified if and only if it is possible to assign types to all variables appearing
in the formula in such a way that it will make sense in a version TST of the theory of
types described in the [[New Foundations]] article, and this is probably the best way
to understand the stratification of [[New Foundations]] in practice.

The notion of stratification can be extended to the [[lambda calculus]]; this is found
in papers of Randall Holmes.

==In topology==
In [[singularity theory]], there is a different meaning, of a decomposition of a [[topological space]] ''X'' into disjoint subsets each of which is a [[topological manifold]] (so that in particular a  ''stratification'' defines a  [[partition of a set|partition]] of the topological space). This is not a useful notion when unrestricted; but when the various '''strata''' are defined by some recognisable set of conditions (for example being [[locally closed]]), and fit together manageably, this idea is often applied in geometry. [[Hassler Whitney]] and [[René Thom]] first defined formal conditions for stratification.  See [[Whitney stratification]] and [[topologically stratified space]].

==In statistics==
See [[stratified sampling]].

This article gives a table of some common [[Lie group]]s and their associated [[Lie algebra]]s.

The following are noted: the [[Topology|topological]] properties of the group ([[dimension]]; [[Connected space|connectedness]]; [[Compact space|compactness]]; the nature of the [[fundamental group]]; and whether or not they are [[simply connected]]) as well as on their algebraic properties ([[Abelian group|abelian]]; [[Simple group|simple]]; [[Semisimple group|semisimple]]).

For more examples of Lie groups and other related topics see the [[list of simple Lie groups]]; the [[Bianchi classification]] of groups of up to three dimensions; and the [[list of Lie group topics]].

Column legend
* '''Cpt''': Is this group ''G'' [[Compact space|compact]]? (Yes or No)
* '''&lt;math&gt;\pi_0&lt;/math&gt;''': Gives the [[group of components]] of ''G''. The order of the component group gives the number of [[connected space|connected components]]. The group is [[connected space|connected]] if and only if the component group is [[trivial group|trivial]] (denoted by 0).
* '''&lt;math&gt;\pi_1&lt;/math&gt;''': Gives the [[fundamental group]] of ''G'' whenever ''G'' is connected. The group is [[simply connected]] if and only if the fundamental group is [[trivial group|trivial]] (denoted by 0).
* '''UC''': If ''G'' is not simply connected, gives the [[universal cover]] of ''G''.

'''''The Paradoxes of the Infinite''''' (German title: ''Paradoxien des Unendlichen'') is a mathematical work by [[Bernard Bolzano]] on the theory of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. It was published by a friend and student, [[František Přihonský]], in 1851, three years after Bolzano's death. The work contained many interesting results in [[set theory]]. Bolzano expanded on the theme of [[Galileo's paradox]], giving more examples of correspondences between the elements of an infinite set and [[proper subset]]s of infinite sets. In the work he also explained the term ''Menge'', rendered in English as "set", which he had coined and used in several works since the 1830s.
