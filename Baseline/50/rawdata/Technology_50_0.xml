'''CHFS''' is a [[file system]] developed at the Department of Software Engineering, [[University of Szeged]], [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="Intromail"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2011/11/10/msg011855.html | title=Intromail | accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first open source [[Flash memory]]-specific file system written for the [[NetBSD]] [[operating system]].

==Structure==
Similar to [[UBIFS]], the CHFS file system utilizes a separate layer for handling Flash aging and bad blocks, called EBH (erase block handler). The file system itself is modelled after [[JFFS2]], thus the internal structure is very similar.

==ChewieFS==
CHFS was originally called ChewieFS during development. The name was changed to avoid legal issues and to have a more neutral name.

'''Collaborative journalism''' is a mode of [[journalism]] where multiple [[reporters]] or news organizations, without affiliation to a common parent organization, report on and contribute [[news]] items to a news story together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novin|first=Alamir|date=17 August 2013|title=DEBATECITED: An empirical experiment into the value of open-source research methods and peer collaboration to science journalism|url=http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/977526/4/DEBATECITED_A1b.pdf|journal=Spectrum. Masters thesis, Concordia University.|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is practiced by both professional and amateur reporters. It is not to be mixed up with [[citizen journalism]].

==Further definition==

Collaborative journalism involves the aggregation of information from numerous individuals or organizations into a single news story.  Information is gathered through research or reporting, or added when readers examine, comment and build upon existing stories.  Stories from the [[mainstream]] media are often built upon.  Depending on the system of collaboration, individuals may also provide [[feedback]] or [[vote]] on whether an article is newsworthy.  A single collaborative news story, therefore, may encompass multiple authors, varying articles, and ranged perspectives.&lt;ref name=CCJ&gt;Whatis.com "[http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid26_gci1090596,00.html What is collaborative citizen journalism?]" 2006, ''TechTarget''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional]] and [[amateur]] reporters may work together to develop collaborative news articles, or mainstream media sites may gather amateur blog posts to complement reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Instablogs "[http://www.instablogs.com/tour/ Instablogs Tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307204057/http://www.instablogs.com/tour/ |date=2009-03-07 }}" 2007, ''Instablogs''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative journalists either contribute directly to stories, sometimes through a wiki-style collaboration platform, or build upon the story externally, often through personal blogs.  Collaborative journalists develop or examine a story one piece at a time.  This contrasts the [[time limit|deadline]] and completion-centered nature of [[traditional media]].  A story is built upon continually, and a popular story may receive daily updates.&lt;ref name=CCJ/&gt;  Through combined authorship, collaborative journalism is thought by some to offer an increased independence of thought and experience unavailable to traditional media.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Stelter, Brian. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13reach.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Mainstream%20News%20Outlets%20Start%20Linking%20to%20Other%20Sites&amp;st=cse Mainstream News Outlets Start Linking to Other Sites]" 12 October 2008, ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful collaborative journalism projects require a participatory community with respect for content.  Ross Mayfield, CEO of SocialText, has commented on wiki-style collaborative journalism:&lt;ref name="Glaser"&gt;Glaser, Mark.  "[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/glaser/1094678265.php Collaborative Conundrum: Do Wikis Have a Place in the Newsroom?]" 2004, ''USC Annenberg: Online Journalism Review''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Most user-generated content isn't content, but conversation.  Cultivating community is a decided practice. It boils down to the social contract you make with your readers-turned-writers. If they trust that their effort and words will be appropriated appropriately, while providing social incentives for participation, it can very well work."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

Collaborative journalism emerged through the [[internet]] in the early 2000s, and developed gradually through various online outlets.  As examples, [[Wikinews]] was founded in 2003, and [[NewsVine]] in 2005.

===Panama Papers===
The [[Panama Papers]] project may be the largest example of a journalistic consortium to date. It began sometime in 2015 (date?) when [[Bastian Obermayer]], an investigative reporter with the south German newspaper [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], was contacted by an anonymous source&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/business/media/how-a-cryptic-message-interested-in-data-led-to-the-panama-papers.html|title=How a Cryptic Message, ‘Interested in Data?,’ Led to the Panama Papers|last=Clark|first=Nicola|date=2016-04-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered the trove of 11.5 million electronic documents from [[Mossack Fonseca]], the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm detailing a web of secret offshore deals and loans worth billions of dollars, and details of tax avoidance designs in numerous countries. The newspaper's editors decided they could not handle the massive volume of information alone and initiated a collaborative journalistic consortium including more than 140 journalists and the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]], a project of the [[nonprofit]] [[Center for Public Integrity]].

==Football Leaks (2016/2017)==
{{main|Football Leaks}}
The [[European Investigative Collaborations]] (EIC) working with "over 60 journalists in 14 countries" published a "series of articles called ''Football Leaks''—the "largest leak in sports history".&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theblacksea.eu/?idT=3&amp;idC=3 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |location=Bucharest, Romania |year=2017 |publisher=The Black Sea |title=Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Football Leaks'' "led to the prosecution of football superstar [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and coach [[Jose Mourinho]]."&lt;ref name="horizont_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.horizont.net/medien/nachrichten/Investigativjournalismus-Spiegel-schafft-ressortuebegreifendes-Recherchenetzwerk-160100 |title=Spiegel schafft multimediales Recherchenetzwerk |first=von Hein |last=David Hein |location=Freitag |date=August 4, 2017 |access-date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; EIC was established in the fall of 2015 with founding members that include ''Der Spiegel'', ''El Mundo'', ''Médiapart'', the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism (CRJI), and ''Le Soir''.&lt;ref name="EU_gov_Rengers_EIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/127803/5%20-%2001%20On%20Football%20Leaks%20-%20speaking%20notes%20Merijn%20Rengers.pdf |format=PDF |title=On Football Leaks Speaking notes |first=Merijn |last=Rengers |agency=European Parliament |series=Speaking notes}}NRC Handelsblad, Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="journalismfund_2016_EIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalismfund.eu/news/%E2%80%9Csome-stories-can-get-killed-without-right-network%E2%80%9D |title=Some stories can get killed without the right network |date=March 30, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |publisher=Journalism Fund formerly Fonds Pascal Decroos voor Bijzondere Journalistiek vzw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2016_EU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1230&amp;recType=multimedia |title=EU’s freedom of goods policy opened door to Paris terror attacks |date=March 18, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |publisher=The Black Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differentiation from other styles of journalism==

*Collaborative journalism should not be confused with [[citizen journalism]], which is practiced only by amateur reporters who develop stories by actively reporting, collecting, analyzing and disseminating news and information, often through [[blog]]s on the internet.
*It is not [[community journalism]] or [[Civic Journalism|civic journalism]], which are practiced only by professionals:
**In [[community journalism]], professional reporters focus their coverage on smaller communities, such as neighborhoods, suburbs, or small towns (rather than national or international coverage.)
**[[Civic Journalism|Civic journalism]] is the philosophy and practice of professional journalists and newspapers acting as participants within a community, rather than detached spectators.
*Collaborative journalism is similar, but not identical, to [[interactive journalism]], in which consumers contribute to a professional news story through commenting and conversing with the reporter.
*[[Wiki journalism]]  is a type of collaborative journalism.

==Link journalism==

"[[Link journalism]]", a phrase coined by Scott Karp in 2008, is "a form of collaborative journalism in which a news story's writer provides external [[hyperlink|links]] within the story to reporting or other sources on the web."&lt;ref name="Karp"&gt;Karp, Brian. "[http://publishing2.com/2008/02/25/how-link-journalism-could-have-transformed-the-new-york-times-reporting-on-mccain-ethics/ How Link Journalism Could Have Transformed the New York Times Reporting on McCain Ethics]" 2008, ''Publish 2.0 Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Link Journalism"&gt;Publish2 "[http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism What is link journalism?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312060206/http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism |date=2009-03-12 }}" 2009, ''Publish2''.&lt;/ref&gt;    These links are meant to complement, enhance, or add context to the original reporting.  [[Jeff Jarvis]], from the Graduate School of Journalism's new media program at the [[City University of New York]], has said that link journalism creates a "new architecture of news."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Implementation==

Collaborative journalism has been implemented in several different ways.  [[Wikinews]], the "free-content online news source," lets any user edit or create a news story, similar in style to [[Wikipedia]].  Several mainstream news sites have adopted a collaborative journalism approach toward news, through use of news aggregation.  [[The Washington Post]] has developed a political site which links to related content from other news sites.  [[NBC]] links to local newspapers, radio broadcasts, online videos, and blogs on its local television stations' sites.  The sites do not separate articles written by NBC staff and links to outside sources.
[[The New York Times]] has introduced a ''Times Extra'' website feature which acts posts links to outside news sites.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;   Commenting on the launch of ''Times Extra'', [[Marc Frons]], CTO for Digital Operations at the New York Times, said:&lt;ref name="Frons"&gt;Frons, Marc. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/28/business/media/28askthetimes.html?adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1217599487-JcYF6S4d34UK1ZlCsX04OA Talk to the Times: Chief Technology Officer, Digital Operations]" 2008, ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“In the past, I think many news organizations were afraid to link to other Web sites out of fear that they might be sending people to an unreliable source or that their readers would never return. But those fears were largely misplaced and we’ve seen a much more open policy when it comes to pointing readers at useful content elsewhere on the Web."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other sites exhibit collaborative journalism through aggregation.  On the site [[NewsVine]], for example, wire stories from the Associated Press complement user-generated stories and blog posts.  [[Reddit]] and other news aggregation sites may also act as collaborative journalism sites, depending on where content originates.

== Awards for collaborative journalism ==
Due to the increase in collaborative journalism, several organizations have begun to offer grants or awards for these types of projects. For example, Online Journalism Awards (launched in May 2000) added a new award category for collaborations and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://awards.journalists.org/2018/05/02/2018-online-journalism-awards-introduce-new-collaboration-category-among-changes/|title="2018 OJAs introduce new Collaboration category, among other changes"|last=|first=|date=|website=Online Journalism Awards|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clean Energy Wire offers grants for collaborative journalism projects on the topic of energy or the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleanenergywire.org/grant-collaborative-journalism-for-global-energy-transition|title="Go collaborate! Grant for energy &amp; climate journalism."|last=|first=|date=|website=Clean Energy Wire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual Hostwriter Prize awards money to support pitches and published collaborative projects by journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hostwriter.org/sites/prize/|title="Hostwriter Prize: Together for better journalism"|last=|first=|date=|website=Hostwriter|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Collaborative journalism has received some criticism:
*Some news stories require secrecy as they develop.  Often sources cannot know that they are being investigated or reported on. When a single reporter investigates a person or organization, this secrecy is more likely to be kept.  When news stories are developed collaboratively by multiple journalists, however, secrecy is more likely to be lost and the story jeopardized.&lt;ref name=DigiDave&gt;"[http://www.digidave.org/2009/03/collaboration-is-queen.html Collaboration is Queen] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090817232727/http://www.digidave.org/2009/03/collaboration-is-queen.html |date=2009-08-17 }}" 2009, ''DigiDave.org''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Quality of collaborative projects may be difficult to assess.  Fact-checking may be difficult, as facts come from many different sources.  Quality of writing and reporting may also differ among contributors.&lt;ref name=Haber&gt;Haber, Marlan Wynne "[http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/article/1026359737.html%3Bjsessionid=E02C44EA6326406DD8BB63E7C014ABC7.ehctc1 Strategies of Collaborative Writing and Intellectual Enrichment.]" 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''combined storage tank''' combines hot water storage both for heating support and drinking water heating in a larger tank. As a result, warm water, typically from solar thermal energy, is stored temporarily for both purposes for later consumption. Breaks in sunshine can thus be bridged without any additional heating, depending on the heating requirement and storage size. This generally takes up less space than two individual [[Hot water storage tank|buffer tanks]] and thermal losses are thereby reduced. These storage tanks are mostly insulated on the outside and designed for the lowest possible heat losses. Usually, it is a tank-in-tank system, that is, a two-compartment system arranged one inside the other. It is thus a combined buffer storage tank with a heat exchange plate in between. Above is a smaller interior tank for drinking water, i.e. water for showers, washing etc. and around it on the outside is a much larger storage volume for heating water for room heating.

An alternative is the [[Layered charge storage|layer charge storage tank]], where the warmest storage layer is located at the top of the tank and colder layers below. The advantage of this is that different temperatures cannot be mixed and warm water can be used for longer. The layer storage tank is considered the most modern type of storage in this field. For drinking water heating, a fresh water station is used in the throughflow principle with a heat exchanger, which reduces the risk of [[legionella]] formation and is therefore even more hygienic.

This leads to efficiency optimisation together with an intelligent loading and unloading control. Both are especially useful if combined with what is called a low-temperature heating system and good building insulation, which makes the energy more effective.

A concept recently championed by [[IBM|International Business Machines (IBM)]], '''consumability''' is a description of customers' end-to-end experience with technology solutions (although the concept could easily apply to almost anything).  The tasks associated with consumability start before the consumer purchases a product and continue until the customer stops using the product.  By improving the consumability of the product, the value of that product to the client can be increased.

Understanding product consumability requires an in-depth understanding of how clients are actually trying to use the product, which is why consumability is so closely aligned with the [[user experience]] and  [[Outside-in software development]].  While [[usability]] addresses a client's ability to use a product, consumability is a higher-level concept that incorporates all the other aspects of the customer’s experience with the product.

Key consumability aspects of the user experience include:

# Identifying the right product
# Acquiring the product 
# Installing and configuring the product
# Using and administering the product 
# Troubleshooting problems with the product 
# Updating the product (e.g.  installing fix packs)

How efficiently and effectively clients can complete these tasks affects the value they get from the product.  Missteps anywhere along this path can have direct impacts on the customer's ability to complete the task they set out to do.  By focusing on consumability, developers can smooth the path, allowing technology solution consumers to focus on the needs of their business, improving their perception and satisfaction with the product or solution.

Projects that crisis camps often work on include setting up [[social network]]s for people to locate missing friends and relatives, creating maps of affected areas, and creating inventories of needed items such as food and clothing.

Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], many crisis camps were set up around the world, often under the name "Crisis Camp Haiti", to help with the relief effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17,0,6468659.story |title=Crisis Camp Haiti: Techno-types volunteer their computer skills to aid quake victims |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |accessdate=January 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120063956/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17%2C0%2C6468659.story |archivedate=January 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical technical practice''' is [[critical theory]] based approach towards technological design proposed by [[Phil Agre]] where [[critical theory|critical]] and [[cultural studies|cultural]] theories are brought to bear in the work of designers and [[engineer]]s. One of the goals of critical technical practice is to increase awareness and critical reflection on the hidden assumptions, ideologies and values underlying technology design.

== Pedagogy of Critical Technical Practice ==
 
A different fork of Critical Technical Practice from Agre’s root (Agre, 1997) was initiated at the former Centre for Cultural Studies between 2007-2017, Goldsmiths, University of London as a way to examine, the live techno-social aspects of contemporary digital culture. This stream of Critical Technical Practice (CTP) at its most broad use can be described as the formation of thought and action that incorporates art as a method of enquiry. This is a compacted intellectual form, that makes the space between the technical, theory and practice ambiguous. A typical digital culture class would make/explore things, attempting to explain the phenomena caught in the lens of a project or proposition. 
 
An example of a class may clarify this approach. We might propose that the class create a simple (DOS) denial of service attack on a test remote server by learning to code computers for the first time. It is empowering for students to find out how quickly they can code. The class would learn how to do this from T.J. Connor’s book Violent Python. After the group had reached a self-satisfied tingle of radicalism the group would be asked to look up the author and would find that Connor is a top grade US Military expert. The group would then look at the books distribution and market penetration and be encouraged to question the affective logics, politics and culture of the book, reflect on why the workshop had been constructed the way it was, and their own learning in different registers of technicality, politics of information and personal critic and empowerment was achieved. 
 
Critical Technical Practice then is not necessarily a reduction of phenomena to literature or a system of logics, but can instead be thought of as knowledge incorporated into a thing that the class created, look at or pointed too, through revealing a certain type of gaze.  A prerequisite of Critical Practice is that incorporates this form of gaze is thinking through the formation of oneself as a thinker, actor in the world. Enquiring into one's pre-existence helps understand the structuring of potential that has informed what one has become, what one could easily recognise, and what one could easily achieve. This is not a summation of limit but an acknowledgement of the hard work needed to escape a pre-existence, as it may relate to the four pillars of repression, class, gender, sexuality and race. The situated knowledge of family and friends, their relation to making things, to popular culture, to oral histories, to struggles with money or law, reading, writing and speaking, all inform this process. 
 
To this end, CTP is partially related to a schizoanalysis of Foucault's question  “What are we today?” (Foucault 1984: pp. 42ff.) The class is always encouraged to unfold what conditions, constrain, control, resist, govern, determine this moment and not another? What patterns of recognition are we privileging and why does it blind us to others? How does language restrict us at the very moment we are able to say something? How can this engagement be born anew in every instance?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5577">'''Data literacy''' is the ability to read, understand, create and communicate data as information. Much like [[literacy]] as a general concept, data literacy focuses on the [[Skill|competencies]] involved in working with data. 
As [[data collection]] and [[data sharing]] become routine and [[data analysis]] and [[big data]] become common ideas in the news, business,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hey, A. J.|editor2=Tony Hey|editor3=Tansley, S.|editor4=Tolle, K.|title=The fourth paradigm: data-intensive scientific discovery.|year=2009|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Data Philly|url=http://opendataphilly.org/|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Na, L. |author2= Yan, Z. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Promote Data-intensive Scientific Discovery, Enhance Scientific and Technological Innovation Capability: New Model, New Method, and New Challenges Comments on" The Fourth Paradigm: Data-intensive Scientific Discovery|journal=Bulletin of Chinese Academy of Sciences|year=2013|volume=1|issue=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it becomes more and more important for students, citizens, and readers to have some data literacy. 

==Related terms==

Data literacy focuses on the ability to understand and build knowledge from data, and to communicate that meaning to others. It is related to other fields, including:
* [[Statistical literacy]]
* [[Media literacy]]
* [[Information literacy]]
* [[New literacies]]
* [[Numeracy]]
* [[Transliteracy]]
* [[21st-century skills]]

== Definitions ==
* When focused on understanding scientific data, data literacy emphasizes the numeric, statistical nature of data as information, including "... understanding what data mean, including how to read graphs and charts appropriately, draw correct conclusions from data, and recognize when data are being used in misleading or inappropriate ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carlson, J.

* When focused on educating a population, data literacy involves "...  the knowledge of what data are, how they are collected, analyzed, visualized and shared, and is the understanding of how data are applied for benefit or detriment, within the cultural context of security and privacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Crusoe, D. |title=Data Literacy defined pro populo: To read this article, please provide a little information.|journal=The Journal of Community Informatics|date=November 2016|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* When focused on citizen-design, data literacy is "... the ability to ask and answer real-world questions from large and small data sets through an inquiry process, with consideration of ethical use of data. It is based on core practical and creative skills, with the ability to extend knowledge of specialist data handling skills according to goals. These include the abilities to select, clean, analyse, visualise, critique and interpret data, as well as to communicate stories from data and to use data as part of a design process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wolff, A. |author2=Gooch, D. |author3=Cavero, J. |author4=Rashid, U. |author5=Kortuem, G. |title=Creating an understanding of data literacy for a data-driven society|journal=The Journal of Community Informatics|date=November 2016|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* When focused narrowly on the skills employers hope to find in their workers, data literacy means "... competence in finding, manipulating, managing, and interpreting data, including not just numbers but also text and images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Jeanne|title=Data Is Useless Without the Skills to Analyze It|url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/09/data_is_useless_without_the_skills.html|work=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4897">'''De-Mail''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[E-Government]] communications service that makes it possible to exchange [[legal document|legal]] [[electronic document]]s between citizens, agencies, and businesses over the Internet. The project called Bürgerportal is realized by the German government in cooperation with private business partners in an effort to reduce communication costs of administration and companies.

The project was announced in 2008 and has been accepted by [[Bundestag]] and [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] in early 2011. The De-Mail law (which serves as the legal basis for the service) went into effect on May 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Gesetzestexte/de_mail_gesetz.pdf?__blob=publicationFile Federal Ministry of the Interior]: De-Mail Law, May 2nd 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
With the introduction of De-Mail the German legislation implements the [[European Union|EU]] [[Directive on services in the internal market]] which demands that authorities accept [[legally binding]] electronic communications by the end of 2009.

The government specifies legal and technical requirements for the services, but does not provide the services. The services are provided by private companies which are allowed to provide De-Mail services after an official [[certification]] process.

== Services ==
Besides email communication, other services are specified that support the communication process.

* '''De-Mail''' is the email communication service which also specifies several ''options'' commonly known from postal mail, such as [[registered mail]], personal delivery (delivery only to the recipient, not to any representatives), delivery and pick-up notifications.
* '''De-Mail accounts''' can be registered by individuals and companies and require identification of the applicant. Email addresses for individuals have the form &lt;Firstname&gt;.&lt;Lastname&gt;@&lt;De-Mail-Provider&gt;.de-mail.de (but can also be registered for pseudonyms if marked as such); companies can also register subdomains in the form of &lt;Domain-Name&gt;.de-mail.de.
* '''De-Ident''' allows users to request signed [[Identity document|proof of identity]] from their provider (based on the identification during the account sign-up process) which can then be forwarded via De-Mail to e.g. online shops to provide proof of identity, age, etc.
* '''De-Safe''' provides users with encrypted online storage for documents. Usage of this service does, however, not fulfill the legal storage and archiving requirements for documents.

== Usage ==
Usage should be voluntary for all users, and should only be an additional option to postal mail.

== Criticism ==
Several aspects of the law have sparked criticism of the system.

* Communication between De-Mail and regular email addresses is not possible. The same applies to clients using the ''electronic court and administration mail'' ([[:de:Elektronisches Gerichts- und Verwaltungspostfach|Elektronisches Gerichts- und Verwaltungspostfach]]) which already provides legal electronic communication between courts and other participating governmental organizations.
* [[End-to-end encryption]] can be offered by the providers but is not mandatory. This would make it possible for providers to read emails before transmission and can constitute a possible point of attack. However, users can still apply encryption before sending De-Mail messages.
* The data provided during the identication process for the account creation is centrally stored and available to the authorities. The De-Mail law even specifies naming the account owner to private individuals.
* Official notifications are delivered once they are available in the recipient's mailbox. This is contrary to the postal mail, where a letter is only seen as legally delivered after it has been accepted by the recipient.

== Current providers ==
The following companies are currently accredited as De-Mail providers
* [[Deutsche Telekom AG]]
* [[Mentana-Claimsoft]]
* [[T-Systems]]
* [[United Internet AG]] (brands [[GMX Mail|GMX]], [[1&amp;1 Internet|1&amp;1]], [[Web.de]])
In the process of accreditation are:
* [[Deutsche Post]]

The DAA platform enables secure authentication of a mobile user whilst simultaneously preserving privacy of the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=451 Research Analyst Report|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-30|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3955296/ovum-report-averon.pdf?hsCtaTracking=21516a12-2112-4331-b738-9cc9ebbd4b19%7C77dd6935-548f-45ff-9b6a-8652e13c284c/|title=Ovum Report: On The Radar |last=Kellet|first=Andrew|date=2018-03-21|website=ovum.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology was developed in stealth from late 2015, first publicly introduced by Averon in 2018, and featured at the 2018 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] as a new technology that combats the increasing threats of cybercrime and consumer account hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crn.com.au/news/10-coolest-smb-products-at-ces-2018-480892?utm_source=desktop&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=share/|title=10 Coolest Products at CES 2018|last=Alspach|first=Kyle|date=2018-01-11|website=CRN|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Overview ==
In contrast to legacy methods of cybersecurity, the DAA platform bypasses end user actions, and rather than focusing on the authentication of a user's device, DAA instead provides autonomous authentication of a user's mobile phone number, since the mobile phone number continues to be associated with the user even when they lose, destroy or upgrade their mobile phone. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.redherring.com/mobile/averon-ceo-wendell-brown-ux-now-crucial-element-cybersecurity/|title=UX Now Crucial Element in Cybersecurity|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2017-11-02|website=redherring.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAA method uses a proprietary mix of technology developed by Averon that works inside the secure mobile network data pipelines together with encrypted technology already within every smartphone. The combination of these autonomous authentication methods has been described by research analysts as a faster, more secure, and stronger method of cybersecurity than traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blockchain and privacy properties ==
Blockchain technology incorporated into the DAA platform ensures the privacy of end users. No identifiable personal data is maintained on the platform, therefore public disclosure of one's authentic identity (such as for the purpose of verified social media interactions) is voluntary. DAA technology affords the end user full control over identity disclosure in any given online interaction, which can be controlled by the end user in varying degrees from fully anonymous to fully identified publicly. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://martechseries.com/mobile/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-invests-in-mobile-identity-start-up-averon/|title=Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Invests in Mobile Identity Startup Averon |last=|first=|date=2018-03-22|website=martechseries.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases involving the need for anonymity with regard to an end user's safety, such as in cases of whistleblowers or political activists, the DAA platform's blockchain technology provides a method for both complete anonymity with the option of voluntary verification of limited but often needed data (such as verifying an anonymous user's general location). Thus DAA technology alleviates the heretofore insurmountable challenge of protecting user privacy with the need for authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use cases ==
The DAA technology platform was designed to be seamlessly adopted for utilization in a wide variety of industries and use cases in which mobile authentication of users is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/ideo-colab/digital-identity-is-broken-but-we-can-fix-it-b15398180bdf/|title=Digital Identity Is Broken, But We Can Fix It|last=Elitzer|first=Dan|date=2017-04-11|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''disc filter''' is a type of [[filter (water)|water filter]] used primarily in [[irrigation]], similar to a [[screen filter]], except that the filter cartridge is made of a number of plastic discs stacked on top of each other like a pile of [[poker]] chips.  Each disc is covered with small grooves or bumps.  The discs (or rings) each have a hole in the middle, forming a hollow cylinder in the middle of the stack. The [[water]] passes through the small passages in between and the impurities are trapped behind.&lt;ref name="Tomatoes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stryker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stryker|first1=Jess|title=Irrigation Water Filtration &amp; Filter Recommendations|url=http://www.irrigationtutorials.com/filters.htm|website=Irrigation Tutorials|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The filtration quality is based on the quantity and size of particles that the filtering element is able to retain.  Higher quality filtration simply means cleaner water.  This depends on the geometry of the channels, including the size, length, angle, and number of generated intersection points.&lt;ref name="CarrowDuncan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert N. Carrow|author2=Ronny R. Duncan|author3=Michael T.

The typical range is from 25 microns for the finest level of filtration to 400 microns for the coarsest.&lt;ref name="Allhands &amp; Prochaska" /&gt;  Sometimes the filtration quality is given as the equivalent [[mesh size]] of a comparable screen filter.  Typical mesh sizes range from 40 to 600.&lt;ref name="Tomatoes" /&gt;  When using mesh sizes, 40 is the coarsest and 600 is the finest or highest level of filtration.

Disc filters range in size from small units with a 3/4" inlet and outlet used for landscape [[drip irrigation]] systems to very large banks of multiple filters manifolded together used for filtering large volumes of water for agricultural and industrial applications.&lt;ref name="Allhands &amp; Prochaska" /&gt;

Some disc filters, especially the smaller ones, must be taken apart and cleaned by hand.&lt;ref name="Stryker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maintaining Microirrigation" /&gt;  Many of the larger ones can be backflushed in such a way that the discs are able to separate and spin during the cleaning cycle.&lt;ref name="Tomatoes"&gt;{{cite book|title=Drip Irrigation of Processing Tomatoes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R7jn7l75kYMC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=7 August 2017|year=2008|publisher=UCANR Publications|isbn=978-1-60107-436-2|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CarrowDuncan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert N.

However, when used to filter organic matter, they will clog more quickly than a [[media filter]] and will have to be cleaned more often.  One advantage that the disc filter has over the media filter is that it can backflush more quickly with less flush water.&lt;ref name="Tomatoes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maintaining Microirrigation"&gt;{{cite book|title=Maintaining Microirrigation Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b32OIhEpqFoC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=7 August 2017|year=2008|publisher=UCANR Publications|isbn=978-1-60107-488-1|pages=33, 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The disc filter was originally developed in 1936 to filter [[hydraulic fluid]] in the [[B-17 bomber]].  In these filters, the discs were made of stainless steel and brass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6660">'''Dispositif''' is a term used by the French intellectual [[Michel Foucault]], generally to refer to the various institutional, physical, and administrative mechanisms and knowledge structures which enhance and maintain the exercise of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] within the social body.

==Translation==
Dispositif is translated variously, even in the same book, as 'device', 'machinery', 'apparatus', 'construction', and 'deployment'.

== Definition ==

Foucault uses the term in his 1977 "The Confession of the Flesh" interview, where he answers the question, "What is the meaning or methodological function for you of this term, [[Apparatus theory|apparatus]] (dispositif)?" as follows:

:''"What I'm trying to pick out with this term is, firstly, a thoroughly heterogeneous ensemble consisting of discourses, institutions, architectural forms, regulatory decisions, laws, administrative measures, scientific statements, philosophical, moral and philanthropic propositions–in short, the said as much as the unsaid. Such are the elements of the apparatus. The apparatus itself is the system of relations that can be established between these elements."''&lt;ref&gt;"The Confession of the Flesh" (1977) interview. In Power/Knowledge Selected Interviews and Other Writings (ed Colin Gordon), 1980: pp. 194–228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foucaultblog.wordpress.com/2007/04/01/what-is-the-dispositif "What is the ''dispositive''?"] Foucault Blog, April 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German linguist [[Siegfried Jäger]] defines Foucault's ''dispositif'' as

:''"the interaction of discursive behavior (i. e. speech and thoughts based upon a shared knowledge pool), non-discursive behavior (i. e. acts based upon knowledge), and manifestations of knowledge by means of acts or behaviors ''...''. ''Dispositifs'' can thus be imagined as a kind of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', the complexly interwoven and integrated ''dispositifs'' add up in their entirety to a ''dispositif'' of all society."''&lt;ref&gt;''"das Zusammenspiel diskursiver Praxen (= Sprechen und Denken auf der Grundlage von Wissen), nichtdiskursiver Praxen (= Handeln auf der Grundlage von Wissen) und „Sichtbarkeiten“ bzw. „Vergegenständlichungen“ (von Wissen durch Handeln/Tätigkeit) ''...''. Dispositive kann man sich insofern auch als eine Art „Gesamtkunstwerke“ vorstellen, die – vielfältig  miteinander verzahnt und verwoben – ein gesamtgesellschaftliches Dispositiv ausmachen."'', [http://www.diss-duisburg.de/Internetbibliothek/Artikel/Aspekte_einer_Kritischen_Diskursanalyse.htm Siegfried Jäger: Theoretische und methodische Aspekte einer Kritischen Diskurs- und Dispositivanalyse]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish philosopher Raffnsøe "advances the 'dispositive' (le dispositif) as a key conception in Foucault's work" and "a resourceful approach to the study of contemporary societal problems."&lt;ref&gt;What is a dispositive? Foucault's historical mappings of the networks of social reality" https://www.academia.edu/9838825/What_is_a_dispositive_Foucault_s_historical_mappings_of_the_networks_of_social_reality&lt;/ref&gt; According to Raffnsøe, "the dispositionally prescriptive level is a crucial aspect of social reality in organizational life, since it has a determining effect on what is taken for granted and considered real. Furthermore, it determines not only what is and can be considered possible but also what can even be imagined and anticipated as potentially realizable, as something one can hope for, or act to bring about".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault's dispositive: The perspicacity of dispositive analytics in organizational Research": 21

=== Agamben's delineation ===
The Italian political philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] traces the trajectory of the term to [[Aristotle]]'s ''oikonomia—the effective management of the household''  and the early Church Fathers' attempt to save the concept of the Trinity from the allegation of polytheism, as the triplicity of the God is his oikonomia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jDGrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=dispositif+agamben+dictionary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=98j4y5vhL5&amp;sig=QBqpf3kZtb92q246YMByRdoidmE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieqfWgz_7PAhUIL48KHYe9DoIQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=dispositif%20agamben%20dictionary&amp;f=false|title=Agamben Dictionary|last=Murray|first=Alex|date=2011-06-06|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748646982|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Agamben defines the ''apparatus''/''dispositif'' as

:''"Further expanding the already large class of Foucauldian apparatuses, I shall call an apparatus literally anything that has in some way the capacity to capture, orient, determine, intercept, model, control, or secure the gestures, behaviors, opinions, or discourses of living beings. Not only, therefore, prisons, madhouses, the panopticon, schools, confession, factories, disciplines, judicial measures, and so forth (whose connection with power is in a certain sense evident), but also the pen, writing, literature, philosophy, agriculture, cigarettes, navigation, computers, cellular telephones and—why not—language itself, which is perhaps the most ancient of apparatuses—one in which thousands and thousands of years ago a primate inadvertently let himself be captured, probably without realizing the consequences that he was about to face."''&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Agamben, "What is an Apparatus?" in ''What is an Apparatus? And Other Essays''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2009: p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian scholar Matteo Pasquinelli criticises Agamben's genealogy with these words

:''"The dispositif is traced back, theoretically and philologically, to the definition of social normativity that Foucault takes from Canguilhem's The Normal and the Pathological (1966) and to the use of the term dispositif by Canguilhem himself in the essay "Machine and Organism" (1952). Both these lineages proceed from the notion of organic normativity that Canguilhem adopts from the German-Jewish neurologist Kurt Goldstein, that is from a tradition of Lebensphilosophie that appears to be incompatible with Agamben's theological thesis."''&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Pasquinelli, "What an Apparatus is Not: On the Archeology of the Norm in Foucault, Canguilhem, and Goldstein". Parrhesia 22,  2015, 79-89. [http://matteopasquinelli.com/what-an-apparatus-is-not/ PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44913">'''E-services''' (electronic services) are services which use of [[Information and communication technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs). The three main components of e-services are- service provider, service receiver and the channels of service delivery (i.e., technology). For example, as concerned to public e-service, public agencies are the service provider and citizens as well as businesses are the service receiver. The channel of service delivery is the third requirement of e-service. Internet is the main channel of e-service delivery while other classic channels (e.g. telephone, call center, public kiosk, mobile phone, television) are also considered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Rowley, J. (2006) An analysis of the e-service literature: towards a research agenda. Internet Research, 16 (3), 339-359&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in the late 1980s in Europe{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and formal introduction in 1993 by the US Government,&lt;ref&gt;Alasem, A. (2009). An Overview of e-Government Metadata Standards and Initiatives based on Dublin Core. Electronic Journal of e-Government, 7(1), 1 – 10&lt;/ref&gt; the term ‘[[E-Government]]’ has now become one of the recognized research domains especially in the context of public policy and now has been rapidly gaining strategic importance in public sector modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer, M., Codagnone, C. and Janssen, M. (2008) “Future of e-Government Research: 13 research themes identified in the eGovRTD2020 project’. Proceedings of the 41st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, USA&lt;/ref&gt; E-service is one of the branches of this domain and its attention has also been creeping up among the practitioners and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Lӧfstedt, U. (2005) ‘Assessment of current research and some proposals for future direction’, International Journal of Public IS&lt;/ref&gt;

E-service (or eservice) is a highly generic term, usually referring to ‘The provision of services via the Internet (the prefix 'e' standing for ‘electronic’, as it does in many other usages), thus e-Service may also include e-Commerce, although it may also include non-commercial services (online), which is usually provided by the government.’ (Irma Buntantan &amp; G. David Garson, 2004: 169-170; Muhammad Rais &amp; Nazariah, 2003: 59, 70-71).

"E-Service constitutes the online services available on the Internet, whereby a valid transaction of buying and selling (procurement) is possible, as opposed to the traditional websites, whereby only descriptive information are available, and no online transaction is made possible." (Jeong, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of E-service ==
Lu (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Lu, J. (2001). Measuring cost/benefits of e-business applications and customer satisfaction”, Proceedings of the 2nd International Web Conference, 29–30 November, Perth, Australia, 139-47&lt;/ref&gt; identifies a number of benefits for e-services, some of these are:

* Accessing a greater customer base
* Broadening market reach
* Lowering of entry barrier to new markets and cost of acquiring new customers
* Alternative communication channel to customers
* Increasing services to customers
* Enhancing perceived company image
* Gaining competitive advantages
* Enhancing transparency 
* Potential for increasing [[Customer knowledge]]

==Importance and advantages of E-shopping==
*E-shops are open 24 hours a day.
*There is no need to travel to the malls or wait at the checkout counters.
*There is usually a wide selection of goods and services.
*It is easy to compare prices and quality by using the E-shopping tool.
*Price reduction and discounts are electronically conveyed.

==E-service domain==
The term ‘e-service’ has many applications and can be found in many disciplines. The two dominant application areas of e-services are

E-business (or e-commerce): e-services mostly provided by businesses or [NGO|non-government organizations] (NGOs) (private sector).

E-government: e-services provided by government to citizens or business (public sector is the supply side). The use and description of the e-service in this page will be limited to the context of e-government only where of the e-service is usually associated with prefix “public”: Public e-services. In some cases, we will have to describe aspects that are related to both fields like some conferences or journals which cover the concept of “e-Service” in both domains of e-government and [[e-business]].[example:[https://web.archive.org/web/20180125141728/http://eserviceforyou.com/] www.eserviceforyou.com]

==Architecture==
Depending on the types of services, there are certain functionalities required in the certain layers of e-service architectural framework, these include but are not limited to – Data layer (data sources), processing layers (customer service systems, management systems, data warehouse systems, integrated customer content systems), exchange layer ([[Enterprise application integration|Enterprise Application Integration]]– EAI), interaction layer ( integrating e-services), and presentation layer (customer interface through which the web pages and e-services are linked).

==E-service quality==
Measuring [[service quality]] and service excellence are important in a competitive organizational environment. The [[SERVQUAL]]- service quality model is one of the widely used tools for measuring quality of the service on various aspects. The five attributes of this model are: reliability, responsiveness, assurance, tangibles, and empathy. The following table summarizes some major of these:

The [[LIRNEasia]] study on benchmarking national telecom regulator websites focuses on content than on accessibility and ease of use, unlike the other studies mentioned here. Websites are increasingly important portals to government agencies, especially in the context of [[information society]] reforms. Stakeholders, including businesses, investors and even the general public, are interested in information produced by these agencies, and websites can help to increase their transparency and accountability. The quality of its website also demonstrates how advanced a regulatory agency is.

==Practical examples of e-services in the Developing World==
Information technology is a powerful tool for accelerating economic development. Developing countries have focused on the development of ICT during the last two decades and as a result, it has been recognized that ICT is critical to economy and is as a catalyst of economic development. So, in recent years there seems to have been efforts for providing various e-services in many developing countries since ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-Government and as a result, e-Services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Ndou, V.(2004)E-Government for developing countries: Opportunities and Challenges, EJISDC 18, 1, 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Many government agencies in developed countries have taken progressive steps toward the web and ICT use, adding coherence to all local activities on the Internet, widening local access and skills, opening up interactive services for local debates, and increasing the participation of citizens on promotion and management of the territory(Graham and Aurigi, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S. and Aurigi, A. (1997) Virtual Cities, Social Polarisation, and the Crisis in Urban Public Space, Journal of Urban Technology, 4, 1, 19-52&lt;/ref&gt;

But the potential for e-government in developing countries remains largely unexploited, even though. ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-government. Different human, organizational and technological factors,
issues and problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and appropriate approaches. ICT, in general, is referred to as an “enabler”, but on the other hand, it should also be regarded as a challenge and a peril in itself. The organizations, public or private, which ignore the potential value and use of ICT may suffer pivotal competitive disadvantages. Nevertheless, some e-government initiatives have flourished in developing countries too, e.g. Brazil, India, Chile, etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; What the experience in these countries shows, is that governments in the developing world can effectively exploit and appropriate the benefits of ICT, but e-government success entails the accommodation of certain unique conditions, needs and obstacles. The adaptive challenges of e-government go far beyond technology, they call for organizational structures and skills, new forms of leadership, transformation of public-private partnerships (Allen et al., 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Allen, A.B., Juillet, L., Paquet, G. and Roy, J. (2001) E-Governance and Government Online in Canada: Partnerships, People and Prospects, Government Information Quarterly,18, 93-104.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following are a few examples regarding e-services in some developing countries:

===E-services in Bangladesh===
Bangladesh first e-service system is National E-Service System ([http://www.eservice.gov.bd/[ NESS]]) and 2nd e-Service For you [http://eserviceforyou.com/[eserviceforyou.com]]. 

===E-services in Rwanda===
Only a decade after emerging from the fastest genocide of the 20th Century, Rwanda, a small country in Eastern Central Africa,
has become one of the continent’s leaders in, and model on, bridging the digital divide through e-government. Rwanda has undergone a rapid turnaround from one of the most technologically deficient countries only a decade ago to a country
where legislative business is conducted online and wireless access to the Internet is available anywhere in the country. This is
puzzling when viewed against the limited progress made in other comparable developing countries, especially those located in the
same region, sub-Saharan Africa, where the structural and institutional constraints to e-government diffusion are similar.&lt;ref&gt;Mawangi, W.(2006) The social relations of e-government diffusion in developing countries: the case of Rwanda, Proceedings of the 2006 international conference on Digital government research, May 21–24, 2006, San Diego, California&lt;/ref&gt;

===E-services in South Africa===
In South Africa, there continues to be high expectations of government in respect to improved delivery of service and of closer consultation with citizens. Such expectations are not unique to this country, and in this regard there is a need for governments to recognise that the implementation of e-government systems and e-services affords them the opportunity to enhance service delivery and good governance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;van Brakel, P.A.(2009) Proceedings of the 11th Annual Conference on World Wide Web Applications, Port Elizabeth, 2–4 September&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of e-Government has been widely acclaimed in that it provides new impetus to deliver services quickly and efficiently (Evans &amp; Yen, 2006:208).&lt;ref&gt;Evans, D. &amp; Yen, D. C. 2006. e-Government: evolving relationship of citizens and government, domestic, and international development. Government Information Quarterly, 23(2): 207-235.)&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of these benefits, various arms of the South African government have embarked on a number of e-government programmes for example the [http://www.gov.za/  Batho Pele portal], [[Sars efiling|SARS e-filing]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100405043644/http://www.enatis.com/  e-Natis system], electronic processing of grant applications from remote sites, and a large number of departmental information websites. Also a number of well publicised e-government ventures such as the latter, analysts and researchers consider the state of e-government in South Africa to be at rudimentary stages. There are various factors
which collectively contribute to such an assessment. Amongst these, key factors relate to a lack of a clear strategy to facilitate uptake and adoption of e-government services as well as evaluation frameworks to assess expectations of citizens who are one of the primary user groups of these services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===E-services in Malaysia===
E-Services is one of the pilot projects under the Electronic Government Flagship within the Multimedia Super Corridor ([http://www.mscmalaysia.my/  MSC]) initiative. With E-Services, one can now conduct transactions with Government agencies, such as the Road Transport Department (RTD) and private utility companies such as Tenaga Nasional Berhad ([http://www.tnb.com.my TNB]) and Telekom Malaysia Berhad ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100529003757/http://www.tm.net.my/  TM]) through various convenient channels such as the eServices kiosks and internet. No more queuing, traffic jams or bureaucratic hassles and one can now conduct transaction at one’s own convenience. Also, Electronic Labour Exchange ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100721234322/http://www.elx.gov.my/  ELX])is one stop-centre for labor market information, as supervised by the Ministry of Human Resource ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100419184753/http://www.mohr.gov.my/ MOHR]), to enable employers and job seekers to communicate on the same platform.

== Examples of E-services in Established Countries ==

=== E-services in the United States of America ===
In America, citizens have many options and opportunities to follow and understand government actions through e-government. [[Government 2.0]] (Gov. 2.0) is currently in place to bring the people and governments together to learn new information, increase government transparency, and better means for communicating to one another. Gov. 2.0 offers increased citizen participation through on-line applications such as social media and other apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinempa.unc.edu/a-citizens-guide-to-open-government-e-government-and-government-2-0/|title=A Citizen's Guide to Open Government, E-Government, and Government 2.0|last=Harper|first=Logan|date=June 10, 2013|website=|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the internet and websites such as USA.gov, an individual can perform actions such as contacting elected officials, find information about the work force such as retirement plans and labor laws, learn about money and consumer issues such as taxes, loans, and welfare, learn about citizenship and obtaining a visa or passport, and other topics such as health and welfare, education, and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usa.gov|title=USA.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E-commerce]] is another growing E-service in the United States for both big and small businesses. E-commerce sales are projected to grow 10 to 12 percent annually. [[Amazon.com]] is the largest on-line marketplace in the country with annual sales of $79 billion. [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] is also a widely popular retailer. They have grown their business by having electronic services. Wal-Mart’s sales for E-commerce in 2015 was roughly $13 billion. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] develops and sells a wide variety of technological goods and services such as cell phones, music players, and computers. Apple’s sales for E-commerce in 2015 was $12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceoworld.biz/2016/03/08/americas-top-25-e-commerce-retailers-sales/|title=CEO Insiders: America's Top 25 E-commerce Retailers by Sales|last=Bhushan|first=Dr. Amarendra|date=March 8, 2016|website=CEOWorld Magazine|access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-services allows businesses to reach new clientele and offer new services. Companies such as [[eBay]] and [[Etsy]] have achieved great success, with eBay posting a net income in 2016 of nearly $9 billion and Esty claiming roughly $200 million in profits from nearly $2 billion sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/27/how-e-commerce-helps-us-small-businesses-go-global.html|title=How e-commerce helps US small businesses go global|last=Rogers|first=Kate|date=April 27, 2015|website=CNBC|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority or eBay's business is conducted in the United States but it does a great deal of international business including the United Kingdom and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/topics/2181/ebay/|title=eBay - Statistics &amp; Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global reach of Etsy is seen in nearly every country in the world with 31% of gross merchandise sales occurring outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amigobulls.com/articles/etsy-ipo-all-you-need-to-know-about-etsy|title=Etsy IPO: All You Need To Know About Etsy|last=Nagarkar|first=Vikram|date=March 19, 2015|website=Amigobulls|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-services in China ===
China’s recent realization of the continuing growth of internet usage has caused the government to recognize the need to expand their E-government services. Some steps the government wants to take in order to increase their E-government services are to develop more online functions, use government sites to integrate on-line services, have supplementary open data available to citizens to further government transparency, and to combine services from local and country-wide governments for convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/15/china_gets_the_egov_love_bug/|title=China Gets the E-Gov Love Bug|last=Sharwood|first=Simon|date=September 15, 2016|website=The Register|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916031541/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/15/china_gets_the_egov_love_bug/|archive-date=2016-09-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; China’s plan of action to incorporate the internet into everyday business and grow the economy is known as “[[Internet Plus]].” The government plans to have this plan in full effect by 2025 to be the main driving force for economic and social improvements. Internet Plus will help to grow the job market as the government plans to use local citizens for development, and to generate more areas dedicated to technological growth such as [[Zhongguancun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/business/2015-07/04/content_35980397.htm|title='Internet Plus' action plan unveiled|last=Xinhua|first=|date=July 4, 2015|website=China.org|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the large population, China has the most internet and cell phone users in the world.(consider rewording)  This causes a need for technological growth and a demand for increased E-services. In 2016, Chinese consumers spent more money for on-line goods and services than the United States and United Kingdom combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/chinas-consumers-outspending-americans-and-british-online-2398441519.html|title=Chinese E-Commerce Boom — Bigger Than US, UK Combined|last=Vavra|first=Shannon|date=May 8, 2017|website=axios.com|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is(are) a wide variety of reasons as to why E-commerce flourishes in China including easy access to mobile internet, low cost of shipping, and a vast selection of cheap, unbranded products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/macroeconomic-insights/growth-of-china/chinese-consumer/index.html?cid=PS_01_50_07_00_01_15_01&amp;mkwid=uui8CuV3|title=The Rise of China's New Consumer Class|last=|first=|date=|website=Goldman Sachs|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] is China’s largest on-line marketplace with an annual revenue stream of $16 billion. Its services are globally available in Russia and Brazil through [[AliExpress]]. [[Tencent]] is another internet company with an annual revenue income of $16 billion. Tencent is used mainly for instant messaging but has other applications as well including mobile games and other digital content. By the end of 2015, Tencent’s [[WeChat]] messaging app reached around 700 million users. The biggest competitor for Tencent is Facebook’s [[WhatsApp]]. [[Baidu]] Is the most visited website in the country and it is used as a search engine and has an annual revenue of $10 billion. In March 2016, there were roughly 663 million users. [[Google]] challenges Baidu as the major internet search engines in the world. Huawei is a tech company that produces phones, tablets, and develops the equipment used in fixed-line networks. [[Huawei]] has an annual revenue income of $61 billion. It is currently located throughout 100 countries worldwide and in 2015, it filed 3,898 patent applications, more than any other country in the world. The biggest competitors to Huawei is Apple and [[Samsung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/17/technology/china-tech-behemoths/index.html|title=Meet China's Tech Behemoths|last=Mullen|first=Jethro|date=May 17, 2016|website=CNN|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to e-services in the Developing World==
The future of e-service is bright but some challenges remain. There are some challenges in e-service, as Sheth &amp; Sharma (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Sheth., J.N., Sharma, A., (2007). E-Services: A framework for growth.  Journal of Value Chain Management, 1(1/2)&lt;/ref&gt; identify, are:

* Low penetration of ICT especially in the developing countries;
* [[Internet fraud|Fraud]] on the internet space which is estimated around 2.8billion USD
* [[Internet privacy|Privacy]] due the emergence of various types of spyware and security holes, and
* intrusive characteristics of the service (e.g. mobile phones based) as customers may not like to be contacted with the service providers at any time and at any place.

The first challenge and primary obstacle to the e-service platform will be penetration of the internet. In some developing countries, the access to the internet is limited and speeds are also limited. In these cases firms and customers will continue to use traditional platforms. The second issue of concern is fraud on the internet. It is anticipated that the fraud on the e-commerce internet space costs $2.8 billion. Possibility of fraud will continue to reduce the utilization of the internet. The third issue is of privacy. Due to both spyware and security holes in operating systems, there is concern that the transactions that consumers undertake have privacy limitations.  For example, by stealthily following online activities, firms can develop fairly accurate descriptions of customer profiles.  Possibility of privacy violations will reduce the utilizations of the internet. The final issue is that e-service can also become intrusive as they reduce time and location barriers of other forms of contract. For example, firms can contact people through mobile devices at any time and at any place. Customers do not take like the intrusive behavior and may not use the e-service platform. (Heiner and lyer, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Heiner and lyer (2007) E-Service opportunities and Threats, Journal of value chain management, 1, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major e-service keywords==
A considerable amount of research efforts already exists on the subject matter exploring different aspects of e-service and e-service delivery ; one worth noting effort is Rowley’s study (2006)&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; who did a review study on the e-service literature. The key finding of his study is that there is need to explore dimensions of e-service delivery not focusing only on service quality “In order to understand e-service experiences it is necessary to go beyond studies of e-service quality dimensions and to also take into account the inherent characteristics of e-service delivery and the factors that differentiate one service experience from another.”

Some of the major keywords of e-service as found in the e-government research are as follows:

===Acceptance===
User acceptance of technology is defined according to Morris (1996, referred by Wu 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Philip F. (2009). User Acceptance of Emergency Alert Technology: A Case Study. Proceedings of the 6th International ISCRAM Conference – Gothenburg, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; as “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support”. This definition can be brought into the context of e-service where acceptance can be defined as the users’ willingness to use e-service or the willingness to decide when and how to use the e-service.

===Accessibility===
Users’ ability to access to the e-service is important theme in the previous literature. For example, Huang (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Huang, C.J. (2003). Usability of E-Government Web Sites for People with Disabilities, In Proceedings of the 36th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS’03), IEEE Computer Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; finds that most of the websites in general fail to serve users with disabilities. Recommendation to improve accessibility is evident in previous literature including Jaeger (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, P.T. Assessing Section 508 compliance on federal e-government Web sites: A multi-method, user-centered evaluation of accessibility for persons with disabilities. Government Information Quarterly 23 (2006) 169–190&lt;/ref&gt; who suggests the following to improve e-services’ accessibility like: design for accessibility from the outset of website development, Involve users with disabilities in the testing of the site …Focus on the benefits of an accessible Web site to all users.

===Administrative literacy===
According to Grönlund et al. (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Grönlund, Å., Hatakka, M. and Ask, A. (2007) ‘ Inclusion in the E-Service Society – Investigating Administrative Literacy Requirements for Using E-Services’. 6th International Conference (EGOV 2007, Regensburg, Germany), 4656&lt;/ref&gt; for a simple e-service, the needs for knowledge and skills, content and procedures are considerably less. However, in complicated services there are needed to change some prevailed skills, such as replacing verbal skills with skill in searching for information online.

===Benchmarking===
This theme is concerned with establishing standards for measuring e-services or the best practices within the field. This theme also includes the international benchmarking of e-government services (UN reports, EU reports); much critic has been targeting these reports being incomprehensive and useless. According to Bannister (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Bannister F. (2007). The curse of the benchmark: an assessment of the validity and value of e-government comparisons, International Review of Administrative Sciences, 73 (2), 171-188&lt;/ref&gt; “… benchmarks are not a reliable tool for measuring real e-government progress. Furthermore, if they are poorly designed, they risk distorting government policies as countries may chase the benchmark rather than looking at real local and national needs”

===Digital divide===
[[Digital divide]] is considered one of the main barriers to implementing e-services; some people do not have means to access the e-services and some others do not know how to use the technology (or the e-service). According to Helbig et al. (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Helbig, N; Gil-García, J ; Ferro, E (2009). Understanding the complexity of electronic government: Implications from the digital divide literature. Government Information Quarterly, 26(2009), 89–97&lt;/ref&gt; “we suggest E-Government and the digital divide should be seen as complementary social phenomena (i.e., demand and supply). Moreover, a serious e-government digital divide is that services mostly used by social elites."

===E-readiness===
Most of the reports and the established criteria focus on assessing the services in terms of infrastructure and public policies ignoring the citizen participation or [[e-readiness]]. According to by Shalini (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Shalini, R. (2009). Are Mauritians ready for e-Government services?. Government Information Quarterly 26 (2009) 536–539&lt;/ref&gt; “the results of the research project reveal that a high [http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=eiu_2007_e_readiness_rankings&amp;rf=0|e-readiness index] may be only indicating that a country is e-ready in terms of ICT infrastructure and info-structure, institutions, policies, and political commitment, but it is a very poor measure of the e-readiness of citizens. To summarize the findings, it can be said that Mauritius is ready but the Mauritians are not”

``E-readiness, as the Economist Intelligence Unit defines, is the measure of a country’s ability to leverage digital channels for communication, commerce and government in order to further economic and social development. Implied in this measure is the extent to which the usage of communications devices and Internet services creates efficiencies for business and citizens, and the extent to which this usage is leveraged in the development of information and communications technology (ICT) industries. In general terms, the definition of e-readiness is relative, for instance depending on a country in question's priorities and perspective.&lt;ref&gt;GeoSINC International (2002). E-Readiness Guide. Available at http://www.apdip.net/documents/evaluation/e-readiness/geosinc01042002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficiency===
As opposed to effectiveness, efficiency is focused on the internal competence within the government departments when delivering e-services. There is a complaint that researchers focus more on effectiveness “There is an emerging trend seemingly moving away from the efficiency target and focusing on users and governance outcome. While the latter is worthwhile, efficiency must still remain a key priority for eGovernment given the budget constraints compounded in the future by the costs of an ageing population. Moreover, efficiency gains are those that can be most likely proven empirically through robust methodologies”&lt;ref&gt;Codagnone, C.  Undheim T.A (2008).  Benchmarking eGovernment: tools, theory, and practice. European Journal of ePractice. Nº 4 • August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
Security is the most important challenge that faces the implementation of e-services because without a guarantee of privacy and security citizens will not be willing to take up e-government services. These security concerns, such as hacker attacks and the theft of credit card information, make governments hesitant to provide public online services.  According to the GAO report&lt;ref&gt;GAO.(2002). E-Government: Proposal addresses Critical Challenges. U.S General Accounting Office, Govt of the USA&lt;/ref&gt; of 2002 “security concerns present one of the toughest challenges to extending the reach of e-government.The rash of hacker attacks, Web page defacing, and credit card information being posted on electronic bulletin boards can make many federal agency officials—as well as the general public—reluctant to conduct sensitive government transactions involving personal or financial data over the Internet.” By and Large,  Security is one of the major challenges that faces the implementation and development of electronic services. people want to be assured that they are safe when they are conducting online services and that their information will remain secure and confidential

===Stakeholders===
Axelsson et al. (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Axelsson, K, Melin, f, Lindgren, I, (2009) DEVELOPING PUBLIC E-SERVICES FOR SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS – A MULTIFACETED VIEW OF THE NEEDS FOR AN E-SERVICE. 17th European Conference on Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the stakeholder concept-which was originally used in private firms-, can be used in public setting and in the context of e-government. According to them, several scholars have discussed the use of the [[stakeholder theory]] in public settings.&lt;ref&gt;Scholl, H. J. (2001). Applying stakeholder theory to e-government: Benefits and Limits. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt; The stakeholder theory suggests that need to focus on all the involved stakeholder s when designing the e-service; not only on the government and citizens.

===Usability===
Compared to Accessibility, There is sufficient literature that addresses the issue of usability; researchers have developed different models and methods to measure the usability and effectiveness of eGovernment websites. However, But still there is call to improve these measures and make it more compressive&lt;ref&gt;Kaylor, C.,  Deshazo, R. &amp; Eck, D. V. (2001) "Gauging e-government: A report on implementing services among American cities". Government Information Quarterly (GIQ), 18(4), 293 - 307&lt;/ref&gt;

``The word usability has cropped up a few times already in this unit. In the context of biometric identification, usability referred to the smoothness of enrollment and other tasks associated with setting up an identification system. A system that produced few false matches during enrollment of applicants was described as usable. Another meaning of usability is related to the ease of use of an interface. Although this meaning of the term is often used in the context of computer interfaces, there is no reason to confine it to computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=211245 Open Learning - OpenLearn - Open University]&lt;/ref&gt;´´

==Social, cultural and ethical implications of e-services==
The perceived effectiveness of e-service can be influenced by public’s view of the social and cultural implications of e-technologies and e-service.

Impacts on individuals’ rights and privacy – as more and more companies and government agencies use technology to collect, store, and make accessible data on individuals, privacy concerns have grown. Some companies monitor their employees' computer usage patterns in order to assess individual or workgroup performance.&lt;ref&gt;Asgarkhani, M. (2002). Strategic Management of Information systems and Technology in an e-World”, Proceedings of the 21st IT Conference, Sri Lanka, pp103-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advancements are also making it much easier for businesses, government and other individuals to obtain a great deal of information about an individual without their knowledge. There is a growing concern&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Asgarkhani, M. (2002b) “e-Governance in Asia Pacific”, Proceedings of the International Conference on Governance in Asia, Hong Kong.&lt;/ref&gt; that access to a wide range of information can be dangerous within politically corrupt government agencies.

Impact on Jobs and Workplaces - in the early days of computers, management scientists anticipated that computers would replace human decision-makers. However, despite significant technological advances, this prediction is no longer a mainstream concern. At the current time, one of the concerns associated with computer usage in any organization (including governments) is the health risk – such as injuries related to working continuously on a computer keyboard. Government agencies are expected to work with regulatory groups in order to avoid these problems.

Potential Impacts on Society – despite some economic benefits of ICT to individuals, there is evidence that the computer literacy and access gap between the haves and have-nots may be increasing. Education and information access are more than ever the keys to economic prosperity, yet access by individuals in different countries is not equal - this social inequity has become known as the digital divide.

Impact on Social Interaction – advancements in ICT and e-Technology solutions have enabled many government functions to become automated and information to be made available online. This is a concern to those who place a high value on social interaction.

Information Security - technological advancements allow government agencies to collect, store and make data available online to individuals and organizations. Citizens and businesses expect to be allowed to access data in a flexible manner (at any time and from any location). Meeting these expectations comes at a price to government agencies where it concerns managing information – more specifically, ease of access; data integrity and accuracy; capacity planning to ensure the timely delivery of data to remote (possibly mobile) sites; and managing the security of corporate and public information.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==E-service awards==
The benefits of e-services in advancing businesses efficiency and in promoting good governance are huge; recognizing the importance of these benefits has resulted in number of international awards that are dedicated to recognize the best designed e-services. In the section, we will provide description of some international awards

===Best online e-service in Europe===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3686">An '''early adopter''' (sometimes misspelled as ''early adapter'' or ''early adaptor'') or '''lighthouse customer''' is an early customer of a given company, product, or technology. The term originates from [[Everett M. Rogers]]' ''[[Diffusion of Innovations]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Rogers
 | first = Everett M.
 | authorlink = Everett Rogers
 | year = 1962
 | title = Diffusion of Innovations
 | publisher = Free Press of Glencoe, Macmillan Company
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Typically this will be a customer who, in addition to using the vendor's product or technology, will also provide considerable and candid feedback to help the vendor refine its future product releases, as well as the associated means of distribution, service, and support.  

[[File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Early adopters as shown in the [[Technology adoption lifecycle|Rogers' bell curve]]|384x237px]]

The relationship is [[synergy|synergistic]], with the customer having early (and sometimes unique, or at least uniquely early) access to an advantageous new product or technology, but he or she also serves as a kind of [[Human subject research|guinea pig]].

In exchange for being an early adopter, and thus being exposed to the problems, risks, and annoyances common to early-stage product testing and deployment, the lighthouse customer is sometimes given especially attentive vendor assistance and support, even to the point of having personnel at the customer's work site to assist with implementation.
The customer is sometimes given preferential pricing, terms, and conditions, although new technology is often very expensive, so the early adopter still often pays quite a lot.

The vendor, on the other hand, benefits from receiving early
revenues, and also from a lighthouse customer's endorsement and assistance in further developing the product and its go-to-market mechanisms. Acquiring lighthouse customers is a common step in new product development and implementation. The real-world focus that this type  of relationship can bring to a vendor can be extremely valuable.

Early adoption does come with pitfalls: early versions of products may be buggy and/or prone to malfunction.  Furthermore, more efficient, and sometimes less expensive, versions of the product usually appear a few months after the initial release ([[Apple iPhone]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.aol.com/top5/general/gadgets AOL Money]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13508_3-9790142-19.html Making sense of the million-dollar iPhone lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend of new technology costing more at release is often referred to as the "early adopter tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-3251293-501465.html | title=The Early Adopter's Gamble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1640">'''Electric tweezers''' are an electronic device intended to permanently [[hair removal|remove hair]]. The design incorporates a pair of tweezers at the tip. A button on the side of the handle is used to simultaneously close the tweezer tips and turn on the [[high frequency|high-frequency]] electrical signal. The electrical signal is intended to cause the connection of the hair to its root to be weakened and to stop hair growth from the root in a manner similar to [[Electrology|electrolysis]].

Some electric tweezers have been described using the term ''electrolysis tweezer [[epilator]]'' or ''tweezer epilator'', but their operation is quite different from that of epilators.

The US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] has a definition of ''permanent hair removal'', which these devices have been unable to pass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hairfacts.com/makers/etweezer/ihrs/fda1001.html Hairfacts: Rejuvenu cited for violations by FDA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA definition is such that a device can qualify and yet be ineffective for some people.

[[Plucking (hair removal)|Plucking]] (tweezing) is often described as ''time consuming''. Because the tweezers operate on only one hair at a time and it requires several seconds of application on each hair, this technique is even slower than normal tweezing. The US FDA suggest that, because of the difficulty of using these devices, many people end up effectively only using them as tweezers, with no permanent hair removal.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}

There are various e-authentication methods that can be used to authenticate a user's identify ranging from a password to higher levels of security that utilize [[multifactor authentication]] (MFA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McMahon|first1=Mary|title=What is E-Authentication?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-e-authentication.htm|website=wiseGEEK|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the level of security used, the user might need to prove his or her identity through the use of [[security token]]s, challenge questions or being in possession of a certificate from a third-party certificate authority that attests to their identity.&lt;ref name="Turner-AuthenticationBasics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Digital Authentication - the Basics|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/digital-authentication-the-basics|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Digital enrollment and authentication reference process.jpg|thumb|Digital enrollment and authentication reference process by the American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] The American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) has developed a generic electronic authentication model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burr|first1=William|last2=Dodson|first2=Donna|last3=Newton|first3=Elaine|title=Electronic Authentication Guideline|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63-1/SP-800-63-1.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides a basic framework on how the authentication process is accomplished regardless of jurisdiction or geographic region. According to this model, the enrollment process begins with an individual applying to a [[Credential Service Provider]] (CSP). The CSP will need to prove the applicant's identity before proceeding with the transaction. Once the applicant's identity has been confirmed by the CSP, he or she receives the status of "subscriber", is given an authenticator, such as a token and a credential, which may be in the form of a username.

The CSP is responsible for managing the credential along with the subscriber's enrollment data for the life of the credential. The subscriber will be tasked with maintaining the authenticators. An example of this is when a user normally uses a specific computer to do their online banking. If he or she attempts to access their bank account from another computer, the authenticator will not be present. In order to gain access, the subscriber would need to verify their identity to the CSP, which might be in the form of answering a challenge question successfully before being given access.&lt;ref name="Turner-AuthenticationBasics" /&gt;

==History==
The need for authentication has been prevalent throughout history. In ancient times, people would identify each other through eye contact and physical appearance. The [[Sumer]]ians in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] attested to the authenticity of their writings by using seals embellished with identifying symbols. As time moved on, the most common way to provide authentication would be the handwritten signature.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Authentication factors==
There are three generally accepted factors that are used to establish a digital identity for electronic authentication, including:
* Knowledge factor, which is something that the user knows, such as a password, answers to challenge questions, ID numbers or a PIN.
* Possession factor, which is something that the user has, such as mobile phone, PC or token
* [[Biometric]] factor, which is something that the user is, such as his or her fingerprints, eye scan or voice pattern
Out of the three factors, the biometric factor is the most convenient and convincing to prove an individual's identity. However, having to rely on this sole factor can be expensive to sustain. Although having their own unique weaknesses, by combining two or more factors allows for reliable authentication. It is always recommended to use multifactor authentication for that reason.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Methods==
Authentication systems are often categorized by the number of factors that they incorporate. The three factors often considered as the cornerstone of authentication are:
Something you know (for example, a password)
Something you have (for example, an ID badge or a cryptographic key)
Something you are (for example, a voice print, thumb print or other biometric)

Multifactor authentication is generally more secure than single-factor authentication. But, some multi-factor authentication approaches are still vulnerable to cases like man-in-the-middle attacks and Trojan attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|title=The Failure of Two-Factor Authentication|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/03/the_failure_of.html|website=Schneier on Security|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common methods used in authentication systems are summarized below.

=== Token ===
[[File:SecureID token new.JPG|thumb|A sample of token]]
Tokens generically are something the claimant possesses and controls that may be used to authenticate the claimant's identity. In e-authentication, the claimant authenticates to a system or application over a network. Therefore, a token used for e-authentication is a secret and the token must be protected. The token may, for example, be a cryptographic key, that is protected by encrypting it under a password. An impostor must steal the encrypted key and learn the password to use the token.

=== Passwords and PIN-based authentication===
Passwords and PINs are categorized as "something you know" method. A combination of numbers, symbols, and mixed cases are considered to be stronger than all-letter password. Also, the adoption of Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) features during the information transmission process will as well create an encrypted channel for data exchange and to further protect information delivered. Currently, most security attacks target on password-based authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Passwords and PINs based Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/passwords.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=2 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531015717/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/passwords.htm |archivedate=May 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public-key authentication===
This type of authentication has two parts. One is a public key, the other is a private key. A public key is issued by a Certification Authority and is available to any user or server.  A private key is known by the user only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Public-Key Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/pkey.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531015722/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/pkey.htm |archivedate=May 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetric-key authentication===
The user shares a unique key with an authentication server. When the user sends a randomly generated message (the challenge) encrypted by the secret key to the authentication server, if the message can be matched by the server using its shared secret key, the user is authenticated.
When implemented together with the password authentication, this method also provides a possible solution for two-factor authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Symmetric-key Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/skey.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709050327/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/skey.htm |archivedate=July 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SMS-based authentication===
[[File:US-VISIT (CBP).jpg|thumb|Biometric authentication]]
The user receives password by reading the message in the cell phone, and types back the password to complete the authentication. [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) is very effective when cell phones are commonly adopted. SMS is also suitable against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, since the use of SMS does not involve the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=SMS based Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/sms.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827103712/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/sms.htm |archivedate=August 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biometric authentication ===
Biometric authentication is the use of unique physical attributes and body measurements as the intermediate for better identification and access control. Physical characteristics that are often used for authentication include fingerprints, voice recognition, face, recognition, and iris scans because all of these are unique to every individual separately. Traditionally, Biometric Authentication based on token-based identification systems, such as passport, and nowadays becomes one of the most secure identification systems to user protections. A new technological innovation which provides a wide variety of either behavioral or physical characteristics which are defining the proper concept of Biometric Authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Biometric Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/biometric.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108205213/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/biometric.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital identity authentication ===
Digital identity authentication refers to the combined use of device, behavior, location and other data, including email address, account and credit card information, to authenticate online users in real time.

==Electronic credentials==
Paper credentials are documents that attest to the identity or other attributes of an individual or entity called the subject of the credentials. Some common paper credentials include passports, [[birth certificate]]s, driver's licenses, and employee identity cards. The credentials themselves are authenticated in a variety of ways: traditionally perhaps by a signature or a seal, special papers and inks, high quality engraving, and today by more complex mechanisms, such as holograms, that make the credentials recognizable and difficult to copy or forge. In some cases, simple possession of the credentials is sufficient to establish that the physical holder of the credentials is indeed the subject of the credentials. More commonly, the credentials contain biometric information such as the subject's description, a picture of the subject or the handwritten signature of the subject that can be used to authenticate that the holder of the credentials is indeed the subject of the credentials. When these paper credentials are presented in-person, authentication [[biometrics]] contained in those credentials can be checked to confirm that the physical holder of the credential is the subject.

Electronic identity credentials bind a name and perhaps other attributes to a token. There are a variety of [[Electronic identification|electronic credential]] types in use today, and new types of credentials are constantly being created (eID, [[Voter ID laws|electronic voter ID card]], biometric passports, bank cards, etc.) At a minimum, credentials include identifying information that permits recovery of the records of the registration associated with the credentials and a name that is associated with the subscriber.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Verifiers==
In any authenticated on-line transaction, the verifier is the party that verifies that the claimant has possession and control of the token that verifies his or her identity. A claimant authenticates his or her identity to a verifier by the use of a token and an authentication protocol. This is called Proof of Possession (PoP). Many PoP protocols are designed so that a verifier, with no knowledge of the token before the authentication protocol run, learns nothing about the token from the run. The verifier and CSP may be the same entity, the verifier and [[relying party]] may be the same entity or they may all three be separate entities. It is undesirable for verifiers to learn shared secrets unless they are a part of the same entity as the CSP that registered the tokens. Where the verifier and the relying party are separate entities, the verifier must convey the result of the authentication protocol to the relying party. The object created by the verifier to convey this result is called an assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burr|first1=William|last2=Dodson|first2=Donna|last3=Polk|first3=W|title=INFORMATION SECURITY|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63/SP800-63V1_0_2.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authentication schemes==
There are four types of authentication schemes: local authentication, centralized authentication, global centralized authentication, global authentication and web application (portal).

When using a local authentication scheme, the application retains the data that pertains to the user's credentials. This information is not usually shared with other applications. The onus is on the user to maintain and remember the types and number of credentials that are associated with the service in which they need to access. This is a high risk scheme because of the possibility that the storage area for passwords might become compromised.

Using the central authentication scheme allows for each user to use the same credentials to access various services. Each application is different and must be designed with interfaces and the ability to interact with a central system to successfully provide authentication for the user. This allows the user to access important information and be able to access private keys that will allow he or she to electronically sign documents.

Using a third party through a global centralized authentication scheme allows the user direct access to authentication services. This then allows the user to access the particular services they need.

The most secure scheme is the global centralized authentication and web application (portal). It is ideal for E-Government use because it allows a wide range of services. It uses a single authentication mechanism involving a minimum of two factors to allow access to required services and the ability to sign documents.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Authentication and digital signing working together==
Often, authentication and digital signing are applied in conjunction. In [[advanced electronic signature]]s, the signatory has authenticated and uniquely linked to a signature. In the case of a [[qualified electronic signature]] as defined in the [[eIDAS]]-regulation, the signer's identity is even certified by a qualified [[trust service provider]]. This linking of signature and authentication firstly supports the probative value of the signature – commonly referred to as [[non-repudiation]] of origin. The protection of the message on the network-level is called non-repudiation of emission. The authenticated sender and the message content are linked to each other. If a 3rd party tries to change the message content, the signature loses validity.&lt;ref name="Turner-NonRep"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Understanding Non-Repudiation of Origin and Non-Repudiation of Emission|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-non-repudiation-of-origin-and-non-repudiation-of-emission|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics biometric authentication==

=== Homogenization and decoupling ===
Biometric authentication can be defined by many different procedures and sensors which are being used to produce security. Biometric can be separated into physical or behavioral security. Physical protection is based on identification through fingerprint, face, hand, iris, etc. On the other hand, behavioral safety is succeeded by keystroke, signature, and voice.&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c3e6/b094d8052137c6e91f9c89cba860d356483a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The main point is that all of these different procedures and mechanism that exist, produce the same homogeneous result, namely the security of the system and users. When thinking of the decoupling of hardware, the hardware is not coded in the same form by digitization which directly makes decoupling more difficult. Because of unlinkability and irreversibility of biometric templates, this technology can secure user authentication.

=== Digital traces ===
Biometric authentication has a substantial impact on digital traces. For example when the user decides to use his fingerprint to protect his data on his smartphone, then the system memorizes the input so it will be able to be re-used again. During this procedure and many other similar applications proves that the digital trace is vital and exist on biometric authentication.

=== Connectivity ===
Another characteristic of biometric authentication is that it combines different components such as security tokens with computer systems to protect the user. Another example is the connection between devices, such as camera and computer systems to scan the user’s retina and produce new ways of security. So biometric authentication could be defined by connectivity as long it connects different applications or components and through these users are getting connected and can work under the same roof and especially on a safe environment on the cyber world.

=== Reprogrammable &amp; smart ===
As new kinds of cybercrime are appearing, the ways of authentication must be able to adapt. This adaptation means that it is always ready for evolution and updating, and so it will be able to protect the users at any time. At first biometric authentication started in the sampler form of user’s access and defining user profiles and policies. Over time the need of biometric authentication became more complex, so cybersecurity organizations started reprogramming their products/technology from simple personal user’s access to allow interoperability of identities across multiple solutions. Through this evolution, business value also rises.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.fidis-project.eu/fileadmin/journal/issues/1-2007/Biometric_Implementations_and_the_Implications_for_Security_and_Privacy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk assessment ==
When developing electronic systems, there are some industry standards requiring United States agencies to ensure the transactions provide an appropriate level of assurance. Generally, servers adopt the US' [[Office of Management and Budget]]'s (OMB's) E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies (M-04-04) as a guideline, which is published to help federal agencies provide secure electronic services that protect individual privacy. It asks agencies to check whether their transactions require e-authentication, and determine a proper level of assurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E-Authentication Risk Assessment for Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/ecomm/e_rx/risk_assessment_dea_218.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It established four levels of assurance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radack |first1=Shirley |title=ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION:  GUIDANCE FOR SELECTING SECURE TECHNIQUES |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915011249/http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |archivedate=September 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assurance Level 1: Little or no confidence in the asserted identity's validity.&lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 2: Some confidence in the asserted identity's validity. &lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 3: High confidence in the asserted identity's validity. &lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 4: Very high confidence in the asserted identity's validity.

=== Determining assurance levels ===
The OMB proposes a five-step process to determine the appropriate assurance level for their applications:
* Conduct a risk assessment, which measures possible negative impacts. 
* Compare with the five assurance levels and decide which one suits this case.
* Select technology according to the technical guidance issued by NIST.
* Confirm the selected authentication process satisfies requirements.
* Reassess the system regularly and adjust it with changes.&lt;ref name="OMB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolten|first1=Joshua|title=Memorandum: E-Authentication Guideline for Federal Agencies|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-04.pdf|publisher=Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB)|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The required level of authentication assurance are assessed through the factors below:
* Inconvenience, distress, or damage to standing or reputation;
* Financial loss or agency liability;
* Harm to agency programs or public interests;
* Unauthorized release of sensitive information;
* Personal safety; and/or civil or criminal violations.&lt;ref name="OMB" /&gt;

=== Determining technical requirements ===
[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) guidance defines technical requirements for each of the four levels of assurance in the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radack |first1=Shirley |title=ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION:  GUIDANCE FOR SELECTING SECURE TECHNIQUES |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915011249/http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |archivedate=September 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tokens are used for proving identity. Passwords and symmetric cryptographic keys are private information that the verifier needs to protect. Asymmetric cryptographic keys have a private key (which only the subscriber knows) and a related public key.
* Identity proofing, registration, and the delivery of credentials that bind an identity to a token. This process can involve a far distance operation.
* Credentials, tokens, and authentication protocols can also be combined together to identify that a claimant is in fact the claimed subscriber. 
* An assertion mechanism that involves either a digital signature of the claimant or is acquired directly by a trusted third party through a secure authentication protocol.

==Guidelines and regulations==
Triggered by the growth of new cloud solutions and online transactions, person-to-machine and machine-to-machine identities play a significant role in identifying individuals and accessing information. According to the Office of Management and Budget in the U.S, more than $70 million was spent on identity management solutions in both 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Shawn|title=E-authentication: What IT managers will be focusing on over the next 18 months|url=https://gcn.com/articles/2013/07/31/eauthentication.aspx|website=GCN|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments use e-authentication systems to offer services and reduce time people traveling to a government office. Services ranging from applying for visas to renewing driver's licenses can all be achieved in a more efficient and flexible way. Infrastructure to support e-authentication is regarded as an important component in successful e-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agimo.gov.au/infrastructure/authentication|title=Whole of Government Information and Communications Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor coordination and poor technical design might be major barriers to electronic authentication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=27391 Breaking Barriers to eGovernment (Draft Deliverable 1b)], eGovernment unit, European Commission, August 2006. See table 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In several countries there has been established nationwide common e-authentication schemes to ease the reuse of digital identities in different electronic services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanpkiforum.jp/shiryou/e-auth_policy/overview_e-auth_v07.pdf An overview of International Initiatives in the field of Electronic Authentication], Japan PKI Forum, June 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Other policy initiatives have included the creation of frameworks for electronic authentication, in order to establish common levels of trust and possibly interoperability between different authentication schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/security-and-authentication/ Australia], [http://e-com.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ecic-ceac.nsf/en/h_gv00090e.html Canada], [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-04.pdf US] (M04-04).&lt;/ref&gt;

===US===
E-authentication is a centerpiece of the [[United States government]]'s effort to expand electronic government, or [[e-government]], as a way of making government more effective and efficient and easier to access. The e-authentication service enables users to access government services online using log-in IDs (identity credentials) from other web sites that both the user and the government  trust.

E-authentication is a government-wide partnership that is supported by the agencies that comprise the Federal CIO Council. The United States General Services Administration (GSA) is the lead agency partner. E-authentication works through an association with a trusted credential issuer, making it necessary for the user to log into the issuer's site to obtain the authentication credentials.  Those credentials or e-authentication ID are then transferred the supporting government web site causing authentication.The system was created in response a December 16, 2003  memorandum was issued through the  Office of Management and Budget.  Memorandum M04-04 Whitehouse.&lt;ref name="OMB" /&gt; That memorandum updates the guidance issued in the  ''Paperwork Elimination Act'' of 1998, 44 U.S.C. § 3504 and implements section 203 of the E-Government Act, 44 U.S.C. ch. 36.

NIST provides guidelines for digital authentication standards and does away with most knowledge-based authentication methods. A stricter standard has been drafted on more complicated passwords that at least 8 characters long or passphrases that are at least 64 characters long.&lt;ref name="NIST800-63-3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft NIST Special Publication 800-63-3: Digital Authentication Guideline|url=https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In [[Europe]], [[eIDAS]] provides guidelines to be used for electronic authentication in regards to electronic signatures and certificate services for website authentication. Once confirmed by the issuing Member State, other participating States are required to accept the user's electronic signature as valid for cross border transactions.

Under eIDAS, electronic identification refers to a material/immaterial unit that contains personal identification data to be used for authentication for an online service. Authentication is referred to as an electronic process that allows for the electronic identification of a natural or legal person. A trust service is an electronic service that is used to create, verify and validate electronic signatures, in addition to creating, verifying and validating certificates for website authentication.

Article 8 of eIDAS allows for the authentication mechanism that is used by a natural or legal person to use electronic identification methods in confirming their identity to a relying party. Annex IV provides requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication.&lt;ref name="Tuner_Understanding eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn|title=Understanding eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG|website=EUR-Lex|publisher=The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
E-authentication is a centerpiece of the Russia government's effort to expand e-government, as a way of making government more effective and efficient and easier for the Russian people to access. The e-authentication service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garant.ru/products/ipo/prime/doc/12092469/|title=Постановление Правительства РФ от 28 ноября 2011 г. N 977 "О федеральной государственной информационной системе "Единая система идентификации и аутентификации в инфраструктуре, обеспечивающей информационно-технологическое взаимодействие информационных систем, используемых для предоставления государственных и муниципальных услуг в электронной форме"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; enables users to access government services online using log-in IDs (identity credentials) they already have from web sites that they and the government trust.

== Other applications ==
Apart from government services, e-authentication is also widely used in other technology and industries. These new applications combine the features of authorizing identities in traditional database and new technology to provide a more secure and diverse use of e-authentication. Some examples are described below.

=== Mobile authentication ===
Mobile authentication is the verification of a user's identity through the use a mobile device. It can be treated as an independent field or it can also be applied with other multifactor authentication schemes in the e-authentication field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Margaret|first1=Rouse|title=mobile authentication definition|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/mobile-authentication|website=SearchSecurity.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For mobile authentication, there are five levels of application sensitivity from Level 0 to Level 4. Level 0 is for public use over a mobile device and requires no identity authentications, while level 4 has the most multi-procedures to identify users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of India Department of Electronics and Information Technology Ministry of Communications and Information Technology|title=e-Pramaan: Framework for e-Authentication|url=https://epramaan.gov.in/documents/ePramaan_Framework.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For either level, mobile authentication is relatively easy to process. Firstly, users send a one-time password (OTP) through offline channels. Then, a server identifies the information and makes adjustment in the database. Since only the user has the access to a PIN code and can send information through their mobile devices, there is a low risk of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tolentino|first1=Jamie|title=How to Increase App Security Through Mobile Phone Authentication|url=https://thenextweb.com/future-of-communications/2015/03/16/increasing-application-security-with-mobile-phone-authentication/|accessdate=3 November 2015|publisher=TNW news|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-commerce authentication ===
In the early 1980s, [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI) systems was implemented, which was considered as an early representative of E-commerce. But ensuring its security is not a significant issue since the systems are all constructed around closed networks. However, more recently, business-to-consumer transactions have transformed. Remote transacting parties have forced the implementation of E-commerce authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Matthew|title=Identity Authentication and 'E-Commerce'|journal=Warwick, Journal of Information Law &amp;Technology|date=23 Feb 2005|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/1998_3/ford/#a2|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the approaches adopted in E-commerce authentication are basically the same as e-authentication. The difference is E-commerce authentication is a more narrow field that focuses on the transactions between customers and suppliers. A simple example of E-commerce authentication includes a client communicating with a merchant server via the Internet. The merchant server usually utilizes a web server to accept client requests, a database management system to manage data and a payment gateway to provide online payment services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawma|first1=Victor|title=A New Methodology for Deriving Effective Countermeasures Design Models|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.1216&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|publisher=School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==
To keep up with the evolution of services in the digital world, there is continued need for security mechanisms. While passwords will continued to be used, it is important to rely on authentication mechanisms, most importantly multifactor authentication. As the usage of e-signatures continues to significantly expand throughout the United States, the EU and throughout the world, there is expectation that regulations such as [[eIDAS]] will eventually be amended to reflect changing conditions along with regulations in the United States.&lt;ref name="Walker-Perspectives"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Heather|title=How eIDAS affects the USA|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/how-eidas-affects-the-us|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

'''Extensible Forms Description Language''' ('''XFDL''') is a high-level [[computer language]] that facilitates defining a form as a single, stand-alone object using elements and attributes from [[XML| the Extensible Markup Language (XML)]]. Technically, it is a class of XML originally specified in a [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) Note.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-XFDL-19980902 Extensible Forms Description Language (XFDL) 4.0], W3C Note, 2 SEP 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  See Specifications below for links to the current versions of XFDL.  XFDL It offers precise control over form layout, permitting replacement of existing business/government forms with electronic documents in a human-readable, [[open standard]].

In addition to precision layout control, XFDL provides multiple page capabilities, step-by-step guided user experiences, and [[digital signature]]s.  XFDL also provides a syntax for in-line mathematical and conditional expressions and data validation constraints as well as custom items, options, and external code functions.  Current versions of XFDL (see Specifications below) are capable of providing these interactive features via open standard markup languages including XForms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xforms-20091020/ XForms 1.1], W3C Recommendation, 20 OCT 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; XPath,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116 XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0], W3C Recommendation, 16 NOV 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; XML Schema&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-1-20041028/ XML Schema Part 1: Structures Second Edition], W3C Recommendation, 28 OCT 2004;
[http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/ XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition], W3C Recommendation, 28 OCT 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and XML Signatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/ XML Signature Syntax and Processing (Second Edition)], W3C Recommendation, 10 JUN 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

XFDL not only supports multiple digital signatures, but the signatures can apply to specific sections of a form and prevent changes to signed content.

These advantages to XFDL led large organizations such as the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] to migrate to XFDL from using forms in other formats. Later, though, the lack of portable software capable of creating XFDL led them to investigate moving away from it. The Army migrated to [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] fillable [[PDF]]s in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://armypubs.army.mil/news/Memo_Army_Migrating_to_Adobe_Fillable_Forms_10Jul13_Redacted.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hacking Health''' is a social organization that pairs innovators with healthcare experts to build solutions to front-line healthcare problems through the use of emerging technology.

== History ==

The organization started off in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada in 2012 with a weekend-long hackathon to encourage collaboration between healthcare professionals and IT experts. Since then, Hacking Health events have been held in cities across Canada, the USA and internationally.

== Event Formats ==

Held over a weekend, Hacking Health [[hackathon]]s consist of 200-300 participants where designers and developers collaborate with doctors, nurses, clinic managers and other healthcare professionals to develop prototypes that can be put to test in clinics and hospitals. The event also attracts industry professionals, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.

Held typically in the evening, Hacking Health Café [[meeting|meetups]] are regular events to bring together entrepreneurs in the healthcare industry and foster relationships between technology talent and healthcare experts. These shorter, casual events help interested parties stay up-to-date on local collaborations, projects and start-ups.

A '''handheld television''' is a [[portable device]] for watching [[television]] that usually uses a [[thin-film transistor|TFT]] [[LCD]] or [[OLED]] [[color graphics|color]] display.  Many of these devices resemble [[handheld]] [[transistor radio]]s.

==History==
[[File:Sony watchman fd210.jpg|thumb|Sony Watchman]]
In the 1970s and early 1980s, [[Panasonic]] and [[Sinclair Research]] released the first TVs which were small enough to fit in a large pocket; called the Panasonic IC TV MODEL TR-001 and [[MTV-1]].  Since [[LCD]] technology was not yet mature at the time, the TV used a minuscule [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] which set the record for being the smallest CRT on a commercially marketed product.

Later in 1982, [[Sony]] released the first model of the [[Sony Watchman|Watchman]], a [[pun]] on [[Walkman]].  It had grayscale video at first.  Several years later, a color model with an [[Active-matrix liquid crystal display|active-matrix]] LCD was released.  Some [[smartphone]]s integrate a television receiver, although Internet broadband video is far more common.

Since the switch-over to digital broadcasting, handheld TVs have reduced in size and improved in quality.{{dubious|reason=See talk page|date=August 2018}}{{cn|date=August 2018}} The major current manufacturers of [[DVB-T]] standard (common throughout Europe) handheld TVs are August International, ODYS and Xoro.

==Hardware==
[[File:Pocket Television CRT.svg|thumb|Elements of a pocket television CRT: (1) Recessed Screen, (2) Electron Beam, (3) Electron Gun]]
These devices often have stereo 1⁄8 inch (3.5 mm) [[phono plug]]s for [[composite video]]-analog mono audio relay to serve them as [[composite monitor]]s; also, some models have mono 3.5 mm jacks for the broadcast signal that is usually relayed via [[F connector]] or [[Belling-Lee connector]] on standard television models. 

Some include [[HDMI]], [[USB]] and [[Secure Digital|SD]] ports.

Screen sizes vary from {{convert|1.3|to|5|in}}.  Some handheld televisions also double as portable [[DVD player]]s and [[digital video recorder|USB personal video recorders]].

==Size==
'''Portable televisions''' cannot fit in a pocket, but often run on batteries and include a [[cigarette lighter receptacle]] plug.

'''Pocket televisions''' fit in a pocket.

'''Wearable televisions''' sometimes are made in the form of a [[wristwatch]].

{{Redirect|Handoff}}

{{No footnotes|date=February 2008}}

In [[cellular network|cellular]] [[telecommunications]], the terms  '''handover''' or '''handoff''' refer to the process of transferring an ongoing call or data session from one channel connected to the [[core network]] to another channel. In [[satellite communications]] it is the process of transferring satellite control responsibility from one [[Earth station (communications)|earth station]] to another without loss or interruption of service.

==Terminology==
[[American English]]  uses the term ''handoff'', and this is most commonly used within some American organizations such as [[3GPP2]] and in American originated technologies such as [[CDMA2000]]. In [[British English]] the term ''handover'' is more common, and is used within international and European organisations such as [[ITU-T]], [[IETF]], [[ETSI]] and [[3GPP]], and standardised within European originated standards such as [[GSM]] and [[UMTS]]. The term handover is more common than handoff in academic research publications and literature, while handoff is slightly more common within the [[IEEE]] and [[ANSI]] organisations.{{or|date=November 2012}}

==Purpose==
In telecommunications there may be different reasons why a handover might be conducted:&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;[[Guowang Miao]], Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107143217}}, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* when the phone is moving away from the area covered by one cell and entering the area covered by another cell the call is transferred to the second cell in order to avoid call termination when the phone gets outside the range of the first cell;
* when the capacity for connecting new calls of a given cell is used up and an existing or new call from a phone, which is located in an area overlapped by another cell, is transferred to that cell in order to free-up some capacity in the first cell for other users, who can only be connected to that cell;
* in non-[[CDMA]] networks when the channel used by the phone becomes interfered by another phone using the same channel in a different cell, the call is transferred to a different channel in the same cell or to a different channel in another cell in order to avoid the interference;
* again in non-CDMA networks when the user behaviour changes, e.g. when a fast-travelling user, connected to a large, umbrella-type of cell, stops then the call may be transferred to a smaller macro cell or even to a micro cell in order to free capacity on the umbrella cell for other fast-traveling users and to reduce the potential interference to other cells or users (this works in reverse too, when a user is detected to be moving faster than a certain threshold, the call can be transferred to a larger umbrella-type of cell in order to minimize the frequency of the handovers due to this movement);
* in CDMA networks a handover (see further down) may be induced in order to reduce the interference to a smaller neighboring cell due to the "[[Near-far problem|near-far]]" effect even when the phone still has an excellent connection to its current cell;
* etc.

The most basic form of handover is when a [[cell phone|phone]] [[telephone call|call]] in progress is redirected from its current [[cell site|cell]] (called ''source'') to a new cell (called ''target'').&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;[[Guowang Miao]], Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107143217}}, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In terrestrial networks the source and the target cells may be served from two different cell sites or from one and the same cell site (in the latter case the two cells are usually referred to as two ''sectors'' on that cell site). Such a handover, in which the source and the target are different cells (even if they are on the same cell site) is called ''inter-cell'' handover. The purpose of inter-cell handover is to maintain the call as the subscriber is moving out of the area covered by the source cell and entering the area of the target cell.

A special case is possible, in which the source and the target are one and the same cell and only the used channel is changed during the handover. Such a handover, in which the cell is not changed, is called ''intra-cell'' handover. The purpose of intra-cell handover is to change one channel, which may be interfered or fading with a new clearer or less fading channel.

==Types==
In addition to the above classification of ''inter-cell'' and ''intra-cell'' classification of handovers, they also can be divided into hard and soft handovers:&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;[[Guowang Miao]], Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107143217}}, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Hard handover: Is one in which the channel in the source cell is released and only then the channel in the target cell is engaged. Thus the connection to the source is broken before or 'as' the connection to the target is made—for this reason such handovers are also known as ''break-before-make''. Hard handovers are intended to be instantaneous in order to minimize the disruption to the call. A hard handover is perceived by network engineers as an event during the call. It requires the least processing by the network providing service. When the mobile is between base stations, then the mobile can switch with any of the base stations, so the base stations bounce the link with the mobile back and forth. This is called 'ping-ponging'.
;[[Soft handover]]: Is one in which the channel in the source cell is retained and used for a while in parallel with the channel in the target cell. In this case the connection to the target is established before the connection to the source is broken, hence this handover is called ''make-before-break''. The interval, during which the two connections are used in parallel, may be brief or substantial. For this reason the soft handover is perceived by network engineers as a state of the call, rather than a brief event. Soft handovers may involve using connections to more than two cells:  connections to three, four or more cells can be maintained by one phone at the same time. When a call is in a state of soft handover, the signal of the best of all used channels can be used for the call at a given moment or all the signals can be combined to produce a clearer copy of the signal. The latter is more advantageous, and when such combining is performed both in the [[downlink]] ([[forward link]]) and the [[uplink]] ([[reverse link]]) the handover is termed as ''softer''. Softer handovers are possible when the cells involved in the handovers have a single cell site.
Handover can also be classified on the basis of handover techniques used. Broadly they can be classified into three types:
#Network controlled handover
#Mobile phone assisted handover
#Mobile controlled handover

==Comparison==
An advantage of the hard handover is that at any moment in time one call uses only one channel. The hard handover event is indeed very short and usually is not perceptible by the user. In the old [[analog transmission|analog]] systems it could be heard as a click or a very short beep; in digital systems it is unnoticeable. Another advantage of the hard handover is that the phone's hardware does not need to be capable of receiving two or more channels in parallel, which makes it cheaper and simpler. A disadvantage is that if a handover fails the call may be temporarily disrupted or even terminated abnormally. Technologies which use hard handovers, usually have procedures which can re-establish the connection to the source cell if the connection to the target cell cannot be made. However re-establishing this connection may not always be possible (in which case the call will be terminated) and even when possible the procedure may cause a temporary interruption to the call.

One advantage of the soft handovers is that the connection to the source cell is broken only when a reliable connection to the target cell has been established and therefore the chances that the call will be terminated abnormally due to failed handovers are lower. However, by far a bigger advantage comes from the mere fact that simultaneously channels in multiple cells are maintained and the call could only fail if all of the channels are interfered or fade at the same time. Fading and interference in different channels are unrelated and therefore the probability of them taking place at the same moment in all channels is very low. Thus the reliability of the connection becomes higher when the call is in a soft handover. Because in a cellular network the majority of the handovers occur in places of poor coverage, where calls would frequently become unreliable when their channel is interfered or fading, soft handovers bring a significant improvement to the reliability of the calls in these places by making the interference or the fading in a single channel not critical. This advantage comes at the cost of more complex hardware in the phone, which must be capable of processing several channels in parallel. Another price to pay for soft handovers is use of several channels in the network to support just a single call. This reduces the number of remaining free channels and thus reduces the capacity of the network. By adjusting the duration of soft handovers and the size of the areas in which they occur, the network engineers can balance the benefit of extra call reliability against the price of reduced capacity.

==Possibility==
While theoretically speaking soft handovers are possible in any technology, analog or digital, the cost of implementing them for analog technologies is prohibitively high and none of the technologies that were commercially successful in the past (e.g. [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]], [[TACS]], [[Nordic Mobile Telephone|NMT]], etc.) had this feature. Of the digital technologies, those based on [[FDMA]] also face a higher cost for the phones (due to the need to have multiple parallel radio-frequency modules) and those based on [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] or a combination of TDMA/FDMA, in principle, allow not so expensive implementation of soft handovers. However, none of the [[2G]] (second-generation) technologies have this feature (e.g. GSM, [[D-AMPS]]/[[IS-136]], etc.). On the other hand, all CDMA based technologies, 2G and [[3G]] (third-generation), have soft handovers. On one hand, this is facilitated by the possibility to design not so expensive phone hardware supporting soft handovers for CDMA and on the other hand, this is necessitated by the fact that without soft handovers CDMA networks may suffer from substantial interference arising due to the so-called ''[[Near-far problem|near-far]]'' effect..

In all current commercial technologies based on FDMA or on a combination of TDMA/FDMA (e.g. GSM, AMPS, IS-136/DAMPS, etc.) changing the channel during a hard handover is realised by changing the pair of used transmit/receive [[frequency|frequencies]].

==Implementations==
For the practical realisation of handovers in a cellular network each cell is assigned a list of potential target cells, which can be used for handing over calls from this source cell to them. These potential target cells are called ''neighbors'' and the list is called ''neighbor list''. Creating such a list for a given cell is not trivial and specialized computer tools are used. They implement different algorithms and may use for input data from field measurements or computer predictions of radio wave propagation in the areas covered by the cells.

During a call one or more parameters of the signal in the channel in the source cell are monitored and assessed in order to decide when a handover may be necessary. The downlink (forward link) and/or uplink (reverse link) directions may be monitored. The handover may be requested by the phone or by the [[Base transceiver station|base station]] (BTS) of its source cell and, in some systems, by a BTS of a neighboring cell. The phone and the BTSes of the neighboring cells monitor each other's signals and the best target candidates are selected among the neighboring cells. In some systems, mainly based on CDMA, a target candidate may be selected among the cells which are not in the neighbor list. This is done in an effort to reduce the probability of interference due to the aforementioned near-far effect.

In analog systems the parameters used as criteria for requesting a hard handover are usually the ''received [[signal power]]'' and the ''received [[signal-to-noise ratio]]'' (the latter may be estimated in an analog system by inserting additional tones, with frequencies just outside the captured voice-frequency band at the transmitter and assessing the form of these tones at the receiver). In non-CDMA 2G digital systems the criteria for requesting hard handover may be based on estimates of the received signal power, [[bit error rate]] (BER) and [[Block Error Rate|block error/erasure rate]] (BLER), received quality of speech ([[RxQual]]), distance between the phone and the BTS (estimated from the radio signal propagation delay) and others. In CDMA systems, 2G and 3G, the most common criterion for requesting a handover is [[Ec/Io]] ratio measured in the [[pilot channel]] ([[CPICH]]) and/or [[RSCP]].

In CDMA systems, when the phone in soft or softer handover is connected to several cells simultaneously, it processes the received in parallel signals using a [[rake receiver]]. Each signal is processed by a module called ''rake finger''. A usual design of a rake receiver in mobile phones includes three or more rake fingers used in soft handover state for processing signals from as many cells and one additional finger used to search for signals from other cells. The set of cells, whose signals are used during a soft handover, is referred to as the ''active set''. If the search finger finds a sufficiently-strong signal (in terms of high Ec/Io or RSCP) from a new cell this cell is added to the active set. The cells in the neighbour list (called in CDMA ''neighbouring set'') are checked more frequently than the rest and thus a handover with a neighbouring cell is more likely, however a handover with others cells outside the neighbor list is also allowed (unlike in GSM, IS-136/DAMPS, AMPS, NMT, etc.).

== Reasons for failure ==
There are occurrences where a handoff is unsuccessful. Much research has been dedicated to this problem.{{such as|date=June 2018}} The source of the problem was discovered in the late 1980s.  Because frequencies cannot be reused in adjacent cells, when a user moves from one cell to another, a new frequency must be allocated for the call. If a user moves into a cell when all available channels are in use, the user’s call must be terminated. Also, there is the problem of signal interference where adjacent cells overpower each other resulting in receiver desensitization.

==Vertical handover==
{{Main|Vertical handover}}

There are also inter-technology handovers where a call's connection is transferred from one access technology to another, e.g. a call being transferred from GSM to UMTS or from CDMA [[IS-95]] to [[cdma2000]].

The 3GPP [[Generic access network|UMA/GAN]] standard enables GSM/UMTS handoff to Wi-Fi and vice versa.

==Handoff Prioritization==
Different systems have different methods for handling and managing handoff request. Some systems handle handoff in same way as they handle new originating call. In such system the probability that the handoff will not be served is equal to blocking probability of new originating call. But if the call is terminated abruptly in the middle of conversation then it is more annoying than the new originating call being blocked. So in order to avoid this abrupt termination of ongoing call handoff request should be given priority to new call this is called as handoff prioritization.

There are two techniques for this:
;Guard Channel Concept: In this technique, a fraction of the total available channels in a cell is reserved exclusively for handoff request from ongoing calls which may be handed off into the cell.
;Queuing: Queuing of handoffs is possible because there is a finite time interval between the time the received signal level drops below handoff threshold and the time the call is terminated due to insufficient signal level. The delay size is determined from the traffic pattern of a particular service area.

==Inter and Intra System Handoff==
;Inter System Handoff:
*If during ongoing call mobile unit moves from one cellular system to a different cellular system which is controlled by different MTSO, a handoff procedure which is used to avoid dropping of call is referred as Inter System Handoff.
*An MTSO engages in this handoff system. When a mobile signal becomes weak in a given cell and MTSO can not find other cell within its system to which it can transfer the call then it uses Inter system handoff.
*Before implementation of Inter System Handoff MTSO compatibility must be checked and in Inter System Handoff local call may become long distance call.

;Intra System Handoff:
*If during ongoing call mobile unit moves from one cellular system to adjacent cellular system which is controlled by same  MTSO, a handoff procedure which is used to avoid dropping of call is referred as Intra System Handoff.
*An MTSO engages in this handoff system. When a mobile signal becomes weak in a given cell and MTSO finds other cell within its system to which it can transfer the call then it uses Intra system handoff.
*In Intra System Handoff local calls always remain local call only since after handoff also the call is handled by same MTSO.

[[Paper]], a thin unwoven material made from milled plant fibers, is primarily used for writing, artwork, and packaging; it is commonly white. The first [[papermaking]] process was documented in China during the [[Eastern Han]] period (25–220 CE), traditionally attributed to the court official [[Cai Lun]]. During the 8th century, Chinese papermaking spread to the [[Islamic world]], where [[pulp mill]]s and [[paper mill]]s were used for papermaking and money making. By the 11th century, papermaking was brought to Europe. By the 13th century, papermaking was refined with paper mills utilizing [[waterwheel]]s in Spain. Later European improvements to the papermaking process came in the 19th century with the invention of [[Wood pulp|wood-based]] papers.

Although precursors such as [[papyrus]] and [[amate]] existed in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean world]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian Americas]], respectively, these materials are not defined as true paper. Nor is true [[parchment]] considered paper{{efn|Confusingly, parchment ''paper'' is a treated paper used in baking, and unrelated to true parchment.}}; used principally for writing, parchment is heavily prepared animal skin that predates paper and possibly papyrus. In the twentieth century with the advent of plastic manufacture some plastic "paper" was introduced, as well as paper-plastic laminates, paper-metal laminates, and papers infused or coated with different products that give them special properties. 

==Precursors: papyrus==
[[File:Papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|In contrast to paper, papyrus has an uneven surface that visibly retains the original structure of the ribbon-like strips that make it up. As the papyrus is worked, it tends to break apart along the seams, leading to long linear cracks and eventually falling apart.]]

The word "paper" is etymologically derived from ''papyrus'', [[Ancient Greek]] for the ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' plant. [[Papyrus]] is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the ''Cyperus papyrus'' plant which was used in [[ancient Egypt]] and other [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean societies]] for [[History of writing|writing]] long before paper was used in China.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Papyrus is prepared by cutting off thin ribbon-like strips of the interior of the ''Cyperus papyrus'', and then laying out the strips side-by-side to make a sheet. A second layer is then placed on top, with the strips running at right angle to the first. The two layers are the pounded together into a sheet. The result is very strong, but has an uneven surface, especially at the edges of the strips. When used in scrolls, repeated rolling and unrolling causes the strips to come apart again, typically along vertical lines. This effect can be seen in many ancient papyrus documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper contrasts with papyrus in that the plant material is broken down through maceration or disintegration before the paper is pressed. This produces a much more even surface, and no natural weak direction in the material which falls apart over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|It is lucky chance that the date of CE 105 was recorded, because Cai Lun, the official involved, who seems to have introduced some improvements in paper manufacture, worked at the palace as a eunuch. Yet just because the new technology was not trumpeted at the time does not mean that it had no effect. On the contrary: up to this point China was lagging behind those Mediterranean societies where papyrus was used and where light, inexpensive scrolls could be created. But thereafter the advantage swung the other way, since papyrus, which is composed of organic material not as highly processed as paper, was prone to splitting and deterioration at a much greater rate; this may be why vellum eventually came to dominate, especially in the harsher climate of Northern Europe. Paper, by contrast, gave a good, uniform writing surface that could be smoothly rolled and unrolled without damage, while remaining relatively durable.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}}|T.H. Barrett}}

Archaeological evidence of [[papermaking]] predates the traditional attribution given to [[Cai Lun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; an imperial eunuch official of the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE – CE 220), thus the exact date or inventor of paper can not be deduced. The earliest extant paper fragment was unearthed at [[Fangmatan]] in [[Gansu]] province, and was likely part of a map, dated to 179–141 BCE.&lt;ref name="buisseret 1998 p12"&gt;
{{Citation|author=David Buisseret|title=Envisaging the City|year=1998|publisher=U Chicago Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBvl1wHRTX0C|page=12|isbn=978-0-226-07993-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of paper have also been found at Dunhuang dated to 65 BCE and at Yumen pass, dated to 8 BCE.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}

"Cai Lun's" invention, recorded hundreds of years after it took place, is dated to 105 CE. The innovation is a type of paper made of [[mulberry]] and other [[bast fibre]]s along with [[fishing nets]], old rags, and [[hemp]] waste which reduced the cost of paper production, which prior to this, and later, in the West, depended solely on rags.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}&lt;ref&gt;Papermaking.

===Techniques===
During the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] (1600–1050 BCE) and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (1050–256 BCE) dynasties of [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], documents were ordinarily written on bone or [[bamboo]] (on tablets or on bamboo strips sewn and rolled together into scrolls), making them very heavy, awkward, and hard to transport. The light material of [[silk]] was sometimes used as a recording medium, but was normally too expensive to consider. The [[Han dynasty]] Chinese court official [[Cai Lun]] (c. 50–121 CE) is credited as the inventor of a method of papermaking (inspired by wasps and bees) using rags and other plant fibers in 105 CE.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}} However, the discovery of specimens bearing written [[Chinese character]]s in 2006 at [[Fangmatan]] in north-east China's [[Gansu]] Province suggests that paper was in use by the ancient Chinese military more than 100 years before Cai, in 8 BCE, and possibly much earlier as the map fragment found at the Fangmatan tomb site dates from the early 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="buisseret 1998 p12"/&gt; It therefore would appear that "Cai Lun's contribution was to improve this skill systematically and scientifically, fix a recipe for papermaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-08/08/content_4937457.htm|title=eNewsletter|publisher=World Archeological Congress|date=August 2006|accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record in the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' says&lt;ref name=needham&gt;
{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=40}} uses Wade-Giles transcription&lt;/ref&gt;
:In ancient times writings and inscriptions were generally made on tablets of bamboo or on pieces of silk called chih. But silk being costly and bamboos heavy they were not convenient to use. Tshai Lun then initiated the idea of making paper from the bark of trees, remnants of hemp, rags of cloth and fishing nets. He submitted the process to the emperor in the first year of Yuan-Hsing (105 CE) and received praise for his ability. From this time, paper has been in use everywhere and is universally called the paper of Marquis Tshai.

The production process may have originated from the practice of pounding and stirring rags in water, after which the matted fibres were collected on a mat. The bark of [[paper mulberry]] was particularly valued and high quality paper was developed in the late Han period using the bark of ''tan'' (檀; [[sandalwood]]). In the [[Eastern Jin]] period a fine bamboo screen-mould treated with insecticidal dye for permanence was used in papermaking. After [[printing]] was popularized during the [[Song dynasty]] the demand for paper grew substantially. In the year 1101, 1.5 million sheets of paper were sent to the capital.&lt;ref name=needham /&gt;

===Uses===

{{quotation|Open, it stretches; closed, it rolls up. it can be contracted or expanded; hidden away or displayed.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}|Fu Xian}}

Among the earliest known uses of paper was padding and wrapping delicate bronze mirrors according to archaeological evidence dating to the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] from the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padding doubled as both protection for the object as well as the user in cases where poisonous "medicine" were involved, as mentioned in the official history of the period.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"/&gt; Although paper was used for writing by the 3rd century CE,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; paper continued to be used for wrapping (and other) purposes. [[Toilet paper]] was used in China from around the late 6th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 589, the Chinese scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531–591) wrote: "Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from [[Five Classics]] or the names of [[Wise old man|sage]]s, I dare not use for toilet purposes".&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt; An [[Arab]] traveler who visited China wrote of the curious Chinese tradition of toilet paper in 851, writing: "...&amp;nbsp;[the Chinese] do not wash themselves with water when they have done their necessities; but they only wipe themselves with paper".&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt;

During the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of [[tea]]. In the same period, it was written that tea was served from baskets with multi-colored paper cups and paper napkins of different size and shape.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt; During the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) the government produced the world's first known paper-printed money, or [[banknote]] (''see [[Jiaozi (currency)|Jiaozi]] and [[Huizi (currency)|Huizi]]''). Paper money was bestowed as gifts to government officials in special paper [[envelope]]s.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt; During the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), the first well-documented [[Europeans in Medieval China]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] merchant [[Marco Polo]] remarked how the Chinese burned paper [[effigy|effigies]] shaped as male and female servants, camels, horses, suits of clothing and armor while [[Cremation|cremating]] the dead during [[Funerary art|funerary rites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of paper===
According to Timothy Hugh Barrett, paper played a pivotal role in early Chinese written culture, and a "strong reading culture seems to have developed quickly after its introduction, despite political fragmentation."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=36}} Indeed the introduction of paper had immense consequences for the book world. It meant books would no longer have to be circulated in small sections or bundles, but in their entirety. Books could now be carried by hand rather than transported by cart. As a result individual collections of literary works increased in the following centuries.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

Textual culture seems to have been more developed in the south by the early 5th century, with individuals owning collections of several thousand scrolls. In the north an entire palace collection might have been only a few thousand scrolls in total.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=37}} By the early 6th century, scholars in both the north and south were capable of citing upwards of 400 sources in commentaries on older works.{{sfn|Barret|2008|p=37-38}} A small compilation text from the 7th century included citations to over 1,400 works.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=38}}

The personal nature of texts was remarked upon by a late 6th century imperial librarian. According to him, the possession of and familiarity with a few hundred scrolls was what it took to be socially accepted as an educated man.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=39}} 

According to Endymion Wilkinson, one consequence of the rise of paper in China was that "it rapidly began to surpass the Mediterranean empires in book production."{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}} During the Tang dynasty, China became the world leader in book production. In addition the gradual spread of [[woodblock printing]] from the late Tang and Song further boosted their lead ahead of the rest of the world.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}

{{quotation|From the fourth century CE to about 1500, the biggest library collections in China were three to four times larger than the largest collections in Europe. The imperial government book collections in the Tang numbered about 5,000 to 6,000 titles (89,000 ''juan'') in 721. The Song imperial collections at their height in the early twelfth century may have risen to 4,000 to 5,000 titles. These are indeed impressive numbers, but the imperial libraries were exceptional in China and their use was highly restricted. Only very few libraries in the Tang and Song held more than one or two thousand titles (a size not even matched by the manuscript collections of the grandest of the great cathedral libraries in Europe).{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=934}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

However despite the initial advantage afforded to China by the paper medium, by the 9th century its spread and development in the middle east had closed the gap between the two regions. Between the 9th to early 12th centuries, libraries in Cairo, Baghdad, and Cordoba held collections larger than even the ones in China, and dwarfed those in Europe. From about 1500 the maturation of paper making and printing in Southern Europe also had an effect in closing the gap with the Chinese. The Venetian [[Domenico Grimani]]'s collection numbered 15,000 volumes by the time of his death in 1523. After 1600, European collections completely overtook those in China. The Bibliotheca Augusta numbered 60,000 volumes in 1649 and surged to 120,000 in 1666. In the 1720s the Bibliotheque du Roi numbered 80,000 books and the Cambridge University 40,000 in 1715. After 1700, libraries in North America also began to overtake those of China, and toward the end of the century, [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s private collection numbered 4,889 titles in 6,487 volumes. The European advantage only increased further into the 19th century as national collections in Europe and America exceeded a million volumes while a few private collections, such as that of Lord Action, reached 70,000.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=934}}

{{quotation|European book production began to catch up with China after the introduction of the mechanical printing press in the mid fifteenth century. Reliable figures of the number of imprints of each edition are as hard to find in Europe as they are in China, but one result of the spread of printing in Europe was that public and private libraries were able to build up their collections and for the first time in over a thousand years they began to match and then overtake the largest libraries in China.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

Paper became central to the three arts of China – poetry, painting, and calligraphy. In later times paper constituted one of the 'Four Treasures of the Scholar's Studio,' alongside the brush, the ink, and the inkstone.{{sfn|Barret|2008|p=40}}

==Paper in Asia==

{{see|Dunhuang manuscripts}}

After its origin in central [[China]], the production and use of paper spread steadily. It is clear that paper was used at [[Dunhuang]] by 150 CE, in [[Loulan]] in the modern-day province of [[Xinjiang]] by 200, and in [[Turpan]] by 399.  Paper was concurrently introduced in [[Japan]] sometime between the years 280 and 610.&lt;ref&gt;DeVinne, Theo. L. ''The Invention of Printing''.

The oldest known paper document in the West is the [[Mozarab]] [[Missal of Silos]] from the 11th century, probably using paper made in the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic part of the Iberian Peninsula]]. They used [[hemp]] and [[linen]] rags as a source of fiber. The first recorded paper mill in the Iberian Peninsula was in [[Xàtiva]] in 1056.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Leslie Hills: ''Papermaking in Britain 1488–1988: A Short History.''

Papermaking reached [[Europe]] as early as 1085 in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and was firmly established in [[Xàtiva]], [[Spain]] by 1150.  It is clear that [[France]] had a paper mill by 1190, and by 1276 mills were established in [[Fabriano]], [[Italy]] and in [[Treviso]] and other northern Italian towns by 1340.  Papermaking then spread further northwards, with evidence of paper being made in [[Troyes]], [[France]] by 1348, in [[Holland]] sometime around 1340–1350, in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]] in 1320, and in [[Nuremberg]] by 1390 in a mill set up by [[Ulman Stromer]].&lt;ref name=fuller&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuller|first=Neathery Batsell|title=A Brief history of paper|year=2002|url=http://users.stlcc.edu/nfuller/paper/|accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was just about the time when the [[woodcut]] [[printmaking]] technique was transferred from fabric to paper in the [[old master print]] and [[popular prints]]. There was a paper mill in [[Switzerland]] by 1432 and the first mill in [[England]] was set up by [[John Tate (papermaker)|John Tate]] in 1490 near [[Stevenage]] in [[Hertfordshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manufactura.cz/historie.htm Historie ručního papíru&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but the first commercially successful paper mill in [[Great Britain|Britain]] did not occur before 1588 when [[John Spilman]] set up a mill near [[Dartford]] in [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartfordarchive.org.uk/technology/paper.shtml|title=Dartford, cradle of Britain's papermaking industry|accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, paper making spread to [[Poland]] by 1491, to [[Austria]] by 1498, to [[Russia]] by 1576, to the [[Netherlands]] by 1586, to [[Denmark]] by 1596, and to [[Sweden]] by 1612.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Arab prisoners who settled in a town called [[Borgo Saraceno]] in the Italian [[Province of Ferrara]] introduced [[Fabriano]] artisans in the [[Province of Ancona]]{{huh|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- is this the wrong Borgo Saraceno? they seem very far apart--&gt; the technique of making paper by hand.  At the time they were renowned for their wool-weaving and manufacture of cloth.  Fabriano papermakers considered the process of making paper by hand an art form and were able to refine the process to successfully compete with parchment which was the primary medium for writing at the time.  They developed the application of stamping hammers to reduce rags to pulp for making paper, [[sizing]] paper by means of [[animal glue]], and creating watermarks in the paper during its forming process. The Fabriano used glue obtained by boiling scrolls or scraps of animal skin to size the paper; it is suggested that this technique was recommended by the local [[tannery|tanneries]].

==Americas==

[[File:Huex_codex_1a_loc.jpg|thumb|[[Amate]] is similar to modern paper but has a more fibrous texture.]]

In the Americas, archaeological evidence indicates that a similar bark-paper writing material was used by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns no later than the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathcs.duq.edu/~tobin/maya/ The Construction of the Codex In Classic- and post classic-Period Maya Civilization] Maya Codex and Paper Making&lt;/ref&gt; Called ''[[amatl]]'' or ''[[amate]]'', it was in widespread use among [[Mesoamerican]] cultures until the [[Spanish conquest]]. The earliest sample of [[amate]] was found at [[Huitzilapa]] near the [[Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco]], Mexico, belonging to the [[shaft tomb culture]]. It is dated to 75 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Benz, Bruce; Lorenza Lopez Mestas; Jorge Ramos de la Vega (2006). "Organic Offerings, Paper, and Fibers from the Huitzilapa Shaft Tomb, Jalisco, Mexico". Ancient Mesoamerica.== 17 (2). pp. 283–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of amate is much more similar to paper than papyrus. The bark material is soaked in water, or in modern methods [[boiled]], so that it breaks down into a mass of fibres. They are then laid out in a frame and pressed into sheets. It is a true paper product in that the material is not in its original form, but the base material has much larger fibres than those used in modern papers. As a result, amate has a rougher surface than modern paper, and may dry into a sheet with hills and valleys as the different length fibres shrink.

European papermaking spread to the Americas first in [[Mexico]] by 1575 and then in [[Philadelphia]] by 1690.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Paper mills ==
{{Main|Paper mill}}
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Nuremberga.png|thumb|left|The [[Nuremberg]] paper mill, the building complex at the lower right corner, in 1493. Due to their noise and smell, paper mills were required by medieval law to be erected outside the city perimeter.]]

The use of human and animal powered mills was known to Chinese and Muslim [[papermaking|papermakers]]. However, evidence for water-powered paper mills is elusive among both prior to the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin 1985, pp. 68–73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414f."&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}: {{quote|It has also become universal to talk of paper "mills" (even of 400 such mills at [[Fes|Fez]]!), relating these to the hydraulic wonders of Islamic society in east and west.

[[Jean Gimpel]], in ''The Medieval Machine'' (the English translation of ''La Revolution Industrielle du Moyen Age''), points out that the Chinese and Muslims used only human and animal force. Gimpel goes on to say : "This is convincing evidence of how technologically minded the Europeans of that era were. Paper had traveled nearly halfway around the world, but no culture or civilization on its route had tried to mechanize its manufacture."'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general absence of the use of water-powered paper mills in Muslim papermaking prior to the 11th century is suggested by the habit of Muslim authors at the time to call a production center not a "mill", but a "paper manufactory".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}: {{quote|Indeed, Muslim authors in general call any "paper manufactory" a ''wiraqah'' – not a "mill" (''tahun'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Routledge Hill|Donald Hill]] has identified a possible reference to a water-powered [[paper mill]] in [[Samarkand]], in the 11th-century work of the Persian scholar [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]], but concludes that the passage is "too brief to enable us to say with certainty" that it refers to a water-powered paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A history of engineering in classical and medieval times|author=[[Donald Routledge Hill]]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=0-415-15291-7|pages=169–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by Halevi as evidence of Samarkand first harnessing waterpower in the production of paper, but notes that it is not known if waterpower was applied to papermaking elsewhere across the Islamic world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Christian Impurity versus Economic Necessity: A Fifteenth-Century Fatwa on European Paper|author=Leor Halevi|journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]|year=2008|volume=83|pages=917–945 [917–8]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi=10.1017/S0038713400017073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns remains sceptical, given the isolated occurrence of the reference and the prevalence of manual labour in Islamic papermaking elsewhere prior to the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414−417"&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414−417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clear evidence of a water-powered paper mill dates to 1282 in the Spanish [[Kingdom of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=417f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decree by the Christian king [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]] addresses the establishment of a royal "[[Watermill|molendinum]]", a proper hydraulic mill, in the paper manufacturing centre of [[Xàtiva]].&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."/&gt; The crown innovation was operated by the Muslim [[Mudéjar]] community in the [[Moorish]] quarter of Xàtiva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia|author=[[Thomas F.

Before the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from [[hemp]], [[linen]] and [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=PST1&gt;{{Citation |last1=Göttsching|first1=Lothar|authorlink1= |last2=Pakarinen |first2=Heikki |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Recycled Fiber and Deinking|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 7 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-07-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 12–14 |chapter= 1|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A process for removing printing inks from [[recycled paper]] was invented by German jurist [[Justus Claproth]] in 1774.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt; Today this method is called [[deinking]]. It was not until the introduction of [[wood pulp]] in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from [[ragpicker]]s.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt;

==19th-century advances in papermaking==
Although cheaper than vellum, paper remained expensive, at least in book-sized quantities, through the centuries, until the advent of steam-driven paper making machines in the 19th century, which could make paper with [[fibres]] from [[wood pulp]]. Although older machines predated it, the [[Fourdrinier machine|Fourdrinier]] papermaking machine became the basis for most modern papermaking. [[Robert brothers|Nicholas Louis Robert]] of [[Essonnes]], [[France]], was granted a patent for a continuous paper making machine in 1799. At the time he was working for [[Leger Didot]] with whom he quarrelled over the ownership of the invention. Didot sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, to meet  Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], stationers of [[London]], who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British [[patent]] 2487 on 20 October 1801. With the help particularly of [[Bryan Donkin]], a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], [[Hertfordshire]], in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers' own mill at [[Two Waters]]. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at [[St Neots]] intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop.

However, experiments with wood showed no real results in the late 18th century and at the start of the 19th century. By 1800, [[Matthias Koops]] (in London, England) further investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and in 1801 he wrote and published a book titled ''Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper.''&lt;ref&gt;Koops, Matthias. Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper. London: Printed by T. Burton, 1800.&lt;/ref&gt; His book was printed on paper made from wood shavings (and adhered together). No pages were fabricated using the pulping method (from either rags or wood). He received financial support from the royal family to make his printing machines and acquire the materials and infrastructure needed to start his printing business. But his enterprise was short lived. Only a few years following his first and only printed book (the one he wrote and printed), he went bankrupt. The book was very well done (strong and had a fine appearance), but it was very costly.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, George. Paper in the Making. Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-Operative, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison. "Koops. Matthias." Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to the year 2000, Vol. 32. London: Oxford University Press, 2004: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}} pp.30–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in the 1830s and 1840s, two men on two different continents took up the challenge, but from a totally new perspective. Both [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] and [[Charles Fenerty]] began experiments with wood but using the same technique used in paper making; instead of pulping rags, they thought about pulping wood. And at about the same time, by mid-1844, they announced their findings. They invented a machine which extracted the fibres from wood (exactly as with rags) and made paper from it. Charles Fenerty also bleached the pulp so that the paper was white. This started a new era for paper making. By the end of the 19th-century almost all printers in the [[western world]] were using wood in lieu of rags to make paper.&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the invention of the practical [[fountain pen]] and the mass-produced [[pencil]] of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary [[printing press]], wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also meant that keeping personal diaries or writing letters became possible and so, by 1850, the [[clerk (position)|clerk]], or writer, ceased to be a high-status job.

The original wood-based paper was acidic due to the use of [[alum]] and more prone to disintegrate over time, through processes known as [[slow fires]]. Documents written on more expensive rag paper were more stable. Mass-market paperback books still use these cheaper mechanical papers (see below), but book publishers can now use [[acid-free paper]] for [[hardback]] and [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] books.

==Determining provenance==
Determining the provenance of paper is a complex process that can be done in a variety of ways.  The easiest way is using a known sheet of paper as an exemplar.  Using known sheets can produce an exact identification.  Next, comparing watermarks with those contained in catalogs or trade listings can yield useful results.  Inspecting the surface can also determine age and location by looking for distinct marks from the production process.  Chemical and fiber analysis can be used to establish date of creation and perhaps location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book: A Global History|first1=Michael F.|last1= Suarez, S.J.| last2=Woudhuysen|first2=H.R.|isbn=9780199679416|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sbacAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

[[File:Wind turbine 1888 Charles Brush.jpg|thumb| [[Charles F. Brush|Charles Brush's]] windmill of 1888, used for generating electricity.]]

'''[[Wind power]]''' has been used as long as humans have put [[sailing ships|sails]] into the wind. For more than two millennia [[Windmill|wind-powered machines]] have ground grain and pumped water. Wind power was widely available and not confined to the banks of fast-flowing streams, or later, requiring sources of fuel. Wind-powered pumps drained the [[Polder#Polders and the Netherlands|polders of the Netherlands]], and in arid regions such as the [[American mid-west]] or the [[Australian outback]], [[wind pump]]s provided water for livestock and steam engines.

With the development of electric power, wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally-generated power. Throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind plants suitable for farms or residences, and larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electricity grids for remote use of power. Today wind powered generators operate in every size range between tiny plants for battery charging at isolated residences, up to near-gigawatt sized [[List of offshore wind farms|offshore wind farms]] that provide electricity to national electrical networks.

By 2014, over 240,000 commercial-sized wind turbines were operating in the world, producing 4% of the world's electricity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.gwec.net/global-figures/wind-in-numbers/ Wind in numbers], Global Wind Energy Council&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wwea2014&gt;{{cite book |author=The World Wind Energy Association |title=2014 Half-year Report |year=2014|pages=1–8 |publisher=WWEA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sailboats]] and [[sailing ship]]s have been using wind power for at least 5,500 years,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and architects have used wind-driven [[natural ventilation]] in buildings since similarly ancient times. The use of wind to provide mechanical power came somewhat later in antiquity.

The [[Babylonia]]n emperor [[Hammurabi]] planned to use wind power for his ambitious irrigation project in the 17th century BC.&lt;ref name="Sathyajith2006"&gt;

The first practical [[windmill]]s were in use in [[Sistan]], a region in [[Iran]] and bordering [[Afghanistan]], at least by the 9th century and possibly as early as the 7th century. These "[[Panemone windmill]]s" were horizontal windmills,{{ref|a|[note 1]}} which had long vertical [[driveshaft]]s with six to twelve rectangular [[Windmill sail|sail]]s covered in reed matting or cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1986).

&lt;/ref&gt; The use of windmills became widespread across the Middle East and Central Asia, and later spread to China and [[Indian subcontinent|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p. 64-69.

Wind-powered [[Automaton|automata]] are known from the mid-8th century: wind-powered [[statue]]s that "turned with the wind over the domes of the four gates and the palace complex of the Round City of [[Baghdad]]". The "Green Dome of the palace was surmounted by the statue of a horseman carrying a lance that was believed to point toward the enemy. This public spectacle of wind-powered statues had its private counterpart in the '[[Abbasid]] palaces where automata of various types were predominantly displayed."&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Campo de Criptana Molinos de Viento 1.jpg|thumb|The vertical windmills of [[Campo de Criptana]] were immortalized in chapter VIII of [[Don Quixote]].]]
The first windmills in [[Europe]] appear in sources dating to the twelfth century. These early European windmills were  [[post mill|sunk post mills]]. The earliest certain reference to a windmill dates from 1185, in Weedley, Yorkshire, although a number of earlier but less certainly dated twelfth-century European sources referring to windmills have also been adduced.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White Jr., ''Medieval technology and social change'' (Oxford, 1962) p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is sometimes argued that [[the Crusades|crusaders]] may have been inspired by windmills in the Middle East, this is unlikely since the European vertical windmills were of significantly different design than the horizontal windmills of Afghanistan. Lynn White Jr., a specialist in medieval European technology, asserts that the European windmill was an "independent invention;" he argues that it is unlikely that the Afghanistan-style horizontal windmill had spread as far west as the Levant during the Crusader period.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White Jr. ''Medieval technology and social change'' (Oxford, 1962) p. 86-87, 161-162.&lt;/ref&gt;  In medieval England rights to waterpower sites were often confined to nobility and clergy, so wind power was an important resource to a new middle class.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Energy Encyclopedia Vol. 6'', page 420&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, windmills, unlike water mills, were not rendered inoperable by the freezing of water in the winter.

By the 14th century Dutch [[windmill]]s were in use to drain areas of the [[Rhine River]] delta.

The first wind turbine used for the production of electricity was built in Scotland in July 1887 by [[Prof James Blyth]] of [[Anderson's College]], Glasgow (the precursor of [[Strathclyde University]]).&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price |first=Trevor J |title=James Blyth - Britain's First Modern Wind Power Engineer |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mscp/wind/2005/00000029/00000003/art00002 |journal=Wind Engineering |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=191–200 |date=3 May 2005 |doi=10.1260/030952405774354921 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Blyth's 10 m high, cloth-sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at [[Marykirk]] in [[Kincardineshire]] and was used to charge [[accumulator (energy)|accumulator]]s developed by the Frenchman [[Camille Alphonse Faure]], to power the lighting in the cottage,&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; thus making it the first house in the world to have its electricity supplied by wind power.&lt;ref name="Shackleton"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Blyth offered the surplus electricity to the people of Marykirk for lighting the main street, however, they turned down the offer as they thought electricity was "the work of the devil."&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; Although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;

Across the Atlantic, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] a larger and heavily engineered machine was designed and constructed in the winter of 1887-1888 by [[Charles F. Brush]],&lt;ref&gt;[Anon, 1890, 'Mr. Brush's Windmill Dynamo', Scientific American, vol 63 no. 25, 20 December, p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt; this was built by his engineering company at his home and operated from 1886 until 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windpower.org/en/pictures/brush.htm A Wind Energy Pioneer: Charles F.

Accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brush wind turbine had a rotor 17 m (56 foot) in diameter and was mounted on an 18 m (60 foot) tower. Although large by today's standards, the machine was only rated at 12&amp;nbsp;kW; it turned relatively slowly since it had 144 blades. The connected dynamo was used either to charge a bank of batteries or to operate up to 100 [[incandescent light bulb]]s, three arc lamps, and various motors in Brush's laboratory. The machine fell into disuse after 1900 when electricity became available from Cleveland's central stations, and was abandoned in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in Cutler J. Cleveland,(ed) ''Encyclopedia of Energy Vol.6'', Elsevier, {{ISBN|978-1-60119-433-6}}, 2007, pp. 421-422&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 [[Denmark|Danish]] scientist, [[Poul la Cour]], constructed a wind turbine to generate electricity, which was used to produce [[hydrogen]]&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; by [[electrolysis]] to be stored for use in experiments and to light the Askov High school. He later solved the problem of producing a steady supply of power by inventing a regulator, the Kratostate, and in 1895 converted his windmill into a prototype electrical power plant that was used to light the village of Askov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historybecauseitshere.weebly.com/poul-la-cour-pioneered-wind-mill-power-in-denmark.html|title=Poul la Cour Pioneered Wind Mill Power in Denmark|last=Warnes|first=Kathy|work=History, because it's there|accessdate=20 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129092021/http://historybecauseitshere.weebly.com/poul-la-cour-pioneered-wind-mill-power-in-denmark.html|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark there were about 2,500 windmills by 1900, used for mechanical loads such as pumps and mills, producing an estimated combined peak power of about 30 MW.

In the American midwest between 1850 and 1900, a large number of small windmills, perhaps six million, were installed on farms to operate irrigation pumps.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Encyclopedia of Energy'',pg. 421&lt;/ref&gt;  Firms such as Star, Eclipse, [[Fairbanks-Morse]], and [[Aeromotor]] became famed suppliers in North and South America.

== 20th century ==

Development in the 20th century might be usefully divided into the periods:
* 1900–1973, when widespread use of individual wind generators competed against fossil fuel plants and centrally-generated electricity
* 1973–onward, when the [[1973 oil crisis|oil price crisis]] spurred investigation of non-petroleum energy sources.

=== 1900–1973 ===

==== Danish development ====
In Denmark wind power was an important part of a decentralized electrification in the first quarter of the 20th century, partly because of Poul la Cour from his first practical development in 1891 at Askov. By 1908 there were 72 wind-driven electric generators from 5&amp;nbsp;kW to 25&amp;nbsp;kW. The largest machines were on 24&amp;nbsp;m (79&amp;nbsp;ft) towers with four-bladed 23&amp;nbsp;m (75&amp;nbsp;ft) diameter rotors.&lt;ref name=EncycEnergy /&gt; In 1957 [[Johannes Juul]] installed a 24 m diameter [[Gedser wind turbine|wind turbine at Gedser]], which ran from 1957 until 1967.  This was a three-bladed, horizontal-axis, upwind, stall-regulated turbine similar to those now used for commercial wind power development.&lt;ref name=EncycEnergy&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Encyclopedia of Energy Vol. 6'', page 426&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Farm power and isolated plants ====
In 1927 the brothers Joe Jacobs and Marcellus Jacobs opened a factory, [[Jacobs Wind]] in [[Minneapolis]] to produce wind turbine generators for farm use.  These would typically be used for lighting or battery charging, on farms out of reach of central-station electricity and distribution lines. In 30 years the firm produced about 30,000 small wind turbines, some of which ran for many years in remote locations in Africa and on the [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] expedition to [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Energy Encyclopedia vol. 6'', page 422&lt;/ref&gt; Many other manufacturers produced small wind turbine sets for the same market, including companies called Wincharger, Miller Airlite, Universal Aeroelectric, Paris-Dunn, Airline and Winpower.

In 1931 the [[Darrieus wind turbine]] was invented, with its [[Wind turbine#Vertical axis design|vertical axis]] providing a different mix of design tradeoffs from the conventional horizontal-axis wind turbine. The vertical orientation accepts wind from any direction with no need for adjustments, and the heavy generator and gearbox equipment can rest on the ground instead of atop a tower.

By the 1930s windmills were widely used to generate electricity on farms in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed. Used to replenish battery storage banks, these machines typically had generating capacities of a few hundred watts to several kilowatts. Beside providing farm power, they were also used for isolated applications such as [[cathodic protection|electrifying]] bridge structures to prevent corrosion. In this period, high tensile steel was cheap, and windmills were placed atop prefabricated open steel [[lattice tower]]s.

The most widely used small wind generator produced for American farms in the 1930s was a two-bladed horizontal-axis machine manufactured by the Wincharger Corporation. It had a peak output of 200 watts. Blade speed was regulated by curved air brakes near the hub that deployed at excessive rotational velocities. These machines were still being manufactured in the United States during the 1980s. In 1936, the U.S. started a [[Rural Utilities Service|rural electrification]] project that killed the natural market for wind-generated power, since network power distribution provided a farm with more dependable usable energy for a given amount of capital investment.

In Australia, the Dunlite Corporation built hundreds of small wind generators to provide power at isolated postal service stations and farms. These machines were manufactured from 1936 until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pearen.ca/dunlite/Dunlite.htm Dunlite history page Retrieved 28 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Utility-scale turbines ====
[[File:Wind turbine 1941.jpg|thumb|The world's first megawatt-sized wind turbine near Grandpa's Knob Summit,&lt;!-- yes, this is the real name for the [http://www.mountainzone.com/mountains/detail.asp?fid=3618456 mountain] the turbine was built on -see the citation- --&gt;, [[Castleton, Vermont]].&lt;ref name=NP /&gt;]]
[[File:Eolienne 006 02.jpg|thumb|right|Experimental wind turbine at [[Nogent-le-Roi]], France, 1955.]]

A forerunner of modern horizontal-axis utility-scale wind generators was the WIME D-30 in service in [[Balaklava]], near [[Yalta]], [[USSR]] from 1931 until 1942. This was a 100&amp;nbsp;kW generator on a 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) tower, connected to the local 6.3 kV distribution system. It had a three-bladed 30 metre rotor on a steel lattice tower.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Hau, ''Wind turbines: fundamentals, technologies, application, economics'', Birkhäuser, 2006 {{ISBN|3-540-24240-6}}, page 32, with a photo&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reported to have an annual [[load factor (electrical)|load factor]] of 32 per cent,&lt;ref&gt;Alan Wyatt, Electric Power: Challenges and Choices,(1986),Book Press Ltd., Toronto, {{ISBN|0-920650-00-7}} , page NN&lt;/ref&gt; not much different from current wind machines.&lt;ref&gt;See also Robert W. Righter ''Wind energy in America: a history'' page 127 which gives a slightly different description.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 the [[Smith-Putnam wind turbine|world's first megawatt-size wind turbine]] was connected to the local electrical distribution system on the mountain known as Grandpa's Knob in [[Castleton, Vermont]], United States. It was designed by [[Palmer Cosslett Putnam]] and manufactured by the S. Morgan Smith Company.  This 1.25 MW Smith-Putnam turbine operated for 1100 hours before a blade failed at a known weak point, which had not been reinforced due to war-time material shortages. No similar-sized unit was to repeat this "bold experiment" for about forty years.&lt;ref name=NP&gt;[http://www.noblepower.com/our-windparks/GrandpasKnob/documents/07.09.12-NEP-GPKHistoryHandout-G.pdf The Return of Windpower to Grandpa's Knob and Rutland County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828170455/http://www.noblepower.com/our-windparks/GrandpasKnob/documents/07.09.12-NEP-GPKHistoryHandout-G.pdf |date=28 August 2008 }}, Noble Environmental Power, LLC, 12 November 2007.

==== Fuel-saving turbines ====
During the [[Second World War]], small wind generators were used on German U-boats to recharge submarine batteries as a fuel-conserving measure. In 1946 the [[Great Tower Neuwerk|lighthouse]] and residences on the island of [[Neuwerk]] were partly powered by an 18&amp;nbsp;kW wind turbine 15 metres in diameter, to economize on diesel fuel. This installation ran for around 20 years before being replaced by a submarine cable to the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri R. Stein, '' Pioneer in the North Sea: 1946 Insel Neuwerk Turbine'', in ''IEEE Power and Energy Magazine'', September/October 2009, pp. 62-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The Station d'Etude de l'Energie du Vent at [[Nogent-le-Roi]] in France operated an experimental 800 KVA wind turbine from 1956 to 1966.&lt;ref name="cavey2004"&gt;

=== 1973–2000 ===

==== US development ====
From 1974 through the mid-1980s the United States government worked with industry to advance the technology and enable large commercial wind turbines. The [[NASA wind turbines]] were developed under a program to create a utility-scale wind turbine industry in the U.S. With funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] and later the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE), a total of 13 experimental wind turbines were put into operation, in four major wind turbine designs. This research and development program pioneered many of the multi-megawatt turbine technologies in use today, including: steel tube towers, variable-speed generators, composite blade materials, partial-span pitch control, as well as aerodynamic, structural, and acoustic engineering design capabilities. The large wind turbines developed under this effort set several world records for diameter and power output. The MOD-2 wind turbine cluster of three turbines produced 7.5 megawatts of power in 1981. In 1987, the MOD-5B was the largest single wind turbine operating in the world with a rotor diameter of nearly 100 meters and a rated power of 3.2 megawatts.  It demonstrated an availability of 95 percent, an unparalleled level for a new first-unit wind turbine. The MOD-5B had the first large-scale variable speed drive train and a sectioned, two-blade rotor that enabled easy transport of the blades. The 4 megawatt WTS-4 held the world record for power output for over 20 years. Although the later units were sold commercially, none of these two-bladed machines were ever put into mass production. When oil prices declined by a factor of three from 1980 through the early 1990s,&lt;ref name=OilHistory&gt;[[Price of petroleum]],&lt;/ref&gt; many turbine manufacturers, both large and small, left the business. The commercial sales of the NASA/Boeing Mod-5B, for example, came to an end in 1987 when Boeing Engineering and Construction announced they were "planning to leave the market because low oil prices are keeping windmills for electricity generation uneconomical."&lt;ref name=BoeingLeaves&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1987/8701230009.asp{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Hawaiians get Boeing's Last Wind Machine Makani Ho'Olapa will Bring Power to 1,140 Residences'' 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in the 1980s, [[California]] provided [[tax rebate]]s for wind power. These rebates funded the first major use of wind power for utility electricity. These machines, gathered in large wind parks such as at [[Altamont Pass]] would be considered small and un-economic by modern wind power development standards.

====Danish development====

A giant change took place in 1978 when the world's [[:da:Vindkraftværket Tvindkraft|first multi-megawatt wind turbine]] was constructed. It pioneered many technologies used in modern wind turbines and allowed Vestas, Siemens and others to get the parts they needed. Especially important was the novel wing construction using help from German aeronautics specialists. The power plant was capable of delivering 2MW, had a tubular tower, pitch controlled wings and three blades. It was built by the teachers and students of the Tvind school. Before completion these "amateurs" were much ridiculed. The turbine still runs today and looks almost identical to the newest most modern mills.

Danish commercial wind power development stressed incremental improvements in capacity and efficiency based on extensive serial production of turbines, in contrast with development models requiring extensive steps in unit size based primarily on theoretical extrapolation.  A practical consequence is that all commercial wind turbines resemble the ''Danish model'', a light-weight three-blade upwind design.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gipe '' Wind Energy Comes of Age'', John Wiley and Sons, 1995 {{ISBN|0-471-10924-X}}, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

All major [[Wind turbine#Horizontal axis|horizontal axis]] turbines today rotate the same way (clockwise) to present a coherent view. However, early turbines rotated counter-clockwise like the old windmills, but a shift occurred from 1978 and on. The individualist-minded [[Wind turbine design#Blades|blade]] supplier Økær made the decision to change direction in order to be distinguished from the [[collective]] [[Tvind]] and their small wind turbines. Some of the blade customers were companies that later evolved into [[Vestas]], [[Siemens]], [[Enercon]] and [[Nordex]]. Public demand required that all turbines rotate the same way, and the success of these companies made clockwise the new standard.&lt;ref name="woc77-81"&gt;Grove-Nielsen, Erik. [http://www.windsofchange.dk/WOC-77-81.php Økær Vind Energi 1977 - 1981] ''Winds of Change''. Retrieved: 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Self-sufficiency and back-to-the-land ====
In the 1970s many people began to desire a self-sufficient life-style. [[Solar cell]]s were too expensive for small-scale electrical generation, so some turned to windmills. At first they built ad-hoc designs using wood and automobile parts. Most people discovered that a reliable wind generator is a moderately complex engineering project, well beyond the ability of most amateurs. Some began to search for and rebuild farm wind generators from the 1930s, of which Jacobs Wind Electric Company machines were especially sought after. Hundreds of Jacobs machines were reconditioned and sold during the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Following experience with reconditioned 1930s wind turbines, a new generation of American manufacturers started building and selling small wind turbines not only for battery-charging but also for interconnection to electricity networks. An early example would be Enertech Corporation of Norwich, Vermont, which began building 1.8&amp;nbsp;kW models in the early 1980s.

In the 1990s, as aesthetics and durability became more important, turbines were placed atop tubular steel or reinforced concrete towers. Small generators are connected to the tower on the ground, then the tower is raised into position. Larger generators are hoisted into position atop the tower and there is a ladder or staircase inside the tower to allow technicians to reach and maintain the generator, while protected from the weather.

== 21st century ==
[[File:Wind turbine size increase 1980-2011.png|thumb|Size comparison of modern wind turbines]]

As the 21st century began, fossil fuel was still relatively cheap, but rising concerns over [[energy security]], [[global warming]], and eventual [[peak oil|fossil fuel depletion]] led to an expansion of interest in all available forms of [[renewable energy]]. The fledgling commercial wind power industry began expanding at a robust growth rate of about 25% per year, driven by the ready availability of large wind resources, and falling costs due to improved technology and wind farm management.&lt;ref name=re&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/03/btm-forecasts-340-gw-of-wind-by-2013?src=rss |title=BTM Forecasts 340-GW of Wind Energy by 2013 |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steady run-up in [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil prices after 2003]] led to increasing fears that [[peak oil]] was imminent, further increasing interest in commercial wind power. Even though wind power generates electricity rather than liquid fuels, and thus is not an immediate substitute for petroleum in most applications (especially transport), fears over petroleum shortages only added to the urgency to expand wind power. Earlier oil crises had already caused many utility and industrial users of petroleum to shift to [[coal]] or [[natural gas]]. Wind power showed potential for replacing natural gas in electricity generation on a cost basis.

===Floating wind turbine technology===
Offshore wind power began to expand beyond fixed-bottom, shallow-water turbines beginning late in the first decade of the 2000s.  The world's first operational deep-water ''large-capacity'' [[floating wind turbine]], Hywind, became operational in the [[North Sea]] off Norway in late 2009&lt;ref name=BBC20090908&gt;

These floating turbines are a very different construction technology—closer to floating oil rigs rather—than traditional fixed-bottom, shallow-water [[monopile foundation]]s that are used in the other large [[offshore wind farm]]s to date.

By late 2011, Japan announced plans to build a multiple-unit floating wind farm, with six 2-megawatt turbines, off the [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima coast]] of northeast Japan where the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster]] has created a scarcity of electric power.&lt;ref name=bb20110916&gt;

===Airborne turbines===
{{see also|High altitude wind power}}
Airborne wind energy systems use airfoils or [[Airborne wind turbine|turbines supported in the air]] by buoyancy or by aerodynamic lift. The purpose is to eliminate the expense of tower construction, and allow extraction of wind energy from steadier, faster, winds higher in the atmosphere. As yet no grid-scale plants have been constructed.

==Notes==
#{{Note|a}}The terms "horizontal" and "vertical" refer to the plane of rotation of the sails. Modern wind turbines are generally referred to by the plane of rotation of the main axle (windshaft). Thus a horizontal mill may also be described as a "vertical-axis windmill" and a vertical mill may also be described as a "horizontal-axis windmill".

'''husITa''' (Human Services Information Technology Applications) is an international virtual association{{spnd}}and a registered US non-profit organization{{spnd}}established with the mission of promoting the ethical and effective use of [[information technology]] in the [[human services]]. The main focus of husITa, and the claim to expertise of its associates, is situated at the intersection of three core domains: [[information technology]], [[human services]], and [[social development]]. husITa pursues its mission through international conferences, publications and research dissemination directed at technology applications and innovations that promote social well-being.

For much of its early history husITa operated as an informal international network of human service academics and practitioners. One of the outcomes of its first international conference{{spnd}}husITa1 held in 1987 in [[Birmingham]], England{{spnd}}was the establishment of a working group to determine the feasibility of an international body 'to highlight the importance of human service computing, to guide developments, and to foster international co-operation'.

The working group was composed of Hein de Graaf (Netherlands), Walter LaMendola (USA), Dick Schoech (USA), and Stuart Toole (UK). Initial projects identified by the working group included the development of research agendas, position papers, repositories of information, and promoting a second husITa conference in 1989.  Bryan Glastonbury was later added to the group as secretary. The working group met in Colorado, Denver for three days in May 1988 and published a report on the issues that a husITa international organization would need to address.&lt;ref&gt;See Report of the husITa working group, Computer Use in Social Services Network Newsletter, Fall, 1998, Vol 8/3, pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the 1988 Denver meeting agreed its objectives, husITa wasn't formally established as an organization for another twelve years. The structure of the formal organization was later agreed to at Denver in 2000. The founding members at the Denver 2000 meeting were: Hein de Graaf, Walter LaMendola, Rob MacFadden, Jo Ann Regan, Jackie Rafferty, Jan Steyaert, Dick Schoech, Stuart Toole, and Victor Savtschenko.

== Objectives ==
husITa's objectives (agreed by the 1988 Denver working group) are to:
* Facilitate international cooperation in human service technology.
* Collect and disseminate information on human service technology, including tackling the problems of language translation.
* Provide technical assistance in human service technology and encourage the involvement of countries with a less developed human service IT infrastructure.
* Stimulate international discussion on key human service technology issues and encourage position papers in areas such as security/privacy/confidentiality, curriculum content and teaching methods, and ethical issues in systems/software development and use.
* Encourage publications about human service information technology.
* Encourage international research efforts.
* Encourage standards for making human service technology culturally independent.

== Journal of Technology in Human Services ==
The [http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=wths20 ''Journal of Technology in Human Services''] is the official journal of husITa.

== Related human service technology initiatives ==
husITa was built on the activity of an international  network of human service organizations, academics and practitioners in the USA, the UK and the Netherlands. The section below highlights some of the key organizations, people and events.

=== Early developments ===

In 1978, Gunther R. Geiss, aprofessor of social work at [[Adelphi University]], New York, conducted a survey of US schools of [[social work]]. The survey sought to identify faculty members who had used computers in their administrative, teaching or research activities, or who had consulted or participated in the design and development of computer-based information systems. There were over 80 positive responses indicating a wide range of activities and levels of involvement. The survey initiated the development of a system to track and communicate with individuals with expertise in computers and human services.

Walter LaMendola, professor of social work at the [[University of Denver]] in Colorado, described an incident during a social work conference in 1979 suggesting early indications of the resistance of some social work professionals to computer use in the human services.&lt;ref&gt;Walter LaMendola discusses '[http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/schoech/cussn/stories.htm crowd resistance]' to a human services computer presentation in 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a theme which has continued throughout the history of technology use in the human services and continues to the present day. Some aspects of this resistance can be considered as a well-founded concern about the ethical issues surrounding human service technology applications. However, other aspects of technology resistance seem to be a less rational form of [[Neo-Luddism]].

=== Computer Use in Social Services Network (CUSSN) ===
Growing interest in the use of technology in the human services led a group of US human service technology specialists, meeting at a [http://www.cswe.org/ Council of Social Work Education] conference in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] Kentucky in 1981, to form the Computer Use In Social Services Network ([http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/schoech/cussn/cussn/index.htm CUSSN]). By the end of 1981 the network had over 350 members. The CUSSN newsletter continued in print until 1992 when it was merged with the first academic journal on human service technology ''Computers in Human Services''.

In 1984 Gunther Geiss was sponsored by the [http://www.socialservicegrants.org/silbermanfund.html Silberman Fund] to organize the Wye Plantation Conference on Human Services Technology. Conference members developed pre-conference position papers via EYES: a centralized email system.&lt;ref&gt;Papers from the Wye Plantation Conference were published in [https://www.amazon.com/Human-Edge-Information-Technology-Helping/dp/0866564047/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350877770&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=0866564047 Geiss &amp; Viswanathan (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, CUSSN developed CUSSNet [http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-17472-001 CUSSNet], a PC and [[FidoNet]] based networking system that automatically exchanged emails between members each night during off-peak telephone hours. [[FidoNet]] was a PC distributed email, bulletin board, and file sharing system that preceded the Internet. CUSSNet quickly developed nodes in major cities in the US, the UK, and the Netherlands.

The name husITa (Human Service Information Technology Applications) was coined in 1983 by Walter LaMendola and Brian Klepinger at the [[University of Denver]].

The Human Service [[Microcomputer]] Conference was held in [[Seattle]].

=== Computer Applications in Social Work (CASW) ===
In 1984 Stuart Toole formed Computer Applications in Social Work (CASW) in the UK to set up and run national conferences and to publish the CASW journal.

Based on the success of the first UK technology conferences, Stuart Toole, Walter LaMendola, and Brian Klepinger agreed to pursue an international conference in 1987: this conference was to become HUSITA's first international conference HUSITA1.

The CASW  journal was later renamed [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/chst/projects/nths_archive/default.htm New Technology in the Human Services] in [when] and continued in publication under this title until it was closed in 2003.

In 1986 the second UK conference held on [[social welfare]] computing was held.

=== The Centre for Human Service Technology (CHST) ===
In 1985 Bryan Glastonbury, from the University of Southampton published ''Computers in Social Work'', the first major academic text on technology and human services.&lt;ref&gt;Glastonbury, B. (1985). Computers in Social Work. London, England: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the [[University of Southampton]] began publishing the journal New Technology in the Human Services under the editorship of Bryan Glastonbury. In the same year the University of Southampton established the Centre for Human Service Technology (CHST) with Jackie Rafferty as Director. In 2007, Jan Steyaert joined as adjunct research professor and together they edited a special issue of the British Journal of Social Work on ''social work in the digital age''.
The [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/chst/ Centre for Human Service Technology] is based at the University of Southampton in England. CHST is an international, multi-disciplinary research center focused on influencing the appropriate use of technology in social work practice and education and researching its implementation and impact.

In July 1997 the CTI Centre for Human Services held a conference on ''Social Services and Learning Technology''  hosted by the Institute for Health and Community Services at the University of Bournemouth.

In 2003 the journal New Technology in Human Services ceased publication.

=== The European Network for Information Technology in Human Services (ENITH) ===
In 1986 Hein de Graaf, Director of the CREON foundation in the Netherlands, organised the first of a series of three-day gatherings. The CREON foundation was a Dutch foundation for computer research, expertise and support in field of the human services. The gatherings, called WELCOM, were designed to increase the knowledge and understanding of information technology in the Dutch human services. WELCOM1 was held in 1986 in [[Bussum]] with Walter LaMendola as the main international speaker. WELCOM2, a smaller Dutch-only conference, took place in 1987, again in [[Bussum]]. The next WELCOM event, WELCOM3: a combined conference and fair,  was held jointly with HUSITA3 in [[Maastricht]] in 1993.

Following the success of HUSITA's first international conference held in Birmingham in 1987 the Dutch Ministry of Social Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs organized an informal meeting of European experts in the field of Information Technology and Human Services.  The meeting was one of the outcomes of a feasibility study carried out by the CREON foundation, concerning international cooperation in this field.  A main conclusion of this feasibility study was that an international (European) network should be established for the exchange of products, ideas, expertise, experiences and skills with respect to the introduction and use of IT in the human services.  As a first step in this approach the informal meeting of experts was organized.  The European network of organizations was called ENITH (European Network Information Technology and Human services).&lt;ref&gt;This [http://wweb.uta.edu/projects/sswtech/husita/history/ENITH_experts.htm report of an Expert Meeting] held by the Dutch Ministry of Social Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs details the early work of ENITH.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 an ENITH3 Expert Meeting on “IT Applications and the Quality of Life and Services” was held in The Netherlands.

In 1994, from September 21 to September 23 an  ENITH4 conference was held in [[Berlin]], Germany. Bernd kolleck chaired this conference.

In September 1995 a CAUSA5/ENITH5 conference on “The Impact of Information Technology on Social Policy,” was held in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Jan Steyaert chaired this conference.

The '''iControlPad''' is a [[wireless]] [[game controller]] compatible with a variety of [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]], and [[personal computer]]s. It is designed for use as either a standalone [[gamepad]] or attached to appropriately sized devices, such as the [[iPhone]], using a clamp system.&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gadgetoid.com/2011/07/09/icontrolpad-review/|title=iControlPad Review|publisher=Gadgetoid|date=July 9, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, the iControlPad is able to add traditional physical gaming controls to devices which otherwise rely on inputs such as [[touchscreen]]s and [[accelerometer]]s.&lt;ref name="MobileMagReal"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobilemag.com/2008/12/23/game-for-real-with-iphone-icontrolpad/ | title = Game for Real with iPhone iControlPad | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Kwan | first = Michael | date = 2008-12-23 | work = [[Mobile Magazine]] | publisher = Pilato Private Consulting | quote = Naturally, you’ll still be able to take advantage of anything on the touchscreen [...] using the accelerometer, but having “real” gaming controls is a great option as well.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The iControlPad's input controls include an eight-directional [[D-pad]], dual [[analog stick|analog nubs]], six digital face buttons, and two digital trigger buttons on the gamepad's reverse. The sides of the iControlPad are detachable, with two different attachment types: rubber grips, for using the controller as a standard wireless gamepad; or plastic clamps, for connecting with a suitable handheld, such as a smartphone or [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt; A [[mini USB]] port on the bottom of the iControlPad can be used to charge the internal 1500mAh battery, update the device's [[firmware]], and charge attached devices using a [[USB On-The-Go]] connection and an appropriate adapter.&lt;ref name="iCPManual" /&gt;

The iControlPad, a [[Bluetooth]] device, can be run in a wide variety of modes, including as a [[Human interface device|HID]] [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], [[joystick]], and gamepad, among others, allowing compatibility with equipment which is limited to only certain types of input.&lt;ref name="iCPManual" /&gt; One of the iControlPad's modes mimics the protocol used by the [[iCade]], an [[Video game arcade cabinet|arcade cabinet]] released for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]], facilitating compatibility between apps designed for the iCade and the iControlPad hardware.&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt;

Due to the iControlPad's ability to operate as a Bluetooth keyboard&amp;mdash;by mapping the D-pad and buttons to standard keyboard keys&amp;mdash;it is able to communicate with devices such as those running Apple's [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], including the iPhone and iPad, which do not support Bluetooth gamepads.&lt;ref name="148Physical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.148apps.com/news/gaming-ios-physical-variety-external-joystick-gamepad-solutions/|title=Gaming on iOS is About to Get Physical With a Variety of External Joystick and Gamepad Solutions.|publisher=148Apps|first=Carter|last=Dotson|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since iOS natively supports keyboards, apps can be developed with iControlPad compatibility using either its own protocol or that of the iCade. Thus, the iControlPad is able to control [[video games]] and [[video game console emulator]]s across multiple platforms.&lt;ref name="DroidReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.droidgamers.com/index.php/game-news/hardware-a-devices/1493-icontrolpad-for-android-review-its-as-easy-as-a-b-x-y-|title=iControlPad for Android Review: It's as easy as A, B, X, Y...|publisher=DroidGamers|first=Tom|last=Grace|date=April 13, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Development of the iControlPad began in 2007,{{Specify|date=July 2011}} with testing using a hacked [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] gamepad to connect to an iPhone over the [[Dock Connector#Apple 30-pin dock connector|dock connection]].&lt;ref name="iCPArchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icontrolpad.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316081844/http://www.icontrolpad.com/|archivedate=March 16, 2009|title=iControlPad - Add real gaming controls to your iPhone!|publisher=iControlPad Ltd|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the serial connection was working, the first prototype iControlPad was produced, using a design styled after the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]. This earliest concept was a one-piece case enveloping the iPhone, with a [[D-pad]] on the left side, and four face buttons on the right in a landscape orientation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2008/12/23/icontrolpad-gamepad-heads-to-production-warms-hearts/ | title = iControlPad gamepad heads to production, warms hearts | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Stevens | first = Tim | date = December 12, 2008 | work = [[Engadget]] | publisher = [[AOL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first revealed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/icontrolpad-unofficial-iphone-gamepad-coming-soon-50000514/ | title = iControlPad unofficial iPhone gamepad coming soon | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Wattanajantra | first = Asavin | date = 2010-08-27 | publisher = [[CNET]] | quote = The device has been in development for some time.

Well, almost. You can order today for a delivery next week [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2009, a completely redesigned iControlPad prototype was under development. This much larger version moved the controls below the screen and added two analog nubs and two trigger buttons to the controller.&lt;ref name="EngadgetProto09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/08/latest-icontrolpad-prototype-bulks-up-gets-handled-on-video/|title=Latest iControlPad prototype bulks up, gets handled on video|publisher=[[Engadget]]|first=Nilay|last=Patel|date=November 8, 2009|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design, which featured clamps to attach it to the iPhone, was much closer to the version that was ultimately released, and would soon go into production.&lt;ref name="SlashProduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/icontrolpad-for-iphone-production-parts-now-shipping-2398553/|title=iControlPad for iPhone production parts now shipping|publisher=[[SlashGear]]|first=Chris|last=Davies|date=August 23, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one large change was made very late in development. The team had secretly added Bluetooth support to the iControlPad, in order to increase compatibility beyond the iPhone and its proprietary connection.&lt;ref name="TwitterSecret"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Craigix/statuses/25788017664|title=Something we kept secret ...|publisher=[[Twitter]]|first=Craig|last=Rothwell|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved fortunate when Apple began exercising its rights over the dock connector, suing an unlicensed accessory maker. Thus, the iControlPad team were forced to adapt to use the Bluetooth connection for the iPhone,&lt;ref name="SlashDock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/icontrolpad-dumps-dock-connector-for-bluetooth-over-apple-legal-fears-android-bt-confirmed-28104830/|title=iControlPad dumps Dock Connector for Bluetooth over Apple legal fears; Android BT confirmed|publisher=[[SlashGear]]|first=Chris|last=Davies|date=September 28, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was this version which finally became available for order in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slashgear.com/icontrolpad-with-bluetooth-shipping-this-month-08131711/ | title = iControlPad with Bluetooth Shipping This Month | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Perkins | first = Samia | date = February 8, 2011 | work = [[SlashGear]] | publisher = R3 Media LLC | quote = The new iControlPad with Bluetooth is scheduled to ship February 16th.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reception for the iControlPad has been mostly positive. [[The Register|Register Hardware]] noted that while "patience and geekery" were required to get the controller working, the iControlPad "almost perfectly solves the touchscreen game control conundrum".&lt;ref name="RegisterReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reghardware.com/2011/05/18/review_igamer_icontrolpad/|title=iControlPad Bluetooth controller for mobile devices|publisher=[[The Register|Register Hardware]]|first=Andrew|last=Bailey|date=May 18, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gadgetoid homed in on the device's usefulness for classic gaming, remarking that it was "awesome [...] for emulation on the go".&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt; TouchArcade's reviewer said while playing games with the iControlPad that "the experience feels great", but that "[he couldn't] recommend that the typical gamer run out right now and grab one," due to its limited support on the iTunes App Store.&lt;ref name="TouchReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2011/07/13/a-close-look-at-the-icontrolpad-bluetooth-control-accessory/|title=A Close Look at the 'iControlPad' Bluetooth Control Accessory|publisher=TouchArcade|first=Blake|last=Patterson|date=July 13, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early reviews were mixed on the quality of the controls, with DroidGamers describing them as "very loose",&lt;ref name="DroidReview" /&gt; while, conversely, Register Hardware said "the analogue nubs and face buttons work extremely well".&lt;ref name="RegisterReview" /&gt; The controller's responsiveness was later improved by replacing the original rubber keymat with a larger one. In their review, Gadgetoid lauded the inputs as having "a great tactile feel and a liberal amount of travel with a good response."&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt;

==iControlPad 2==

A successor, the '''iControlPad 2''', was successfully funded via [[Kickstarter]] in October 2012. As of November 2013, it has been cancelled,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with little to no refunds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14950">The '''Industrious Revolution''' is the title given to a period of time, usually given as between 1600 and 1800&lt;ref name="Clark1998p841"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 841.&lt;/ref&gt; that led up to the [[Industrial Revolution]].  It is a term first coined by the Japanese demographic historian [[Akira Hayami]] &lt;small&gt;([[:ja:速水融|速水融]])&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref name="DeVries2008p78"&gt;De Vries (2008), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted by other historians to help further explain the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of this theory deals with the spending behaviours of families in the period.  It also deals with the production and consumption of goods.  In fact, Industrious Revolutions are often characterized by a rise in demand for "market-supplied goods",&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p265"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; which will minimize the value of domestic goods, before the ultimate consumption. Industrious Revolutions often occur during a period where labour wages have stagnated or decreased.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p265" /&gt;  The theory of a pre-industrial Industrious Revolution is contested within the history community.

== Origin ==
Hayami introduced the concept of Industrious Revolution in a Japanese-language work published in 1967. It was coined to compare the labour-intensive technologies of Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868) with the capital-intensive technologies of Britain's Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industrious Revolution: Consumer Behavior and the Household Economy, 1650 to the Present|last=de Vries|first=Jan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521895026|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayami observed that the two countries took different paths due to the different mix of factor endowments (capital for Britain and labour for Japan). He introduced Industrious Revolution to describe the Japanese developmental trajectory, which - lacking the British capital - exploited the benefits of increasing labour absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Resurgence of East Asia: 500, 150 and 50 Year Perspectives|last=Arrighi|first=Giovanni|last2=Hamashita|first2=Takeshi|last3=Selden|first3=Mark|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-0415316361|location=London|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Industrious vs. Industrial Revolution ==
This proposed Industrious Revolution does not aim to replace the [[Industrial Revolution]] in history; rather it is designed to supplement it.  By revamping the history of the period directly preceding the [[Industrial Revolution]], some historians hope to ensure that people get a better understanding of a particular aspect of the [[Early Modern Period]].
	
The basic picture painted of the pre-Industrial Revolution is that the [[Industrial Revolution]] was the result of a surplus of money and crops, which led to the development of new technology.  This new technology eventually developed into factories.  The Industrious Revolution addresses this belief, saying instead, that the overwhelming desire for more goods directly preceded the Industrial Revolution. The theory states that during the Industrious Revolution there was an increase in demand for goods, but that supply did not rise as quickly.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Eventually, some achievements of industry and agriculture, as well as the decisions made by households, helped to increase the supply, as well as the demand for goods. These behaviours, when combined constitute an Industrious Revolution.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255" /&gt;  A quick summation of the differences between the Industrious Revolution and the [[Industrial Revolution]] is that the former is concerned with demand, and the latter is supply based.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p256"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The right mindset to a productional economy and world may have increased the supply of technology, but they would have had little impact on invention without a demand for new techniques. 
	
The theory of an Industrious Revolution, as put forward by historian Jan de Vries, claims that there were two parts to the Industrious Revolution.  First, there was a reduction of leisure time as the utility of monetary income rose.  Second, the focus of labour shifted from goods and services to marketable goods.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p257"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some within the field of [[cultural history]] have theorized that a further motive for an industrious revolution is a shift in the view on what it takes for an individual to be considered independent.  Independence was equated with land ownership prior to an industrious revolution.  Wage earners were granted a degraded and dependent status.  Typically, as in the case of pre-industrial Great Britain and America, these dependent sorts were deemed unworthy of full citizenship rights.  Industrious revolutions shift the meaning of independence from land-holding to earning a competency.  A wage earner could now be considered independent if he/she earned enough money to support a household.  Hard work was viewed as essential for reaching this goal.

== Opposition ==
One of the suggested hallmarks of an Industrious Revolution is that of increased work days.  However, according to historians Gregory Clark and Ysbrand Van Der Werf, there has been no information found to suggest an increase in work days, in the time period between the [[Medieval]] Period and the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p839"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt; These records even indicate that before 1750, some people were working three hundred days per year.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p836"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 836.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even in the period preceding the [[Industrial Revolution]] people were working at least two hundred and ninety days in a year.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p837"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt;  So, this information would demonstrate that there was very little increase in days worked.  Since increase in work loads is one of the suggested hallmarks of an Industrious Revolution, this would work against the theory.
	
Clark and Van Der Werf have also examined the output of a couple of English industries.  For one, they looked at records of the saw mills in England.  Between 1300 and 1800, the period directly preceding and following the proposed Industrious Revolution, the estimated amount of lumber sawed increased about eighty percent.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p835"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 835.&lt;/ref&gt;    However, this increase in lumber sawed can be attributed to new technologies, and not in fact the influence of an Industrious Revolution.  In contrast, they mention the [[threshing]] industry.  Unlike the lumber sawing business, this industry shows “clear downward movement”&lt;ref name="Clark1998p834"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 834.&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[threshing]] rates, after which there are no longer any trends.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p834" /&gt; This information would help to disprove the idea of an Industrious Revolution, since, as it has been put forth, there is no universal trend displaying an increase of work habits.

In a later work, Hayami cited that de Vries and other theorists' interpretations did not use the term in the same way he does. Hayami noted that these saw Industrious Revolution and Industrial Revolution as a continuum while the original idea considers the two revolutions as opposing concepts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan's Industrious Revolution: Economic and Social Transformations in the Early Modern Period|last=Hayami|first=Akira|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9784431551416|location=Tokyo|pages=95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayami also stressed that the term explained how the Japanese became industrious for some reason at one point and that eventually they will no longer be.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Production of goods ==
Prior the proposed era of the Industrious Revolution most goods were produced either by household or by [[guilds]].&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p202"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many households involved in the production of marketable goods.  Most of what was produced by these households were things that involved cloth- textiles, clothing, as well as art,&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p202" /&gt; and tapestries.&lt;ref name="Jardine1996p399"&gt;Jardine (1996), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;  These would be produced by the households, or by their respective [[guilds]].  It was even possible for [[guilds]] and merchants to outsource into more rural areas, to get some of the work done. These merchants would bring the raw materials to the workers, who would then, using the supplied materials, make the goods.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p419"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, young girls would be hired to make silk, because they were the only people believed to have hands dexterous enough to make the silk properly.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p418"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other occupations such as knitting, a job that was never organized into guilds, could easily be done within the household.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The income of the household became dependent upon the quality and the quantity of everyone's work.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994"&gt;De Vries (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Even if people were not working for an individual [[guild]] they could still supply and make items not controlled by the [[guilds]]. These would be small, but necessary items like wooden dishes, or soaps.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p205"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; So, basically, much of production was done by, or for, [[guilds]]. This would indicate that much of what was done was not done for one individual household, but for a larger group or organization. 

Prior to the Industrious Revolution, the household was the major site of production, and could be comparable to a factory. However, things were to change a bit during the Industrious Revolution.  If the theory is to be believed, then there was a shift in the running of the household.  The everyday goods and products used by the household would slowly shift from mostly homemade, to mostly "commercially produced goods".&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p262"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the women would be more than likely to be able to attain jobs outside of the household.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p261-62"&gt;De Vries (1994), pp. 261–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also seen within the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], where women would often find small jobs to help supplement their husband's wages.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  This would demonstrate the gradual movement away from the household as a centre of production.

==Patterns of consumption==
The patterns of consumption present in England at this time period were similar to what one might find in Europe, as well as in some of the Ottoman territories. This is unsurprising, however, since most of Europe and the Ottoman Empire were all connected through trade.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p252"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through these trade connections, people were able to buy many of the luxury goods that they desired.  Very common amongst the nobility was the idea of [[Conspicuous consumption]].  This can be traced back, even into the [[Middle Ages]].  People, the nobility especially, had trade connections throughout Europe, and many of them would use these connections to buy the works of art, etc. that they desired.&lt;ref name="Jardine1996"&gt;Jardine (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not extend only to the rich however: even [[Medieval]] peasants enjoyed imported luxury items; there is evidence to suggest that some English peasants drank imported French wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Peasant |title=Medieval Lives |last=Jones |first=Terry |authorlink= |author2=Ereira, Alan |year=2005 |publisher=BBC Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-563-48793-7 |page=23 |chapter-url=}}{{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People were consuming products well before the Industrious Revolution. There were stock exchanges all over Europe, even London.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006" /&gt; People were also clearly making products for consumption, as the large number of guilds existing within Europe at that point would suggest.  What would cause the period between 1600 and 1800 to be labeled an Industrious Revolution, by looking at the patterns of consumption, is the rise in demand for these products.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255" /&gt; So, what would set this period in time apart would be more demands for luxury items.  Especially those items that could not be produced in the homes or by the [[guilds]].  During the proposed Industrious Revolution, this demand for luxury items would be greater than the supply could accommodate.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994" /&gt;  A rise in the rate at which people were consuming goods, especially when combined with other factors of the times, could have potentially heralded the Industrious Revolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6176">The '''Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators''' ('''ISTC''') is the UK's largest professional association for those involved in [[technical communication]] and [[information design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tceurope.org/memberorganisations/istc.htm Profile of ISTC published by TCeurope]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qualityauthors.co.uk/aboutistc.php ABOUT ISTC]. Copyright © 2000 Quality Independent Authors.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astauthors.co.uk/aboutast/istc/index.php The Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators]. Site © copyright AST 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages professional education and standards, provides guidance about the value of using professional communicators, and provides research resources and networking opportunities for its members and affiliates.

==History==
The ISTC as it is today was created in 1972 from an amalgamation of three associations: the Presentation of Technical Information Group (founded in 1948&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reginaldkapp.org/AboutROK/About_biography.htm Involvement of Reginald Kapp in the PTI Group and the ISTC]&lt;/ref&gt;), the Technical Publications Association and the Institute of Technical Publicity &amp; Publications.&lt;ref&gt;Hockley, H R: "Communicator", May 1972, page 1. ITPP, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was incorporated as a limited company on 19 July 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/2b94e8c4de7394e8e35d5577f693cc20/compdetails limited company, 01061923]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The ISTC is managed by its Council, with day-to-day running handled by a professional administration company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.co.uk/pages/clients-test.htm Administration Services Ltd client list]&lt;/ref&gt; Members have the opportunity to contribute their ideas, skills and time to specific Steering Groups and can stand for Council.

The ISTC is a member of the [[Professional Associations Research Network]] (PARN). This organisation provides a network for professional bodies and offers services and events on subjects such as governance, [[Continuing Professional Development]], ethics and standards, and member relations. The ISTC was one of the sponsors of a project in 2006 to explore the issues affecting professional associations as they grow.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, C; Woodhead, S: "The Growing Pains of Smaller Professional Associations: Key Issues and Interesting Practice". PARN, June 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISTC has a Code of Professional Practice, with which it expects its members to comply. This was developed in accordance with research carried out by PARN and its author was cited in PARN's third book on ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, A: "Ethical Competence and Professional Associations", pages 109-111. PARN, 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0-9545487-7-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Technical communication encompasses a wide range of activities, all with the common thread of communicating complex or important information in the most effective way for the reader. Technical communicators create information that affects people in virtually every industry and area of society. Examples of roles that may be involved in technical communication are:

* [[Technical writer|Technical writing]]
* [[Technical illustration]]
* [[Index (publishing)|Indexing]]
* [[Editing]]
* [[Instructional design]]
* [[Information architecture]]
* [[Single source publishing]]
*[[Environmental policy|Environmental]], [[safety]] and [[health]] communication
* [[Management]]

The ISTC offers several grades of individual membership. There are two corporate grades, Member (MISTC) and Fellow (FISTC), and two non-corporate grades, Associate and Student. Corporate grades are entitled to vote at the ISTC's AGM. Members cite a sense of community as an important factor in their continued membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stcfrance.org/files/STCFranceConnexionFebruary2008.pdf Newell, M: "Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators", page 4. France Connexion, STC France Chapter, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisations can join the ISTC as Business Affiliates.

==Publications==	
The ISTC publishes periodicals and books:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cde.london.ac.uk/resources/documents/books/resource1752.htm Centre for Distance Learning listing for Professional Communication and Information Design]&lt;/ref&gt;
* a quarterly journal, ''Communicator'' (ISSN 0953-3699)

* a handbook comprising essays from a range of practitioners, ''Professional Communication and Information Design'' ({{ISBN|0-9506459-5-8}})
* an overview of the role of XML in the profession, ''XML in Technical Communication''.({{ISBN|978-0-9506459-7-1}})

==Events==	
The ISTC organises an annual conference, Technical Communication UK, which is held in September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ribaproductselector.com/Docs/7/13447/external/cov.htm?ac= Royal Institute of British Architecture listing for ISTC annual conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==	
The ISTC makes annual awards:
* UK Technical Communication Awards (formerly the ISTC Documentation Awards) for deliverables in five classes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lr.org/NR/exeres/BAEA09AA-4C70-4C1B-AA67-C5148E953F13.htm Lloyds Register announcement of win]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Horace Hockley Award for contribution to the profession&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shu.ac.uk/media/staff.html#nw Sheffield Hallam University announcement of win]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mike Austin Award for contribution to the ISTC

==International==	
The ISTC participates in the international technical communication profession through its membership of two umbrella organisations:
* [[INTECOM]]&lt;ref&gt;Watson, M: "Communicator", Winter 2004, pages 14-15. ISTC, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[TCeurope]]&lt;ref&gt;Risku, H: "Communicator", Winter 2005, page 32-33. ISTC, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISTC was one of the founder members of both organisations, INTECOM in 1970&lt;ref&gt;Hockley, H R: "Communicator", July 1974, page 2. ISTC, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; and TCeurope in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, A: "Communicator", Spring/Summer 2002, page 28. ISTC, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Location awareness''' refers to devices that can passively or actively determine their location. [[Navigational instrument]]s provide location coordinates for vessels and vehicles. Surveying equipment identifies location with respect to a well-known locationa [[wireless communications]] device. ''Network location awareness'' (NLA) describes the location of a node in a network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.blackviper.com/wiki/Network_Location_Awareness_%28NLA%29 Network location awareness]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740123%28VS.85%29.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The term applies to [[navigation|navigating]], [[location (geography)|real-time locating]] and positioning support with global, regional or local scope. The term has been applied to [[traffic]], [[logistics]], [[business administration]] and [[leisure]] applications. Location awareness is supported by [[Radar|navigation systems]], [[radar tracker|positioning systems]] and/or [[Real-time locating system|locating services]].

Location awareness without the active participation of the device is known as non-cooperative locating or detection.

== History of terminology ==
The term originated for [[configurations]] settings of [[computer network|network]] systems and addressed network entities. ''Network location awareness'' (NLA) services collect network configuration and location information, and notify applications when this information changes. With the advent of [[global positioning system]]s and radio-equipped mobile devices, the term was redefined to include consumer-focused applications.

While location awareness began as a matter of static user location, the notion was extended to reflect movement. Context models have been proposed&lt;ref name="curino-context2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cristiana Bolchini and Carlo A. Curino and Elisa Quintarelli and Fabio A. Schreiber and Letizia Tanca |title=A data-oriented survey of context models |url=http://carlo.curino.us/documents/curino-context2007-survey.pdf |format=PDF |journal=SIGMOD Rec. |volume=36 |issue=4 |year=2007 |issn=0163-5808 |pages=19–26 |doi=10.1145/1361348.1361353 |publisher=ACM |location=New York, NY, USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424051627/http://carlo.curino.us/documents/curino-context2007-survey.pdf |archivedate=April 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to support context-aware applications which use location to tailor interfaces, refine application-relevant data, increase the precision of information retrieval, discover services, make user interaction implicit and build smart environments. For example, a location-aware mobile phone may confirm that it is currently in a building.&lt;ref name="schmidt1999a"&gt;{{cite conference

== Determining location ==
Description in '''logical terms''' uses a structured textual form. International standardisation offers a common method using ISO/TS 16952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38178 |title=ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation - Reference designation system - Part 1: General application rules |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as originated with German standards DIN EN 61346&lt;ref&gt;DIN EN 61346 Industrielle Systeme, Anlagen und Ausrüstungen und Industrieprodukte – Strukturierungsprinzipien und Referenzkennzeichnung&lt;/ref&gt; and DIN EN 81346.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dke.din.de/cmd?bcrumblevel=1&amp;contextid=dke&amp;subcommitteeid=54759251&amp;projid=103797592&amp;level=tpl-proj-detailansicht&amp;committeeid=54738887&amp;languageid=de |title=Industrielle Systeme, Anlagen und Ausrüstungen und Industrieprodukte - Strukturierungsprinzipien und Referenzkennzeichnung - Teil 1: Allgemeine Regeln (IEC 81346-1:2009) |publisher=Dke.din.de |date=2007-05-29 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Location in '''mathematical terms''' offers coordinates that refer to a nominated point of [[reference]].

Location in '''network terms''' relates to locating network nodes. These include:

==Variants==
"Crisp" locating offers precise coordinates, using wireless signals or optical sighting, possibly with phase angle measurements. Coordinates are relative to either a standardized system of coordinates, e.g. [[WGS84]], or a fixed object such as a building plan. [[Real-time locating system|Real-time locating]] adds timely delivery of results, especially for moving targets. Real time locating is defined with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 19762-5 and ISO/IEC 24730-1.&lt;ref name="malik2009"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fuzzy locating]] offers less precision, e.g., presence "near" a point of reference. Measuring wireless power levels can supply this degree of precision. Less sophisticated systems can use wireless distance measurements to estimate a point of reference in [[polar coordinate]]s (distance and direction) from another site. Index locating indicates presence at a known location, as with fixed [[RFID]] readers and RFID tags.&lt;ref name="sweeney2006"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Location-aware systems address the acquisition of coordinates in a grid (for example using distance metrics and lateration algorithms) or at least distances to reference points (for example discriminating presence at a certain choke point on a corridor or in a room of a building).&lt;ref name="schmidt2003phd"&gt;{{cite conference

=== Navigation ===
[[Navigation]] and reckoning are key concerns for [[seafarer]]s, [[aviator]]s and professional drivers. The task is to dynamically determine the current location and the time, distance and direction to destination. [[radar]] served for regional demand and [[NAVSTAR]] satellite systems for global demand. [[GPS]] and similar systems have become ubituitous in long-haul transport operation and are  becoming a standard automobile feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wm-user.de/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=76 Test TomTom Navigator 6] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228155025/http://www.wm-user.de/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=76 |date=December 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveying ===
[[Surveying]] is the static complement to navigating. It is essential for delineating land ownership and for [[architect]]s and [[civil engineer]]s designing construction projects. Optical surveying technology preceded [[LASER]] [[triangulation|triangulating]] aids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rlehmann.ch/data/Das_neue_Messen_2-14.pdf Das neue Messen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001918/http://www.rlehmann.ch/data/Das_neue_Messen_2-14.pdf |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business process ===
Currently location awareness is applied to design innovative [[process control]]s, and is integral to [[ubiquitous computing|ubiquitous]] and [[wearable computer|wearable computing]]. On mobile devices, location aware [[search algorithm|search]] can prioritize results that are close to the device. Conversely, the device location can be disclosed to others, at some cost to the bearer's privacy.&lt;ref name="schmidt1999b"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Warehouse and routing ===
RFID provides a time/location reference for an object, but does not indicate that the object remains at that location, which is sufficient for applications that limit access, such as tracking objects entering and leaving a warehouse, or for objects moving on a fixed route, such as charging tolls for crossing a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfid-basis.de/article-00146.html |title=Fünf Jahre nach dem RFID-Hype erste Ernüchterung |publisher=Rfid-basis.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rosemann2006"&gt;{{cite conference

=== Consumer ===
Location awareness enables new applications for ubiquitous computing systems and [[mobile phone]]s. Such applications include the automatic reconfiguration of a computing device to suit the location in which it is currently being used (examples include [http://www.controlplaneapp.com ControlPlane] and [http://www.45rpmsoftware.com/locamatic.php Locamatic]), or publishing a user's location to appropriate members of a social network, and allowing retailers to publish special offers to potential customers who are near to the retailers. Allegedly, individuals gain [[self confidence]] with confirmation of current [[Tracking (Scouting)|whereabouts]].&lt;ref name="blank1989"&gt;{{cite journal

== Infrastructure ==
While governments have created global systems for computing locations, independent localized systems exist at scales ranging from one building to sub-national regions.

=== Local ===
Such solutions may apply concepts of [[Real-time locating system|RTLS]] and [[WPAN]], [[wireless LAN]] or [[DECT]], with results in proprietary terms of [[floor plan]]s or room numbers. Local systems degrade as distance from the locality increases. Applications include the automatic reconfiguration of a computing device to suit the location in which it is currently being used.

=== Regional ===
This approach uses for example mobile phone systems, such as [[3GPP]], [[GSM]] or [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]], typically returning information in standardized coordinates as with WGS84 in standardized formats such as [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]] for outdoor usage or in symbolic coordinates referring to street addresses.

=== Global ===
This approach relies on [[GPS]] technology, currently supplied by NAVSTAR and may in future employ the pending [[Galileo (satellite navigation)]] system, generally adopting WGS84 and NMEA. Applications include [[Avalanche|avalanche rescue]] or [[emergency]] and [[mountain rescue]] as well as with [[search and rescue]], (SAR) and [[combat search and rescue]], (CSAR).

The '''Mobile Telephone Switching Office''' (MTSO) is the mobile equivalent of a [[PSTN]] Central Office.  The MTSO contains the switching equipment or Mobile Switching Center (MSC) for routing mobile phone calls.  It also contains the equipment for controlling the cell sites that are connected to the MSC.

The systems in the MTSO are the heart of a cellular system.  It is responsible for interconnecting calls with the local and long distance landline telephone companies, compiling billing information (with the help of its CBM/SDM), etc. It also provides resources needed to efficiently serve a mobile subscriber such as registration, authentication, location updating and call routing.  Its subordinate BSC/RNC are responsible for assigning [[frequency|frequencies]] to each call, reassigning frequencies for [[handoff]]s, controlling handoffs so a [[mobile phone]] leaving one cell (formally known as [[Base transceiver station|BTS]])'s coverage area, can be switched automatically to a [[Channel (communications)|channel]] in the next cell.

All cellular systems have at least one MTSO which will contain at least one MSC. The MSC is responsible for switching calls to mobile units as well as to the local telephone system, recording billing data and processing data from the cell site controllers.

The MSC is connected to a close telephone exchange by a trunk group. This provides an interface to the ([[Public Switched Telephone Network]]) (PSTN). It also provides connectivity to the PSTN. The region to be served by a Cellular Geographic Serving Area(CGSA) is split into geographic cells. These cells are ideally hexagonal in shape and they are initially laid out with their centers about 4 to 8 miles apart from each other.  Other MTSO equipment, the cell site controllers provide control functions for a group of cell sites and actions of mobile phones through command and control data channels.  To achieve this, there has to be a method of connectivity between the MTSO and the cell site.  This may be by DS1, DS3, OCn or Ethernet circuits.

== Subscriber Registration ==
The MSC also plays a major role in call [[routing]]. When a mobile phone is turned on, it listens for the network operator's SID (System Identification Code) on the control channel. If it cannot find any control channels to listen to then it assumes it is outside the range and displays a message indicating no service. If it finds a control channel to listen to, receives the SID and then compares it to the SID programmed into the phone. If both SIDs match then it knows that it is communicating with a cell in its home system.

The phone also transmits a registration request along with the SID.  If the subscriber has previously registered to a particular [[Mobile Switching Center|MSC]] then the MSC will have a record in its [[Network switching subsystem#Visitor location register|VLR]] and will therefore know the subscriber last registered location. If the subscriber is unknown to the MSC's VLR, it will query the [[Home Location Register|HLR]] to obtain the subscriber's profile and save it for a set length of time in its VLR.  Anytime a MSC successfully registers a subscriber the HLR record is also updated.  This will help when a call is received outside of the MSC's coverage area or for an incoming PSTN call.

A subscriber's VLR profile has a LAC(Location Area Code - Area server by cluster of BTS/cell sites) CID (Cell ID) as well as a list of allowed and disallowed services/features and other information.

With the subscriber's VLR Profile the MSC can determine the last ''known'' LAC/CID for this subscriber and knows which BTS to use when it needs to ring/page that phone for an incoming call.  When the MSC gets the call, it checks its database for the location of the phone. Then it picks a frequency pair the phone will use in that cell to take the call. The MSC communicates with the phone over the control channel to tell it which frequencies to use, and once the phone and the tower switch on those frequencies, the call is connected.

== Handovers ==
As a mobile unit engaged in a call moves away from a cell site or formally known as [[Base transceiver station]] and its [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] weakens, the [[Base Station Controller|BSC]]([[GSM]]) or [[Radio Network Controller|RNC]](3G [[UMTS]]) will automatically instruct it to tune to a different frequency, one assigned to the newly entered BTS. This process is called handoff. The BSC/RNC determines when handoff should take place by analyzing measurements of radio signal strength made by the present controlling cell site and by its neighbors. The returning instructions for handoff sent during a call must use the voice channel. The data regarding the new channel are sent rapidly (in about 50 milliseconds), and the entire returning process takes only about 300 milliseconds. After handoff, if the SID on the control channel does not match the SID programmed into the phone, then the phone assumes that it is roaming.

The [[Mobile Switching Center|MSC]] also performs handovers/handoffs which occurs when a call needs to be handed off to a different BSC/RNC it serves or to completely new MSC.  A MSC can serve many BSCs/RNCs which in turn server many BTS.  As a result, a MSC can serve a large area typically hundreds of miles.  Highly populated areas require more BTSs and BSCs/RNCs which will in turn obviously, will reduce the geographic coverage of a DMSC.  The above in a MSC is what's considered as its mobility management.  The BTS, BSC/RNC are the RAN/UTRAN (Radio Access Network &amp; UMTS Radio Access Network) subset in the mobile network. The remaining functions of a MSC are identical to a PSTN switch.

A '''mobile form ''' is an electronic or digital form application that functions on a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet device]]. Mobile forms enable users to collect [[data]] using [[mobile device]]s, and then to send the results back to the source. Mobile forms exist to replace paper forms as a more productive means of [[data collection]], eliminating the need to [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]] or scan paper data results into a back office system.

Depending on the [[mobile form]] [[App (computing)|application]] provider, some mobile form solutions allow offices to dispatch data to mobile form applications. In addition, other mobile form applications can be connected with various [[cloud service]]s, [[Server (computing)|servers]], and [[social media platform]]s.

Depending on the business, the motivating factors to deploying mobile forms may vary. Some businesses implement mobile forms to speed up processes, while others institute mobile forms with field users to reduce [[cost]]s associated with transporting paper forms back and forth. Furthermore, [[Green business|green-minded businesses]] implement mobile forms in order to be more environmentally friendly, thus reducing their reliance on paper, ink printing, and subsequent waste.

Advanced mobile form features include [[signature]] capture, [[bar code]] capture, photo capture, [[GPS]] location form info, time form info, and skip logic.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Uses for mobile forms include:
* [[Safety inspection]]s 
* [[Work order]]s
* [[Expense report]]s
* [[Inventory]] reports
* [[Merchandise]] requisition
* [[Invoice|Invoicing]]

'''Mobile procurement''' is mobile [[business software]] that helps organizations streamline their procurement process from a mobile device. Features of mobile procurement software include mobile [[purchase order]] creation, on-demand notifications, and real-time analytics. What makes mobile procurement successful is the ability to leverage software-side servers to move data along. The key benefit for organizations using mobile procurement systems is the ability to track business operations using any ordinary mobile device.

Mobile [[procurement software]] is generally represented in the form of custom applications provided as an add-on feature of a larger [[ERP software|ERP]] solution. As such, if the goal of a mobile procurement system should be to complement existing information systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gebaue|first1=Judith|last2=Shaw|first2=Michael J|title=Success Factors and Impacts of Mobile Business Applications: Results from a Mobile e-Procurement Study|journal=Mobile Commerce Applications|date=Spring 2004|volume=8|issue=3|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; mobile procurement software should typically involve the needs of procurement professionals before implementation. Assuring that necessary features are prioritized over having many features is key to successful user adoption.

It also simplifies order management processes by removing the confusion and disorder often seen with paper-based procurement. Mobile procurement provides a clearer view of the steps behind procurement and give companies the insight needed to consistently secure the best possible total cost of ownership.

==Mobile Enterprise Applications==
Mobile enterprise application software is the use of office software applications on a mobile platform in a way that adapts to different devices and networks. Many organizations use these applications to increase employee productivity and streamline business operations.

The first common mobile enterprise application was the implementation of email. Now, 53% of emails &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=Justine|title=53% of Emails Opened on Mobile; Outlook Opens Decrease 33%|journal=Litmus}}&lt;/ref&gt; are opened on a mobile device, a 45% increase in three years. The next wave of popular mobile enterprise application software was the advent of the [[CRM software]]. This allows salespeople to stay up-to-date with the business and manage customer relationships crucial to success from anywhere.

[[File:Vroozi Mobile Procurement Marketplace.png|thumbnail|Mobile procurement platform renders the same marketplace console in perfect optimization for all devices.]]
Another [[enterprise software]] application being leveraged on a mobile platform is [[procurement]]. This trend is led by the consumer shopping experience. Over 36% of online sales on Black Friday in 2015 came from mobile shopping, according to IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Seung|title=Analysts: Mobile Phones Saved This Year's Black Friday|journal=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more shoppers are migrating to mobile applications, procurement departments need to keep up with user preferences. This mobile platform provides capabilities to complete the procurement process from start to finish. This includes searching for items and services, comparing vendors and prices, submitting purchase requests, approving requests, electronic signing, purchase orders and invoicing. Being able to accomplish this all in one place from any device significantly streamlines business procurement and operations.

Users leverage mobile procurement for various reasons, and the tool can benefit businesses in many ways.

'''User Convenience'''
The clear advantage of using mobile procurement is the ability to use it anywhere from any device. This eliminates interruptions in the process or the need to complete a request from a single device. Users can search, compare and request items from anywhere. Suppliers can receive and sign purchase orders electronically. Checking inventory levels of physical locations provides a strong utility for mobile procurement. 

'''Save Time'''
Mobile procurement saves time by reducing approval cycle time. A manager can make approvals from anywhere, not just his office. Users can request things they need when they need it, instead of after the fact, breaking corporate policy. Procurement now fills idle time rather than being a major item on a to-do list. This keeps employees and business moving forward. A fast procurement turnaround increases outcomes.

'''Visibility'''
Full visibility of suppliers and information helps businesses make informed decisions for better results and quicker processes. User analytics also help companies shop smarter in the long run.

==Native Apps vs. HTML5==
Mobile interaction now exceeds desktop Web interaction by 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techpp.com/2015/07/24/mobile-internet-usage-report/|title=Global Mobile Internet Usage Overtakes Desktop for the First Time|work=TechPP|date=24 July 2015|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now that mobile is the dominant form of online activity, mobile procurement is simply a natural step into today’s digital landscape. Mobile procurement platforms can be approached in two ways: native apps or Web apps using HTML5.

'''Native Apps'''
A native app is a mobile application developed specifically for use on mobile devices, launched directly from the home screen. In the United States, use of mobile apps greatly exceeds use of mobile Web browsing, but that trend is not worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techpp.com/2015/07/24/mobile-internet-usage-report/|title=Think the app vs. mobile web battle is over? Only in the U.S.|work=VentureBeat|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a native app requires development for all operating systems and brands. A fully operational native app needs to be designed for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Microsoft]], all their various generations, and at different resolutions and orientations. For total success of an app, users will expect it to work on everything from a high-resolution tablet down to an Apple Watch.

The other factor to consider with native apps is the way they access backend data. This is often more complex than a simple push to read data that takes place on a Web browser. Apps are developed, depending on their purpose and functionality, to access other applications such as the camera or local storage.

Native apps can be the preferred use of mobile procurement in environments with either no IT access or highly secure networks. Financial institutions value privacy and security when considering mobile tools operating in their network. Oil and gas environments are often remote and require apps that can work with limited Internet access.

A downside to mobile apps is the memory they occupy on a device. Because of this, many businesses will steer away from apps that require a great deal of storage.

'''Web Apps and HTML5''' 
A Web app is run by a browser and is really a responsive Web site. Responsive sites change and adapt to any digital environment, including operating system, screen size and orientation. This has several advantages for mobile procurement platforms.

Responsive design can adjust to any browser on any device. The design is such that images, text, and user experience adjust based on the size and resolution of the platform. Adaptive web design is based on predetermined parameters for each platform. Both are ideal for any business that plans on interacting with customers on any type of mobile device.

[[HTML]], JavaScript and CSS3 seamlessly integrate backend systems with browsers and user interfaces. This creates an easy-to-use experience for all users on any device. Although some designs are scaled down, which can limit functionality, responsive and adaptive [[web design]] is easily accessible for any customer. And functionality is all about priority. If a scaled down site still performs the necessary functions, users will still find the advantages of increased turnarounds and time saving.

The widespread availability of Wi-Fi increases the availability of HTML5 sites, reducing concerns about accessibility. With Wi-Fi everywhere, mobile procurement can happen in any place on a responsive site.

Elegantly designed responsive and adaptive sites are the ideal solution for mobile procurement because of the simplicity of creating and implementing one. If a user’s experience is smooth and consistent, they will have no problem accessing a mobile procurement platform from any device. With the advancement of tools and technology it is [[AngularJS|currently]] possible to provide a native feel and minimal native feature set to your mobile products. Examples would be AngularJS, which allows for rapid web app development while preserving quality.

'''Multimodal anthropology''' is an emerging subfield of social [[cultural anthropology]] that encompasses anthropological research and knowledge production across multiple traditional and new media platforms and practices including [[film]], [[video]], [[photography]], theatre, design, [[podcast]], mobile apps, interactive games, web-based social networking, immersive [[360-degree video|360 video]] and [[augmented reality]]. As characterized in [[American Anthropologist]]'','' multimodal anthropology is an "anthropology that works across multiple media, but one that also engages in public anthropology and collaborative anthropology through a field of differentially linked media platforms" (Collins, Durington &amp; Gill).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Samuel Gerald|last2=Durington|first2=Matthew|last3=Gill|first3=Harjant|date=2017-01-12|title=Multimodality: An Invitation|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=119|issue=1|pages=142–146|doi=10.1111/aman.12826|issn=0002-7294}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multimodal approach also encourages [[anthropologist]] to reconsider the ways in which they conduct their research, to pay close attention to the role various media technologies and digital devices plays in the lives of their interlocutors, and how they these technologies redefine what fieldwork looks like.

== History and background ==
Multimodal anthropology is not a new concept. It has been a fundamental part of anthropological research and [[Field research|fieldwork]] from the early days of the disciple. Anthropologists have been experimenting with different forms media technologies throughout the [[20th century|twentieth century]] whenever confronted with the limitation of text-based ethnography. Multimodal is a term that has readily been used since the 1970s in varied disciplines as [[psychotherapy]], [[phonetics]], [[genetics]], [[literature]] and [[medicine]] to characterize different approaches to carrying out scientific research that involves to a certain degree, thinking outside of the box. In the early 1990s, semioticians used the terms to discuss different forms of communication across different media, eventually including digital media.

Technological advances in the later part of the twentieth century, the accessibility to [[photography]], [[film]] cameras and audio recorders led to the emergence of [[visual anthropology]] as a sub discipline dedicated to the study and production of ethnographic photography, film and media. Building in this legacy, multimodal anthropology seeks to expand the boundaries of visual anthropology to incorporate emerging technologies of [[21st century|twenty-first century]] including mobile networking, [[social media]], [[Geotagging|geo-mapping]], [[virtual reality]], [[Podcast|podcasting]], [[interactive design]], along with other traditional forms of learning and knowledge production like art and drawing that were often sidelined within [[visual anthropology]], such as interactive gaming, theatre, performance, graphic novels, ethnofiction and experimental ethnography. As Samuel Collins, Matthew Durington and [[Harjant Gill]] note in their introductory essay on title "Multimodality: An Invitation," published in [[American Anthropologist]], "multimodal anthropologies does not attempt – or desire – to supplant visual anthropology. Rather it seeks to include traditional forms of [[visual anthropology]] while simultaneously broadening the purview of the discipline to engage in variety of media forms that exist today."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Neolithic Revolution''', '''Neolithic Demographic Transition''', '''Agricultural Revolution''', or '''First Agricultural Revolution''' was the wide-scale transition of many [[human culture]]s during the [[Neolithic]] period from a lifestyle of [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to one of [[agriculture]] and [[sedentism|settlement]], making an increasingly larger population possible.&lt;ref name=SCNDR&gt;{{cite journal|title= When the World's Population Took Off: The Springboard of the Neolithic Demographic Transition|journal= Science|date= July 29, 2011|volume= 333|issue= 6042|pages= 560–561|doi= 10.1126/science.1208880|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/560.full|accessdate= June 10, 2012|author= Jean-Pierre Bocquet-Appel|bibcode = 2011Sci...333..560B|pmid= 21798934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants to learn how they grew and developed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Worlds together, worlds apart concise edition vol.1 |last = Pollard, Rosenberg, and Tigor |publisher = W.W.

Archaeological data indicates that the [[domestication]] of various types of plants and animals happened in separate locations worldwide, starting in the [[Geologic time scale|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] of the [[Holocene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.westfalen-blatt.de/nachricht/2012-11-25-klimaschutz-die-ziele-schmelzen-dahin/613/

The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, resulting in a downturn in human nutrition.&lt;ref name=Armelagos2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Armelagos|first1= George J.|title= Brain Evolution, the Determinates of Food Choice, and the Omnivore's Dilemma|journal= Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume= 54|issue= 10|year= 2014|pages= 1330–1341|issn= 1040-8398|doi= 10.1080/10408398.2011.635817|pmid= 24564590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it would transform the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated [[human history|human pre-history]] into [[sedentism|sedentary]] (non-[[nomad]]ic) [[society|societies]] based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their [[natural environment]] by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as [[irrigation]] and [[deforestation]] which allowed the production of surplus food.  Other developments found very widely are the [[domestication of animals]],  [[pottery]], polished stone tools, and rectangular houses.

These developments, sometimes called the '''Neolithic package''', provided the basis for centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical [[ideology|ideologies]], depersonalized systems of knowledge (e.g. [[history of writing|writing]]), [[population density|densely populated]] settlements, specialization and [[division of labour]], more [[trade]], the development of non-portable [[art]] and [[architecture]], and [[property]] ownership.  The earliest known [[civilization]] developed in [[Sumer]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]] ({{circa|6,500 [[Before Present|BP]]}}); its emergence also heralded the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.ancient.eu/Neolithic/|title= Neolithic|work= Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date= 2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of the above-mentioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture, their sequence of emergence, and empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate, and varies from place to place, rather than being the outcome of universal laws of [[social evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/images/neolithic_agriculture.htm "The Slow Birth of Agriculture"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101201656/http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/images/neolithic_agriculture.htm |date=2011-01-01 }}, [[Heather Pringle]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/zawichemishanidar.html |title=Wizard Chemi Shanidar |work=EMuseum |publisher=[[Minnesota State University]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618214404/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/zawichemishanidar.html |archive-date=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Levant]] saw the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, followed by sites in the wider [[Fertile Crescent]].

The term ''Neolithic Revolution'' was coined in 1923 by [[V. Gordon Childe]] to describe the first in a series of agricultural revolutions in [[Middle East]]ern history. The period is described as a "revolution" to denote its importance, and the great significance and degree of change affecting the communities in which new agricultural practices were gradually adopted and refined.

The beginning of this process in different regions has been dated from 10,000 to 8,000 BC in the [[Fertile Crescent]]&lt;ref name=Barker2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thissen2002&gt;Thissen, L. "Appendix I, The CANeW 14C databases, Anatolia 10,000-5000 cal. BC." in: F. Gérard and L. Thissen (eds.), '' The Neolithic of Central Anatolia. Internal developments and external relations during the 9th–6th millennia cal BC'', Proc. Int.  CANeW Round Table, Istanbul 23–24 November 2001, (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps 8000 BC in the [[Kuk Swamp|Kuk Early Agricultural Site]] of [[Melanesia]].&lt;ref name="Denham2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Denham|first = Tim P.|authorlink =|year = 2003|title = Origins of Agriculture at Kuk Swamp in the Highlands of New Guinea|journal = Science|volume = 301|issue = 5630|pages = 189–193|doi = 10.1126/science.1085255| pmid = 12817084 |author3 = and others|displayauthors = 2|last2 = Haberle|first2 = S.

Recent archaeological research suggests that in some regions such as the Southeast Asian peninsula, the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculturalist was not linear, but region-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kealhofer |first=Lisa |title=Looking into the gap: land use and the tropical forests of southern Thailand |journal=Asian Perspectives |date=2003 |volume=42 |issue=1|pages=72–95 |doi=10.1353/asi.2003.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several competing (but not mutually exclusive) theories as to the factors that drove populations to take up agriculture. The most prominent of these are:
* The Oasis Theory, originally proposed by [[Raphael Pumpelly]] in 1908, popularized by [[V. Gordon Childe]] in 1928 and summarised in Childe's book ''Man Makes Himself''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man Makes Himself|author=Gordon Childe|year=1936|publisher=Oxford university press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory maintains that as the climate got drier due to the Atlantic depressions shifting northward, communities contracted to [[oases]] where they were forced into close association with animals, which were then domesticated together with planting of seeds. However, today this theory has little support amongst archaeologists because subsequent climate data suggests that the region was getting wetter rather than drier.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, Chris (2005).

London: Thames and Hudson. p. 188. {{ISBN|0500285314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hilly Flanks]] hypothesis, proposed by [[Robert Braidwood]] in 1948, suggests that agriculture began in the hilly flanks of the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]] and [[Zagros mountains]], where the climate was not drier as Childe had believed, and fertile land supported a variety of plants and animals amenable to domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rise of Civilization: From Early Hunters to Urban Society in the Ancient Near East |author=Charles E. Redman |year=1978 |publisher=Freeman |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Feasting model by Brian Hayden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayden|first=Brian |chapter=Models of Domestication|title=Transitions to Agriculture in Prehistory |editor=Anne Birgitte Gebauer and T. Douglas Price |location=Madison |publisher=Prehistory Press |year=1992 |pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that agriculture was driven by ostentatious displays of power, such as giving feasts, to exert dominance. This required assembling large quantities of food, which drove agricultural technology.
* The Demographic theories proposed by [[Carl Sauer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sauer |first=Carl O. |year=1952|title=Agricultural origins and dispersals|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adapted by [[Lewis Binford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Binford |first=Lewis R. |year=1968 |chapter=Post-Pleistocene Adaptations |title=New Perspectives in Archaeology |editor=Sally R. Binford and Lewis R. Binford |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |location=Chicago |pages=313–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kent Flannery]] posit an increasingly sedentary population that expanded up to the carrying capacity of the local environment and required more food than could be gathered. Various social and economic factors helped drive the need for food.
* The evolutionary/intentionality theory, developed by [[David Rindos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Agriculture: An Evolutionary Perspective|first=David|last=Rindos|publisher=Academic Press|date=December 1987|isbn=978-0125892810}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, views agriculture as an evolutionary adaptation of plants and humans. Starting with domestication by protection of wild plants, it led to specialization of location and then full-fledged domestication.
* [[Peter Richerson]], [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]], and [[Robert Bettinger]]&lt;ref name="Richersonetal2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Richerson|first = Peter J.|authorlink =|year = 2001|title = Was Agriculture Impossible during the Pleistocene but Mandatory during the Holocene?|journal = American Antiquity|volume = 66|issue = 3|pages = 387–411|doi = 10.2307/2694241|displayauthors = etal |jstor = 2694241|last2 = Boyd|first2 = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; make a case for the development of agriculture coinciding with an increasingly stable climate at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. [[Ronald Wright]]'s book and Massey Lecture Series ''[[A Short History of Progress]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Short History of Progress|first=Ronald|last=Wright|publisher=Anansi|year=2004|isbn=978-0887847066}}&lt;/ref&gt; popularized this hypothesis.
* The postulated [[Younger Dryas event|Younger Dryas impact event]], claimed to be in part responsible for [[Quaternary extinction event|megafauna extinction]] and ending the last [[glacial period]], could have provided circumstances that required the evolution of agricultural societies for humanity to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=David G|author2=Albert C. Goodyear |author3=James Kennett |author4=Allen West |title=Multiple lines of evidence for possible Human population decline/settlement reorganization during the early Younger Dryas|journal=Quaternary International|date=2011|volume=242|issue=2|pages=570–583|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2011.04.020|bibcode=2011QuInt.242..570A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agrarian revolution itself is a reflection of typical overpopulation by certain species following initial events during extinction eras; this overpopulation itself ultimately propagates the extinction event.
* [[Leonid Grinin]] argues that whatever plants were cultivated, the independent invention of agriculture always took place in special natural environments (e.g., South-East Asia). It is supposed that the cultivation of cereals started somewhere in the Near East: in the hills of Palestine or Egypt. So Grinin dates the beginning of the agricultural revolution within the interval 12,000 to 9,000 BP, though in some cases the first cultivated plants or domesticated animals' bones are even of a more ancient age of 14–15 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L.E.

Volume 6, Number 2 / September 2007 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129510/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrew M. T. Moore|Andrew Moore]] suggested that the Neolithic Revolution originated over long periods of development in the [[Levant]], possibly beginning during the [[Epipaleolithic]]. In ''"A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution"'', [[Frank Hole]] further expanded the relationship between plant and [[animal domestication]]. He suggested the events could have occurred independently over different periods of time, in as yet unexplored locations. He noted that no transition site had been found documenting the shift from what he termed immediate and delayed return social systems. He noted that the full range of domesticated animals ([[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]] and [[pigs]]) were not found until the sixth millennium at [[Tell Ramad]]. Hole concluded that ''"close attention should be paid in future investigations to the western margins of the [[Euphrates]] basin, perhaps as far south as the [[Arabian Peninsula]], especially where [[wadi]]s carrying Pleistocene rainfall runoff flowed."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_1984_num_10_2_939 Hole, Frank., A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution, Paléorient, Volume 10, Issue 10-2, pp. 49-60, 1984.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once agriculture started gaining momentum, around 9000 BC, human activity resulted in the [[selective breeding]] of cereal grasses (beginning with [[emmer]], [[einkorn]] and [[barley]]), and not simply of those that would favour greater caloric returns through larger seeds. Plants with traits such as small seeds or bitter taste would have been seen as undesirable. Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest, therefore not stored and not seeded the following season; years of harvesting selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer.

Several plant species, the "pioneer crops" or [[Neolithic founder crops]], were identified by [[Daniel Zohary]], who highlighted the importance of the three [[cereal]]s, and suggested that domestication of [[flax]], [[pea]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]] and [[lentil]]s came a little later. Based on analysis of the [[gene]]s of domesticated plants, he preferred theories of a single, or at most a very small number of domestication events for each [[taxon]] that spread in an arc from the [[Levantine corridor]] around the [[Fertile Crescent]] and later into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRi1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;dq=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jSDLeRcJNI&amp;sig=V8u7my28ypj_bN_lBNIYmGc_HX8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cvUqUIbjFOmf0QXxp4GgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y Zohary, D., The mode of domestication of the founder crops of Southwest Asian agriculture. pp. 142-158 in D.

Monographie du CRA 6, Éditions Centre Nationale Recherches Scientifiques: Paris, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these pioneering attempts failed at first and crops were abandoned, sometimes to be taken up again and successfully domesticated thousands of years later: [[rye]], tried and abandoned in Neolithic [[Anatolia]], made its way to Europe as weed seeds and was successfully domesticated in Europe, thousands of years after the earliest agriculture.&lt;ref name="Weiss2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weiss | first = Ehud | authorlink = | author2 = Kislev, Mordechai E.; Hartmann, Anat | year = 2006 | title = Autonomous Cultivation Before Domestication | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 312 | issue = 5780 | pages = 1608–1610 | doi = 10.1126/science.1127235 | url =| pmid = 16778044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild lentils presented a different problem: most of the wild seeds do not germinate in the first year; the first evidence of lentil domestication, breaking dormancy in their first year, was found in the early Neolithic at [[Jerf el Ahmar]] (in modern Syria), and quickly spread south to the [[Netiv HaGdud]] site in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].&lt;ref name="Weiss2006" /&gt; This process of domestication allowed the founder crops to adapt and eventually become larger, more easily harvested, more dependable{{clarify|date=November 2016}} in storage and more useful to the human population.

Selectively propagated [[ficus|figs]], wild barley and wild oats were cultivated at the early Neolithic site of [[Gilgal I]], where in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/06/060602074522.htm|title=Tamed 11,400 Years Ago, Figs Were Likely First Domesticated Crop}}&lt;/ref&gt; archaeologists found caches of seeds of each in quantities too large to be accounted for even by [[intensive gathering]], at strata datable to c. 11,000 years ago. Some of the plants tried and then abandoned during the Neolithic period in the Ancient Near East, at sites like Gilgal, were later successfully domesticated in other parts of the world.

Once early farmers perfected their agricultural techniques like irrigation, their crops would [[Crop yield|yield]] surpluses that needed storage. Most hunter gatherers could not easily store food for long due to their migratory lifestyle, whereas those with a sedentary dwelling could store their surplus grain. Eventually [[granary|granaries]] were developed that allowed villages to store their seeds longer. So with more food, the population expanded and communities developed specialized workers and more advanced tools.

The process was not as linear as was once thought, but a more complicated effort, which was undertaken by different human populations in different regions in many different ways.

===In the Fertile Crescent===

Early agriculture is believed to have originated and become widespread in Southwest [[Asia]] around 10,000–9,000 BP, though earlier individual sites have been identified. The [[Fertile Crescent]] region of Southwest Asia is the centre of domestication for three cereals (einkorn wheat, emmer wheat and barley), four legumes (lentil, pea, bitter vetch and chickpea), and flax. Domestication was a slow process involving multiple sites for each crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Brown | first1=T. A. | last2=Jones | first2=M.

===In Africa===
[[File:Nile-River1.ogv|thumb|right|Nile River Valley, Egypt]]

On the African continent, three areas have been identified as independently developing agriculture: the [[Ethiopian Highlands|Ethiopian highlands]], the [[Sahel]] and [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{cite book |last=Diamond|first= Jared|authorlink=Jared Diamond| year=1999|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel|publisher= New York: Norton Press|isbn= 978-0393317558|title-link= Guns, Germs, and Steel}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast,   [[Agriculture in Egypt|Agriculture in the Nile River Valley]] is thought to have developed from the original Neolithic Revolution in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. 
Many grinding stones are found with the early Egyptian [[Sebilian]] and [[Mechian]] cultures and evidence has been found of a neolithic domesticated crop-based economy dating around 7,000 BP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JAca1F3qG34C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Africa,+neolithic&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wWVGAvbwDC&amp;sig=oLsfZADAq2fplcionxe5hXjBgXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V8GKSaSbO9eitge6-eibBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA76,M1 The Cambridge History of Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, Philip E.L., Stone Age Man on the Nile, Scientific American Vol. 235 No. 2, August 1976: "With the benefit of hindsight we can now see that many Late Paleolithic peoples in the Old World were poised on the brink of plant cultivation and animal husbandry as an alternative to the hunter-gatherer's way of life".&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the Middle East, this evidence appears as a "false dawn" to agriculture, as the sites were later abandoned, and permanent farming then was delayed until 6,500 BP with the [[Tasian]] and [[Badarian]] cultures and the arrival of crops and animals from the Near East.

[[Bananas]] and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], which were first domesticated in [[Southeast Asia]], most likely [[Papua New Guinea]], were re-domesticated in Africa possibly as early as 5,000 years ago. Asian yams and [[taro]] were also cultivated in Africa.&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

The most famous crop domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands is [[coffee]]. In addition, [[khat]], [[ensete]], [[noog]], [[teff]] and [[finger millet]] were also domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands. Crops domesticated in the Sahel region include [[sorghum]] and [[pearl millet]]. The [[kola nut]] was first domesticated in West Africa. Other crops domesticated in West Africa include [[African rice]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] and the [[oil palm]].&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

Agriculture spread to Central and Southern Africa in the [[Bantu expansion]] during the 1st millennium BC to 1st millennium AD.

===In the Americas===
{{further|New World Crops|Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Oasisamerica|Proto-Uto-Aztecan}}

[[Maize]] (corn), [[beans]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]] were among the earliest crops domesticated in [[Mesoamerica]], with maize beginning about 4000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Johannessen, S. |editor2=Hastorf, C. A. |title=Corn and Culture in the Prehistoric New World |publisher=Westview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; squash as early as 6000 BC, and beans by no later than 4000 BC. [[Potatoes]] and [[manioc]] were domesticated in [[South America]]. In what is now the eastern United States, Native Americans domesticated [[sunflower]], [[sumpweed]] and [[goosefoot]] around 2500 BC. Sedentary village life based on farming did not develop until the second millennium BC, referred to as the formative period.&lt;ref name="Barker2009p252"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme Barker|title=The Agricultural Revolution in Prehistory: Why Did Foragers Become Farmers?|page=  252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkifXu2gx4YC|accessdate=4 January 2012|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199559954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In New Guinea===
Evidence of drainage ditches at [[Kuk Swamp]] on the borders of the [[Western Highlands Province|Western]] and [[Southern Highlands Province|Southern Highlands]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] shows evidence of the cultivation of [[taro]] and a variety of other crops, dating back to 11,000 BP. Two potentially significant economic species, taro (''[[Colocasia esculenta]]'') and [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] (''[[Dioscorea]]'' sp.), have been identified dating at least to 10,200 calibrated years before present (cal BP). Further evidence of [[banana]]s and [[sugarcane]] dates to 6,950 to 6,440 BP. This was at the altitudinal limits of these crops, and it has been suggested that cultivation in more favourable ranges in the lowlands may have been even earlier. [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] has found evidence that taro was introduced into the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands]] for human use, from 28,000 years ago, making taro cultivation the earliest crop in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Denham, Tim et al. (received July 2005) "Early and mid Holocene tool-use and processing of taro (''Colocasia esculenta''), yam (''Dioscorea'' sp.) and other plants at Kuk Swamp in the highlands of Papua New Guinea" (Journal of Archaeological Science, Volume 33, Issue 5, May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoy, Thomas &amp; Matthew Springs (1992), " Direct evidence for human use of plants 28,000 years ago: starch residues on stone artefacts from the northern Solomon Islands" (Antiquity  Volume: 66,  Number: 253, pp. 898–912)&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems to have resulted in the spread of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] from New Guinea east into the Solomon Islands and west into [[Timor]] and adjacent areas of [[Indonesia]]. This seems to confirm the theories of [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Sauer]] who, in "Agricultural Origins and Dispersals", suggested as early as 1952 that this region was a centre of early agriculture.

==Domestication of animals==
{{Further|Domestication of animals}}
When hunter-gathering began to be replaced by sedentary food production it became more profitable to keep animals close at hand.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Therefore, it became necessary to bring animals permanently to their settlements, although in many cases there was a distinction between relatively sedentary farmers and nomadic herders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|title=The Development of Agriculture|work=Genographic Project|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en-US|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414142437/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|archivedate=2016-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=November 2016}} The animals' size, temperament, diet, mating patterns, and life span were factors in the desire and success in domesticating animals. Animals that provided milk, such as cows and goats, offered a source of protein that was renewable and therefore quite valuable. The animal’s ability as a worker (for example ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account. Besides being a direct source of food, certain animals could provide leather, wool, hides, and fertilizer. Some of the earliest domesticated animals included dogs ([[East Asia]], about 15,000 years ago),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Domestication of animals in the Middle East===
[[File:Menare.jpg|Dromedary caravan in Algeria|thumb|right]]

The Middle East served as the source for many animals that could be domesticated, such as sheep, goats and pigs. This area was also the first region to [[domesticate]] the [[dromedary]]. [[Henri Fleisch]] discovered and termed the [[Shepherd Neolithic]] [[flint]] industry from the [[Bekaa Valley]] in [[Lebanon]] and suggested that it could have been used by the earliest [[nomad]]ic [[shepherd]]s. He dated this industry to the [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] as it is evidently not [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] or even [[Pottery]] [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Préhistoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development. As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier, many of the farmers were forced to leave, taking their domesticated animals with them. It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that would later help distribute these animals to the rest of [[Afroeurasia]]. This emigration was mainly on an east-west axis of similar climates, as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes. For instance, wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates, just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates. Some authors, like [[Jared Diamond]], have postulated that this East-West axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa, while it did not reach through the North-South axis of [[Africa]] to reach the Mediterranean climates of [[South Africa]], where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]: The Fates of Human Societies''. [[Jared Diamond]] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the African [[Zebu]] of central Africa and the domesticated bovines of the fertile-crescent — separated by the dry sahara desert — were not introduced into each other's region.

==Consequences==

===Social change===
[[File:World population growth (lin-log scale).png|thumb|left|320px|World population (estimated) did not rise for a few millennia after the Neolithic revolution.]]

Despite the significant technological advance, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects,
mostly diseases and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[[James C. Scott]],''Against the Grain: a Deep History of the Earliest States'', NJ:Yale UP, (2017), "The world's population in 10 000 BC, according to a careful estimate was roughly 4 million. A full five thousand years later it has risen only to 5 million...One likely explanation for this apparent human progress in subsistance techniques together with a long period of demographic stagnation is that epidemologically this was perhaps the most lethal period in human history".&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increase in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth.&lt;ref name="SandsMorris2009"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Sands DC, Morris CE, Dratz EA, Pilgeram A| title=Elevating optimal human nutrition to a central goal of plant breeding and production of plant-based foods. | journal=Plant Sci | year= 2009 | volume= 177 | issue= 5 | pages= 377–389 | pmid=20467463 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.07.011 | pmc=2866137 |  type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKeefeCordain2004"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=O'Keefe JH, Cordain L| title=Cardiovascular disease resulting from a diet and lifestyle at odds with our Paleolithic genome: how to become a 21st-century hunter-gatherer. | journal=Mayo Clin Proc | year= 2004 | volume= 79 | issue= 1 | pages= 101–108 | pmid=14708953 | doi=10.4065/79.1.101 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shermer, Michael 2001 p.250"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shermer, Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer |year=2001 |title=The Borderlands of Science |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average height went down from 5'10" (178&amp;nbsp;cm) for men and 5'6" (168&amp;nbsp;cm) for women to 5'5" (165&amp;nbsp;cm) and 5'1" (155&amp;nbsp;cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hermanussen | first=Michael | last2=Poustka | first2=Fritz | title=Stature of early Europeans | journal=Hormones (Athens) | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=175–178 |date=July–September 2003 | pmid=17003019 | doi=10.1159/000079404 | url=http://hormones.gr/preview.php?c_id=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making.&lt;ref name="Eagly99"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eagly, Alice H. |author2=Wood, Wendy |title=The Origins of Sex Differences in Human Behavior: Evolved Dispositions Versus Social Roles |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=June 1999 |pages=408–423 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/facets/eagly&amp;wood.htm |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.408}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] (in [[The World Until Yesterday]]) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently. The result is that a population can increase more rapidly. Diamond, in agreement with feminist scholars such as [[V. Spike Peterson]], points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged [[gender inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diamond, Jared |authorlink=Jared Diamond |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1987/may/02-the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race  |title=The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race |journal=Discover Magazine |date=May 1987 |pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=V.

===Subsequent revolutions===
[[File:Egyptian Domesticated Animals.jpg|thumb|Domesticated cow being milked in [[Ancient Egypt]]]]

[[Andrew Sherratt]] has argued that following upon the Neolithic Revolution was a second phase of discovery that he refers to as the [[secondary products revolution]]. Animals, it appears, were first domesticated purely as a source of meat.&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"&gt;Sherratt 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The Secondary Products Revolution occurred when it was recognised that animals also provided a number of other useful products. These included:
* [[History of hide materials|hides and skins (from undomesticated animals)]]
* [[manure]] for soil conditioning (from all domesticated animals)
* [[wool]] (from sheep, llamas, alpacas, and [[Angora goat]]s)
* [[milk]] (from goats, cattle, yaks, sheep, horses and camels)
* [[Working animal|traction]] (from oxen, [[onagers]], donkeys, horses, camels and dogs)
* guarding and herding assistance (dogs)

Sherratt argued that this phase in agricultural development enabled humans to make use of the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for farming. It also made possible [[nomadic pastoralism]] in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the [[dromedary]] and [[Bactrian camel]].&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"/&gt; Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts.

Living in one spot would have more easily permitted the accrual of personal possessions and an attachment to certain areas of land. From such a position, it is argued{{by whom|date=May 2015}}, prehistoric people were able to stockpile food to survive lean times and trade unwanted surpluses with others. Once [[trade]] and a secure food supply were established, populations could grow, and society would have diversified into food producers and artisans, who could afford to develop their trade by virtue of the free time they enjoyed because of a surplus of food. The artisans, in turn, were able to develop technology such as metal weapons. Such relative complexity would have required some form of social organisation to work efficiently, so it is likely that populations that had such organisation, perhaps such as that provided by religion, were better prepared and more successful. In addition, the denser populations could form and support legions of professional soldiers. Also, during this time property ownership became increasingly important to all people. Ultimately, Childe argued that this growing social complexity, all rooted in the original decision to settle, led to a second [[Urban Revolution]] in which the first cities were built.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Disease===

Throughout the development of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed. Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution, as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population. Some examples of [[infectious diseases]] spread from animals to humans are [[influenza]], [[smallpox]], and [[measles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Furuse | first1=Y. | last2=Suzuki | first2=A. | last3=Oshitani | first3=H. | title=Origin of measles virus: Divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-7-52 | journal=Virology Journal | volume=7 | page=52 | year=2010 | pmc=2838858 | pmid=20202190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In concordance with a process of [[natural selection]], the humans who first domesticated the big [[mammals]] quickly built up immunities to the diseases as within each generation the individuals with better immunities had better chances of survival. In their approximately 10,000 years of shared proximity with animals, such as cows, Eurasians and Africans became more resistant to those diseases compared with the indigenous populations encountered outside [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''.  [[Jared Diamond]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the population of most [[Caribbean]] and several [[Pacific Islands]] have been completely wiped out by diseases. 90% or more of many populations of the Americas were [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|wiped out by European and African diseases]] before recorded contact with European explorers or colonists. Some cultures like the [[Inca Empire]] did have a large domestic mammal, the [[llama]], but llama milk was not drunk, nor did llamas live in a closed space with humans, so the risk of contagion was limited. According to bioarchaeological research, the effects of agriculture on physical and dental health in Southeast Asian rice farming societies from 4000 to 1500 B.P. was not detrimental to the same extent as in other world regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Halcrow |first=S. |author2=E., Harris, N.

===Technology===

In his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] argues that Europeans and East Asians benefited from an advantageous geographical location that afforded them a head start in the Neolithic Revolution. Both shared the temperate climate ideal for the first agricultural settings, both were near a number of easily [[domestication|domesticable]] plant and animal species, and both were safer from attacks of other people than civilizations in the middle part of the Eurasian continent. Being among the first to adopt agriculture and sedentary lifestyles, and neighboring other early agricultural societies with whom they could compete and trade, both Europeans and East Asians were also among the first to benefit from technologies such as [[firearm]]s and steel [[sword]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/overview_british_prehistory_01.shtml|title=BBC – History – Ancient History in depth: Overview: From Neolithic to Bronze Age, 8000–800 BC|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--During and after the [[Age of Discovery]], European explorers, such as the Spanish [[conquistador]]s, encountered other groups of people who had never or only recently adopted agriculture. (SO WHAT?)--&gt;

==Archaeogenetics==
The dispersal of Neolithic culture from the Middle East has recently been associated with the distribution of human genetic markers. In Europe, the spread of the Neolithic culture has been associated with distribution of the [[E1b1b]] lineages and [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]] that are thought to have arrived in Europe from North Africa and the Near East respectively.&lt;ref name="semino2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Semino|year=2004|title=Origin, Diffusion, and Differentiation of Y-Chromosome Haplogroups E and J: Inferences on the Neolithization of Europe and Later Migratory Events in the Mediterranean Area|pmid=15069642|first1=O|last2=Magri|first2=C|last3=Benuzzi|first3=G|last4=Lin|first4=AA|last5=Al-Zahery|first5=N|last6=Battaglia|first6=V|last7=MacCioni|first7=L|last8=Triantaphyllidis|first8=C|last9=Shen|first9=P|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1023–34|doi=10.1086/386295|pmc=1181965|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lancaster"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lancaster|first=Andrew|year=2009|url=http://www.jogg.info/51/files/Lancaster.pdf|journal=Journal of Genetic Genealogy|volume=5|issue=1|title=Y Haplogroups, Archaeological Cultures and Language Families: a Review of the Multidisciplinary Comparisons using the case of E-M35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, the spread of farming, and notably the [[Bantu expansion]], is associated with the dispersal of Y-chromosome haplogroup [[E1b1a]] from West Africa.&lt;ref name="semino2004"/&gt;

'''RailTel Corporation of India Ltd.''' is a "[[Miniratna]]" (public sector) enterprise of [[Government of India]] focusing on providing [[broadband]] and [[VPN]] services. RailTel was formed in September 2000 with the objective of creating nationwide broadband, telecom and multimedia network, to modernise train control operation and safety system of [[Indian Railways]]. RailTel's network passes through around 5,000 stations across the country, covering all major commercial centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=100106 |title=RAILTEL Celebrates its Annual Day|date=18 October 2013 |publisher=Press Information Bureau, Indian government|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Indian Railways (IR) was initially solely dependent on the Department of Telecom (now [[BSNL]]) for their control and administrative communication circuits. To increase circuit efficiency, the Railways began building up its own communication systems from early 1970s based on overhead telephone lines, quad cables and [[microwave]] signalling. In 1983, the Railway Reforms Committee decided to introduce [[optical fibre cable]] (OFC) based communications in IR to provide safety, reliability, availability and serviceability through use of a dedicated network. The decision was also taken to create a network independent of the DoT and replace the existing microwave telecom systems (60% of which had reached end of life) with OFC.

Indian Railways commissioned the first OFC on the [[Western line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)|Churchgate–Virar line]] in Mumbai in 1988 for train operation and control purpose, which consisted of 60&amp;nbsp;km of network across 28 stations. The network was expanded in Central India with the commissioning of 900&amp;nbsp;km of OFC network in 1991–92 across Durg–Nagpur, Nagpur–Itarsi and Itarsi–Bhusaval sections of the [[Howrah–Nagpur–Mumbai line]], and in Eastern India with the commissioning of 60&amp;nbsp;km of OFC network in [[Tatanagar–Bilaspur section|Tatanagar–Chakradhrapur section]] of the same line.

The second National Telecom Policy in 1999 opened the National Long-Distance segment under favourable licensing conditions with revenue sharing to assist mobile network operators to spread their networks across India. In 2000, the Government announced the formation of a telecom corporation to build a nationwide broadband multimedia telecommunication network. RailTel was established in September 2000 as a [[Public Sector Undertaking]] (PSU), wholly owned by the Indian Railways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railtelindia.com/profile/about-us.html Rural Broadband Connectivity Provider in India | RailTel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wi-Fi and WiMax===
RailTel, in collaboration with Google, provides free [[WiFi]] access at selected railways stations across India. Google chose railway stations as the location to provide free WiFi because stations have access to reliable power supply and fibre provided by RailTel, and because the passengers at a station come from all demographics of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google teams up with RailTel to give free Wifi to all railway stations in India|url=http://www.indialivetoday.com/google-teams-up-with-railtel-to-give-free-wifi-to-all-railway-stations-in-india/16505.html|website=India Live Today|accessdate=25 August 2016|date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free WiFi service was launched at [[Mumbai Central railway station]] in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-central-gets-googles-highspeed-wifi-network/article8140702.ece Mumbai Central gets Google's Wi-Fi network – The Hindu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the service was expanded to 9 more railway stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google, RailTel expand free WiFi reach, cover 9 more stations|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/google-railtel-expand-free-wifi-reach-cover-9-more-stations-116041500438_1.html|publisher=''[[Business Standard]]''|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, Google announced that free Wi-Fi was available across 19 stations in India and was being used by over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1.5&amp;nbsp;million Indians enjoy high Speed Wi-Fi across 19 Railway Stations|url=http://googleindia.blogspot.in/2016/06/15-million-indians-enjoy-high-speed-wi.html|website=Official Google India Blog|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google and RailTel plan to provide free WiFi at 100 railway stations across the country by the end of 2016.

In September 2016, Google announced a public WiFi initiative called Google Station. Google plans to expand free WiFi coverage under the initiative to locations such as cafes and malls across India, and later expand worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byford|first1=Sam|title=Google Station is a new platform that aims to make public Wi-Fi better|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13070922/google-station-public-wi-fi-india|website=The Verge|accessdate=28 September 2016|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Google announced that it's Free Wi-Fi project is now powering 400 Indian railway stations. As a result, there are now more than 8 million people accessing the internet each month via the project.&lt;ref&gt;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/google-says-free-wifi-available-at-400-railway-stations/articleshow/64492865.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railwire===
Based on its nationwide fibre network, RailTel offers various bandwidth intensive application to its customers. One such initiative is RailWire, a joint venture with MSOs to provide Voice, Video and Multimedia access on a single wire at a customer's home or office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RailTel to tie up with MSOs to expand internet base in rural T.N.|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/railtel-to-tie-up-with-msos-to-expand-internet-base-in-rural-tn/article5387079.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=25 November 2013|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

'''Recife Antigo''' ('''Old Recife''') is the historical section of central [[Recife]], [[Brazil]]. It is located on the Island of Recife, near the Recife harbor. This historic area has been recently recovered and now holds several clubs, bars and a high-tech center called ''Porto Digital''.

==History==
Recife Antigo consists of the initial [[Portugal|Portuguese]] settlement in the 16th century around the port. [[Sugar cane]] production from [[Pernambuco]] was delivered to Portugal through Recife's port. While Recife had port functions, [[Olinda]] was the capital. In 1630, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] invaded Pernambuco, set Olinda partially on fire and Recife became the seat of the Dutch government. Count [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen|John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen]] became Governor-General of the [[New Holland (Brazil)|Dutch colony]] and built a new town on a neighboring island. This city was named [[Mauritsstadt]] and the [[Palacio do Campo das Princesas]], seat of the State of Pernambuco government, is built on its ruins. 

The Dutch were forced out in 1654 of a Recife with good infrastructure, for they had built canals and improved the port and the defenses of it. A flourishing [[Judaism|Jewish]] community lived in Recife under them and they had to leave it because of the Portuguese Inquisition. Thus, a group of 24 Portuguese Jews who had previously migrated from Portugal to the Netherlands because of antisemitism, headed farther North with the Dutch, where [[New Amsterdam]] --present-day Manhattan-- was founded. The first Synagogue built in the Americas, the [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], is located in Recife Antigo, on Rua do Bom Jesus, formerly Rua dos Judeus, or Street of the Jews. The Portuguese synagogue was founded in lower Manhattan and it is located on Central Park West in Manhattan nowadays under the name Portuguese &amp; Spanish synagogue.

'''Redshift''' is a techno-economic theory suggesting hypersegmentation{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} of [[information technology]] markets based on whether individual computing needs are over or under-served by [[Moore's law]], which predicts the doubling of computing transistors (and therefore roughly computing power) every two years.  The theory,
proposed and named by [[New Enterprise Associates]] partner and former [[Sun Microsystems]] CTO [[Greg Papadopoulos]], categorized a series of high growth markets (redshifting) while predicting slower GDP-driven growth in traditional computing markets (blueshifting). Papadopoulos predicted the result will be a fundamental redesign of components comprising computing systems.

==Hypergrowth market segments (redshifting)==
According to the Redshift theory, applications "redshift" when they grow dramatically faster than Moore's Law allows, growing quickly in their absolute number of systems.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"&gt;Greg Papadopoulos: Sun Analyst Summit 2007, http://sun.feedroom.com/linking/?skin=oneclip&amp;fr_story=FEEDROOM178646&amp;hl=false&lt;/ref&gt;  In these markets, customers are running out of datacenter real-estate, power and cooling infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, June 14, 2006: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/technology/14search.html?ex=1307937600&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dell]] Senior Vice President Brad Anderson, “Businesses requiring [[hyperscale]] computing environments – where infrastructure deployments are measured by up to millions of servers, storage and networking equipment – are changing the way they approach IT.”&lt;ref&gt;Dell Press Release: http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_03_27_rr_000?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp&lt;/ref&gt;

While various Redshift proponents offer minor alterations on the original presentation, “Redshifting” generally includes:&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

=== ΣBW (Sum-of-[[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]]) ===
These are companies that drive heavy [[Internet]] traffic.  This includes popular web-portals like [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], [[AOL]] and [[MSN]].  It also includes [[Telecommunications service provider|telecoms]], multimedia, television over IP, online games like [[World of Warcraft]] and others.{{which|date=November 2010}}  This segment has been enabled by widespread availability of high-bandwidth Internet connections to consumers through a [[DSL]] or [[cable modem]]. A simple way to understand this market is that for every [[byte]] of content served to a PC, mobile phone or other device over a network, there must exist computing systems to send it over the network.

=== [[High performance computing]] (HPC) ===
These are companies that do complex simulations that involve (for example) weather, stock markets or drug-design simulations.  This is a generally elastic market because businesses frequently spend every "available" dollar budgeted for IT. A common anecdote claims that cutting the cost of computing by half causes customers in this segment to buy at least twice as much, because each marginal IT dollar spent contributes to business advantage.

=== *prise (or "Star-prise") ===
These are companies that aggregate traditional computing applications and offer them as services, typically in the form of [[Software as a service|Software as a Service (SaaS)]].  For example, companies that deploy [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] are over-served by Moore's Law, but companies that aggregate CRM functions and offer them as a service, such as [[Salesforce.com]], grow faster than Moore's Law.

=== The eBay crisis ===
A prime example of redshift was a crisis at [[eBay]].  In 1999 eBay suffered a database crisis when a single [[Oracle Database]] running on the fastest [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] machine available (these tracking Moore's law in this period) was not enough to cope with eBay's growth.  The solution was to massively parallelise their system architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smoothspan.wordpress.com/2007/08/30/youve-already-had-a-multicore-crisis-and-just-didnt-realize-it/ You’ve Already Had a Multicore Crisis and Just Didn’t Realize It!] (Bob Warfield, ''SmoothSpan Blog'', 2007-08-30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randy Shoup and Dan Pritchett. [http://www.addsimplicity.com/downloads/eBaySDForum2006-11-29.pdf "The eBay Architecture: Striking a balance between site stability, feature velocity, performance, and cost."] SD Forum 2006 proceedings, November 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional computing markets (blueshifting)==
Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets, such as those serving [[enterprise resource planning]] or [[customer relationship management]] applications, have reached relative saturation in industrialized nations.  Thereafter, proponents argued further market growth will closely follow [[gross domestic product]] growth, which typically remains under 10% for most countries annually. Given that Moore's Law continues to predict accurately the rate of computing transistor growth, which roughly translates into computing power doubling every two years, the Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets will ultimately contract as a percentage of computing expenditures over time.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

Functionally, this means “Blueshifting” customers can satisfy computing requirement growth by swapping in faster processors without increasing the absolute number of computing systems.

==Consequences and industry commentary==
Papadopoulos argued that while traditional computing markets remain the dominant source of revenue through the late 2000s, a shift to hypergrowth markets will inevitably occur.  When that shift occurs, he argued computing (but not computers) will become a utility, and differentiation in
the IT market will be based upon a company's ability to deliver computing at massive scale, efficiently and with predictable service levels, much like electricity at that time.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

If computing is to be delivered as a utility, [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] suggested Papadopoulos' vision compares with [[Microsoft]] researcher Jim Hamilton, who both agree that computing is most efficiently generated in [[shipping containers]]&lt;!-- Makes no sense --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Rough Type (Nicholas Carr's blog): http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/02/the_future_of_c.php and http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/03/showdown_in_the_1.php&lt;/ref&gt; Industry analysts are also beginning to quantify Redshifting and Blueshifting markets.  According to [[International Data Corporation]] vice president Matthew Eastwood, "IDC believes that the IT market is in a period of hyper segmentation... This a class of customers that is Moore's law driven and as price performance gains continue, IDC believes that these organizations will accelerate their consumption of IT infrastructure.”&lt;ref&gt;IDC Link: http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=lcUS20623507&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and nomenclature==
Key portions of Papadopoulos' theory were first presented by Sun Microsystems CEO [[Jonathan I. Schwartz|Jonathan Schwartz]] in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Blackbox Press Conference: http://sun.feedroom.com/?skin=oneclip&amp;fr_story=73d774789da2b024c111f8cfc7948af6d1577827&amp;rf=bm&lt;/ref&gt; Papadopoulos later gave a full presentation on Redshift to Sun's annual Analyst Summit&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt; in February 2007. The term [[Redshift]] refers to what happens when electromagnetic radiation, usually visible light, moves away from an observer.  Papadopoulos chose this term to reflect growth markets because redshift helped cosmologists explain the expansion of the universe.

Papadopoulos originally depicted traditional IT markets as green to represent their revenue base, but later changed them to “blueshift,” which occurs when a light source moves toward an observer, similar to what would happen during a contraction of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, April 12, 2007: http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9013563&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Release notes''' are documents that are distributed with software products, sometimes when the product is still in the development or test state (e.g., a [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] release). For products that have already been in use by clients, the release note is delivered to the customer when an update is released.

==Purpose and Responsibilities==
Release notes are documents that are shared with end users, customers and clients of an organization. The definition of the terms 'End Users', 'Clients' and 'Customers' are very relative in nature and might have various interpretations based on the specific context. For instance, Quality Assurance group within a software development organization can be interpreted as an internal customer. They detail the corrections, changes or enhancements made to the service or product the company provides. This document is usually circulated only after the product or service is thoroughly tested and approved against the specification provided by the development team. However this document might also be provided as an artifact accompanying the deliverables for System Testing and System Integration Testing and other managed environments especially with reference to an information technology organization.

Release notes can also contain test results and information about the [[Software testing|test procedure]]. This kind of information gives readers of the release note more confidence in the fix/change done; this information also enables implementer of the change to conduct rudimentary [[Acceptance testing|acceptance tests]].

==Content and Format==
There is no standard format for release notes that is followed throughout different organizations. Organizations normally adopt their own formatting styles based on the requirement and type of the information to be circulated. The content of release notes also vary according to the release type. For products that are at testing stage and that are newly released, the content is usually more descriptive compared to release notes for bug fixes and feature enhancements, which are usually brief. 
Release notes may include the following sections:
* '''Header''' – Document Name (i.e. Release Notes), product name, release number, release date, note date, note version, etc.
* '''Overview''' - A brief overview of the product and changes, in the absence of other formal documentation.
* '''Purpose''' - A brief overview of the purpose of the release note with a listing of what is new in this release, including [[bug fix]]es and new features.
* '''Issue Summary''' - A short description of the bug or the enhancement in the release.
* '''Steps to Reproduce''' - The steps that were followed when the bug was encountered.
* '''Resolution''' - A short description of the modification/enhancement that was made to fix the bug.
* '''End-User Impact''' - What different actions are needed by the end-users of the application.  This should include whether other functionality is impacted by these changes.
* '''Support Impacts''' - Changes required in the daily process of administering the software.
* '''Notes''' - Notes about software or hardware [[Installation (computer programs)|installation]], upgrades and product documentation (including documentation updates)
* '''Disclaimers''' - Company and standard product related messages. e.g.; [[freeware]], [[Copy protection#Anti-piracy|anti-piracy]], duplication etc.. See also [[Disclaimer]].
* '''Contact''' - Support contact information.

A release note is usually a terse summary of recent changes, enhancements and bug fixes in a particular software release. It is not a substitute for [[user guide]]s. Release notes are frequently written in the present tense and provide information that is clear, correct, and complete.

'''RingGo''' is a [[pay by phone parking]] service, based in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burtonmail.co.uk/news/local-news/parking-burton-railway-station-can-1422111|title=New passenger parking scheme at Burton Railway Station|last=Pridding|first=Beth|date=2018-04-13|work=burtonmail|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It processes over 2 million phone parking transactions a month and over 6 million individual UK motorists have used the service.  Offered in public car parks and on-street locations across the [[United Kingdom]] it is now deployed in support of over 100 local authorities.  The first major implementation (from June 2006) was for the [[First Great Western]] Railway in 60 stations. The project by the [[FirstGroup]], was an early step in the trend away from the established system of paying for parking using electro-mechanical machines which dispense paper tickets – the [[pay and display]] model.

Railways were a major area of early stage growth.  Franchises that adopted the service included [[Network Rail]], [[Chiltern Railways]], [[South West Trains]], [[First Capital Connect]], [[National Express East Anglia]], [[c2c]], [[First TransPennine Express]], [[Arriva Trains Wales]] and [[East Coast Railway]].  The service has also been offered in [[National Car Parks|NCP]] operated and managed car parks since March 2010.

Parking was an early area in which [[electronic money]] as opposed to cash-money made considerable advances although it has been overtaken since in sectors such as mass transportation.

On 1 October 2009, Richmond Council introduced variable parking charges which were linked to the [[carbon dioxide emissions]] of vehicles parking there (carbon metered parking).  Payment of the service was either via RingGo or by a Richmond [[smart card]], which could be used in the machine.

Milton Keynes Council, Richmond Council, Lewisham Council and, from November 2014, Westminster council provide online parking permits that are an extension of the RingGo phone parking service

The RingGo brand is owned by Cobalt Telephone Technologies Ltd, a UK private company headquartered in Basingstoke, Hampshire. Cobalt was acquired by the [[Parkmobile Group]] in August 2012.  The Parkmobile group is a global specialist in phone parking and has similar operations in support of cities, railways and municipalities in North America, The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13175">A '''room-[[High-temperature superconductor|temperature superconductor]]''' is a [[hypothetical]] material that would be capable of exhibiting [[superconductivity]] at [[operating temperature]]s above 0&amp;nbsp;[[celsius|°C]] (273.15&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]). While this is not strictly "room temperature", which would be approximately 20–25&amp;nbsp;°C, it is the temperature at which ice forms and can be reached and easily maintained in an everyday environment. The highest temperature known superconducting material is [[high pressure|highly pressurized]] [[hydrogen sulfide]], the [[transition temperature]] of which is {{convert|203|K|°C}}, the highest accepted superconducting critical temperature as of 2015.&lt;ref name=cart15&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cartlidge|first1=Edwin|title=Superconductivity record sparks wave of follow-up physics|url=https://www.nature.com/news/superconductivity-record-sparks-wave-of-follow-up-physics-1.18191|journal=Nature|volume=524|issue=7565|pages=277|accessdate=18 August 2015|date=18 August 2015|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.18191|pmid=26289188}}&lt;/ref&gt; By substituting a small part of sulfur with phosphorus and using even higher pressures, it has been predicted that it may be possible to raise the critical temperature to above 0&amp;nbsp;°C and achieve room-temperature superconductivity.&lt;ref name=cart15/&gt; Previously the record was held by the [[High-temperature superconductor#Cuprates|cuprates]], which have demonstrated superconductivity at [[atmospheric pressure]] at temperatures as high as {{convert|138|K|°C}}, and {{convert|164|K|°C}} under high pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Claims of "near-room temperature" transient effects date from the early 1950s and some suggest that in fact the breakthrough might have been made more than once but could not be made stable enough and/or reproducible as the relationship between isotope number and T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; was not known at the time.

==Reports==
Since the discovery of [[high-temperature superconductor]]s, several materials have been reported to be room-temperature [[superconductor]]s, although none of these reports has been confirmed.

In 2000, while extracting electrons from [[diamond]] during [[ion implantation]] work, Johan Prins claimed to have observed a phenomenon that he explained as room-temperature superconductivity within a [[Phase (matter)|phase]] formed on the surface of oxygen-doped type [[Diamond|IIa diamonds]] in a [[Vacuum|{{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mbar}} vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2012, an ''[[Advanced Materials]]'' article claimed superconducting behavior of graphite powder after treatment with pure water at temperatures as high as 300&amp;nbsp;K and above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2014, an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggested that some materials, notably YBCO ([[yttrium barium copper oxide]]), could be made to superconduct at room temperature using [[infrared laser]] pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2015, an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by researchers of the Max Planck Institute suggested that under certain conditions such as extreme pressure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S transitioned to a superconductive form H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S at around 1.5 million times atmospheric pressure in a [[diamond anvil cell]]. The critical temperature is 203&amp;nbsp;K which would be the highest T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; ever recorded and their research suggests that other hydrogen compounds could superconduct at up to 260&amp;nbsp;K which would match up with the original research of Ashcroft.&lt;ref name=cart15/&gt;&lt;ref name=GeZhangYao2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Ge|first1=Y.

In 2018, Dev Kumar Thapa and Anshu Pandey from the Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore claimed the observation of superconductivity at ambient pressure and room temperature in films and pellets of a nanostructured material that is composed of silver particles embedded in a gold matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evidence for Superconductivity at Ambient Temperature and Pressure in Nanostructures|first=Dev Kumar |last=Thapa |first2=Anshu |last2=Pandey |arxiv = 1807.08572 |bibcode = 2018arXiv180708572T |year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Due to similar noise patterns of supposedly independent plots and the not peer-reviewed nature of this publication, the results were called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/iisc-duos-claim-of-ambient-superconductivity-may-have-support-in-theory/article24725793.ece?homepage=true |title=IISc duo's claim of ambient superconductivity may have support in theory |last=Desikan |first=Shubashree |date=2018-08-18 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, researchers noted a possible superconducting phase at 260K in lanthanum decahydride at elevated (200GPa) pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Grant |doi=10.1063/PT.6.1.20180823b |title= Pressurized superconductors approach room-temperature realm |journal = Physics Today |date= 2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research also suggests a link between the palladium hydride containing small impurities of sulfur as a plausible explanation for the anomalous resistance drops noticed by other researchers, and hydrogen absorption by cuprates has been suggested in light of the recent results in [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] as a plausible explanation for transient resistance drops or "USO" noticed
in the 1990s during research after the discovery of YBCO.{{CN|date=September 2016}}

==Theories==
Theoretical work by [[Neil Ashcroft]] predicted that solid [[metallic hydrogen]] at extremely high pressure (~500&amp;nbsp;GPa) should become superconducting at approximately room-temperature because of its extremely high [[speed of sound]] and expected strong [[coupling (physics)|coupling]] between the conduction electrons and the lattice vibrations ([[phonon]]s).&lt;ref name=Ashc1968&gt;

A team at Harvard has claimed to make metallic hydrogen and reports a pressure of 495&amp;nbsp;GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/hydrogen-metal-revolution-technology-space-rockets-superconductor-harvard-university-a7548221.html | title=Hydrogen turned into metal in stunning act of alchemy that could revolutionise technology and spaceflight |work=[[The Independent]] |language=en-UK |author=Ian Johnston |date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the exact critical temperature has not yet been determined, weak signs of a Meissner effect at 250K may have appeared in magnetometer tests.

In 1964, William A. Little proposed the possibility of high temperature superconductivity in [[organic polymers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A '''Rumford furnace''' is a [[kiln]] for the industrial scale production in the 19th century of [[calcium oxide]], popularly known as quicklime or burnt lime. It was named after its inventor, Benjamin Thompson, also known as [[Count Rumford]], and is sometimes called a [[Rüdersdorf]] furnace after the location where it was first built and from where the design rapidly spread throughout Europe.

==Technology==
Rumford’s innovation was to separate the combustion chambers for the limestone and the fuel. In previous designs, the fuel (traditionally wood or charcoal, later coal) was mixed with the limestone before burning, which meant that the quicklime end product was contaminated with ash and had to be laboriously cleaned. By separating the two it was possible to produce large quantities of high-quality quicklime for the booming 19th-century European construction industry. 

[[File:MP Rüdersdorf Rumfordofen 1.jpg|thumb| A Rumford furnace at the Rüdersdorf Museum Park near Berlin]]

In a Rumford furnace, fuel compartments surround the actual combustion chamber, each one being connected to it by a single transverse channel through which the hot air produced by the burning fuel flows into the stack and moves upward through the pile of limestone. The fuel ash waste falls into a separate chamber, from which it can be removed.
The limestone in the central shaft collapses as it burns to quicklime, making space for new limestone to be added to the top of the stack. The quicklime cools down as it slowly descends through the space below the channel connecting the stack to the firing compartment and is finally removed through an outlet at the bottom of the shaft. 
The upper part of the limestone shaft extends above the fuel compartments and its walls contain separate cavities filled with coal dust. This insulation supports the prewarming of the limestone before it moves into the vicinity of the hot air source.

==Historical development==
The first Rumford kiln was constructed in 1802&lt;ref&gt;750 Jahre Kalksteinbergbau in Rüdersdorf, Rüdersdorfer Zement GmbH, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; in Rüdersdorf near Berlin, and one of them can still be explored at the Museumspark Rüdersdorf. The innovation rapidly spread throughout Europe because it made it possible to produce quicklime far more efficiently than predecessor technologies. These required either batch production, waiting for each load to be assembled, burn and cool before removal, or carefully mixing the fuel and limestone in the appropriate proportions, burning them together, and then cleaning the contaminated limestone afterward.
In a Rumford kiln continuous operation was possible for the first time, since the addition of fuel and limestone as well as the removal of ash and quicklime could be separately optimized according to need, and all these operations could take place simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Vom Bergbau zu Industriereivier, Enzo Baraldi, Ekkehard Westermann, 1993, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

''' SMARC (‘Smart Mobility ARChitecture’)''' is a specification published by the Standardization Group for Embedded Technologies e.V. (SGET) for [[computer-on-module]]s (COMs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sget.org/news/view/article/sget-team-sdt01-has-passed-its-specification-with-the-smarc-standard.html?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=24 ''SGET team SDT.01 has passed its specification with the SMARC standard.'']. SGET.org. Retrieved 2013-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; SMARC Computer-on-Modules are specifically designed for the development of extremely compact low-power systems. Generally, SMARC modules are based on [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processors, they can, however, also be fitted with other low-power [[System on a chip|SoC]] architectures, like, for example, ones based on [[x86]] SoCs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.vdcresearch.com/embedded_hw/2013/02/vdc-initiating-coverage-on-smarc-embedded-coms.html''VDC Initiating Coverage on SMARC Embedded COMs '']&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, SMARC modules’ power requirement is in the range of a few watts, which opens up avenues to markets which to date could not be addressed due to processor designs with much higher power consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.iccmedia.com/pdf/ecefeb13/ecefeb13-page46-49-smarc_new-computer-on-module-standard-for-arm-soc-designs.pdf''SMARC – new Computer-on-Module standard for ARM/SoC designs'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer-on-Modules integrate the core function of a bootable computer, like SoC, as well as additional circuitry, including DRAM, boot-flash, voltage distribution, [[Ethernet]] and display transmitter. The modules are deployed together with an application-specific carrierboard, whose size and form can be defined to meet customer-specific requirements. The carrierboard executes the required interfaces and can integrate, if required, any further functionalities, such as audio codecs, touch controller, wireless communication interfaces, etc.

The SMARC specification outlines both the dimensions of the module and the positioning of the anchor points as well as the connector to the carrierboard and, most importantly, the executed interfaces with the pin-out. The pin-out is optimized for ARM and low-power SoC interfaces and is distinguished from classical PC interfaces by its target-oriented focus on low-power and mobile applications.

SMARC is based on the ULP-COM form factor&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.kontron.com/about-kontron/news-events/kontron+announces+the+release+candidate+of+the+ultra+lowpower+module+standard+for+arm+and+socbased+coms+.html''Kontron announces the release candidate of the ultra low-power module standard for ARM- and SoC-based COMs'']&lt;/ref&gt; which was introduced by the companies Kontron and Adlink in 2011. During the specification process by the SGET the standard was renamed to SMARC.

== Dimensions ==

SMARC defines two module sizes: 
* 82&amp;nbsp;mm × 50&amp;nbsp;mm for extremely compact low-power designs 
* 82&amp;nbsp;mm × 80&amp;nbsp;mm for SoCs with higher performance and with increased space and cooling requirement

== Connector ==

SMARC Computer-on-Modules have 314 card edge contacts on the [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) of the module which is plugged via a low-profile connector on the carrierboard. In most cases, the connector has a construction height of 4.3&amp;nbsp;mm. It is also used for [[Mobile PCI Express Module]] 3.0 graphic cards, which naturally have completely different pin assignments.

== Signal lines and pin assignments ==

Signal transmission is carried out via a total of 314 pins. 33 of these are reserved signal lines for power supply and grounding, so that with SMARC a total of 281 signal lines are effectively available. ARM- and SoC-typical energy-saving interfaces, like, for instance, parallel LCD for display connection, mobile industry processor interfaces for cameras, [[Serial Peripheral Interface]] (SPI) for general peripheral connection, [[I²S]] for audio and [[I2C]] are included. Besides these, classical computer interfaces such as [[USB]], [[Serial ATA|SATA]] and [[PCI Express]] are also defined.

In the current version of the SMARC specification not all of the 314 signal lines are assigned to fixed I/Os. The Alternate Function Block (AFB) has free pins available for different requirements. This is to ensure that the SMARC specification can flexibly accommodate up and coming technical developments which today are not foreseeable while remaining fully compatibility to previous designs. On the one hand, extended versions of the SMARC specification can assign new standard functions to these 20 AFB signal lines. On the other hand, the SMARC specification 1.0 currently lists the MOST (Media Oriented System Transport) bus, Dual [[Gigabit Ethernet]], Super Speed USB, or industrial network protocols which from a current point of view could be imagined as or might be assigned as interfaces of the AFB.

== Specification ==

The SMARC hardware specification V1.0 is supervised by the SGET. The specification is freely available as a download on the SGET website.

In [[information science]], an  '''upper ontology''' (also known as a '''top-level ontology''' or '''foundation ontology''') is an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] (in the sense used in information science) which consists of very general terms (such as "object", "property", "relation") that are common across all domains.  An important function of an upper ontology is to support broad [[semantic interoperability]] among a large number of domain-specific ontologies by providing a common starting point for the formulation of definitions. Terms in the domain ontology are ranked "under" the terms in the upper ontology, and the former stand to the latter in subclass relations.

A number of upper ontologies have been proposed, each with its own proponents. Each upper ontology can be considered as a computational implementation of [[natural philosophy]], which itself is a more empirical method for investigating the topics within the philosophical discipline of [[physical ontology]].

[[Library classification]] systems predate upper ontology systems. Though library classifications organize and categorize knowledge using general concepts that are the same across all knowledge domains, neither system is a replacement for the other.

==Development==

Any standard foundational ontology is likely to be contested among different groups, each with their own idea of "what exists". One factor exacerbating the failure to arrive at a common approach has been the lack of open-source applications that would permit the testing of different ontologies in the same computational environment.  The differences have thus been debated largely on theoretical grounds, or are merely the result of personal preferences. Foundational ontologies can however be compared on the basis of adoption for the purposes of supporting interoperability across domain ontologies.

No particular upper ontology has yet gained widespread acceptance as a [[de facto]] standard.  Different organizations have attempted to [[#Available ontologies|define standards]] for specific domains.  The '[[Process Specification Language]]' (PSL) created by the [[National Institute for Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is one example.

Another important factor leading to the absence of wide adoption of any existing upper ontology is the complexity. Some upper ontologies -- [[Cyc]] is often cited as an example in this regard—are very large, ranging up to thousands of elements (classes, relations), with complex interactions among them and with a complexity similar to that of a human [[natural language]], and the learning process can be even longer than for a natural language because of the unfamiliar format and logical rules.  The motivation to overcome this learning barrier is largely absent because of the paucity of publicly accessible examples of use.  As a result, those building domain ontologies for local applications tend to create the simplest possible domain-specific ontology, not related to any upper ontology.  Such domain ontologies may function adequately for the local purpose, but they are very time-consuming to relate accurately to other domain ontologies.

To solve this problem some genuinely top level ontologies have been developed, which are deliberately designed to have minimal overlap with any domain ontologies. Examples are [[Basic Formal Ontology]] and the [[Domain Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering|DOLCE]] (see below).

===Arguments for the infeasibility of an upper ontology===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Historically, many attempts in many societies{{which|date=December 2016}} have been made to impose or define a single set of concepts as more primal, basic, foundational, authoritative, true or rational than all others. A common objection{{By whom|date=December 2016}} to such attempts points out that humans lack the sort of  transcendent perspective - or ''[[God's eye view]]'' - that would be required to achieve this goal. Humans are bound by language or culture, and so lack the sort of objective perspective from which to observe the whole terrain of concepts and derive any one standard.

Another objection is the problem of formulating definitions. Top level ontologies are designed to maximize support for interoperability across a large number of terms. Such ontologies must therefore consist of terms expressing very general concepts, but such concepts are so basic to our understanding that there is no way in which they can be defined, since the very process of definition implies that a less basic (and less well understood) concept is defined in terms of concepts that are more basic and so (ideally) more well understood. Very general concepts can often only be elucidated, for example by means of examples, or paraphrase.

* There is no self-evident way of dividing the world up into [[concept]]s, and certainly no non-controversial one
* There is no neutral ground that can serve as a means of translating between specialized (or "lower" or "application-specific") ontologies
* Human [[language]] itself is already an arbitrary approximation of just one among many possible conceptual maps.  To draw any ''necessary correlation'' between [[English language|English]] words and any number of intellectual concepts we might like to represent in our ontologies is just asking for trouble. ([[WordNet]], for instance, is successful and useful precisely because it does not pretend to be a general-purpose upper ontology; rather, it is a tool for semantic / syntactic / linguistic disambiguation, which is richly embedded in the particulars and peculiarities of the English language.)
* Any hierarchical or topological representation of concepts must begin from some ontological, [[epistemology|epistemological]], linguistic, cultural, and ultimately pragmatic perspective.  Such pragmatism does not allow for the exclusion of politics between persons or groups, indeed it requires they be considered as perhaps more basic primitives than any that are represented.

Those{{who|date=December 2016}} who doubt the feasibility of general purpose ontologies are more inclined to ask “what specific purpose do we have in mind for this conceptual map of entities and what practical difference will this ontology make?”  This pragmatic philosophical position surrenders all hope of devising the encoded ontology version of “everything that is the case,” ([[Wittgenstein]], [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]).

Finally there are objections similar to those against [[artificial intelligence]]{{From whom?|date=December 2016}}.  Technically, the complex concept acquisition and the social / linguistic interactions of human beings suggests any axiomatic foundation of "most basic" concepts must be cognitive, biological or otherwise difficult to characterize since we don't have axioms for such systems.  Ethically, any general-purpose ontology could quickly become an actual tyranny by recruiting adherents into a political program designed to propagate it and its funding means, and possibly defend it by violence.  Historically, inconsistent and irrational belief systems have proven capable of commanding obedience to the detriment or harm of persons both inside and outside a society that accepts them.  How much more harmful would a consistent rational one be, were it to contain even one or two basic assumptions incompatible with human life?

===Arguments for the feasibility of an upper ontology===

Many of those who doubt the possibility of developing wide agreement on a common upper ontology fall into one of two traps:
# they assert that there is no possibility of universal agreement on any conceptual scheme; but they argue that a practical common ontology does not need to have universal agreement, it only needs a large enough user community (as is the case for human languages) to make it profitable for developers to use it as a means to general interoperability, and for third-party developer to develop utilities to make it easier to use; and
# they point out that developers of data schemes find different representations congenial for their local purposes; but they do not demonstrate that these different representation are in fact logically inconsistent.

In fact, different representations of assertions about the real world (though not philosophical models), if they accurately reflect the world, must be logically consistent, even if they focus on different aspects of the same physical object or phenomenon.  If any two assertions about the real world are logically inconsistent, one or both must be wrong, and that is a topic for experimental investigation, not for ontological representation.  In practice, representations of the real world are created as and known to be approximations to the basic reality, and their use is circumscribed by the limits of error of measurements in any given practical application.  Ontologies are entirely capable of representing approximations, and are also capable of representing situations in which different approximations have different utility.  Objections based on the different ways people perceive things attack a simplistic, impoverished view of ontology.  The objection that there are logically incompatible models of the world are true, but in an upper ontology those different models can be represented as different theories, and the adherents of those theories can use them in preference to other theories, while preserving the logical consistency of the ''necessary'' assumptions of the upper ontology.  The ''necessary'' assumptions provide the logical vocabulary with which to specify the meanings of all of the incompatible models.  It has never been demonstrated that incompatible models cannot be properly specified with a common, more basic set of concepts, while there are examples of incompatible theories that can be logically specified with only a few basic concepts.

Many of the objections to upper ontology refer to the problems of life-critical decisions or non-axiomatized  problem areas such as law or medicine or politics that are difficult even for humans to understand.  Some of these objections do not apply to physical objects or standard abstractions that are defined into existence by human beings and closely controlled by them for mutual good, such as standards for electrical power system connections or the signals used in traffic lights.  No single general [[metaphysics]] is required to agree that some such standards are desirable.  For instance, while time and space can be represented many ways, some of these are already used in interoperable artifacts like maps or schedules.

Objections to the feasibility of a common upper ontology also do not take into account the possibility of forging agreement on an ontology that contains all of the ''primitive'' ontology elements that can be combined to create any number of more specialized concept representations.  Adopting this tactic permits effort to be focused on agreement only on a limited number of ontology elements. By agreeing on the meanings of that inventory of basic concepts, it becomes possible to create and then accurately and automatically interpret an infinite number of concept representations as combinations of the basic ontology elements.  Any domain ontology or database that uses the elements of such an upper ontology to specify the meanings of its terms will be automatically and accurately interoperable with other ontologies that use the upper ontology, even though they may each separately define a large number of domain elements not defined in other ontologies.  In such a case, proper interpretation will require that the logical descriptions of domain-specific elements be transmitted along with any data that is communicated; the data will then be automatically interpretable because the domain element descriptions, based on the upper ontology, will be properly interpretable by any system that can properly use the upper ontology.  In effect elements in different domain ontologies can be *translated* into each other using the common upper ontology. An upper ontology based on such a set of primitive elements can include alternative views, provided that they are logically compatible.  Logically incompatible models can be represented as alternative theories, or represented in a specialized extension to the upper ontology.  The proper use of alternative theories is a piece of knowledge that can itself be represented in an ontology.  Users that develop new domain ontologies and find that there are semantic primitives needed for their domain but missing from the existing common upper ontology can add those new primitives by the accepted procedure, expanding the common upper ontology as necessary.

Most proponents{{Who|date=April 2015}} of an upper ontology argue that several good ones may be created with perhaps different emphasis.  Very few are actually arguing to discover just one within natural language or even an academic field.  Most are simply standardizing some existing communication.  Another view advanced is that there is almost total overlap of the different ways that upper ontologies have been formalized, in the sense that different ontologies focus on a different aspect of the same entities, but the different views are complementary and not contradictory to each other; as a result, an internally consistent ontology that contains all the views, with means of translating the different views into the other, is feasible.  Such an ontology has not thus far been constructed, however, because it would require a large project to develop so as to include all of the alternative views in the separately developed upper ontologies, along with their translations.  The main barrier to construction of such an ontology is not the technical issues, but the reluctance of funding agencies to provide the funds for a large enough consortium of developers and users.

Several common arguments against upper ontology can be examined more clearly by separating issues of concept definition (ontology), language (lexicons), and facts (knowledge).  For instance, people have different terms and phrases for the same concept.  However, that does not necessarily mean that those people are referring to different concepts.  They may simply be using different language or idiom.  Formal ontologies typically use linguistic labels to refer to concepts, but the terms that label ontology elements mean no more and no less than what their axioms say they mean.  Labels are similar to variable names in software, evocative rather than definitive.  The proponents of a common upper ontology point out that the meanings of the elements (classes, relations, rules) in an ontology depend only on their [[logical form]], and not on the labels, which are usually chosen merely to make the ontologies more easily usable by their human developers.  In fact, the labels for elements in an ontology need not be words - they could be, for example, images of instances of a particular type, or videos of an action that is represented by a particular type.  It cannot be emphasized too strongly that words are *not* what are represented in an ontology, but entities in the real world, or abstract entities (concepts) in the minds of people.  Words are not equivalent to ontology elements, but words *label* ontology elements.  There can be many words that label a single concept, even in a single language (synonymy), and there can be many concepts labeled by a single word (ambiguity).  Creating the mappings between human language and the elements of an ontology is the province of Natural Language Understanding.  But the ontology itself stands independently as a logical and computational structure.  For this reason, finding agreement on the structure of an ontology is actually easier than developing a controlled vocabulary, because all different interpretations of a word can be included, each *mapped* to the same word in the different terminologies.

A second argument is that people believe different things, and therefore can't have the same ontology.  However, people can assign different truth values to a particular assertion while accepting the validity of certain underlying claims, facts, or way of expressing an argument with which they disagree. (Using, for instance, the issue/position/argument form.) This objection to upper ontologies ignores the fact that a single ontology can represent different belief systems, representing them as different belief systems, without taking a position on the validity of either.

Even arguments about the existence of a thing require a certain sharing of a concept, even though its existence in the real world may be disputed.  Separating belief from naming and definition also helps to clarify this issue, and show how concepts can be held in common, even in the face of differing belief.  For instance, [[wiki]] as a medium may permit such confusion but disciplined users can apply [[dispute resolution]] methods to sort out their conflicts.  It is also argued that most people share a common set of "semantic primitives", fundamental concepts, to which they refer when they are trying to explain unfamiliar terms to other people.  An ontology that includes representations of those semantic primitives could in such a case be used to create logical descriptions of any term that a person may wish to define logically.   That ontology would be one form of upper ontology, serving as a logical "interlingua" that can translate ideas in one terminology to its [[logical equivalence|logical equivalent]] in another terminology.

Advocates{{Who|date=April 2015}} argue that most disagreement about the viability of an upper ontology can be traced to the conflation of ontology, language and knowledge, or too-specialized areas of knowledge: many people, or agents or groups will have areas of their respective internal ontologies that do not overlap.  If they can cooperate and share a conceptual map at all, this may be so very useful that it outweighs any disadvantages that accrue from sharing.  To the degree it becomes harder to share concepts the deeper one probes, the more valuable such sharing tends to get.  If the problem is as basic as opponents of upper ontologies claim, then, it also applies to a group of humans trying to cooperate, who might need machine assistance to communicate easily.

If nothing else, such ontologies are implied by [[machine translation]], used when people cannot practically communicate.  Whether "upper" or not, these seem likely to proliferate.

==Available upper ontologies==

===Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)===
{{main|Basic Formal Ontology}}
The Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) framework developed by [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]] and his associates consists of a series of sub-ontologies at different levels of granularity. The ontologies are divided into two varieties: relating to continuant entities such as three-dimensional enduring objects, and occurrent entities (primarily) processes conceived as unfolding in successive phases through time. BFO thus incorporates both three-dimensionalist and four-dimensionalist perspectives on reality within a single framework. Interrelations are defined between the two types of ontologies in a way which gives BFO the facility to deal with both static/spatial and dynamic/temporal features of reality. A continuant domain ontology descending from BFO can be conceived as an inventory of entities existing at a time. Each occurrent ontology can be conceived as an inventory of processes unfolding through a given interval of time. Both BFO itself and each of its extension sub-ontologies can be conceived as a window on a certain portion of reality at a given level of granularity. More than 200 extension ontologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifomis.uni-saarland.de/bfo/users|title=Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) - Users|website=ifomis.uni-saarland.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; of BFO have been created, applying the BFO architecture to different domains through the strategy of downward population. The Cell Ontology, for example, populates downward from BFO by importing the BFO branch terminating with object, and defining a cell as a subkind of object. Other examples of ontologies extending BFO are the [[Ontology for Biomedical Investigations]] (OBI) and the ontologies of the [[OBO Foundry|Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry]]. In addition to these examples, BFO and extensions are increasingly being use in defense and security domains, for example in the AIRS framework.&lt;ref&gt;http://milportal.org&lt;/ref&gt; BFO serves as the upper level of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDG) Interface Ontology developed by the United Nations Environment Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uneplive.unep.org/portal|title=Environment Live|first=|last=uneplive@unep.org|website=uneplive.unep.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; BFO has been documented in the textbook Building Ontologies with Basic Formal Ontology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/building-ontologies|title=Building Ontologies with Basic Formal Ontology|website=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by MIT Press in 2015.

===BORO===
{{main|BORO}}
Business Objects Reference Ontology is an upper ontology designed for developing ontological or semantic models for large complex operational applications that consists of a top ontology as well as a process for constructing the ontology.  It is built upon a series of clear [[metaphysical choices]]  to provide a solid (metaphysical) foundation. A key choice was for an [[Extension (metaphysics)|extensional]] (and hence, [[Spacetime|four-dimensional]]) [[ontology]] which provides it a simple [[criteria of identity]]. Elements of it have appeared in a number of standards. For example, the ISO standard, [[ISO 15926]] – Industrial automation systems and integration – was heavily influenced by an early version. The [[IDEAS Group|IDEAS]] (International Defence Enterprise Architecture Specification for exchange) standard is based upon BORO, which in turn was used to develop [[DODAF]] 2.0.

===CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model===
{{main|CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model}}
Although "CIDOC object-oriented Conceptual Reference Model" (CRM) is a [[Ontology (information science)#Domain ontologies and upper ontologies|domain ontology]], specialised to the purposes of representing cultural heritage, a subset called CRM Core is a generic upper ontology, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graphical Representation of core CRM form|url=http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc_core_graphical_representation/graphical_representation.html|publisher=[[CIDOC]]|access-date=2013-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021110613/http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc_core_graphical_representation/graphical_representation.html|archive-date=2013-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, Version 5.0.4|url=http://www.cidoc-crm.org/html/5.0.4/cidoc-crm.html#_Toc310250785|publisher=[[CIDOC]]|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Space-Time – title/identifier, place, era/period, time-span, relationship to persistent items
* Events – title/identifier, beginning/ending of existence, participants (people, either individually or in groups), creation/modification of things (physical or conceptional), relationship to persistent items
* Material Things – title/identifier, place, the information object the material thing carries, part-of relationships, relationship to persistent items
* Immaterial Things – title/identifier, information objects (propositional or symbolic), conceptional things, part-of relationships

A persistent item is a physical or conceptional item that has a persistent identity recognized within the duration of its existence by its identification rather than by its continuity or by observation. A persistent item is comparable to an endurant.&lt;br/&gt;A propositional object is a set of statements about real or imaginary things.&lt;br/&gt;A symbolic object is a sign/symbol or an aggregation of signs or symbols.

===COSMO===
[[Common Semantic Model|COSMO]] (COmmon Semantic MOdel, available at http://micra.com/COSMO/COSMO.owl) is an ontology that was initiated as a project of the COSMO working group of the Ontology and taxonomy Coordinating Working Group, with the goal of developing a foundation ontology that can serve to enable broad general [[Semantic Interoperability]]. The current version is an OWL ontology, but a Common-Logic compliant version is anticipated in the future. The ontology and explanatory files are available at the COSMO site. The goal of the COSMO working group was to develop a foundation ontology by a collaborative process that will allow it to represent all of the basic ontology elements that all members feel are needed for their applications. The development of COSMO is fully open, and any comments or suggestions from any sources are welcome. After some discussion and input from members in 2006, the development of the COSMO has been continued primarily by Patrick Cassidy, the chairman of the COSMO Working Group. Contributions and suggestions from any interested party are still welcome and encouraged. Many of the types (OWL classes) in the current COSMO have been taken from the OpenCyc OWL version 0.78, and from the SUMO. Other elements were taken from other ontologies (such as BFO and DOLCE), or developed specifically for COSMO. Development of the COSMO initially focused on including representations of all of the words in the [[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]] (LDOCE) controlled [[defining vocabulary]] (2148 words). These words are sufficient to define (linguistically) all of the entries in the LDOCE. It is hypothesized that the ontological representations of the concepts represented by those terms will be sufficient to specify the meanings of any specialized ontology element, thereby serving as a basis for general [[Semantic Interoperability]].  Interoperability via COSMO is enabled by using the COSMO (or an ontology derived from it) as an interlingua by which other domain ontologies can be translated into each other's terms and thereby accurately communicate. As new domains are linked into COSMO, additional semantic primitives may be recognized and added to its structure.  The current (January 2016) OWL version of COSMO has over 8000 types (OWL classes), over 1000 relations, and over 3000 restrictions.  The COSMO itself (COSMO.owl) and other related and explanatory files can be obtained at http://micra.com/COSMO.

===Cyc===
{{main|Cyc}}
A well-known and quite comprehensive ontology available today is [[Cyc]], a proprietary system under development since 1986, consisting of a foundation ontology and several domain-specific ontologies (called ''microtheories''). A subset of that ontology has been released for free under the name [[Cyc#OpenCyc|OpenCyc]], and a more or less unabridged version is made available for free non-commercial use under the name [[Cyc#ResearchCyc|ResearchCyc]].

=== DOLCE &lt;!--This section is linked from [[Ontology (information science)]]: do not rename without including an anchor to previous name ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;===
Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) is the first module of the WonderWeb foundational ontologies library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loa-cnr.it/old/Papers/D18.pdf|title=NetRegister.it: Network Domain Registrar (Italian Version)|first=NetRegister Staff|last=Design|website=www.loa-cnr.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Nicola Guarino and his associates at the Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA). As implied by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear ''cognitive bias'', in that it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying [[natural language]] and human [[common sense]]. DOLCE, however, does not commit to a strictly [[referentialist]] metaphysics related to the intrinsic nature of the world. Rather, the categories it introduces are thought of as cognitive artifacts, which are ultimately depending on human perception, cultural imprints and social conventions. In this sense, they intend to be just ''descriptive'' (vs ''prescriptive'') notions, that assist in making already formed conceptualizations explicit.

===General Formal Ontology (GFO)===
{{main|General formal ontology}}
The general formal ontology (GFO), developed by Heinrich Herre and his colleagues of the research group Onto-Med in [[Leipzig]], is a realistic ontology integrating processes and objects. It attempts to include many aspects of recent philosophy, which is reflected both in its taxonomic tree and its axiomatizations. GFO allows for different axiomatizations of its categories (such as the existence of [[atomic time-interval]]s vs. [[dense time]]). The basic principles of GFO are published in the Onto-Med Report Nr. 8 and in "General Formal Ontology (GFO): A Foundational Ontology for Conceptual Modelling".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onto-med.de/Archiv/ontomed2002/en/publications/scientific-reports/om-report-no8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onto-med.de/publications/2010/gfo-basic-principles.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Two GFO specialties, among others, are its account of persistence and its time model. Regarding persistence, the distinction between endurants (objects) and perdurants (processes) is made explicit within GFO by the introduction of a special category, a persistent&lt;!-- [sic]?, not persistAnt? --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onto-med.de/en/theories/gfo/part1/node20.html|title=General Formal Ontology (GFO)|first=Kai-Uwe|last=Hoop|website=www.onto-med.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; A persistant&lt;!-- [sic], not persistEnt --&gt; is a special category with the intention that its instances "remain identical" (over time). With respect to time, time intervals are taken as primitive in GFO, and time-points (called "time boundaries") as derived. Moreover, time-points may coincide, which is convenient for modelling instantaneous changes.

===gist===

gist is developed and supported by Semantic Arts.  gist (not an acronym – it means to get the essence of) is a “minimalist upper ontology”.  gist is targeted at enterprise information systems, although it has been applied to healthcare delivery applications.  
The major attributes of gist are:
# it is small (there are 140 classes and 127 properties)
# it is comprehensive (most enterprises will not find the need to create additional primitive classes, but will find that most of their classes can be defined and derived from gist)
# it is robust – all the classes descend from 12 primitive classes, which are mostly mutually disjoint.  This aids a great deal in subsequent error detection.  There are 1342 axioms, and it uses almost all of the DL constructs (it is SROIQ(D) )
# it is concrete – most upper ontologies start with abstract philosophical concepts that users must commit to in order to use the ontology.  Gist starts with concrete classes that most people already do, or reasonably could agree with, such as Person, Organization, Document, Time, UnitOfMeasure and the like) 
# it is unambiguous – ambiguous terms (such as “term”) have been removed as they are often overloaded and confused.  Also terms that frequently have different definitions at different enterprises (such as customer and order) have been removed, also to reduce ambiguity.
# it is understandable – in addition to being built on concrete, generally understood primitives, it is extremely modular.  The 140 classes are implemented in 18 modular ontologies, each can easily be understood in its entirety, and each imports only the other modules that it needs. 
gist has been used to build Enterprise Ontologies for a number of major commercial and governmental agencies including:  Procter &amp; Gamble, Sentara Healthcare, Washington State Department of Labor &amp; Industries, LexisNexis, Sallie Mae and two major Financial Services firms.
gist is freely available with a Creative Commons share alike license.  There are 18 small ontologies that make up gist.  Gist can be downloaded all at once by loading or importing gistCore at gist7.   
gist is actively maintained, and has been in use for 10 years. As of November 2017 it is at version 7.5.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://semanticarts.com/gist|title=gist home page|author=Semantic Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

gist was the subject of a paper exploring how to bridge modeling differences between ontologies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anthony_Cohn/publication/221235042_Utility_Ontology_Development_with_Formal_Concept_Analysis/links/0912f50cbb29adba1f000000.pdf#page=163|title=Complexity of Reasoning with Expressive Ontology Mappings|author1=Chiara Ghidini |author2=Luciano Serafini |author3=Segio Tessaris }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a paper describing the OQuaRE methodology for evaluating ontologies, the gist unit of measure ontology scored the highest in the manual evaluation against 10 other unit of measure ontologies,  and scored above average in the automated evaluation.  The authors stated "This ontology could easily be tested and validated, its knowledge could be effectively reused and adapted for different specified environments" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acs.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/14118/JRPIT43.2.159.pdf|title=OQuaRE: A SQuaRE-based Approach for Evaluating the Quality of Ontologies|author1=Astrid Duque-Ramos  |author2=Jesualdo Tomas Fernandez-Breis |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IDEAS===
The upper ontology developed by the [[IDEAS Group]] is [[higher-order]], [[extensional]] and [[4D ontology|4D]]. It was developed using the [[BORO Method]]. The IDEAS ontology is not intended for reasoning and inference purposes; its purpose is to be a precise model of business.

===ISO 15926===
{{main|ISO 15926}}
ISO 15926 is an International Standard for the representation of process plant life-cycle information. This representation is specified by a generic, conceptual data model that is suitable as the basis for implementation in a shared database or data warehouse. The data model is designed to be used in conjunction with reference data: standard instances that represent information common to a number of users, process plants, or both. The support for a specific life-cycle activity depends on the use of appropriate reference data in conjunction with the data model. To enable integration of life-cycle information the model excludes all information constraints that are appropriate only to particular applications within the scope.
ISO 15926-2 defines a generic model with 201 entity types. It has been prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 184, Industrial automation systems and integration, Subcommittee SC 4, Industrial data.

===MarineTLO===
MarineTLO is an upperontology for the marine domain (also applicable to the terrestrial domain), developed by the Information Systems Laboratory at the Institute of Computer Science,
Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas ([[FORTH-ICS]]).
Its purpose is to tackle the need for having integrated sets of facts about marine species,
and thus to assist research about species and [[biodiversity]].
It provides a unified and coherent core model for schema mapping which enables formulating and
answering queries which cannot be answered by any individual source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ics.forth.gr/isl/MarineTLO|title=MarineTLO - A Top Level Ontology for the Marine/Biodiversity Domain|work=forth.gr|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tzitzikas, Y. and Alloca, C. and Bekiari, C. and Marketakis, Y. and Fafalios, P. and Doerr, M. and Minadakis, N. and Patkos, T. and Candela, L.|title=Integrating Heterogeneous and Distributed Information about Marine Species through a Top Level Ontology|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-03437-9_29|location=Institute of Computer Science, FORTH-ICS, Greece|publisher=Springer|year=2013|pages=289–301|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-03437-9_29|journal=Communications in Computer and Information Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PROTON===
PROTON (PROTo ONtology) is a basic [[subsumption hierarchy]] which provides coverage of most of the upper-level concepts   necessary for semantic annotation, indexing, and retrieval.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology)===
{{main|Suggested Upper Merged Ontology}}
The [[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology]] (SUMO) is another comprehensive ontology project.  It includes an [[Standard upper ontology|upper ontology]], created by the [[IEEE]] working group P1600.1 (originally by [[Ian Niles]] and [[Adam Pease]]). It is extended with many domain ontologies and a complete set of links to WordNet. It is open source.

Upper Mapping and Binding Exchange Layer ([[UMBEL]]) is an ontology of 28,000 reference concepts that maps to a simplified subset of the [[OpenCyc]] ontology, that is intended to provide a way of linking the precise OpenCyc ontology with less formal ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mkbergman.com/441/the-role-of-umbel-stuck-in-the-middle-with-you/|title=The Role of UMBEL: Stuck in the Middle with You . . .|author=Mike Bergman|accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has formal mappings to [[Wikipedia]], [[DBpedia]], [[PROTON Ontology|PROTON]] and [[GeoNames]]. It has been developed and maintained as [[open source]] by Structured Dynamics.

===UFO (Unified Foundational Ontology)===
The Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO), developed by [[Giancarlo Guizzardi]] and associates, incorporating developments from GFO, DOLCE and the Ontology of Universals underlying OntoClean in a single coherent foundational ontology. The core categories of UFO (UFO-A) have been completely formally characterized in Giancarlo Guizzardi's Ph.D. thesis and further extended at the Ontology and Conceptual Modelling Research Group (NEMO) in Brazil with cooperators from Brandenburg University of Technology (Gerd Wagner) and Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA). UFO-A has been employed to analyze structural conceptual modeling constructs such as object types and taxonomic relations, associations and relations between associations, roles, properties, datatypes and weak entities, and parthood relations among objects. More recent developments incorporate an ontology of events in UFO (UFO-B), as well as an ontology of social and intentional aspects (UFO-C). The combination of UFO-A, B and C has been used to analyze, redesign and integrate reference conceptual models in a number of complex domains such as, for instance, Enterprise Modeling, Software Engineering, Service Science, Petroleum and Gas, Telecommunications, and Bioinformatics. Another recent development aimed towards a clear account of services and service-related concepts, and provided for a commitment-based account of the notion of service (UFO-S),&lt;ref&gt;Nardi, J. C., Falbo, R. D. A., Almeida, J. P. A., Guizzardi, G., Pires, L. F., van Sinderen, M. J., &amp; Guarino, N. (2013, September). "Towards a commitment-based reference ontology for services". In Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference (EDOC), 2013 17th IEEE International (pp. 175-184). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;
UFO is the foundational ontology for [[OntoUML]], an ontology modeling language.

===WordNet===
{{main|WordNet}}
[[WordNet]], a freely available database originally designed as a [[semantic network]] based on [[psycholinguistic]] principles, was expanded by addition of definitions and is now also viewed as a [[dictionary]]. It qualifies as an upper ontology by including the most general concepts as well as more specialized concepts, related to each other not only by the [[subsumption relation]]s, but by other semantic relations as well, such as part-of and cause. However, unlike Cyc, it has not been formally axiomatized so as to make the logical relations between the concepts precise. It has been widely used in [[Natural language processing]] research.

===YAMATO (Yet Another More Advanced Top Ontology)===
YAMATO is developed by Riichiro Mizoguchi, formerly at the Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research of the [[University of Osaka]], and now at the [[Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]]. Major features of YAMATO are:
# an advanced description of quality, attribute, property, and quantity,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ei.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/hozo/onto_library/YAMATO101216.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

YAMATO has been extensively used for developing other, more applied, ontologies such as a medical ontology,&lt;ref&gt;http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-833/paper9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; an ontology of gene,&lt;ref&gt;http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-897/session1-paper05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; an ontology of learning/instructional theories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edont.qee.jp/omnibus/doku.php|title=start    [OMNIBUS project]|date=6 December 2014|work=qee.jp|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an ontology of sustainability science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11625-008-0063-z|title=Toward knowledge structuring of sustainability science based on ontology engineering|accessdate=22 April 2015 | doi=10.1007/s11625-008-0063-z|volume=4|journal=Sustainability Science|pages=99–116|author=Kumazawa Terukazu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an ontology of the cultural domain &lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5989/e6ebae1f4676416426d5acbc56e2282bde04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Upper/foundational ontology tools==

===ONSET===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
ONSET, the foundational ontology selection and explanation tool, assists the domain ontology developer in selecting the most appropriate foundational ontology. The domain ontology developer provides the requirements/answers one or more questions, and ONSET computes the selection of the appropriate foundational ontology and explains why. The current version (v2 of 24 April 2013) includes DOLCE, BFO, GFO, SUMO, YAMATO and GIST.

===ROMULUS===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
ROMULUS is a foundational ontology repository aimed at improving semantic interoperability. Currently there are three foundational ontologies in the repository: DOLCE, BFO and GFO. Features of ROMULUS include:
# It provides a high-level view of the foundational ontologies with only the most general concepts common to all implemented foundational ontologies. 
# Foundational ontologies in ROMULUS are modularised.
# Foundational ontology mediation has been performed. This includes alignment, mapping, merging, searchable metadata and an interchangeability method for foundational ontologies. 
# ROMULUS provides detailed taxonomies of each foundational ontology to allow easy browsing of foundational ontologies. 
# ROMULUS allows you to download each foundational ontology module including the integrated foundational ontologies. 
# Searchable metadata of each foundational ontology is available. 
# A comparison of the included foundational ontologies is available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8016">'''Uzawa's theorem''', also known as the '''steady state growth theorem''', is a theorem in [[Economic growth|economic growth theory]] concerning the form that [[technological change]] can take in the [[Solow–Swan model|Solow–Swan]] and [[Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model|Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans]] growth models. It was first proved by Japanese economist [[Hirofumi Uzawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uzawa|first=Hirofumi|date=Summer 1961|title=Neutral Inventions and the Stability of Growth Equilibrium|url=|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=28|pages=117-124|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One general version of the theorem consists of two parts.&lt;ref name="Jones &amp; Scrimgeour"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Charles I. |last=Jones |first2=Dean |last2=Scrimgeour |year=2008 |title=A New Proof of Uzawa's Steady-State Growth Theorem |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=180–182 |doi=10.1162/rest.90.1.180  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Modern Economic Growth|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-691-13292-1|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=60-61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first states that, under the normal assumptions of the Solow and Neoclassical models, if (after some time T) capital, investment, consumption, and output are increasing at constant exponential rates, these rates must be equivalent. Building on this result, the second part asserts that, within such a balanced growth path, the production function, &lt;math&gt;Y = \tilde{F}(\tilde{A},K,L)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is technology, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is capital, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is labor), can be rewritten such that technological change affects output solely as a scalar on labor (i.e. &lt;math&gt;Y = F(K,AL)&lt;/math&gt;) a property known as [[labor-augmenting]] or [[Harrod neutral|Harrod-neutral]] technological change. 

Uzawa's theorem demonstrates a significant limitation of the commonly used Neoclassical and Solow models. Imposing the assumption of balanced growth within such models requires that technological change by labor-augmenting. By contraposition, any production function for which it is not possible to represent the effect of technology as a scalar on labor cannot produce a balanced growth path.&lt;ref name="Jones &amp; Scrimgeour" /&gt;

== Statement of Theorem ==
Throughout this page, a dot over a variable will denote its derivative with respect to time (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\dot{X}(t)\equiv {dX(t) \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;). Also, the growth rate of a variable &lt;math&gt;X(t)&lt;/math&gt; will be denoted &lt;math&gt;g_X\equiv \frac{\dot{X}(t)}{X(t)}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Uzawa's theorem''' 

(The following version is found in Acemoglu (2009) and adapted from Schlicht (2006))

Model with aggregate production function &lt;math&gt;Y(t)=\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(t),K(t),L(t))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\tilde{F}:\mathbb{R}^2_+ \times \mathcal{A}\to \mathbb{R}_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}(t)\in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; represents technology at time t (where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^N&lt;/math&gt; for some natural number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;). Assume that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{F}&lt;/math&gt; exhibits constant returns to scale in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The growth in capital at time t is given by

&lt;math&gt;\dot{K}(t)=Y(t)-C(t)-\delta K(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;/math&gt; is the depreciation rate and &lt;math&gt;C(t)&lt;/math&gt; is consumption at time t. 

Suppose that population grows at a constant rate, &lt;math&gt;L(t)=\exp(nt)L(0)&lt;/math&gt;, and that there exists some time &lt;math&gt;T &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{Y}(t)/Y(t)=g_Y&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{K}(t)/K(t)=g_K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\dot{C}(t)/C(t)=g_C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Then 

1. &lt;math&gt;g_Y = g_K = g_C&lt;/math&gt;; and

2. For any &lt;math&gt;t \geq T&lt;/math&gt; , there exists a function &lt;math&gt;F:\mathbb{R}^2_+ \to \mathbb{R}_+&lt;/math&gt; that is homogeneous of degree 1 in its two arguments, such that the aggregate production function can be represented as ''&lt;math&gt;Y(t)=F(K(t),A(t)L(t))&lt;/math&gt;'', where &lt;math&gt;A(t)\in \mathbb{R}_+&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;g \equiv \dot{A}(t)/A(t) =g_Y-n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Sketch of proof ==
===Lemma 1===
For any constant &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{X^\alpha Y}=\alpha g_X+g_Y&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''': Observe that for any &lt;math&gt;Z(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{Z}= \frac{\dot{Z}(t)}{Z(t)}= \frac{d\ln Z(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,
&lt;math&gt;g_{X^\alpha Y} = \frac{d}{dt}\ln [(X(t))^\alpha Y(t)]=\alpha\frac{d\ln X(t)}{dt}+\frac{d\ln Y(t)}{dt}=\alpha g_X+g_Y&lt;/math&gt;.

===Proof of theorem===
We first show that the growth rate of investment &lt;math&gt;I(t)=Y(t)-C(t)&lt;/math&gt; must equal the growth rate of capital &lt;math&gt;K(t)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;g_I=g_K&lt;/math&gt;) 

The resource constraint at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; implies 
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{K}(t)=I(t)-\delta K(t)&lt;/math&gt;
By definition of &lt;math&gt;g_K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{K}(t)=g_K K(t)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt; . Therefore, the previous equation implies
:&lt;math&gt;g_K+\delta=\frac{I(t)}{K(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;. The left-hand side is a constant, while the right-hand side grows at &lt;math&gt;g_I-g_K&lt;/math&gt; (by Lemma 1). Therefore, &lt;math&gt;0=g_I-g_K&lt;/math&gt; and thus
:&lt;math&gt;g_I=g_K&lt;/math&gt;.
From [[Gross domestic product#Expenditure approach|national income accounting for a closed economy]], final goods in the economy must either be consumed or invested, thus for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y(t)=C(t)+I(t)&lt;/math&gt;
Differentiating with respect to time yields
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Y}(t)=\dot{C}(t)+\dot{I}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
Dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;Y(t)&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\dot{Y}(t)}{Y(t)}=\frac{\dot{C}(t)}{Y(t)}+\frac{\dot{I}(t)}{Y(t)}=\frac{\dot{C}(t)}{C(t)}\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}+\frac{\dot{I}(t)}{I(t)}\frac{I(t)}{Y(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow g_Y=g_C\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}+g_I\frac{I(t)}{Y(t)}=g_C\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}+g_I(1-\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)})=(g_C-g_I)\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}+g_I&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;g_Y, g_C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_I&lt;/math&gt; are constants, &lt;math&gt;\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. Therefore, the growth rate of &lt;math&gt;\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}&lt;/math&gt; is zero. By Lemma 1, it implies that 
:&lt;math&gt; g_c-g_Y=0&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, &lt;math&gt;g_Y= g_I&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;g_Y = g_C = g_K&lt;/math&gt;.                                                                                                                                                   

Next we show that for any &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;, the production function can be represented as one with labor-augmenting technology.

The production function at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is 
:&lt;math&gt;Y(T)=\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(T), K(T), L(T))&lt;/math&gt;
The constant [[Returns to scale|return to scale]] property of production (&lt;math&gt;\tilde{F}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous of degree one]] in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) implies that for any &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;, multiplying both sides of the previous equation by &lt;math&gt;\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)}&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;Y(T)\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)}=\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(T), K(T)\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)}, L(T)\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)})&lt;/math&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)}=\frac{K(t)}{K(T)}&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;g_Y=g_K&lt;/math&gt;(refer to [[Ordinary differential equation#Summary of exact solutions|solution to differential equations]] for proof of this step). Thus, the above equation can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;Y(t)=\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(T), K(t), L(T)\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)})&lt;/math&gt; 
For any &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;, define 
:&lt;math&gt;A(t)\equiv\frac{Y(t)}{L(t)}\frac{L(T)}{Y(T)}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;F(K(t),A(t)L(t))\equiv\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(T), K(t), L(t)A(t))&lt;/math&gt;
Combining the two equations yields 
:&lt;math&gt;F(K(t),A(t)L(t))=\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(T), K(t), L(T)\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)})=Y(t)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;.
By construction, &lt;math&gt;F(K,AL)&lt;/math&gt; is also [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous of degree one]] in its two arguments.

Moreover, by Lemma 1, the growth rate of &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\dot{A}(t)}{A(t)}=\frac{\dot{Y}(t)}{Y(t)}-\frac{\dot{L}(t)}{L(t)}=g_Y-n&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis states that [[transient (oscillation)|transient]] [[mass]] fluctuations arise in any object that absorbs [[mass–energy equivalence|internal energy]] while undergoing a [[proper acceleration]]. Harnessing this effect could generate a [[reactionless drive|reactionless thrust]], which Woodward and others claim to measure in various experiments.&lt;ref name="WoodwardPub1"&gt;

Hypothetically, the Woodward effect would allow for [[field propulsion]] [[spacecraft propulsion|spacecraft engines]] that would not have to expel matter. Such a proposed engine, is sometimes called a Mach effect [[spacecraft propulsion|thruster]] (MET) or a Mach Effect Gravitational Assist (MEGA) drive.&lt;ref&gt;

The effect is controversial within mainstream physics because the underlying mathematics appears faulty,&lt;ref name="whealton" /&gt; and the effect, if found to be real, would violate momentum conservation and energy conservation.&lt;ref name="Wanser 2014" /&gt;

==Mach effects==
According to Woodward, at least three Mach effects are theoretically possible: vectored impulse thrust, open curvature of spacetime, and closed curvature of spacetime.&lt;ref name="MSAS"&gt;

The first effect, the Woodward effect, is the minimal energy effect of the hypothesis. The Woodward effect is focused primarily on proving the hypothesis and providing the basis of a Mach effect impulse thruster. In the first of three general Mach effects for propulsion or transport, the Woodward effect is an impulse effect usable for in-orbit satellite station-keeping, spacecraft reaction control systems, or at best, thrust within the solar system. The second and third effects are open and closed space-time effects. Open curved space-time effects can be applied in a field generation system to produce warp fields. Closed-curve space-time effects would be part of a field generation system to generate wormholes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The third Mach effect is a closed-curve [[spacetime]] effect or [[closed timelike curve]] called a benign wormhole. Closed-curve space is generally known as a [[wormhole]] or [[black hole]]. Prompted by [[Carl Sagan]] for the scientific basis of wormhole transport in the movie ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'', [[Kip Thorne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kip S. Thorne |title=Kip Thorne personal web page |publisher=California Institute of Technology |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~kip/}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the theory of benign wormholes. The generation, stability, and traffic control of transport through a benign wormhole is only theoretical at present. One difficulty is the requirement for energy levels approximating a "Jupiter size mass".

[[Kenneth Nordtvedt]] showed in 1988 that [[gravitoelectromagnetism|gravitomagnetism]], which is an effect predicted by [[general relativity]] but hadn't yet been observed at that time and was even challenged by the scientific community, is inevitably a real effect because it is a direct consequence of the gravitational vector potential. He subsequently showed that the gravitomagnetism interaction (not to be confused with the [[Nordtvedt effect]]), like inertial [[frame dragging]] and the [[Lense–Thirring precession]], is typically a Mach effect.&lt;ref name="Nordtvedt"&gt;

===Mach's principle===
{{main|Mach's principle}}

The Woodward effect is based on the relativistic effects theoretically derived from [[Mach's principle]] on [[inertia]] within [[general relativity]], attributed by [[Albert Einstein]] to [[Ernst Mach]].&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The conjecture comes from a [[thought experiment]]:&lt;ref name="BoingBoing" /&gt;
{{quote
 |Ernst Mach (1838–1916) was an Austrian physicist […] contemporary of Einstein, to whom he suggested a thought experiment: What if there was only one object in the universe? Mach argued that it could not have a velocity, because according to the theory of relativity, you need at least two objects before you can measure their velocity relative to each other.

Taking this thought experiment a step further, if an object was alone in the universe, and it had no velocity, it could not have a measurable mass, because mass varies with velocity.

Mach concluded that inertial mass only exists because the universe contains multiple objects. When a gyroscope is spinning, it resists being pushed around because it is interacting with the Earth, the stars, and distant galaxies. If those objects didn't exist, the gyroscope would have no inertia.

Einstein was intrigued by this concept, and named it "Mach's principle."}}

===Gravitational origin of inertia===

A formulation of Mach's principle was first proposed as a vector theory of gravity, modeled on [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's formalism]] for [[classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]], by [[Dennis William Sciama|Dennis Sciama]] in 1953,&lt;ref name="Sciama 1953"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In this paper, Sciama stated that instantaneous inertial forces in all accelerating objects are produced by a primordial gravity-based inertial [[radiation|radiative]] [[field (physics)|field]] created by distant cosmic matter and propagating both forward ''and'' backward in time at light speed:
{{quote

#The whole of the inertial field must be due to sources, so that in solving the inertial field equations the boundary conditions must be chosen appropriately.

Running the sequence backwards (thinking it as seeing events running backward in time) we then observe concentric waves propagating from the shore towards the center of the pond, where a rock emerges.

The thing to understand is that advanced waves coming back from the future never propagate farther into the past than the rock hitting the water that initiated all of the waves.

===Transient mass fluctuation===
The following has been detailed by Woodward in various peer-reviewed papers throughout the last twenty years.&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MUSH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward2004b"&gt;

 |issue=10

 |url=http://www.enthea.org/docs/Woodward-Flux-Capacitors-Origin-Of-Inertia.pdf
 |bibcode= 2004FoPh...34.1475W
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Woodward, a transient mass fluctuation arises in an object when it absorbs "internal" energy as it is accelerated. Several devices could be built to [[accumulator (energy)|store internal energy]] during accelerations. A measurable effect needs to be driven at a high [[frequency]], so [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] [[mechanical system]]s are out of question since the rate at which their internal energy could be modified is too limited. The only systems that could run at a high frequency are [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] energy storage devices. For fast transient effects, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] are ruled out. A magnetic energy storage device like an [[inductor]] using a high-[[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] [[magnetic core|core material]] to transfer the [[magnetic energy]] could be specially built. But [[capacitor]]s are preferable to inductors because compact devices storing energy at a very high [[energy density]] without [[electrical breakdown]] are readily available. Shielding [[electromagnetic interference|electrical interferences]] are easier than [[magnetic shielding#Magnetic shielding|shielding magnetic]] ones. [[Ferroelectricity|Ferroelectric]] materials can be used to make high-frequency [[linear actuator#Electro-mechanical actuators|electro-mechanical actuators]], and they are themselves capacitors so they can be used for both energy storage and acceleration. Finally, capacitors are cheap and available in various configurations. So Mach effect experiments have always relied on capacitors so far.

When the [[dielectric]] of a capacitor is submitted to a varying [[electric power]] (charge or discharge), Woodward's hypothesis predicts&lt;ref name="Woodward2004b"/&gt; a transient mass fluctuation arises according to the transient mass equation (TME):
:&lt;math&gt;\delta m_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi G}\left[\frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2}\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} - \left(\frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2}\right)^2 \frac{P^2}{V}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[invariant mass|proper mass]] of the dielectric,
*&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]],
*&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum,
*&lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; is the proper [[density]] of the dielectric,
*&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the dielectric,
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the instantaneous power delivered to the system.

This equation is not the full Woodward equation as seen in the book. There is a third term, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle -\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \frac{\phi}{c^2} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;which Woodward discounts because his [[gauge theory|gauge]] sets&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{\phi}{c^2} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;; the derivatives of this quantity must therefore be negligible.&lt;ref name="Woodward2004b"/&gt;

===Propellantless propulsion===
The previous equation shows that when the [[dielectric]] material of a [[capacitor]] is cyclically charged then discharged while being accelerated, its [[density|mass density]] fluctuates, by around plus or minus its [[invariant mass|rest mass]] value. Therefore, a device can be made to [[oscillate]] either in a linear or orbital path, such that its mass density is higher while the mass is moving forward, and lower while moving backward, thus creating an [[acceleration]] of the device in the forward direction, i.e. a thrust. This effect, used repeatedly, does not expel any [[particle]] and thus would represent a type of apparent [[reactionless drive|propellantless propulsion]], which seems to be in contradiction with [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]]. However, Woodward states there is no violation of momentum conservation in Mach effects:&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2012"/&gt;
{{quote
 |If we produce a fluctuating mass in an object, we can, at least in principle, use it to produce a stationary force on the object, thereby producing a propulsive force thereon without having to expel propellant from the object. We simply push on the object when it is more massive, and pull back when it is less massive. The reaction forces during the two parts of the cycle will not be the same due to the mass fluctuation, so a time-averaged net force will be produced. ''This may seem to be a violation of momentum conservation. But the [[Lorentz invariance]] of the theory guarantees that no conservation law is broken. Local momentum conservation is preserved by the [[flux]] of [[momentum]] in the gravity field that is chiefly exchanged with the distant matter in the universe.'' [emphasis added]
}}

Two terms are important for propulsion on the right-hand side of the previous equation:
*The first, [[linear equation|linear term]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2} \frac{\partial P}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''[[impulse (physics)|impulse]] engine'' term because it expresses mass fluctuation depending on the derivative of the power, and scales linearly with the frequency. Past and current experiments about Mach effect [[wikt:thruster|thruster]]s are designed to demonstrate thrust and the control of one type of Mach effect.
*The second, [[quadratic equation|quadratic term]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle -\left(\frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2}\right)^2 \frac{P^2}{V}&lt;/math&gt; is what Woodward calls the ''[[wormhole]]'' term, because ''it is always negative''. Although this term appears to be many [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] weaker than the first term, which makes it usually negligible, theoretically, the second term's effect could become huge in some circumstances. The second term, the wormhole term, is indeed driven by the first impulse engine term, which fluctuates mass by around plus or minus the rest mass value. When fluctuations reach a very high amplitude and mass density is driven very close to zero, the equation shows that mass should achieve very large negative values very quickly, with a strong non-linear behavior. In this regard, the Woodward effect could generate [[exotic matter]], although this still remains very speculative due to the lack of any available experiment that would highlight such an effect.

Applications of propellantless propulsion include straight-line [[wikt:thruster|thruster]] or impulse engine, open curved fields for starship [[warp drive]]s, and even the possibility of closed curved fields such as traversable benign [[wormhole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Negative bare mass of the electron===

The mass of the electron is positive according to the [[mass–energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but this [[invariant mass]] is made from the [[bare mass]] of the electron "clothed" by a [[Virtual particle|virtual photon]] cloud. According to [[quantum field theory]], as those virtual particles have an energy more than twice the bare mass of the electron, mandatory for [[pair production]] in [[renormalization]], the nonelectromagnetic bare mass of the "unclothed" electron has to be ''negative''.&lt;ref name="Milonni"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milonni|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter W. Milonni|title=The Quantum Vacuum: An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics|date=1994|publisher=Academic Press|location=Boston|isbn=0124980805|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPHJCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|LCCN=93029780|oclc=422797902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the [[ADM formalism]], Woodward proposes that the physical interpretation of the "wormhole term" in his transient mass equation could be a way to expose the negative bare mass of the electron, in order to produce large quantities of exotic matter that could be used in a warp drive to propel a spacecraft or generate traversable wormholes.&lt;ref name="Woodward2011" /&gt;

==Space travel==
Current [[spacecraft]] achieve a change in velocity by the expulsion of [[propellant]], the extraction of momentum from stellar [[radiation pressure]] or the [[stellar wind]] or the utilisation of a [[gravity assist]] ("slingshot") from a planet or moon. These methods are limiting in that [[rocket propellant]]s have to be accelerated as well and are eventually depleted, and the stellar wind or the gravitational fields of planets can only be utilized locally in the [[Solar System]]. In [[interstellar space]] and bereft of the above resources, different forms of propulsion are needed to propel a spacecraft, and they are referred to as advanced or [[interstellar travel#Faster-than-light travel: warped spacetime and wormholes|exotic]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Impulse engine===
If the Woodward effect is confirmed and if an engine can be designed to use applied Mach effects, then a spacecraft may be possible that could maintain a steady acceleration into and through interstellar space without the need to carry along propellants. Woodward presented a paper about the concept at the [[NASA]] [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] Workshop conference in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;

Even ignoring for the moment the impact on [[interstellar travel]], future spacecraft driven by impulse engines based on Mach effects would represent an astounding breakthrough in terms of [[interplanetary spaceflight]] alone, enabling the rapid [[space colonization|colonization]] of the entire solar system. Travel times being limited only by the specific power of the available power supplies and the acceleration human physiology can endure, they would allow crews to reach any moon or planet in our solar system in less than three weeks. For example, a typical one-way trip at an acceleration of [[g-force|1 g]] from the Earth to the [[Moon]] would last only about 4 hours; to [[Mars]], 2 to 5 days; to the [[asteroid belt]], 5 to 6 days; and to [[Jupiter]], 6 to 7 days.&lt;ref name="March2007"&gt;

===Warp drives and wormholes===
As shown by the transient mass fluctuation equation above, exotic matter could be theoretically created. A large quantity of negative [[energy density]] would be the key element needed to create warp drives&lt;ref name="Alcubierre"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As such, if proven to be scientifically valid, practically feasible and scaling as predicted by the hypothesis, the Woodward effect could not only be used for interplanetary travel, but also for apparent [[faster-than-light]] interstellar travel:
*The [[negative mass]] could be used to warp spacetime around a spaceship according to an [[Alcubierre metric]].&lt;ref name="MUSH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcubierre"/&gt;
*Enough exotic matter could also be concentrated into a point of space to create a [[wormhole]], and prevent it from collapsing. Woodward and others also state that exotic matter could defocus energy at the outer mouth of the [[wormhole]] (making it a [[white hole]]) and shape the throat of such a [[gravitational singularity]] flat enough to avoid [[event horizon|horizon]] and [[tidal force|tidal]] stresses, resulting in an "absurdly benign traversable [[wormhole]]" linking two regions of distant spacetime, a concept widespread in science fiction as [[Jumpgate|stargate]]s, which could be used for instant interstellar and intergalactic travel or [[time travel]].&lt;ref name="MSAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MUSH"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodward and his associates have claimed since the 1990s to have successfully measured forces at levels great enough for practical use and also claim to be working on the development of a practical prototype [[wikt:thruster|thruster]]. No practical working devices have yet been publicly demonstrated.&lt;ref name="WoodwardPub1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodwardPub2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="io9-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2012"/&gt;

The NIAC contract awarded in 2017 by [[NASA]] for the development of Mach effect thrusters is a primary three-task effort, two experimental and one analytical:&lt;ref name="NIAC 2017 Mach Effect" /&gt;

# Improvement of the current laboratory-scale devices, in order to provide long duration thrust at levels required for practical propulsion applications.
# Design and development of a power supply and electrical systems to provide feedback and control of the input AC voltage, and resonant frequency, that determine the efficiency of the MET.
# Improve theoretical thrust predictions and build a reliable model of the device to assist in perfecting the design. Predict maximum thrust achievable by one device and how large an array of thrusters would be required to send a probe, of size 1.5 m diameter by 3 m, of total mass 1245&amp;nbsp;kg including a modest 400&amp;nbsp;kg of payload, a distance of 8 light-years away.

==Experiments==

===Test devices===

====Mach-Lorentz Thruster====
[[File:Woodward Effect Device.png|thumb|right|Photograph of the 2006 Woodward effect MLT test article.]]
A former type of Mach effect [[wikt:thruster|thruster]] was the Mach-Lorentz thruster (MLT). It used a charging [[capacitor]] embedded in a magnetic field created by a magnetic coil. A Lorentz force, the cross product between the electric field and the magnetic field, appears and acts upon the ions inside the capacitor dielectric. In such electromagnetic experiments, the power can be applied at frequencies of several megahertz, unlike [[PZT]] stack actuators where frequency is limited to tens of kilohertz. The photograph shows the components of a Woodward effect test article used in a 2006 experiment.&lt;ref name="AIP1"/&gt;

However, a problem with some of these devices was discovered in 2007 by physicist Nembo Buldrini, who called it the ''Bulk Acceleration Conjecture'':
{{quote
 |What [Nembo Buldrini] pointed out was that given the way the transient terms of the Mach effect equation are written – in terms of the time-derivatives of the proper energy density – it is easy to lose sight of the requirement in the derivation that the object in which the mass fluctuations occur must be accelerating at the same time. In some of the experimental cases, no provision for such "bulk" acceleration was made.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; As an example, the capacitors affixed to the tines of the tuning fork in the Cramer and the students' experiments made no provision for such an acceleration. Had the tuning fork been separately excited and an electric field applied to the capacitor(s) been properly phased, an effect might have been seen. But to simply apply a voltage to the capacitors and then look for a response in the tuning fork should not have been expected to produce a compelling result.

Other examples could be cited and discussed. Suffice it to say, though, that after Nembo focused attention in the issue of bulk accelerations in the production of Mach effects, the design and execution of experiments changed. The transition to that work, and recent results of experiments presently in progress, are addressed in the next chapter.

&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; By "bulk" acceleration we are referring to the fact that the conditions of the derivation include that the object be both accelerated and experience internal energy changes. The acceleration of ions in the material of a capacitor, for example, does not meet this condition. The capacitor as a whole must be accelerated in bulk while it is being polarized.

====Mach Effect Thruster or MEGA drive====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:All PZT Mach effect thruster test unit.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Photograph of the PZT stack of a Mach effect test device.]] --&gt;
To address this issue, Woodward started to design and build a new kind of device known as a MET (Mach Effect Thruster) and later a MEGA drive (Mach Effect Gravitational Assist drive), using capacitors and a series of thick [[lead zirconate titanate|PZT]] disks. This ceramic is [[piezoelectric]], so it can be used as an electromechanical actuator to accelerate an object placed against it: its [[crystal structure|crystalline structure]] expands when a certain [[electrical polarity]] is applied, then contracts when the opposite field is applied, and the stack of discs vibrates.

In the first tests, Woodward simply used a [[capacitor]] between two stacks of PZT disks. The capacitor, while being electrically charged to change its internal energy density, is shuttled back and forth between the PZT actuators. [[Piezoelectric]] materials can also generate a measurable voltage potential across their two faces when pressed, so Woodward first used some small portions of PZT material as little [[accelerometer]]s put on the surface of the stack, to precisely tune the device with the power supply. Then Woodward realized that PZT material and the [[dielectric]] of a capacitor were very similar, so he built devices that are made exclusively of PZT disks, without any conventional capacitor, applying different signals to different portions of the cylindrical stack. The available picture taken by his graduate student Tom Mahood in 1999 shows a typical all-PZT stack with different disks:&lt;ref name=mahood&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/physics/graduate-studies-in-physics-at-cal-state-university-fullerton/
 |title=Graduate studies in Physics at Cal State University, Fullerton

 |accessdate=27 January 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The outer, thicker disks on the left and right are the "shuttlers".
*The inner stack of thin disks in the center are the shuttled capacitors storing energy during acceleration, where any mass shift would occur.
*The even thinner disks placed between the shuttlers and on both side of the inner disk capacitors are the "squeezometers' acting as accelerometers.
During forward acceleration and before the transient mass change in the capacitor decays, the resultant increased [[momentum]] is transferred forward to a bulk "reaction mass" through an [[elastic collision]] (the [[brass]] end cap on the left in the picture). Conversely, the following decrease in the mass density takes place during its backward movement.
While operating, the PZT stack is isolated in a Faraday cage and put on a sensitive [[torsion spring|torsion]] arm for thrust measurements, inside a vacuum chamber. Throughout the years, a wide variety of different types of devices and experimental setups have been tested. The force measuring setups have ranged from various load cell devices to [[ballistic pendulum]]s to multiple [[torsion spring|torsion]] arm pendulums, in which movement is actually observed. Those setups have been improved against spurious effects by isolating and canceling thermal transfers, vibration and electromagnetic interference, while getting better current feeds and bearings. Null tests were also conducted.&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2013"/&gt;

In the future, Woodward plans to scale thrust levels, switching from the current [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] [[dielectric]] [[ceramic]]s ([[lead zirconate titanate|PZT]] stacks) to new [[high-κ dielectric]] [[nanocomposite]] [[polymer]]s, like [[electrostriction#Materials|PMN]], [[electrostriction#Materials|PMN-PT]] or [[calcium copper titanate|CCTO]]. Nevertheless, such materials are new, quite difficult to find, and are [[electrostriction|electrostrictive]], not piezoelectric.&lt;ref name="Scaling"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and a NIAC phase I grant was awarded in April 2017 to develop a better theoretical model and technical solutions for greater efficiency as a [[Technology readiness level|TRL-1 technology]]: reduction of heating and longer operating time using ''chirped pulses''; and design of a dedicated electronic circuit with better frequency impedance matching. The concept of an interstellar mission to [[Proxima Centauri b]] was also detailed. Consecutively to these achievements, a NIAC Phase II grant was awarded in March 2018 to test an improved design with a higher operational frequency to increase the output thrust.&lt;ref name="NIAC 2018 Mach Effect" /&gt;

====EmDrive====
{{main|RF resonant cavity thruster}}
Another type of claimed propellantless thruster, called the [[RF resonant cavity thruster|EmDrive]] by its inventor British engineer Roger Shawyer, has been proposed to work due to a Mach effect:&lt;ref name="IBT EmDrive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hacked EmDrive" /&gt;

The asymmetric resonant [[microwave cavity]] would act as a capacitor where:
* surface currents propagate inside the cavity on the conic wall between the two end plates,
* electromagnetic resonant modes create electric charges on each end plate,
* a Mach effect is triggered by [[Lorentz force]]s from surface currents on the conic wall,
* a thrust force arises in the [[Radio frequency|RF]] cavity, due to the variation of the electromagnetic density from [[Evanescent field|evanescent wave]]s inside the skin layer.
When a [[polymer]] insert is placed asymmetrically in the cavity, its dielectric properties result in greater asymmetry, while decreasing the cavity [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]].
The cavity's acceleration is a function of all the above factors, and the model can explain the acceleration of the cavity with and without a dielectric.&lt;ref name="Montillet 2016" /&gt;

===Results===
From his initial paper onward Woodward has claimed that this effect is detectable with modern technology.&lt;ref name="Woodward-1990-497"/&gt; He and others have performed and continue to perform experiments to detect the small forces that are predicted to be produced by this effect. So far some groups claim to have detected forces at the levels predicted and other groups have detected forces at much greater than predicted levels or nothing at all. To date there has been no announcement conclusively confirming proof for the existence of this effect or ruling it out.&lt;ref name="io9-2013"/&gt;

*In 1990, Woodward's original paper on Mach effects included an experiment with results.&lt;ref name="Woodward-1990-497"/&gt;
*In 1999, Thomas L. Mahood, Woodward's [[graduate student]] from 1997 to 1999, reported thrusts ranging from 0.03 to 15&amp;nbsp;µN in a setup comprising a torque pendulum in a vacuum chamber, at the [[Space Technology and Applications International Forum]] (STAIF) and in his [[Master of Science|Master of Science in Physics]] [[thesis]].&lt;ref name="Mahood1999"&gt;

==Debate==

===Inertial frames===
All inertial frames are in a state of constant, rectilinear motion with respect to one another; they are not accelerating in the sense that an accelerometer at rest in one would detect zero acceleration. Despite their ubiquitous nature, inertial frames are still not fully understood. That they exist is certain, but what causes them to exist – and whether these sources could constitute reaction-media – are still unknown. Marc Millis, of the NASA [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]], stated " ''For example, the notion of thrusting without propellant evokes objections of violating conservation of momentum. This, in turn, suggests that space drive research must address conservation of momentum. From there it is found that many relevant unknowns still linger regarding the source of the inertial frames against which conservation is referenced. Therefore, research should revisit the unfinished physics of inertial frames, but in the context of propulsive interactions.'' "&lt;ref name="Millis2010"&gt;

}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 February 2013--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mach's principle]] is generally defined within [[general relativity]] as "the local inertia frame is completely determined by the dynamic fields in the universe." Rovelli evaluated a number of versions of "Mach's principle" that exist in the literature. Some are partially correct and some have been dismissed as incorrect.&lt;ref name="Rovelli, Carlo 2004"/&gt;

===Conservation of momentum===

A challenge to the mathematical foundations of Woodward's hypothesis were raised in a paper published by the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in 2001. In the paper, John Whealton noted that the experimental results of Oak Ridge scientists can be explained in terms of force contributions due to time-varying [[thermal expansion]], and stated that a laboratory demonstration produced 100 times the Woodward effect without resorting to non-Newtonian explanations.&lt;ref name="whealton"&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Woodward published a criticism of Whealton's math and understanding of the physics involved, and built an experiment attempting to demonstrate the flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13020.0;attach=119594

&lt;/ref&gt;

A rate of change in [[momentum]] represents a force, whereby '''F''' {{=}} ''m'''''a'''. Whealton et al. use the technical definition, '''F'''{{=}}d(''m'''''v''')/d''t'', which can be expanded to '''F'''{{=}}''m'' d'''v'''/d''t'' + d''m''/d''t'' '''v'''. This second term has both delta mass and '''v''', which is measured instantaneously; this term will, in general, cancel out the force from the inertial response terms predicted by Woodward. Woodward argued that the d''m''/d''t'' '''v''' term does not represent a physical force on the device, because it vanishes in a frame where the device is momentarily stationary.&lt;ref name=Woodward2004b/&gt;

In an appendix to his thesis, Mahood argues that the unexpectedly small magnitude of the results in his experiments are a confirmation of the cancellation predicted by Whealton; the results are instead due to higher-order mass transients which are not exactly cancelled.&lt;ref name="MahoodThesis"/&gt; Mahood would later describe this argument as "one of the very few things I've done in my life that I actually regret".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahood|first1=Thomas|title=Graduate studies in Physics at Cal State University, Fullerton|url=http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/physics/graduate-studies-in-physics-at-cal-state-university-fullerton/|website=Other Hand|accessdate=2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the momentum and energy exchange with distant matter guarantees global conservation of energy and momentum, this [[field (physics)|field]] exchange is supplied at no material cost, unlike the case with conventional fuels. For this reason, when the [[field (physics)|field]] exchange is ignored, a propellantless thruster behaves locally like a free energy device. This is immediately apparent from basic Newtonian analysis: if constant power produces constant thrust, then input energy is linear with time and output (kinetic) energy is quadratic with time. Thus there exists a break-even time (or distance or velocity) of operation, above which more energy is output than is input. The longer it is allowed to accelerate, the more pronounced will this effect become, as simple Newtonian physics predicts.

Considering those conservation issues, a Mach effect thruster relies on Mach's principle, hence it is not an electrical to kinetic [[transducer]], i.e. it does not convert [[electric energy]] to [[kinetic energy]]. Rather, a Mach effect thruster is a gravinertial [[transistor]] that controls the flow of gravinertial [[flux]], in and out of the active mass of the thruster. The primary power into the thruster is contained in the flux of the [[gravitational field]], not the electricity that powers the device. Failing to account for this flux, is much the same as failing to account for the [[wind]] on a [[sail]].&lt;ref name="Stahl 2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Mach effects are relativistic by nature, and considering a spaceship accelerating with a Mach effect thruster, the propellant is not accelerating with the ship, so the situation should be treated as an accelerating and therefore [[non-inertial reference frame]], where '''F''' does not equal ''m'''''a'''. Keith H. Wanser, professor of physics at California State University, Fullerton, published a paper in 2013 concerning the conservation issues of Mach effect thrusters.&lt;ref name="Wanser 2014"&gt;{{cite journal

==Quantum mechanics==
In 2009, [[Harold Sonny White (NASA Scientist)|Harold "Sonny" White]] of [[NASA]] proposed the Quantum Vacuum Fluctuation (QVF) conjecture, a non-relativistic hypothesis based on quantum mechanics to produce momentum fluxes even in empty [[outer space]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Where Sciama's gravinertial field of [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]] is used in the Woodward effect, the White conjecture replaces the Sciama gravinertial field with the [[QED vacuum|quantum electrodynamic vacuum]] field. The local reactive forces are generated and conveyed by momentum fluxes created in the QED vacuum field by the same process used to create momentum fluxes in the gravinertial field. White uses [[magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]] [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[right-hand rule|rules]] to quantify this local momentum interaction where in comparison Woodward applies [[condensed matter physics]].&lt;ref name="Sonny2011"/&gt;

Based on the White conjecture, the proposed theoretical device is called a [[quantum vacuum plasma thruster]] (QVPT) or Q-thruster. No experiments have been performed to date.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Unlike a Mach effect thruster instantaneously exchanging momentum with the distant cosmic matter through the advanced/retarded waves ([[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]]) of the radiative gravinertial field, Sonny's "Q-thruster" would appear to violate momentum conservation, for the thrust would be produced by pushing off virtual "Q" particle/antiparticle pairs that would annihilate after they have been pushed on. However, it would not necessarily violate the law of conservation of energy, as it requires an electric current to function, much like any "standard" MHD thruster, and cannot produce more kinetic energy than its equivalent net energy input.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Woodward and Fearn showed why the amount of [[electron]]-[[positron]] [[pair production|virtual pairs]] of the quantum vacuum, used by White as a virtual plasma propellant, cannot account for thrusts in any isolated, closed electromagnetic system such as the QVPT or the [[RF resonant cavity thruster|EmDrive]].&lt;ref name="JBIS 2016a"&gt;
