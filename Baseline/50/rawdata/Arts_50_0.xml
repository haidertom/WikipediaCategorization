'''''A Palace Concert''''' ({{zh|宮樂圖}}) is a Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] [[silk painting]] showing ten [[Court lady|court ladies]] and two standing servant maidens around a large rectangular table. Some court ladies are depicted drinking tea, while others drink wine. The four women at the far end are presumably responsible for playing music and livening up the mood. The musical instruments depicted, from left to right, are bamboo pipes, [[guqin]], [[pipa]] and [[flute]]. One of the servant maidens plays a [[Clapper (musical instrument)|clapper]] to maintain beat. A small dog is depicted under the table. The artist and the precise year of the painting are unknown. The painting is housed in the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]], Taiwan.

==Dating==
The hairstyles are combed in one direction on top, while others are combed in two directions and tied into knots around the ears. In addition to a floral headdress, these all indicate some of the popular Tang dynasty fashions.&lt;ref name="com"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/painting-anonymous-a-palace-concert.php|title=A Palace Concert|publisher=China Online Museum|accessdate =30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woven bamboo table, cusped crescent stools, winged wine cups and the style of the lute playing with a large pick showcase late Tang dynasty customs.&lt;ref name="com"/&gt;

The '''Atlas Fountain''' stands in the grounds of [[Castle Howard]], [[North Yorkshire]], England.  It has been designated a Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[listed building]] and is now recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]], maintained by [[Historic England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1148973|desc=Atlas Fountain and Pond|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Atlas Fountain and pond dates from 1850. It was exhibited at [[The Great Exhibition]] prior to installation.&lt;ref&gt;Castle Howard Guidebook, G. Howard. 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed by [[William Andrews Nesfield]] and the sculpted figures were carved in Portland stone by [[John Thomas (sculptor)|John Thomas]] who was paid £1183 10s 3d (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1183.5|1853|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for his work. The figures were transported by rail from London to [[Castle Howard railway station]].

The tazza, pedestals, shells and basin were made by local craftsmen. The water engineering was completed by James Easton,&lt;ref&gt;English Gardens and Landscapes, Christopher Hussey. 1700–1750, Country Life. 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; taking water from a stream in [[Coneysthorpe]] and using a steam engine to pump it uphill to the Ray Wood reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Fountains and Water Features: From Ancient Springs to Modern Marvels. Rosalind Hopwood, Frances Lincoln Ltd, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The fountain was turned on for the first time in October 1853.

The fountain was overhauled in 1983 and again by The Earth Stone and Lime in 2012.

==Description==

A large globe of bronze dominates the fountain supported on the shoulders of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]. Four recumbent [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]] blow water through shells over [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] kneeling on a pedestal in the central tazza. Other jets fill the lower scallop shell basins, which overflow into the central basin producing a dramatic cascade of white water.

The fountain is fed from the half-million gallon Ray Wood reservoir, to the east of the main house. Gravity feeds water into a chamber beneath the pond basin where pipes direct it to the main outlets in the Triton's shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/DB/Latest-News/Atlas-Fountain-Restoration.html |title=Atlas Fountain Restoration :: Castle Howard – Historic Estate, House and Gardens, Yorkshire |publisher=Castle Howard |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=1 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091434/http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/DB/Latest-News/Atlas-Fountain-Restoration.html |archivedate=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pond is approximately {{convert|27|m|ft}} in diameter.

'''''Cahiers d'Art''''' is a French artistic and literary journal founded in 1926 by [[Christian Zervos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Serafin|first=Amy|title=Archive covers from relaunched French magazine Cahiers d'Art|url=http://www.wallpaper.com/art/archive-covers-from-relaunched-french-magazine-cahiers-dart/6237|work=Wallpaper*|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cahiers d'Art'' is also an eponymous publishing house which has published many monographs on artists living in France in the first half of the twentieth century. Publications include the definitive catalogue of works by [[Pablo Picasso]], ''Pablo Picasso par Christian Zervos'', in 33 volumes, with over 16,000 images.&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt;

''Cahiers d'Art'' carries no advertising and is published on an irregular schedule.&lt;ref name=FT /&gt;

== History ==
The journal, founded by the art critic [[Christian Zervos]] in Paris at 14, rue du Dragon in 1926, was published with an interruption from 1941 to 1943, until 1960. The first post-war issue was dated 1940-1944 and focused on poets and writers from the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], including [[Vercors (writer)|Vercors]]. ''Cahiers d'Art'' also published selections from poet [[Paul Éluard]]'s ''Open Book I'' (1940) and ''Open Book II'' (1942).

After World War II, the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] was invited by Zervos to publish two articles on logic: ''Logical Time and the Assertion of Anticipated Certainty'' (1945) and ''The Number Thirteen and the Logical Form of Suspicion'' (1946). [[Samuel Beckett]] also contributed one of his earliest texts in French,''The Painting of Van de Velde or the World and the Pants.''

The journal has been noted for the quality of its articles and illustrations which promoted [[Modern Art]] in France for over thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=36e année, n°1, 2012 : Renaissance des " Cahiers d’art " au détour d’une rue|url=http://www.artmediaagency.com/56319/36e-annee-n1-2012-renaissance-des-cahiers-dart-au-detour-dune-rue/|work=Art Media Agency|accessdate=23 January 2013}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists represented include [[Picasso]], [[Matisse]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Brâncuși]], [[Van Gogh]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Henry Laurens]], [[Moholy-Nagy]], [[Jean Lurçat]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]], [[Victor Brauner]], [[De Chirico]], [[Wolfgang Paalen]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Man Ray]].

Swedish collector [[Staffan Ahrenberg]] purchased the publication and relaunched it in October 2012.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news|last=Adam|first=Georgina|title=Mixed messages in the Middle East; lawsuits in London and New York; Les Cahiers relaunched|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/ea635ede-0306-11e2-a284-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AV1ZmlIi|accessdate=27 October 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maus|first=Burkhard|title=Cahiers d'Art – nouveau et à partir d'aujourd'hui|url=http://www.art-magazin.de/blog/2012/10/19/cahiers-dart-nouveau-et-a-partir-daujourdhui/|work=art|accessdate=23 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231033327/http://www.art-magazin.de/blog/2012/10/19/cahiers-dart-nouveau-et-a-partir-daujourdhui/#|archive-date=2012-12-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 2012==
*The first issue featured works by [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Cyprien Gaillard]], [[Sarah Morris]] and [[Adrián Villar Rojas]], and the architecture of [[Oscar Niemeyer]].&lt;ref name=Cahiers&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ellsworth Kelly|journal=Cahiers d'Art|date=October 2012|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the re-launch of ''Cahiers d'Art,'' 14 rue du Dragon has reopened as a gallery and library, while 15 rue du Dragon now operates as an exhibition space for limited edition prints and editions by contemporary artists.
*In October 2013, ''Cahiers d'Art'' presented an exhibition of [[Philippe Parreno]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saywho.fr/mondanites/3226/vernissage-cahiers-d-art-philippe-parreno/164009|title=Vernissage Cahiers d'art - Philippe Parreno|work=SAYWHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; including recent drawings of the artist as well as a dozen master drawings : [[Francisco de Goya]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Case]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Matthew Barney]], Koo Jeong-A and [[John Cage]].
*In 2014 ''Cahiers d'Art'' released the newly published edition of the [[Pablo Picasso]] by [[Christian Zervos]] catalogue, known by many simply as 'the Zervos', in French and for the first time in English. This catalogue of more than 16,000 works in 33 volumes contains updates from the Picasso Administration.
*The second issue of the revue, N°1-2, 2013 features the work of [[Rosemarie Trockel]] who created especially for ''Cahiers d'Art'' a vinyl inserted in each revue that you can squeeze to make a sculpture. She also designed a plexiglass box for the limited edition. The publication also introduces the work of Peter Fischli and David Weiss, [[Le Corbusier]], Inge Mahn, [[:de:Absalon (Künstler)|Absalon]], and Riccardo Paratore, as well as texts by [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]], Brigid Doherty, Joan Simon, [[Jean-Louis Cohen|Jean Louis Cohen]] and poems by [[Rolf Dieter Brinkmann]]. On the occasion of this release ''Cahiers d'Art'' presented an exhibition of Trockel's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saywho.fr/mondanites/3445/lancement-de-la-revue-cahiers-d-art-2-w-rosemarie-trockel/180504|title=Lancement de la revue Cahiers d'art #2 w/ Rosemarie Trockel|work=SAYWHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their galleries of 14 and 15 rue du Dragon in Paris.

'''Color mapping''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that maps (transforms) the [[color]]s of one (source) [[Digital image|image]] to the colors of another (target) image. A color mapping may be referred to as the [[algorithm]] that results in the mapping function or the algorithm that transforms the image colors. Color mapping is also sometimes called ''color transfer'' or, when [[Grayscale|grayscale images]] are involved, ''brightness transfer function (BTF)''.

== Algorithms ==
There are two types of color mapping algorithms: those that employ the statistics of the colors of two images, and those that rely on a given [[pixel]] correspondence between the images.

An example of an algorithm that employs the statistical properties of the images is [[histogram matching]]. This is a classic algorithm for color mapping, suffering from the problem of sensitivity to image content differences. Newer statistic-based algorithms deal with this problem. An example of such algorithm is adjusting the [[mean]] and the [[standard deviation]] of [[Lab color space|Lab]] channels of the two images.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~turkel/imagepapers/ColorTransfer.pdf Color Transfer between Images]&lt;/ref&gt;

A common algorithm for computing the color mapping when the pixel correspondence is given is building the [[Frequency_distribution#Joint_frequency_distributions|joint-histogram]] (see also [[co-occurrence matrix]]) of the two images and finding the mapping by using [[dynamic programming]] based on the joint-histogram values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2003-103.pdf Inter-Camera Color Calibration using Cross-Correlation Model Function]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the pixel correspondence is not given and the image contents are different (due to different point of view), the statistics of the image corresponding regions can be used as an input to statistics-based algorithms, such as histogram matching. The corresponding regions can be found by detecting the corresponding [[Feature_detection_(computer_vision)|features]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.idc.ac.il/sefyk/colmap.htm Piecewise-consistent Color Mappings of Images Acquired Under Various Conditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135029/http://www1.idc.ac.il/sefyk/colmap.htm |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Color mapping can serve two different purposes: one is calibrating the colors of two cameras for further processing using two or more sample images, the second is adjusting the colors of two images for perceptual visual compatibility.

[[Color calibration]] is an important pre-processing task in [[computer vision]] applications. Many applications simultaneously process two or more images and, therefore, need their colors to be calibrated. Examples of such applications are: [[Image differencing]], [[Image registration|registration]], [[object recognition]], multi-camera [[Video tracking|tracking]], [[Segmentation (image processing)|co-segmentation]] and [[Correspondence problem|stereo reconstruction]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8612">Under [[Canadian trade-mark law]], "confusion" is where a [[Trademark|trade-mark]] is similar enough to another trade-mark to cause consumers to equate them. Likelihood of confusion plays a central role in trade-mark registration, infringement and [[Passing off; trademark registration in Canadian law|passing-off]].{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=530}} Whether a trade-mark or [[Trade name|trade-name]] is confusing is a [[question of fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Benson &amp; Hedges (Canada) Limited v. St. Regis Tobacco Corporation|link=|year=1968|court=scc|num=1|format=canlii|pinpoint= p. 199|parallelcite=[1969] SCR 192|date=1968-11-18|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of confusion in trade-mark law is analogous to the role of [[Patent infringement in Canadian law|substantial infringement]] in [[Canadian patent law|patent law]].{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=530}}

==Definition==

Section 6 of the ''Trademarks Act'' sets out the situations where a trade-mark is confusing:

{{quote|6.(2) The use of a trade-mark causes confusion with another trade-mark if the use of both trade-marks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with those trade-marks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not the wares or service are of the same general class.&lt;ref name = "TMA62"&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Trade-marks Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13)|url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-6.html}}, s. 6(2)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The essence of confusion is the inference of common source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Visa International Service Association v. Visa Motel Corporation|link=|year=1984|court=bcca|num=517|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 15|parallelcite=1 CPR (3d) 109 |date=1984-06-21|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Trade-mark A will be confusing with Trade-mark B if the use of both trade-marks in the same area will lead consumers to believe that the goods or services sold under either trade-mark originate from the same source.

==Statutory Factors==

Section 6(5) of the ''Trademarks Act'' provides that in determining whether there is confusion, a court must examine "all of the surrounding circumstances" including:

{{quote|
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trade-marks or trade-names and the extent to which they have become known;

(b) the length of time the trade-marks or trade-names have been in use;

(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;

(d) the nature of the trade; and

(e) the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks or trade-names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Trade-marks Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13)|url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-6.html}}, s. 6(5)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The factors under section 6(5) are not exhaustive.&lt;ref&gt;''Gainers Inc. v. Marchildon'' (1996), 66 C.P.R. (3d) 308 (F.C.T.D.)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, given the factual nature of confusion, the particular factors considered and the weighing of the factors varies from case-to-case.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=531}}

===Degree of Resemblance===

Determining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks is the starting point of a confusion analysis.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=532}} The assessment of resemblance under s. 6(5)(e) is not limited to similarities in the appearance of the trade-marks. Similar sounding word marks can be confusing, even if they appear to be different.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=532}} Word marks representing similar ideas can be confusing (e.g. "Smoothies" and "Smarties" in the context of candies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Rowntree Company Limited v. Paulin Chambers Company Limited et al.|link=|year=1967|court=scc|num=100|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1968] SCR 134|date=1967-11-28|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard of Comparison===

In determining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks, a court will examine each trade-mark as a whole, rather than breaking it up into its individual elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Ultravite Laboratories Ltd. v. Whitehall Laboratories Ltd.|link=|year=1965|court=scc|num=43|format=canlii|pinpoint=p. 192|parallelcite=[1965] SCR 734|date=1965-06-24|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Molson Companies Ltd. v. John Labatt Ltd.'', the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] compared the trade-marks "Molson Golden" and "Winchester Gold" in their entirety.&lt;ref name = "MolsonLabatt"&gt;''Molson Companies Ltd. v. John Labatt Ltd.'' (1994), 58 C.P.R. (3d) 527&lt;/ref&gt; Although both trade-marks used the descriptive "Gold" or "Golden", when viewed as a whole, the trade-marks were sufficiently distinguishable that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion.&lt;ref name = "MolsonLabatt"/&gt;

==="Ordinary Casual Consumer Somewhat in a Hurry"===

In a leading case on confusion, ''[[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] stated that the appropriate standard of comparison is that of the "ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|link=Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|year=2006|court=scc|num=22|format=|pinpoint=par. 56|parallelcite=[2006] 1 SCR 772|date=2006-06-02|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In applying this standard, a court will ask whether a consumer of average intelligence and caution casually encountering both trade-marks in the marketplace would be likely to confuse them.

===Actual Evidence of Confusion===

In addition to predicting whether an "ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry" would perceive confusion, a court may also consider evidence of actual confusion of the trade-marks in the marketplace.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=534}} Although evidence of actual confusion is not necessary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Christian Dior, S.A. v. Dion Neckwear Ltd.|link=|year=2002|court=fca|num=29|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2002] 3 FC 405|date=2002-01-23|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the presence or absence of actual confusion in the marketplace may be a relevant "surrounding circumstance" under s. 6(5) of the ''Trade-marks Act''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinctiveness===

Marks consisting of everyday words or expressions are inherently less distinctive than ones based on invented or coined words or expressions.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=535}} However, a mark based on an everyday word may nonetheless acquire distinctiveness if it is employed extensively.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=534}} In [[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|''Mattel'']], the Court found that although [[Mattel]]’s "Barbie" trade-mark was based on an [[Barbara (name)|every day word]], it had acquired substantial distinctiveness through its strong association with the company's [[Barbie doll|doll products]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade-marks in Different Businesses===

Although section 6(2) of the ''Trade-marks Act'' provides that there can be confusion "whether or not the wares or service are of the same general class",&lt;ref name = "TMA62"/&gt; differences in the types of goods or services associated with each trade-mark are a relevant consideration in determining confusion.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In  [[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|''Mattel'']], the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] found it unlikely that consumers would confuse "Barbie" for dolls with "Barbie" for restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Cliquot Ltée'', the Supreme Court of Canada found that the use of  "Cliquot" for mid-market women’s clothing stores was not confusing with "Veuve Clicquot" as a mark for a [[Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin|famous brand of champagne]].&lt;ref name = "VeuveClicquot"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Cliquot Ltée|link=|year=2006|court=scc|num=23|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2006] 1 SCR 824|date=2006-06-02|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible for a famous trade-mark holder to argue that its trade-mark will expand into new lines of business, there must a reasonable basis for this prediction.&lt;ref name = "VeuveClicquot"/&gt;

The '''Convention for the protection of the architectural heritage of Europe''' is a legally binding instrument which set the framework for an accurate [[Architectural conservation|conservation]] approach within Europe. For a total of forty three member states of the [[Council of Europe]], the Conventions total ratification/accession has reached forty-two countries since it was opened for signature in 1985.

'''''Hadon of Ancient Opar''''' is a [[fantasy]] novel by American writer [[Philip José Farmer]], first published in paperback by [[DAW Books]] in April 1974, and reprinted three times through 1983. The first British edition was published by Magnum in 1977; it was reprinted by Methuen in 1993. The first trade paperback edition was published by Titan Books in 2013. The work has also been translated into French. It was later gathered together with its sequels ''[[Flight to Opar]]'' and ''The Song of Kwasin''  into the omnibus collection ''Gods of Opar: Tales of Lost Khokarsa'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{isfdb title|id=9570|title=Hadon of Ancient Opar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It and its sequels purport to fill in some of the ancient prehistory of the lost city of [[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]], created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] as a setting for his [[Tarzan]] series.

==Plot==
In the plot of the novel, Hadon journeys to Khokarsa to compete in the "Great Games", in which he triumphs. The prize being that he is entitled to marry the ruling high priestess, should she choose to accept him, and thus become high priest and king of the Khokarsa. However, King Minruth is unwilling to relinquish power and schemes to be rid of Hadon.

The novel deals with the expedition of Hadon, a young Oparian warrior, to the Wild Lands and as far as the mysterious Ringing Sea, which would one day be called the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], with the strange woman whom he meets and brings with him, and with the cataclysmic [[civil war]] which breaks out on his return and which he partly (and completely unintentionally) helps touch off.

The ancient [[Khokarsa]]n society of which Opar is a part is a [[matriarchy]] (a reasonable inference from the culture of the later-day Opar encountered by Tarzan). A delicate balance between the genders is maintained, symbolized by the co-rule of the high priestess and the king (whose main authority is command of the army), which corresponds to some theories of sociologists and historians on the way actual matriarchal societies may have worked. The same scheme is repeated on a smaller scale on the local level, where towns are co-governed by a local priestess and the commander of the local garrison.

The current king, Minruth, tries to subvert this immemorial system and establish exclusive male power, which incidentally would force an incestuous relationship upon the current high priestess, Awineth, who happens to be his daughter. Lalila, the foreign "White Witch from the Sea," whom Hadon brings with him and with whom he falls in love, is used as a pawn in King Minruth's power game; the xenophobic suspicions aroused about her are used in an attempt to undermine the position of women in general.

Hadon and his male and female friends rally to the high priestess' banner against the king's evil schemes.

==Setting==
[[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]] is the first and most frequently re-visited of the many [[lost cities]] and cultures which [[Tarzan]] discovers in [[Africa]]. As portrayed by Burroughs, Opar is ruled by the high priestess [[La (Tarzan)|La]], with whom Tarzan develops a prolonged love/hate relationship. The city itself is a decayed remnant of ancient greatness; it is suggested, though not conclusively, that it is a cut-off colony of [[Atlantis]].

Farmer seizes on Burroughs' ambiguity over the issue to recast Opar as a member city of an otherwise unknown local civilization that flourished in central Africa during the last [[Ice Age]]. It was supposedly based on a pair of now vanished inland seas connected by a narrow strait, with a surface roughly equivalent to the [[Mediterranean]]. The two seas facilitated the appearance of a mercantile culture, technologically similar to [[Ancient Greece]], while the rest of the world was still deep in the [[Stone Age]].

Farmer shows this culture at or near the peak of its ancient glory, more than 10,000 years ago. It comprises numerous thriving (and sometimes warring) [[city states]] and empires, one of which is Opar. Opar is, in fact, far from the most important of these cities. The Opar described in the Tarzan novels is depicted as a "former colony of [[Atlantis]]" and this is adhered to by Farmer, though "Atlantis" in this context—the capital of the empire of which Opar is a province—is located on an island in the African inland sea, not in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

Eventually, subsequent to the period of his story, the two seas drain off into the Atlantic and the culture dependent on them decays and disappears, leaving only the remnant of Opar forgotten in the jungles where Tarzan will discover it. The seas' modern remnants are represented to be the much-shrunken [[Lake Chad]] and the [[Congo River]] basin.

While originally derived from the Tarzan series, the world created by Farmer is given its own independent literary existence, with the sociological and cultural aspects worked out in meticulous detail, and a long historical annex added at the end.

==Reception==
[[Lester del Rey]] found the novel to be "good fun" and noted that Farmer was not imitating Burroughs either in storytelling or characterization, although he faulted Farmer for providing an installment in a longer story rather than one with a dramatic resolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Reading Room", [[If (magazine)|''If'']], August 1974, pp.141-42&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the novel for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Theodore Sturgeon]] described Farmer as "tireless and astonishing".&lt;ref&gt;"If . . . ?", ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', September 8, 1974, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]] and [[rhetoric]], the '''historical present''' or '''historic present''' (also called '''dramatic present''' or '''narrative present''') is the employment of the [[present tense]] when narrating past events. It is widely used in writing about history in Latin (where it is sometimes referred to by its Latin name, ''praesens historicum'') and some modern European languages; in English it is used above all in historical chronicles (listing a series of events); it is also used in fiction,  for "hot news" (as in headlines), and in everyday conversation.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=129–131}} In conversation, it is particularly common with "verbs of communication" such as ''tell'', ''write'', and ''say'' (and in colloquial uses, ''go'').{{sfn|Leech|1971|p=7}}  "Historic present" is the form recognised by the Oxford English Dictionary, whereas "historical present" is the form in Merriam Webster.

More recently, analysts of its use in conversation have argued that it functions not by making an event present, but by marking segments of a narrative, [[foregrounding]] events (that is, signalling that one event is particularly important, relative to others) and marking a shift to evaluation.{{sfn|Brinton|1992|p=221}}  

==Examples==
In an excerpt from [[Dickens]]' ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', the shift from the [[past tense]] to the historical present gives a sense of immediacy, as of a recurring vision:
{{quote|If the funeral  had been yesterday, I could not recollect it better. The very air of the best parlour, when I went in at the door, the bright condition of the fire, the shining of the wine in the decanters, the patterns of the glasses and plates, the faint sweet smell of cake, the odour of Miss Murdstone’s dress, and our black clothes. Mr. Chillip '''is''' in the room, and '''comes''' to speak to me.

"And how is Master David?" he '''says''', kindly.

I '''cannot''' tell him very well. I '''give''' him my hand, which he '''holds''' in his.|author=Charles Dickens|source=''David Copperfield'', Chapter IX}}

Notable novels written entirely in the historical present include [[John Updike]]'s ''[[Rabbit, Run]]'' and [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''.

==In describing fiction==
Summaries of the narratives (plots) of works of fiction are conventionally presented using the present tense rather than the past tense. At any particular point of the story, as it unfolds, there is a ''now'', and hence a ''past'' and a ''future'', so whether some event mentioned in the story is past, present, or, future changes as the story progresses; the entire plot description is presented as if the story's ''now'' is a continuous present. Thus, in summarizing the plot of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', one may write:
{{quote|Manette '''is''' obsessed with making shoes, a trade he '''learned''' while in prison.}}

==Other languages==

In French, the historical present is used in journalism, and in historical texts for reporting events in the past.&lt;ref name="Revaz-2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Le Français aujourd’hui |language=French |last=Revaz |first=Françoise |authorlink=&lt;!--viaf:51724807--&gt; |title=Le présent et le futur historiques : des intrus parmi les temps du passé ? |trans-title=The historical present and future: intruders among the past tenses? |publisher=[[Armand Colin]]-[[:fr:Éditions Dunod|Dunod]] |location=Paris |year=2002 |volume=4 |number=139 |pages=87–96 |url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-le-francais-aujourd-hui-2002-4-page-87.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the traditional music of the Native American groups, there now exist [[pan-Indianism|pan-tribal]] and intertribal [[genre (music)|genres]] as well as distinct Native American [[subgenre]]s of [[popular music]] including: [[rock and roll|rock]], [[blues]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[classical music|classical]], [[film music]], and [[reggae]], as well as unique popular styles like [[chicken scratch]] and [[New Mexico music]].

[[Singing]] and [[percussion]] are the most important aspects of traditional Native American music. Vocalization takes many forms, ranging from solo and choral song to responsorial, unison and multipart singing. Percussion, especially drums and rattles, are common accompaniment to keep the rhythm steady for the singers, who generally use their native language or non-lexical [[vocable]]s (nonsense syllables). Traditional music usually begins with slow and steady beats that grow gradually faster and more emphatic, while various flourishes like drum and rattle [[tremolo]]s, shouts and accented patterns add variety and signal changes in performance for [[singer]]s and [[dancer]]s.&lt;ref name="Overview367-368"&gt;Heth, Charlotte, "Overview" in ''[[The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music]]'', pp. 367–368&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Song texts and sources ===
Native American song texts include both public pieces and secret songs, said to be "ancient and unchanging", which are used for only sacred and ceremonial purposes. There are also public sacred songs, as well as ritual speeches that are sometimes perceived as musical because of their use of rhythm and melody. These ritual speeches often directly describe the events of a ceremony, and the reasons and ramifications of the night.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, pp. 368–370&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vocable]]s, or lexically meaningless syllables, are a common part of many kinds of Native American songs. They frequently mark the beginning and end of phrases, sections or songs themselves. Often songs make frequent use of vocables and other untranslatable elements. Songs that are translatable include historical songs, like the Navajo "[[Shi' naasha']], which celebrates the end of Navajo internment in [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico]] in 1868. Tribal flag songs and national anthems are also a major part of the Native American musical corpus, and are a frequent starter to public ceremonies, especially [[powwow]]s. Native American music also includes a range of [[courtship]] songs, dancing songs and popular American or Canadian tunes like "[[Amazing Grace]], "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]", "[[Jambalaya (song)|Jambalaya]]" and "[[Sugar Time]]". Many songs celebrate harvest, planting season or other important times of year.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, pg. 368-369&lt;/ref&gt;

== Societal role ==

Native American music plays a vital role in history and education, with ceremonies and stories orally passing on ancestral customs to new generations. Native American ceremonial music is traditionally said to originate from deities or spirits, or from particularly respected individuals. Rituals are shaped by every aspect of song, dance and costuming, and each aspect informs about the "makers, wearers and symbols important to the nation, tribe, village, clan, family, or individual".&lt;ref&gt;Overview 367–368&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans perform stories through song, music and dance, and the historical facts thus propagated are an integral part of Native American beliefs. Epic legends and stories about culture heroes are a part of tribal music traditions, and these tales are often an iconic part of local culture.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; They can vary slightly from year to year, with leaders recombining and introducing slight variations. The [[Pueblo]] compose a number of new songs each year in a committee which uses dreams and visions.&lt;ref&gt;Herndon, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

The styles and purposes of music vary greatly between and among each Native American tribe. However, a common concept amongst many indigenous groups is a conflation of music and power. For example, the [[Pima people|Pima]] people feel many of their songs were given in the beginning and sung by the Creator. It was believed that some people then have more of an inclination to musical talent than others because of an individual's peculiar power.&lt;ref&gt;Herndon 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
[[File:SE turtle shackles 1920s OHS.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Southeast women's turtleshell leg rattles, ca. 1920, collection of the [[Oklahoma History Center]]]]
Within various Native American communities, gender plays an important role in music. Men and women play sex-specific roles in many musical activities. Instruments, songs and dances are often peculiar to one or the other sex, and many musical settings are strictly controlled by sex. In modern powwows, women play a vital role as backup singers and dancers.&lt;ref name="Gender"&gt;Heth, "Overview" in the ''Garland Encyclopaedia of World Music'', pp. 370–372&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cherokee]] people, for example, hold dances before [[Stickball (Native American)|stickball]] games. At these pre-game events, men and women perform separate dances and follow separate regulations. Men will dance in a circle around a fire, while women dance in place. Men sing their own songs, while women have their songs sung for them by an [[American Indian elder|elder]]. Whereas the men's songs invoke power, the women's songs draw power away from the opposing stickball team.&lt;ref name="Herndon124"&gt;Herndon, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; In some societies, there are customs where certain ceremonial drums are to be played by men only. For the Southern Plains Indians, it is believed that the first drum was given to a woman by the Great Spirit, who instructed her to share it with all women of native nations. However, there also exist prohibitions against women sitting at the Beg Drum.&lt;ref name="Herndon124"/&gt;

Many tribal music cultures have a relative paucity of traditional women's songs and dances, especially in the Northeast and Southeast regions. The Southeast is, however, home to a prominent women's musical tradition in the use of leg rattles for ceremonial [[stomp dance|stomp]] and friendship dances, and the women's singing during [[Horse and Ball Game]] contests. The West Coast tribes of North America tend to more prominence in women's music, with special women's [[love song]]s, [[medicine song]]s and [[handgame]] songs; the Southwest is particularly diverse in women's musical offerings, with major ceremonial, instrumental and social roles in dances. Women also play a vital ceremonial role in the [[Sun Dance]] of the Great Plains and Great Basin, and sing during social dances. [[Shoshone]] women still sang the songs of the [[Ghost Dance]] into the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gender"/&gt;

== History ==
Music and [[oral history|history]] are tightly interwoven in Native American life. A tribe's history is constantly told and retold through music, which keeps alive an oral narrative of history. These historical narratives vary widely from tribe to tribe and are an integral part of tribal identity. However, their historical authenticity cannot be verified; aside from supposition and some archaeological evidence, the earliest documentation of Native American music came with the arrival of European explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 3 Crawford refers to the "historical knowledge valuable to a Native musician" as falling "more readily into the category of myth than of fact".&lt;/ref&gt; Musical instruments and pictographs depicting music and dance have been dated as far back as the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, Charlotte, "Overview" in ''The Garland Encyclopaedia of World Music'', p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruno Nettl refers to the style of the Great Basin area as the oldest style and common throughout the entire continent before [[Mesoamerica]] but continued in only the Great Basin and in the lullaby, gambling, and tale genres around the continent. A style featuring relaxed vocal technique and the rise may have originated in Mesoamerican Mexico and spread northward, particularly into the California-Yuman and Eastern music areas. According to Nettl, these styles also feature "relative" rhythmic simplicity in drumming and percussion, with isometric material and pentatonic scales in the singing, and motives created from shorter sections into longer ones.&lt;ref name="Nettl56118118"&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

While this process occurred, three Asian styles may have influenced North American music across the Bering Strait, all featuring pulsating vocal technique and possibly evident in recent Paleo-Siberian tribes such as Chuckchee, Yukaghir, Koryak. Also, these may have influenced the Plains-Pueblo, Athabascan, and Inuit-Northwest Coast areas. According to Nettl, the boundary between these southward and the above northward influences are the areas of greatest musical complexity: the Northwest Coast, Pueblo music, and Navajo music. Evidence of influences between the Northwest Coast and Mexico are indicated, for example, by bird-shaped whistles.&lt;ref name="Nettl56118118"/&gt; The Plains-Pueblo area has influenced and continues to influence the surrounding cultures, with contemporary musicians of all tribes learning Plains-Pueblo-influenced pantribal genres such as Peyote songs.&lt;ref name="Nettl56118118"/&gt;

== Music areas ==
{{see also|First Nations music}}
Nettl uses the following music areas which approximately coincide with Wissler, Kroeber, and Driver's [[cultural area]]s: Inuit-Northwest coast, Great Basin, California-Yuman, Plains-Pueblo, Athabascan, and Eastern.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, p.107-116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apachefiddler.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Chasi, a [[Warm Springs Apache]] musician playing the Apache fiddle, 1886, photo by A. Frank Randall&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siarchives&amp;uri=full=3100001~!33821~!0#focus "Portrait of Chasi, Bonito's Son..."] ''National Anthropological Archives.'' (retrieved 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Native Americans of the [[Southwestern United States]] were limited to [[idiophone]]s and [[aerophone]]s as mediums to sound production beginning date in the seventh century. The applicable idiophones included: plank resonators, [[footed drum]]s, [[percussion stone]]s, [[shaken idiophone]]s, [[vessel rattle]]s, and copper and clay [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. The applicable aerophones included [[bullroarer]]s, decomposable [[whistle]]s and [[flute]]s, clay resonator whistles, [[shell trumpet]]s and prehistoric [[reed instrument]]s. The wood flute was of particular significance. 

Arid [[American Southwest]] is home to two broad groupings of closely related cultures, the [[Pueblo]] and [[Athabaskan]]. The Southern Athabaskan [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] and [[Apache]] tribes sing in Plains-style [[Nasalization|nasal vocals]] with unblended monophony, while the Pueblos emphasize a relaxed, low range and highly blended monophonic style. Athabaskan songs are swift and use drums or [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s, as well as an instrument unique to this area, the [[Apache fiddle]], or "Tsii'edo'a'tl" meaning "wood that sings" in the [[Apache language]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Pueblo songs are complex and meticulously detailed, usually with five sections divided into four or more phrases characterized by detailed introductory and cadential formulas. They are much slower in tempo than Athabaskan songs, and use various [[percussion instrument]]s as accompaniment.
[[File:PiuteGamblingSong.ogg|left|thumb|Piute Game Song intended to accompany the action of the game being played.]]
Nettl describes Pueblo music, including [[Hopi]], [[Zuni people|Zuni]], [[Taos Pueblo]], [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]], [[Santo Domingo Pueblo]], and many others, as one of the most complex on the continent, featuring increased length and number of scale tones ([[hexatonic scale|hexatonic]] and [[heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] common), variety of form, melodic contour, and percussive accompaniment, ranges between an octave and a twelfth, with rhythmic complexity equal to the Plains sub-area. He sites the [[Kachina]] dance songs as the most complex songs and Hopi and Zuni material as the most complex of the Pueblo, while [[Tanoan languages|Tanoan]] and [[Keres language|Keresan]] music is simpler and intermediate between the Plains and western Pueblos. The music of the [[Pima people|Pima]] and [[Tohono O'odham]] is intermediary between the Plains-Pueblo and the California-Yuman music areas, with melodic movement of the Yuman, though including the [[Melodic motion|rise]], and the form and rhythm of the Pueblo.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956112114"&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp. 112–114&lt;/ref&gt;

He describes Southern Athabascan music, that of the Apache and Navajo, as the simplest next to the Great Basin style, featuring [[strophic form]], tense vocals using [[pulse (music)|pulsation]] and [[falsetto]], [[tritonic scale|tritonic]] and [[tetratonic scale|tetratonic]] scales in [[triad (music)|triad]] formation, simple rhythms and values of limited duration (usually only two per song), arc-type melodic contours, and large melodic intervals with a predominance of [[major third|major]] and [[minor third|minor thirds]] and [[perfect fourth|perfect fourths]] and [[perfect fifth|fifths]] with [[octave]] leaps not rare. [[Peyote song]]s share characteristics of Apache music and Plains-Pueblo music having been promoted among the Plains by the Apache people.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956112114"/&gt;

He describes the structural characteristics of California-Yuman music, including that of Pomo, Miwak, Luiseno, Catalineno, and Gabrielino, and the Yuman tribes, including, Mohave, Yuman, Havasupai, Maricopa, as using the rise in almost all songs, a relaxed nonpulsating vocal technique (like European classical music), a relatively large amount of isorhythmic material, some isorhythmic tendencies, simple rhythms, pentatonic scales without semitones, an average melodic range of an octave, [[sequence (music)|sequence]], and [[syncopation|syncopated]] figures such as a sixteenth-note, eight-note, sixteenth-note figure. The form of rise used varies throughout the area, usually being rhythmically related to the preceding non-rise section but differing in melodic material or pitch. The rise may be no higher than the highest pitch of the original section, but will contain a much larger number of higher pitches. In California the non-rise is usually one reiterate phrase, the rise being the phrase transposed an octave higher, the Yumans use a non-rise of long repeated sections each consisting of several phrases, the rise being three to five phrases performed only once, and in southern California the previous two and progressive forms are found.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp.109–110&lt;/ref&gt; A distinctively Californian instrument is the [[clapper stick]], a percussion instrument made by splitting an elderberry branch used to accompany singers and dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keeling |first1=Richard |title=Music and Culture Areas of Native California |journal=Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology |date=1992 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=6-7, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Woodlands===
[[File:Cwy turtleshell rattle.jpg|thumb|360px|Men's turtleshell rattle, made by [[Tommy Wildcat]] ([[Cherokee]]-[[Muscogee (Creek)|Muscogee]]-[[Natchez Nation|Natchez]]]]
Inhabiting a wide swath of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands]], according to Nettl, can be distinguished by [[antiphon]]y ([[call and response (music)|call and response]] style singing), which does not occur in other areas. Their territory includes [[Maritime Canada]], [[New England]], [[Mid-Atlantic States|U.S. Mid-Atlantic]], [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] and [[United States Southeast|Southeast]] regions. Songs are rhythmically complex, characterized by frequent metric changes and a close relationship to [[ritual dance]]. Flutes and whistles are solo instruments, and a wide variety of drums, rattles and striking sticks are played. Nettl describes the Eastern music area as the region between the [[Mississippi river]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. The most complex styles are that of the Southeastern Creek, [[Yuchi]], Cherokee, [[Choctaw]], [[Iroquois]] and their language group, with the simpler style being that of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language group including [[Lenape|Delaware]] and [[Penobscot]]. The Algonquian-speaking [[Shawnee]] have a relatively complex style influenced by the nearby southeastern tribes.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956114115"&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp.114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this entire area include short iterative phrases; reverting relationships; shouts before, during, and after singing [[Anhemitonic scale|anhemitonic pentatonic scales]]; simple rhythms and meter and, according to Nettl, antiphonal or responsorial techniques including "rudimentary imitative [[polyphony]]". Melodic movement tends to be gradually descending throughout the area and vocals include a moderate amount of tension and pulsation.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956114115"/&gt;

===Plains===
&lt;!--[[Plains Indian music]] redirects directly here--&gt;
Extending across the [[American Midwest]] into Canada, [[Great Plains|Plains]]-area music is [[Nasalization|nasal]], with high pitches and frequent [[falsetto]]s, with a [[terraced descent]] (a step-by-step descent down an [[octave]]) in an unblended [[monophony]]. [[Strophe]]s use [[incomplete repetition]], meaning that songs are divided into two parts, the second of which is always repeated before returning to the beginning.

Large double-sided skin drums are characteristic of the Plains tribes, and solo [[end-blown flute]]s (flageolet) are also common.

Nettl describes the central [[Plains Indians]], from Canada to Texas: Blackfoot, Crow, Dakota, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and Comanche, as the most typical and simple sub-area of the Plains-Pueblo music area. This area's music is characterized by extreme vocal tension, pulsation, melodic preference for perfect fourths and a range averring a tenth, rhythmic complexity, and increased frequency of [[Musical scale|tetratonic scale]]s. The musics of the Arapaho and Cheyenne intensify these characteristics, while the northern tribes, especially [[Blackfoot music]], feature simpler material, smaller melodic ranges, and fewer scale tones.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Nettl [[Arapaho music]] includes ceremonial and secular songs, such as the ritualistic [[Sun Dance]], performed in the summer when the various bands of the Arapaho people would come together. Arapaho traditional songs consist of two sections exhibiting terraced descent, with a range greater than an octave and scales between four and six tones. Other ceremonial songs were received in visions, or taught as part of a man's initiations into a society for his age group. Secular songs include a number of social dances, such as the triple meter [[round dance]]s and songs to inspire warriors or recent exploits. There are also songs said to be taught by a guardian spirit, which should be sung only when the recipient is near death.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1965, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Basin===
Music of the [[Great Basin]] is simple, discreet and ornate, characterized by short melodies with a range smaller than an [[octave]], moderately-blended [[monophony]], relaxed and open vocals and, most unusually, paired-phrase structure, in which a melodic [[phrase (music theory)|phrase]], repeated twice, is alternated with one to two additional phrases. A song of this type might be diagrammed as follows: AA BB CC AA BB CC, etc.

Nettl describes the music of the sparsely settled Great Basin, including most of desert Utah and Nevada (Paiute, Ute, Shoshoni) and some of southern Oregon (Modoc and Klamath), as "extremely simple," featuring melodic ranges averaging just over a perfect fifth, many tetratonic scales, and short forms. The majority of songs are iterative with each phrase repeated once, though occasional songs with multiple repetitions are found. Many Modoc and Klamath songs contain only one repeated phrase and many of their scales only two to three notes (ditonic or tritonic). This style was carried to the Great Plains by the [[Ghost Dance religion]] which originated among the Paiute, and very frequently features paired-phrase patterns and a relaxed nonpulsating vocal style. Herzog attributes the similarly simple lullabies, song-stories, and gambling songs found all over the continent historically to the music of the Great Basin which was preserved through relative cultural isolation and low population.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, p. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northwest Coast===
Open vocals with [[monophony]] are common in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[British Columbia]], though [[polyphony]] also occurs (this is the only area of North America with native polyphony). Chromatic intervals accompanying long melodies are also characteristic, and rhythms are complex and declamatory, deriving from speech. Instrumentation is more diverse than in the rest of North America, and includes a wide variety of whistles, flutes, horns and percussion instruments.

Nettl describes the music of the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]], [[Tsimshian]], [[Makah people|Makah]], and Quileute as some of the most complex on the continent, with the music of the Salish nations ([[Nlaka'pamux]], [[Nuxalk Nation|Nuxálk]], and [[Sliammon]], and others directly east of the Northwest tribes) as being intermediary between these Northwest Coast tribes and Inuit music. The music of the Salish tribes, and even more so the Northwest coast, intensifies the significant features of Inuit music, see below, however their melodic movement is often pendulum-type ("leaping in broad intervals from one limit of the range to the other"). The Northwest coast music also "is among the most complicated on the continent, especially in regard to rhythmic structure," featuring intricate rhythmic patterns distinct from but related to the vocal melody and rigid percussion. He also reports unrecorded use of incipient polyphony in the form of drones or parallel intervals in addition to antiphonal and responorial forms. Vocals are extremely tense, producing dynamic contrast, ornamentation, and pulsation, and also often using multiple sudden accents in one held tone.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956108108"&gt;Nettl, 1956, p. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arctic===
[[File:Inupiat drummers at Eskimo dance.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Inupiaq]] drummers in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]]]]
{{main|Inuit music}}
The [[Inuit]] of [[Alaska]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Yukon Territory]], [[Nunavut]] and [[Greenland]] are well known for their [[Inuit throat singing|throat-singing]], an unusual method of vocalizing found only in a few cultures worldwide. Throat-singing is used as the basis for a game among the Inuit. Narrow-ranged melodies and declamatory effects are common, as in the Northwest. Repeated notes mark the ends of phrases. [[Box drums]], which are found elsewhere, are common, as is a [[tambourine]]-like [[hand drum]]. Nettl describes "Eskimo" music as some of the simplest on the continent, listing characteristics including recitative-like singing, complex rhythmic organization, relatively small melodic range averaging about a sixth, prominence of major thirds and minor seconds melodically, with undulating melodic movement.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956108108"/&gt;

==Academic study==
Archaeological evidence of Native American music dates as far back as the 7th century. However, the earliest written documentation comes from the arrival of European explorers on the American continent, and the earliest academic research comes from the late 19th century. During that period, early musicologists and folklorists collected and studied Native American music, and propounded theories about indigenous styles. In the early 20th century, more systematic research began led by comparative musicologists like [[Frances Densmore]], [[Natalie Curtis]], [[George Herzog (ethnomusicologist)|George Herzog]] and [[Helen Heffron Roberts]]. Densmore was the most prolific of the era, publishing more than one hundred works on Native American music. Most recently, since the 1950s, Native American music has been a part of ethnomusicological research, studied by [[Bruno Nettl]], [[William Powers (ethnomusicologist)|William Powers]] and [[David P. McAllester|David McAllester]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, Charlotte, "Overview" in ''The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music'', pg. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intertribal music==
[[File:Wake singers oglala.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Wake Singers, band of Oglala Lakota musicians]]
Many music genres span multiple tribes. Pan-tribalism is the syncretic adoption of traditions from foreign communities. Since the rise of the United States and Canada, Native Americans have forged a common identity, and invented pan-Indian music, most famously including [[powwow]]s, [[peyote song]]s, and the [[Ghost Dance]].

The Ghost Dance spread throughout the Plains tribes in the 1890s and many songs are sung today. They are characterized by relaxed vocals and a narrow range. [[Apache Tribe|Apache]]-derived peyote songs, [[prayer]]s in the [[Native American Church]], use a descending melody and monophony. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s and [[water drum]]s are used, in a swift tempo. The [[Sun Dance]] and [[Grass Dance]] of the plains are the roots of intertribal powwows, which feature music with [[terraced descent]] and nasal vocals, both Plains characteristic features.

An example of an intertribal song is the [[AIM Song]], which uses meaningless [[vocables]] to make it accessible to people of all tribes. However, because of its origins from the Lakota and Ojibwe people, it still retains some Northern Plains and Great Lakes characteristics.

[[John Trudell]] ([[Santee Dakota]]) launched a new genre of [[spoken word]] poetry in the 1980s, beginning with ''[[Aka Graffiti Man]]'' (1986). The next decade saw further innovations in Native American popular music, including [[Robbie Robertson]] (of [[The Band]]) releasing a [[soundtrack]] for a [[documentary film|documentary]], ''[[Music for the Native Americans]]'', that saw limited mainstream success, as well as [[Verdell Primeaux]] and [[Johnny Mike]]'s modernized [[peyote song]]s, which they began experimenting with on ''[[Sacred Path: Healing Songs of the Native American Church]]''.

Waila (or chicken scratch music of the [[Tohono O'odham]]) has gained performers like the [[Joaquin Brothers]] fame across Native American communities, while [[hip hop music|hip hop]] crews like [[WithOut Rezervation]] and [[Robby Bee &amp; the Boyz From the Rez]] (''[[Reservation of Education]]'') have a distinctively Native American flourish to hip hop. In the 21st century the leading light of contemporary Native American music has been [[Martha Redbone]] whose award winning albums ''[[Home of the Brave (2002)]]'' and ''[[Skintalk (2005)]]'' have incorporated both traditional song and culture references into a brew of soul, funk, rock and jazz that has reached audiences across Europe and Japan as well as into the urban communities of the US. Meanwhile, young Native musicians such as [[Red Earth (band)|Red Earth]] (see [["Zia Soul" (2003)]] ), [[DJ Abel]], [[Derek Miller]], [[Ethnic DeGeneration]], [[War Water]], and [[DJ Casper|Casper]] are producing outstanding underground music (ranging from hip-hop to funk to reggae to metal) defying stereotypes of Native people (without label support).

[[American Indian opera]] is an intertribal music tradition, created when [[Gertrude Bonnin]], a [[Yankton Dakota]] activist collaborated with a classical composer William Hanson to create the opera, ''Sun Dance'' in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kstrom.net/isk/stories/authors/bonnin.html "Gertrude Bonnin, Zitkala Sha, Yankton Nakota."] ''Native Authors.''

===Native American flute===
[[File:Yuchiflute.png|thumb|350px|A traditional [[Yuchi]] flute.&lt;ref&gt;Speck, Frank G. ''Ethnology of the Yuchi Indians.'' Philadelphia: University Museum, 1909. p. 154. Pl. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Native American flute}}
The Native American flute has achieved some measure of fame for its distinctive sound, used in a variety of [[New-age music|new age]] and [[world music]] recordings. Its music was used in [[courtship]], [[healing]], meditation, and spiritual rituals.

The late 1960s saw a [[roots revival]] centered around the flute, with a new wave of flautists and artisans like [[Doc Tate Nevaquaya]] ([[Comanche]]) and [[Carl Running Deer]]. Notable and award winning Native American flautists include: [[Mary Youngblood]], [[Kevin Locke (musician)|Kevin Locke]], [[Charles Littleleaf]], [[Jay Red Eagle]], [[Robert Tree Cody]], [[Robert Mirabal]], [[Joseph Firecrow]], and [[Jeff Ball (musician)|Jeff Ball]]. [[Tommy Wildcat]] is a contemporary flutist, who makes traditional Cherokee [[river cane]] flutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powersource.com/gallery/wildcat/default.htm Tommy Wildcat.] ''Powersource.'' 1997 (retrieved 28 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Of special importance is [[R. Carlos Nakai]] (''[[Changes (R. Carlos Nakai album)|Changes]]'', 1983), who has achieved Gold record status and mainstream credibility for his mixture of the flute with other contemporary genres.

The Native American flute is the only flute in the world constructed with two air chambers - there is a wall inside the flute between the top (slow) air chamber and the bottom chamber which has the whistle and finger holes. The top chamber also serves as a secondary resonator, which gives the flute its distinctive sound. There is a hole at the bottom of the "slow" air chamber and a (generally) square hole at the top of the playing chamber. A block (or "bird") with a spacer is tied on top of the flute to form a thin, flat airstream for the whistle hole (or "window"). Some more modern flutes use an undercut either in the block or the flute to eliminate the need for a spacer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Flutopedia.com/anatomy.htm ''Anatomy of the Native American Flute'', Clint Goss]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "traditional" Native American flute was constructed using measurements based on the body - the length of the flute would be the distance from armpit to wrist, the length of the top air chamber would be one fist-width, the distance from the whistle to the first hole also a fist-width, the distance between holes would be one thumb-width, and the distance from the last hole to the end would generally be one fist-width. Unlike Western music, traditional American Indian music had no standard pitch reference such as [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]], so flutes were not standardized for pitch.

Historic Native American flutes are generally tuned to a variation of the minor pentatonic scale (such as you would get playing the black keys on a piano), which gives the instrument its distinctive plaintive sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flutopedia.com/scale_PentatonicMinor.htm ''NAF Scale: Pentatonic Minor'', Clint Goss]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently some makers have begun experimenting with different scales, giving players new melodic options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flutopedia.com/scales.htm ''NAF Scales for the Native American Flute'', Clint Goss]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, modern flutes are generally tuned in concert keys (such as A or D) so that they can be easily played with other instruments. The root keys of modern Native American flutes span a range of about three and a half octaves, from C2 to A5.

Native American flutes most commonly have either 5 or 6 holes, but instruments can have anything from no holes to seven (including a thumb hole). Various makers employ different scales and fingerings for their flutes.

Some modern Native American flutes are called "drone" flutes, and are two (or more) flutes built together. Generally, the drone chamber plays a fixed note which the other flute can play against in harmony.

===Drums===
[[File:MIM PHX 2011-04-26 0197 edited.jpg|thumb|Drum and drumsticks at rest]]
Drums are highly influential in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums and how to play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.

Another type of drum called a [[foot drum]] have been found in several southwestern and central-Californian Native American archaeological sites inhabited, or formally inhabited, by the [[Miwok]], [[Maidu]], [[Nahua people|Nahua]], and [[Hopi]] Indian tribes. These drums were often semicircle cross-sectioned hollow logs laid over wood covered 'resonating' pits positioned according to custom in [[kivas]] or dance houses. The foot drums were played by stomping on top of the hollow log with the structure's poles used for steadying.

===Awards===
The dedicated [[Native American Music Awards]], which successfully proposed the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album, was launched in 1998 and continues to be held annually. The Native American Music Awards or N.A.M.A. was the first national awards program for Native American music in North America. The awards were born out of a need for greater recognition for Native American music initiatives and remains the largest professional membership based organization in the world.

From 2001 to 2011, the American [[Grammy Awards]] presented an annual award for [[Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album|Best Native American Music Album]], and the Canadian [[Juno Awards]] present an annual award for [[Juno Award for Aboriginal Recording of the Year|Aboriginal Recording of the Year]]. On April 6, 2011, it was announced that the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album would be merged with the [[Grammy Award for Best Hawaiian Music Album|Best Hawaiian Music Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album|Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album]] categories into a new category, [[Best Regional Roots Music Album]]. This change was part of a massive restructuring of Grammy categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement|title=GRAMMY Awards Category Restructuring|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AQXlzopI?url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement|archivedate=2012-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/explanation-for-category-restructuring|title=Explanation for Category Restructuring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samples==
*[[Media:Bice'waan Song.ogg]] is a recording from the [[Library of Congress]], collected by Alice Cunningham Fletcher and Francis La Flesche and published in 1897. The singer is George Miller, who was probably born in about 1852. It was described as: "The true love-song, called by the Omaha Bethae waan, an old designation and not a descriptive name, is sung generally in the early morning, when the lover is keeping his tryst and watching for the maiden to emerge from the tent and go to the spring. They belong to the secret courtship and are sometimes called Me-the-g'thun wa-an - courting songs. . . . They were sung without drum, bell or rattle, to accent the rhythm, in which these songs is subordinated to tonality and is felt only in the musical phrases. . . . Vibrations for the purpose of giving greater expression were not only affected by the tremolo of the voice, but they were enhanced by waving the hand, or a spray of artemesia before the lips, while the body often swayed gently to the rhythm of the song (Fletcher, 1894, p.&amp;nbsp;156)."
*[[Media:PiuteGamblingSong.ogg|Download recording]] [[Ghost Dance]] and [[gambling]] song from the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] and [[Arapaho]] Native Americans from the Library of Congress' ''Emile Berliner and the Birth of the Recording Industry Collection''; performed by James Mooney (possibly along with Charles Mooney; neither are believed to be [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]) on July 5, 1894

'''''La Voix des Femmes''''' ({{lang-en|'''The Women's Voice'''}}) was a [[Paris]]ian [[feminist]] newspaper, and later an organization dedicated to education and the advancement of women's rights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist255-s01/eponine2/newspaper.html|title=A Feminist Daily Newspaper in France?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.mtholyoke.edu|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper was put together by [[Eugenie Niboyet]] and published daily beginning in 1848 with the fall of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] and the emergence of the much more lenient [[French Second Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exiles from European Revolutions|first=Sabine|last=Freitag|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the initial popularity of the newspaper, it soon became an official association with such prominent members as [[Jeanne Deroin]], [[Pauline Roland]], [[Eugenie Niboyet]] and [[Desirée Gay]].  Male collaboration with the newspaper was welcome and among the male contributors was French poet, [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Members of the ''Voix des Femmes'' did not question that a woman's role was inherently maternal or domestic.  Instead, they tried to use the importance of this role as justification for increased financial security, job security, education, property rights, and women's [[suffrage]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} The ''Voix des Femmes'' closed in 1852.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30003">'''Lettrism''' is a French [[avant-garde]] movement, established in Paris in the mid-1940s by [[Romania]]n immigrant [[Isidore Isou]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1992) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/lettrism-1992 "Lettrism"]. ''Glossary of Art, Architecture &amp; Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed.&lt;/ref&gt; In a body of work totaling hundreds of volumes, Isou and the Lettrists have applied their theories to all areas of art and culture, most notably in poetry, film, painting and political theory. The movement has its theoretical roots in [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]]. Isou viewed his fellow countryman [[Tristan Tzara]] as the greatest creator and rightful leader of the Dada movement, and dismissed most of the others as plagiarists and falsifiers.&lt;ref&gt;See Isou, ''Les véritables créateurs et les falsificateurs de dada, du surréalisme et du lettrisme'' (1973), and Maurice Lemaître, ''Le lettrisme devant dada et les nécrophages de dada'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Surrealists, [[André Breton]] was a significant influence, but Isou was dissatisfied by what he saw as the stagnation and theoretical bankruptcy of the movement as it stood in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;See Isou, ''Réflexions sur André Breton'' (1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the movement is called '''''Lettrisme''''', from the French word for ''letter'', arising from the fact that many of their early works centred on letters and other visual or spoken symbols. The ''Lettristes'' themselves prefer the spelling ''''Letterism'''' for the Anglicised term, and this is the form that is used on those rare occasions when they produce or supervise English translations of their writings: however, 'Lettrism' is at least as common in English usage. The term, having been the original name that was first given to the group, has lingered as a blanket term to cover all of their activities, even as many of these have moved away from any connection to letters. But other names have also been introduced, either for the group as a whole or for its activities in specific domains, such as 'the Isouian movement', 'youth uprising', '[[hypergraphics]]', 'creatics', 'infinitesimal art' and 'excoördism'.

== History ==
'''1925.'''&lt;ref&gt;For fuller chronological details, see Curtay, ''La poésie lettriste''; Foster, ''Lettrisme: Into the Present'';  Sabatier, ''Le lettrisme''.&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore Goldstein is born at [[Botoşani]], [[Romania]], on January 31, to an [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish family. During the early 1950s, Goldstein would be signing himself 'Jean-Isidore Isou'; otherwise, it has always been '[[Isidore Isou]]'. 'Isou' is standardly taken to be a pseudonym, but Isou/Goldstein himself resists this interpretation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;My name is Isou. My mother called me Isou, only it's written differently in Romanian. And Goldstein: I'm not ashamed of my name. At Gallimard, I was known as Isidore Isou Goldstein. Isou, it's my name! Only in Romanian it's written Izu, but in French it's Isou.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Roland Sabatier, 15 November 1999, in ''La Termitière'', no. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 1940s ===
*'''1942–1944.''' Isou develops the principles of Lettrism, and begins writing the books that he would subsequently publish after his relocation to [[Paris]].
*'''1945.''' Aged twenty, Isou arrives in Paris on August 23 after six weeks of clandestine travel. In November, he founds the Letterist movement with [[Gabriel Pomerand]].
*'''1946.''' Isou and Pomerand disrupt a performance of Tzara's ''La Fuite'' at the Vieux-Colombier. Publication of ''La Dictature Lettriste: cahiers d'un nouveau régime artistique'' (''The Letterist Dictatorship: notebooks of a new artistic regime''). Although announced as the first in a series, only one such notebook would appear. A subtitle proudly boasts of Letterism that it is 'the only contemporary movement of the artistic avant-garde'.
*'''1947.''' Isou's first two books are published by [[Gallimard]]: ''Introduction à une nouvelle poésie et à une nouvelle musique'' (''Introduction to a New Poetry and a New Music'') and ''L'Agrégation d'un nom et d'un messie'' (''Aggregation of a Name and a Messiah''). The former sets out Isou's theory of the 'amplic' and 'chiselling' phases, and, within this framework, presents his views on both the past history and the future direction of '''poetry''' and '''music'''. The latter is more biographical, discussing the genesis of Isou's ideas, as well as exploring [[Judaism]]. Isou and Pomerand are joined by François Dufrêne.
*'''1949.''' Isou publishes ''Isou, ou la mécanique des femmes'' (''Isou, or the mechanics of women''), the first of several works of '''[[erotology]]''',  wherein he claims to have bedded 375 women in the preceding four years, and offers to explain how (p.&amp;nbsp;9). The book is banned and Isou is briefly imprisoned. Also published, the first of several works on '''political theory''', Isou's ''Traité d'économie nucléaire: Le soulèvement de la jeunesse'' (''Treatise of Nuclear Economics: Youth Uprising'').

=== 1950s ===
*'''1950.''' [[Maurice Lemaître]], [[Jean-Louis Brau]], [[Gil J. Wolman]] and [[Serge Berna]] join the group. Isou publishes first [[metagraphy|metagraphic]] '''novel''', ''Les journaux des dieux'' (''The Gods' Diaries''), followed soon afterwards by Pomerand's ''Saint Ghetto des Prêts'' (''Saint Ghetto of the Loans'') and Lemaître's ''Canailles'' (''Scoundrels''). Also, the first manifestos of Letterist '''painting'''. Some of the younger Letterists [[Notre-Dame Affair|invade Nôtre Dame cathedral at Easter mass]], aired live on national TV, to announce to the congregation that God is dead. In a Letterist [[FAQ]] published in the first issue of Lemaître's journal, ''Ur'', CP-Matricon explains: 'The letterists do not create scandals: they break the [[Conspiracy of silence (expression)|conspiracy of silence]] set up by pusillanimous show-offs (journalists) and smash the faces of those who don't please them.' (p.&amp;nbsp;8).
*'''1951.''' Isou completes his first '''film''', ''[[Traité de bave et d'éternité]]'' (''Treatise on Slime and Eternity''), which will soon be followed by Lemaître's ''Le film est déjà commencé?'' (''Has the film already started?''), [[Gil J. Wolman|Wolman]]'s ''L'Anticoncept'' (''The Anticoncept''), [[François Dufrêne|Dufrêne]]'s ''Tambours du jugement premier'' (''Drums of the First Judgment'') and [[Guy Debord]]'s ''[[Hurlements en faveur de Sade]]'' (''Howls for de Sade''). Debord joins the group in April when they travel down to [[Cannes]] (where he was then living) to show ''Traité de bave et d'éternité'' at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Under the auspices of [[Jean Cocteau]], a prize for 'best avant-garde' is specially created and awarded to Isou's film.
*'''1952.''' Publication of the first (and only) issue of ''Ion'', devoted to Letterist film. This is significant for including Debord's first appearance in print, alongside work from Wolman and Berna who, following an intervention at a [[Charlie Chaplin]] press conference at the Hotel Ritz in October, would join him in splitting from Isou's group to form the '''Letterist International'''.
{{Main|Letterist International}}
*'''1953.''' Isou moves into '''photography''' with ''Amos, ou Introduction à la métagraphologie'' (''Amos, or Introduction to Metagraphology''), '''theatre''' with ''Fondements pour la transformation intégrale du théâtre'' (''The Foundations of the Integrated Transformation of the Theatre''), '''painting''' with ''Les nombres'' (''The Numbers''), and '''dance''' with ''Manifeste pour une danse ciselante'' (''Manifesto for Chiselling Dance'').
*'''1955.''' Dufrêne develops his first ''Crirhythmes''.
*'''1956.''' Isou introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in ''Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire'' (''Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics'').
*'''1958.''' [[Columbia Records]] release the first audio recordings of Letterist poetry, ''Maurice Lemaître presente le lettrisme''.

=== 1960s ===
*'''1960.''' Isou introduces the concept of supertemporal art in ''L'Art supertemporel''. [[Asger Jorn]] publishes a critique of Letterism, ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/originality.html Originality and Magnitude (on the system of Isou)]'' in issue 4 of ''Internationale Situationniste''. Isou replies at length in ''L'Internationale Situationniste, un degré plus bas que le jarrivisme et l'englobant''. This is only the first of many works that Isou will write against Debord (his former protégé) and the [[Situationist International]], which Isou regards as a neo-Nazi organisation. However, as Andrew Hussey reports, his attitude does eventually mellow: 'Now Isou forgave them and he saw (it was crucial, Isou said, that I should understand this!) that they were all on the same side after all.'&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hussey, ''The Game of War'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2001), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the sixties, several new members join group, including [[Jacques Spacagna]] (1961), [[Aude Jessemin]] (1962), [[Roberto Altmann]] (1962), [[Roland Sabatier]] (1963), [[Alain Satié]] (1964), [[Micheline Hachette]] (1964), [[Francois Poyet]] (1966), [[Jean-Paul Curtay]] (1967),  [[Anton Perich]] (1967), [[Gérard-Philippe Broutin]] (1968).
*'''1964.''' Definitive split with Dufrêne and the [[ultra-lettrist|Ultraletterists]], as well as with Wolman who, despite his participation from 1952 to 1957 with the Letterist International (who were forbidden by internal statute from any involvement in Isouian activities), had retained links with Isou's group. Dufrêne and Wolman with Brau form the Second Letterist International (''Deuxième internationale lettriste'').
*'''1967.''' Lemaître stands for election to the local Parisian legislature, representing the 'Union of Youth and Externity'. He loses.
*'''1968.''' First work on '''architecture''', Isou's ''Manifeste pour le bouleversement de l'architecture'' (''Manifesto for the Overhaul of Architecture'').

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
General continuation of existing currents, together with new research into psychiatry, mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
*'''1972''' [[Mike Rose (painter)]], a German painter, set designer, and writer made acquaintance with the Lettrists and became part of them. He participated in their exhibitions until the 1980s.
Other members to join the lettrism during the seventies : [[Woody Roehmer]], [[Anne-Catherine Caron]], and during the eighties : Frédérique Devaux, Michel Amarger ...

=== 1990s ===
Development of excoordism. Uncomfortable with the direction the group is going in, Lemaître—Isou's right-hand man for nearly half a century—begins to distance himself from it.&lt;ref&gt;See Satié, ''Le lettrisme, la creation ininterrompue'' (Paris: Jean-Paul Rocher, 2003), 56n34.&lt;/ref&gt; He still continues to pursue traditional Letterist techniques, but now in relative isolation from the main group.

=== 2000s ===
* '''2007''' Isou dies  and [http://antisystemic.org/DAMTP/TheEndOfTheAgeOfDivinity-Enkutatach409.pdf The End of the Age of Divinity] is published.

== Key concepts ==

=== The Amplic (''amplique'') and the Chiselling (''ciselante'') phases ===
Isou first invented these phases through an examination of the history of poetry, but the conceptual apparatus he developed could very easily be applied to most other branches of art and culture. In poetry, he felt that the first amplic phase had been initiated by [[Homer]]. In effect, Homer set out a blueprint for what a poem ought to be like. Subsequent poets then developed this blueprint, investigating by means of their work all of the different things that could be done within the Homeric parameters. Eventually, however, everything that ''could be'' done within that approach ''had been'' done. In poetry, Isou felt that this point was reached with [[Victor Hugo]] (and in painting with [[Eugène Delacroix]], in music with [[Richard Wagner]].). When amplic poetry had been completed, there was simply nothing to be gained by continuing to produce works constructed according to the old model. There would no longer be any genuine creativity or innovation involved, and hence no aesthetic value. This then inaugurated a chiselling phase in the art. Whereas the form had formerly been used as a tool to express things outside its own domain—events, feelings, etc.--it would then turn in on itself and become, perhaps only implicitly, its own subject matter. From [[Charles Baudelaire]] to [[Tristan Tzara]] (as, in painting, from [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] to [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]; or, in music, from [[Debussy]] to [[Luigi Russolo]]), subsequent poets would deconstruct the grand edifice of poetry that had been developed over the centuries according to the Homeric model. Finally, when this process of deconstruction had been completed, it would then be time for a new amplic phase to commence. Isou saw himself as the man to show the way. He would take the rubble that remained after the old forms had been shattered, and lay out a new blueprint for reutilising these most basic elements in a radically new way, utterly unlike the poetry of the preceding amplic phase. Isou identified the most basic elements of poetic creation as ''letters''—i.e. uninterpreted visual symbols and acoustic sounds—and he set out the parameters for new ways of recombining these ingredients in the name of new aesthetic goals.

=== The ''Lettrie'' ===
Isou's idea for the poem of the future was that it should be purely formal, devoid of all semantic content. The Letterist poem, or ''lettrie'', in many ways resembles what certain [[Futurism (art)|Italian Futurists]] (such as [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]), [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futurists]] (such as [[Velimir Khlebnikov|Velemir Chlebnikov]], [[Iliazd]], or [[Aleksei Kruchenykh|Alexej Kručenych]]—cf. [[Zaum]]), and [[Dada]] poets (such as [[Raoul Hausmann]] or [[Kurt Schwitters]]) had already been doing, and what subsequent [[sound poetry|sound poets]] and [[concrete poetry|concrete poets]] (such as [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Eduard Ovčáček]] or [[Henri Chopin]]) would later be doing. However, the Letterists were always keen to insist on their own radical originality and to distinguish their work from other ostensibly similar currents.

=== Metagraphics/Hypergraphics ===
On the visual side, the Letterists first gave the name '[[metagraphy|metagraphics]]' (''metagraphie'') and then '[[hypergraphics]]' (''hypergraphie'') to their new synthesis of writing and visual art. Some precedents may be seen in [[Cubist]], [[Dada]] and Futurist (both [[Futurism (art)|Italian]] and [[Russian Futurism|Russian]]) [[painting]] and [[typography|typographical]] works, such as [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti's]] [[Zang Tumb Tumb|Zang Tumb Tuum]], or in poems such as [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Apollinaire's]] ''Calligrammes'' but none of them were a full system like hypergraphy.

=== Letterist film ===
Notwithstanding the considerably more recent origins of film-making, compared to poetry, painting or music, Isou felt in 1950 that its own first amplic phase had already been completed. He therefore set about inaugurating a chiselling phase for the cinema. As he explained in the voiceover to his first film, ''Treatise of Slime and Eternity'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe firstly that the cinema is too rich. It is obese. It has reached its limits, its maximum. With the first movement of widening which it will outline, the cinema will burst! Under the blow of a congestion, this ''greased pig'' will tear into a thousand pieces. I announce the ''destruction of the cinema'', the first apocalyptic sign of disjunction, of rupture, of this corpulent and bloated organization which calls itself film.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The two central innovations of Letterist film were: (i) the carving of the image (''la ciselure d'image''), where the film-maker would deliberately scratch or paint onto the actual film stock itself. Similar techniques are also employed in Letterist still photography. (ii) Discrepant cinema (''le cinéma discrépant''), where the soundtrack and the image-track would be separated, each one telling a different story or pursuing its own more abstract path. The most radical of the Letterist films, Wolman's ''The Anticoncept'' and Debord's ''Howls for Sade'', went even further, and abandoned images altogether. From a visual point of view, the former consisted simply of a fluctuating ball of light, projected onto a large balloon, while the latter alternated a blank white screen (when there was speech in the soundtrack) and a totally black screen (accompanying ever-increasing periods of total silence). In addition, the Letterists utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of '[[détournement]]') in Situationist film. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the 'film-debate', directly involve the audience itself in the total experience.

=== Supertemporal art (''L'art supertemporel'') ===
The supertemporal frame was a device for inviting and enabling an audience to participate in the creation of a work of art. In its simplest form, this might involve nothing more than the inclusion of several blank pages in a book, for the reader to add his or her own contributions.

=== Infinitesimal art (''Art infinitesimal'') ===
Recalling the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually, the Letterists developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. Also called ''Art esthapériste'' ('infinite-aesthetics'). Cf. [[Conceptual Art]]. Related to this, and arising out of it, is excoördism, the current incarnation of the Isouian movement, defined as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

=== Youth uprising (''Le soulèvement de la jeunesse'') ===
Isou identified the amplic phase of political theory and economics as that of [[Adam Smith]] and [[free trade]]; its chiselling phase was that of [[Karl Marx]] and [[socialism]]. Isou termed these 'atomic economics' and 'molecular economics' respectively: he launched 'nuclear economics' as a corrective to both of them. Both currents, he felt, had simply failed to take into account a large part of the population, namely those young people and other 'externs' who neither produced nor exchanged goods or capital in any significant way. He felt that the creative urge was an integral part of human nature, but that, unless it was properly guided, it could be diverted into crime and anti-social behaviour. The Letterists sought to restructure every aspect of society in such a way as to enable these externs to channel their creativity in more positive ways.

== Major developments of Lettrism ==
* The [[Letterist International]] was formed in 1952 by Lettrists [[Guy Debord]], [[Gil J. Wolman]], [[Jean-Louis Brau]] and [[Serge Berna]]. In 1957, it fused with the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] to create the [[Situationist International]]. During its five years, the Letterist International continued to practice the Lettrist technique of [[metagraphy|metagraphics]], although they were quite against [[hypergraphics]], instead developing metagraphics into [[détournement]].&lt;ref&gt;See Patrick Straram, ''La veuve blanche et noire un peu détournée'' (Paris [[Sens &amp; Tonka]], 2006), 21–22, 81–82; ''Figures de la négation'' (Saint-Etienne Métropole: Musée d'Art Moderne, 2004), 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ultra-Lettrist|Ultra-Lettrism]] arose in 1958, its manifesto appearing in the second issue of ''Grammes'' in that year, signed by the Lettrists François Dufrêne, Robert Estivals, and Jacques Villeglé. Its members practiced [[hypergraphics]] and, with Dufrêne's crirhythmes and a greater interest in tape-recording, they sought to push Letterist sound-poetry further than Isou's group had done.&lt;ref&gt;''Figures de la négation'', 118; [[Henri Chopin]], ''Poésie sonore'' (Paris: Jean-Michel Place, 1979), 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Second Letterist International was an ephemeral group formed in 1964 by Wolman, Dufrêne and Brau.&lt;ref&gt;''Figures de la négation'', 76; [[Gil J. Wolman]], ''Défense de mourir'' (Paris: Editions Allia, 2001), 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[New Lettrist International]], unknown form the original lettrists themselves, was formed in the late 1990s. Although it has no direct connection with the original Letterist group, it has drawn influences both from them and from the [[Letterist International]], as well as from [[Hurufi]]sm (Arabic for 'Letterism').

== Key members ==
* [[Isidore Isou]] (Jan 29, 1925–July 28, 2007).
* [[Gabriel Pomerand]] (1926–1972), member from 1945.
* [[François Dufrêne]] (1930–1982), member from 1947 to 1964. Split to form [[Ultra-Lettrist|Ultra-letterism]] and the Second Letterist International.
* [[Jan Kubíček]] (1927–2013), significantly contributing member during the early 1960s.
* [[Maurice Lemaître]] (1926–), member since 1950, and still actively pursuing his own approach to Letterism.
* [[Gil J Wolman]] (1929–1995), member from 1950 to 1952. Split to form [[Lettrist International|Letterist International]] 1952-1957], but then returned to occasional participation with Isouian group from 1961 to 1964, before splitting again to form the Second Letterist International.
* [[Jean-Louis Brau]] (1930–1985), member from 1950 to 1952. Split to form [[Lettrist International|Letterist International]] 1952-1957], but then returned to occasional participation with Isouian group from 1961 to 1964, before splitting again to form the Second Letterist International.*
* [[Guy Debord]] (1931–1994), member from 1951 to 1952. Split to form [[Lettrist International|Letterist International]].
* [[Anton Perich]] (1945-), member from 1967 to 1970.

== Influences ==
* [[Fluxus]] artist [[Ben Vautier]] has openly avowed his indebtedness to Isou: "Isou, I don't deny it, was very important for me around 1958 when I first theorized about art. It was thanks to Isou that I realized that what was important in art was not the beautiful, but the new, the creation. In 1962, while reading ''L'agrégation d'un nom et d'un messie'', I was fascinated by his ego, his megalomania, his pretences. I said to myself then: there is no art without ego, and this is where my work on the ego is rooted."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Art Tribes'', ed. Achille Bonito Oliva (Milan: Skira, 2002), 274n2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The German painter, set designer, and writer, [[Mike Rose (painter)|Mike Rose]], developed techniques close to Letterism during the 1970s and 1980s, and had some contact with the Parisian group.
* The film ''Irma Vep'' (1996) contains a sequence that evokes the Lettrist aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arkepix.com/kinok/DVD/ASSAYAS_Olivier/dvd_noise.html (French site)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michael Jacobson's novella ''The Giant's Fence'' [http://www.ubu.com/vp/Jacobson.html] (2006) is a hypergraphic work, apparently inspired by the Letterists.

'''''Lira dos Vinte Anos''''' (in {{lang-en|Twenty-year-old Lyre}}) is a poetry [[anthology]] written by [[Brazil]]ian [[Romanticism|Romantic]] author [[Álvares de Azevedo]]. Originally part of an aborted project that would be written in partnership with [[Aureliano Lessa]] and [[Bernardo Guimarães]] called ''As Três Liras'' ({{lang-en|The Three Lyres}}), it was published in [[1853 in literature|1853]]. It is one of the few works whose publication was prepared by Álvares himself, due to his premature death on April 25, 1852.&lt;ref name="YoungCisneros2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Richard|last2=Cisneros|first2=Odile|title=Historical Dictionary of Latin American Literature and Theater|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0ZyleoLY5UC&amp;pg=PA68|date=18 December 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7498-5|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided in three parts: the "[[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]] Face" (first and third parts) and the "[[Caliban]] Face" (second part), as Álvares calls them, based on characters from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Limites: anais|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZoa3CBQyyoC&amp;pg=PA288|year=1995|publisher=EdUSP|language=Portuguese|isbn=978-85-314-0290-6|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the poems of the Ariel Face feature extreme [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]], [[platonic love]], melancholy, among others, the poems of the Caliban Face are heavily morbid, sarcastic and ironic.

From its initial publication in 1853, it would suffer many re-edits, getting to its current form in 1942.

Some studies about this book: "O belo e o disforme", Cilaine Alves; "Risos entre pares", Vagner Camilo; "Uma lira de duas cordas", Rafael Fava Belúzio.

==Changes in the 2010s==

'''2012'''

On April 6, 2011 the Recording Academy announced a major overhaul of many Grammy Award categories.&lt;ref name="grammy.org"&gt;[http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement Recording Academy Awards Category Restructuring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408162804/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement |date=2011-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the number of categories fell from 109 to 78. Some categories were discontinued, others were merged or renamed.

'''2013'''

On June 8, 2012, the Academy announced a few changes {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, including the addition of three new categories: Best Classical Compendium, Best Latin Jazz Album and Best Urban Contemporary Album. This meant the number of categories in 2013 rose to 81.

According to the Academy, the '''Best Classical Compendium''' is "for an album collection containing (...) newly recorded material of performances (vocal or instrumental) by various soloist(s) and/or ensemble(s) involving a mixture of classical subgenres."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/jun-08-2012-320-am|title=THE RECORDING ACADEMY®'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING RESULTS IN CONTINUED EVOLUTION OF GRAMMY® CATEGORIES|work=The GRAMMYs|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albums entered in this category cannot be entered in other classical album categories, but individual tracks can.

The intent for the newly formed '''Best Latin Jazz Album''' is "to recognize recordings that represent the blending of jazz with Latin, Iberian-American, Brazilian, and Argentinean tango music."&lt;ref name="grammy.org"/&gt;

The new '''Best Urban Contemporary Album''' category is for albums with contemporary songs derivative of R&amp;B. It is for artists who blend contemporary styles with R&amp;B music, such as urban (euro)pop, urban rock and/or urban alternative.

Other changes for the 2013 Grammy Award season were:
* [[Best Small Ensemble Performance]] category (in the classical field) has been renamed [[Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance]].
* [[Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album]] has been split into two categories: [[Best Latin Pop Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album|Best Latin Rock, Alternative or Urban Album]], thereby returning to the situation prior to 2012.
* The [[Best Banda or Norteño Album]] and [[Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album]] categories have been merged into one category: [[Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano)|Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano)]].
* Mastering engineers will now be considered nominees and award winners in the [[Record of the Year]] category.

'''2014'''

Changes were made in 2014. One was the introduction of a new category, '''[[Best American Roots Song]]''', which encompasses all subgenres in the American roots music field such as Americana, bluegrass, blues, folk and regional roots music. The award will be presented to the songwriter(s).
The '''[[Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance]]''' category, introduced in 2012, was split and recognises metal performances only. It was renamed '''[[Best Metal Performance]]''' (returning to the situation prior to 2012). Hard rock performances are screened in the [[Best Rock Performance]] category, thus losing its own genre award.
The two Music Video categories were renamed. The '''Best Short Form Music Video''' became the [[Best Music Video]] category, while '''Best Long Form Music Video''' is now [[Best Music Film]]. The rules and description of these two categories did not change. Also new for 2014 was the '''Music Educator Award.''' It recognizes "current educators (kindergarten through college, public and private schools) who have made a significant and lasting contribution to the field of music education and who demonstrate a commitment to the broader cause of maintaining music education in the schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/a-total-of-25-semifinalists-from-across-the-us-announced-for-first|title=A TOTAL OF 25 SEMIFINALISTS FROM ACROSS THE U.S. ANNOUNCED FOR FIRST-EVER MUSIC EDUCATOR AWARD PRESENTED BY  THE RECORDING ACADEMY® AND  THE GRAMMY FOUNDATION®|work=The GRAMMYs|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2015'''

The Recording Academy introduced further changes beginning on the 2015 ceremony: particularly allowing [[Music sampling|samples]] or [[interpolation (music)|interpolations]] of previously written songs in all songwriting categories, most notably the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] category.&lt;ref name="Grammy 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/the-recording-academy-announces-grammy-awards-process-changes |title=The Recording Academy Announces GRAMMY Awards Process Changes |publisher=The Recording Academy |date=June 12, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additional changes include:
* the introduction of '''[[Best American Roots Performance]]''' in the American Roots Music Field
* Dance/Electronica Field to Dance/Electronic Music Field
** renaming [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album|Best Dance/Electronica Album]] to '''Best Dance/Electronic Album'''
* introduction of Contemporary Instrumental Music Field
** renaming of [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album|Best Pop Instrumental Album]] to '''Best Contemporary Instrumental Album'''
* restructuring the categories of the Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/6776/20140612/grammy-awards-makes-changes-christian-gospel-categories.htm |title=The Grammy Awards Makes Changes to the Christian/Gospel Categories |publisher=Music Times |date=June 12, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** creation of [[Best Gospel Performance/Song]], with both the artist(s) and songwriter(s) as recipient(s)
** creation of [[Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song]], with both the artist(s) and songwriter(s) as recipient(s)
** introduction of [[Best Roots Gospel Album]]
* moving [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]] to the Pop Field
* changing [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance|Best Classical Vocal Solo]] (albums and tracks) to '''Best Classical Solo Vocal Album''' (limited to albums only)
* renaming [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement|Best Instrumental Arrangement]] to '''Best Arrangement, Instruments And Vocals'''
* renaming [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)|Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)]] to '''Best Arrangement, Instrumental Or A Cappella'''

The introduction of the changed will push the total number of categories to 83.&lt;ref name="Grammy 2015" /&gt;

'''2017'''

In June 2016, the Grammy organization announced changes to the voting and awarding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/the-recording-academy-announces-rule-amendments-and-dates-for-the|title=THE RECORDING ACADEMY® ANNOUNCES RULE AMENDMENTS AND DATES FOR THE 59TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS PROCESS|publisher=|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recordings released solely through streaming services became eligible to enter the award process. These recordings must be available through streaming platforms. Applicable streaming services are paid subscription, full catalog, on-demand streaming/limited download platforms that have existed as such within the United States for at least one full year as of the submission deadline. All recordings entered must have an assigned [[International Standard Recording Code]] (ISRC).

Best New Artist rules were amended to remove the album barrier given trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted; many new artists first release singles, tracks, or EPs rather than full albums. To become eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group:
* Must have released a minimum of five singles/tracks or one album, but no more than 30 singles/tracks or three albums.
* May not have entered the category more than three times, including as a performing member of an established group.
* Must have achieved a breakthrough into the public consciousness and impacted the musical landscape during the eligibility period.

The [[Best Blues Album]] category was split back into two distinct categories, as they were prior to 2012:
* [[Best Traditional Blues Album]] (Blues recordings with traditional blues song and harmonic structures, including various subgenres such as Delta blues, Piedmont blues, jump/swing blues, Chicago blues, and classic/Southern soul).
* [[Best Contemporary Blues Album]] (Recordings which may employ non-traditional blues rhythms such as funk, hip-hop, reggae, and rock, or which feature contemporary techniques such as synthesizers or [[Loop (music)|loops]]).

The Best Rap/Sung Collaboration category (in the Rap field) was renamed as Best Rap/Sung Performance to allow solo performances, a result of "the current state and future trajectory of rap by expanding the category beyond collaborations between rappers and vocalists to include recordings by a solo artist who blurs the lines between rapping and singing."

Additional amendments were made to the number and type of music creators recognized in the categories of [[Best Choral Performance]] and [[Best jazz vocal album|Best Jazz Vocal Album]].

'''''Mickey''''' is an American [[sitcom]] that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 1964 to January 1965. Created and produced by Bob Fisher and Arthur Marx, the series stars [[Mickey Rooney]], and was filmed at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Studios.

==Synopsis==

Rooney said he would have liked [[Judy Garland]] to guest star.

==Reception and cancellation==
The series failed to sustain ratings to survive the full season in its 9 p.m. Eastern time slot on Wednesdays. Its principal competition was another sitcom, ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' on CBS. [[NBC]] ran [[television movies]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;1964-1965 American network television schedule&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to low ratings, ABC was considering canceling ''Mickey''. The network was hesitant to cancel the series due to the popularity of Sammee Tong's character who had a solid fanbase thanks to his role in ''[[Bachelor Father (U.S. TV series)|Bachelor Father]]''. In his 1991 [[autobiography]], ''Life Is Too Short'', Mickey Rooney wrote that Tong was upset by the news that the series faced cancellation. Tong, who was a heavy gambler and owed money to the mafia, needed the money from the series to pay off his debts. On October 27, 1964, Tong took an [[overdose]] of barbiturates and died at his home. Tong's death effectively ended any chance for the series' survival, and ABC canceled ''Mickey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rooney|first=Mickey |title=Life Is Too Short|year=1991|publisher=Villard Books|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' last episode aired on January 13, 1965.

{{Nihongo|'''Nōtan'''|濃淡}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[design]] concept involving the play and placement of light and dark elements as they are placed next to the other in the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of [[art]] and [[image]]ry.

==Uses==
This use of light and dark translates shape and form into flat shapes on a two-dimensional surface. Nōtan is traditionally presented in [[paint]], [[ink]], or cut [[paper]], but it is relevant to a host of modern-day image-making techniques, such as [[lithography]] in [[printmaking]], and [[rotoscope|rotoscoping]] in [[animation]].

The '''odor detection threshold''' is the lowest concentration of a certain [[odor]] compound that is perceivable by the human [[olfaction|sense of smell]]. The threshold of a chemical compound is determined in part by its [[Molecular geometry|shape]], [[Chemical polarity|polarity]], [[partial charge]]s, and [[molecular mass]]. The olfactory mechanisms responsible for a compound's different detection threshold is not well understood. As such, odor thresholds cannot be accurately predicted. Rather, they must be measured through extensive tests using human subjects in laboratory settings.

[[Optical isomer]]s can have different detection thresholds because their conformations may cause them to be less perceivable for the human nose. It is only in recent years that such compounds were separated on [[gas chromatograph]]s.

==Values==
* The [[odor threshold value|threshold value]] is the concentration an aroma or taste can be detected (air, water and fat).
* The [[odor recognition threshold|recognition threshold]] or [[arousal threshold]] of [[olfactory neurons]]  is the concentration at which you can identify an odor (air, water and fat).
* The [[odour activity value]] is the concentration divided by the threshold.
* The [[flavor impact]] is the value the rate of change in perception with concentration.
* The [[flavor contribution]] of an [[aroma component]] in a mixture to the total profile can be calculated from the total odor units and the number contributed by that aroma chemical.

===Odor detection value===
''Odor threshold value (OTV)'' (also ''aroma threshold value (ATV)'', ''Flavor threshold'') is defined as the most minimal [[concentration]] of a substance that can be detected by a [[human nose]]. Some substances can be detected when their concentration is only few [[milligram]]s per 1000 [[tonnes]], which is less than a [[Drop (unit)|drop]] in an [[Olympic swimming pool]]. Odor threshold value can be expressed as a concentration in water or concentration in air.

Two major types of flavor thresholds can be distinguished: the absolute and the difference threshold. The odor detection threshold and the odor recognition threshold are absolute thresholds; the first is the minimum concentration at which an odor can be detected without any requirements to identify or recognize the stimulus, while the second is the minimum concentration at which a stimulus can be identified or recognized.&lt;ref&gt;L.J. van Gemert (2003) Flavour thresholds&lt;/ref&gt;

The odor threshold value of an odorant is influenced by the medium.

Examples of substances with strong odors:

* (Z)-8-[[tetradecenal]] (OTV = 0.009 ppb in water)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabine|first=Widder|title=8-tetradecenal as fragrance and flavoring substance|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US7332468|work=Google Patents|accessdate=20 July 2017|author2=Symrise GmbH &amp; Co. KG}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* p-[[vinylguaiacol]] (OTV = 10 [[Parts per billion|ppb]])&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Baek, K.R. Cadwallader (1999) Contribution of Free and Glycosidically Bound Volatile Compounds to the Aroma of Muscadine Grape Juice
Journal of Food Science 64 (3), 441–444 {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2621.1999.tb15059.x}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variables==
Threshold in a food is dependent upon:
* The threshold of the aroma in air.
* Concentration in the food.
* Solubility in oil and water.
* Partition coefficient between the air and the food.
* The [[pH]] of the food. Some aroma compounds are affected by the pH: weak organic acids are protonated at low pH making them less soluble and hence more volatile.
* Number and functionality of odorant receptors in the observer's nose.

The concentration of an odor above a food is dependent on its solubility in that food and its [[vapor pressure]] and concentration in that food.

Since most forms of Western music can make use of the piano, pianists have a wide [[Piano repertoire|repertoire]] and a wide variery of styles to choose from, among them traditional [[classical music]], [[jazz piano|jazz]], [[blues piano|blues]], and all sorts of [[popular music]], including [[rock music|rock and roll]]. Most pianists can, to an extent, easily play other [[musical keyboard|keyboard]]-related instruments such as the [[synthesizer]], [[harpsichord]], [[celesta]], and the [[organ (music)|organ]].

==Pianists past and present==
Modern [[classical music|classical]] pianists dedicate their careers to performing, recording, teaching, researching, and learning new works to expand their repertoire. They generally do not write or transcribe music as pianists did in the 19th century. Some classical pianists might specialize in accompaniment and [[chamber music]], while others (though comparatively few) will perform as full-time soloists.

==Classical ==
[[File:Ian Parker.jpg|thumb|300px|Canadian pianist [[Ian Parker (Canadian pianist)|Ian Parker]] performing [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1]] with the Maui Pops Orchestra in 2016|alt=A man plays a piano with enthusiasm, his left hand raised in preparation for striking keys; behind him, the string section of an orchestra plays accompaniment.]]
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] could be considered the first "concert pianist" as he performed widely on the piano. Composers [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]] from the classical era were also famed for their playing, as were, from the romantic era,  [[Liszt]], [[Brahms]], [[Chopin]], [[Mendelssohn]] and [[Rachmaninoff]]. From that era, leading performers less known as composers were Clara Schumann and [[Hans von Bülow]]. However, as we do not have modern audio recordings of most of these pianists, we rely mainly on written commentary to give us an account of their technique and style.

==Jazz ==
[[File:Tord Gustavsen (221258).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tord Gustavsen]] playing piano during a concert at the 2016 [[Oslo Jazzfestival|Oslo Jazz Festival]] in Norway
|alt=A black-and-white photo of a man playing a piano; he is hunched over it and is concentrating deeply.]]Jazz pianists almost always perform with other musicians. Their playing is more free than that of  classical pianists and they create an air of spontaneity in their performances. They generally do not write down their compositions; improvisation is a significant part of their work. Well known jazz pianists include [[Art Tatum]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Oscar Peterson]] and [[Bud Powell]].

==Pop==
Popular pianists might work as live performers (concert, theatre, etc.), session musicians, arrangers most likely feel at home with synthesizers and other electronic keyboard instruments. Notable popular pianists include [[Victor Borge]] who performed as a comedian; [[Richard Clayderman]], who is known for his covers of popular tunes; and singer and entertainer [[Liberace]], who at the height of his fame, was one of the highest paid entertainers in the world.
==Well-known pianists==

==Amateur pianism==

Some people, having received a solid piano training in their youth, decide not to continue their musical careers but choose nonmusical ones. As a result, there are prominent communities of ''amateur pianists'' all over the world that play at quite a high level and give concerts not to earn money but just for the love of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreas|first1=Møller|title=Professionel pianist leverer dinnermusik til jeres fest af højeste klasse|url=http://www.pianomusic.dk/|website=Pianomusic.dk|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs]], held annually in [[Paris]], attracts about one thousand listeners each year and is broadcast on French radio.

It is notable that [[Jon Nakamatsu]], the Gold Medal winner of the prestigious [[Van Cliburn International Piano Competition]] for professional pianists in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] (1997) was at the moment of his victory technically an amateur: he never attended a music conservatory or majored in music, and worked as a high school German teacher at the time; it was only after the competition that he started pursuing a career as a classical pianist.

The German pianist [[Davide Martello]] is known for traveling around conflict zones to play his moving piano. Martello has previously been recognised by the European parliament for his “outstanding contribution to European cooperation and the promotion of common values”.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/paris-attacks-john-lennon-imagine-pianist-davide-martello-klavierkunst|title=Paris attacks: pianist 'drove 400 miles through the night' to pay tribute|first=Jonathan|last=Bucks|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Reader's Digest Condensed Books''''' were a series of hardcover [[anthology]] collections, published by the American general interest monthly family magazine ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' and distributed by [[direct mail]].  Most volumes contained five (although a considerable minority consisted of three, four, or six) current best-selling novels and nonfiction books which were [[abridged]] (or "condensed") specifically for ''Reader's Digest''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02680426 Springer.com: "The continuous publication of the Reader's Digest Condensed Books directmail
subscription series since 1950 is a cultural phenomenon."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/65843-reader-s-digest-condensed-book-series-to-get-wider-distribution.html Publishers Weekly: "Reader's Digest Condensed Book Series to Get Wider Distribution" March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was popular; a 1987 New York Times article estimated annual sales of 10 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/02/nyregion/new-editor-at-digest-s-condensed-books.html N.Y. Times: "New Editor at Digest's Condensed Books" August 2, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this popularity, old copies are notoriously difficult to sell. &lt;ref&gt;[https://nathanhobby.com/2012/03/11/readers-digest-condensed-books-as-difficult-to-dispose-of-as-bins-of-radioactive-waste/ "Readers Digest Condensed Books as diffiult to dispose of as bins of radioactive waste"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claytonlibrary.org/donating.htm Clayton Library: "We Don't Accept Reader's Digest Condensed Books--they do not sell."]&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of their publication schedule, the volumes were issued four times each year, with the rate gradually increasing to a bi-monthly schedule by the early-1990s. The series was produced for 47 years (1950–1997), until being renamed ''[[Reader's Digest Select Editions]]''. (''Note'': UK editions seem to have been somewhat different from USA editions. Pre-1992 Canadian editions also contain different titles).

Occasional titles  such as ''[[The Leopard]]'' (Summer 1960), ''[[The Days Were Too Short]]'' (Autumn 1960), and ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'' (Autumn 1970) were not written in English but published as abridgments of the translated versions. In a few cases, new editions of older works (''[[Up from Slavery]]'', originally published in 1901 (Autumn 1960), ''[[A Roving Commission: My Early Life]]'', originally published in 1930 (Autumn 1951) or ''[[Goodbye Mr. Chips]]'', originally published in 1934 (Summer 1961)) were also among the condensed selections.

[[File:Vatican-ChapelleSixtine-Plafond.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A post-restoration section of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel that includes the fresco shown above]]

The '''conservation-restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel''' was one of the most significant [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation-restorations]] of the 20th century.

The [[Sistine Chapel]] was built by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] within the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] immediately to the north of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] and completed in about 1481. Its walls were decorated by a number of [[Italian Renaissance painting|Renaissance painters]] who were among the most highly regarded artists of late 15th century Italy, including [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], and [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]].&lt;ref name=JS/&gt; The Chapel was further enhanced under [[Pope Julius II]] by the painting of [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|the ceiling]] by [[Michelangelo]] between 1508 and 1512 and by the painting of the ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]'', commissioned by [[Pope Clement VII]] and completed in 1541, again by Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Giacometti, editor, ''The Sistine Chapel'', (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tapestry|tapestries]] on the lowest tier, today best known from the [[Raphael Cartoons]] (painted designs) of 1515–16, completed the ensemble.

Together the paintings make up the greatest pictorial scheme of the Renaissance. Individually, some of Michelangelo's paintings on the ceiling are among the most notable works of western art ever created.{{ref label|a|a|none}} The [[fresco]]es of the Sistine Chapel and in particular the ceiling and accompanying [[lunette]]s by Michelangelo have been subject to a number of restorations, the most recent taking place between 1980 and 1994. This most recent restoration had a profound effect on art lovers and historians, as colours and details that had not been seen for centuries were revealed. It has been claimed that as a result "Every book on Michelangelo will have to be rewritten".&lt;ref&gt;University of Victoria art scholar, John Osborne, in the ''Queen's Quarterly'', as quoted in: {{cite news | first=Fulford| last=Robert| title =Robert Fulford's column about art restoration in Italy | work =[[The Globe and Mail]] | date=11 February 1998 | url =http://www.robertfulford.com/restore.html | accessdate = 2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the art historian [[James Beck (art historian)|James Beck]] of [[ArtWatch International]], have been extremely critical of the restoration, saying that the restorers have not realised the true intentions of the artist. This is the subject of continuing debate.

==Previous restorations==
The frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel had a number of interventions prior to the restoration process which was started in 1980&lt;!--doesn't make sense in the context of the rest of the article otherwise--&gt;. Initial problems with the ceiling appear to have been caused by water penetrating through the floor above. In about 1547 [[Paolo Giovio]] wrote that the ceiling was being damaged by [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] and cracks. The effect of saltpetre is to leave a white [[efflorescence]].  Gianluigi Colalucci, Head Restorer at the Laboratory for the Restoration of Paintings for Papal Monuments, Museums and Galleries, states in his essay ''Michelangelo's colours rediscovered'',&lt;ref name=GC/&gt; that the early conservators treated this cosmetically by an application of [[linseed oil|linseed]] or [[walnut oil]] which had the effect of making the crystalline deposit more transparent.

In 1625, a restoration was carried out by Simone Lagi, the "resident gilder",  who wiped the ceiling with linen cloths and cleaned it by rubbing it with bread. He occasionally resorted to wetting the bread to remove the more stubborn accretions. His report states that the [[fresco]]es "were returned to their previous beauty without receiving any harm".&lt;ref&gt;[[Vatican Library]], Vat. Capponiano 231, f 238 and Chigiano  G. III 66. f 108.  as cited by Colalucci&lt;/ref&gt; Colalucci states that Lagi "almost certainly" applied layers of  glue-varnish to revive the colours but does not state this in his report in the interests of "preserving the secrets of their [the restorers'] craft".&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Between 1710 and 1713 a further restoration was carried out by the painter [[Annibale Mazzuoli]] and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke.{{ref label|b|b|none}} Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the [[lunette]]s.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

The penultimate restoration was undertaken by the Restoration Laboratory of the [[Vatican Museum]] between 1935 and 1938. The scope of the work was to consolidate some areas of the [[intonaco]] at the eastern end of the building and partially remove the soot and dirt.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

==Modern restoration==
[[File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 014.jpg|thumb|200px|The Sistine Chapel before the restoration. {{ref label|c|c|none}}]]
The preliminary experimentation for the modern restoration began in 1979. The restoration team comprised Gianluigi Colalucci, Maurizio Rossi, Piergiorgio Bonetti, and others,&lt;ref name=CP/&gt; who took as their guidelines the ''Rules for restoration of works of art'' as established in 1978 by Carlo Pietrangeli, director of the Vatican's Laboratory for the Restoration of Pictures, which govern the procedure and methods employed in restoration. An important part of modern restoration procedure, as established by these rules, is the study and analysis of the artwork.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt; Part of this was the recording of every stage of the restoration process. This was done by the photographer [[Takashi Okamura (photographer)|Takashi Okamura]] for [[Nippon Television Network Corporation]].&lt;ref name=FM/&gt;

Between June 1980 and October 1984 the first stage of restoration, the work upon Michelangelo's lunettes, was achieved. The focus of the work then transferred to the ceiling, which was completed in December 1989 and from there to the [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]. The restoration was unveiled by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 8 April 1994.&lt;ref name=jp94&gt;{{cite web

===Aims of the conservators===
The aims of the conservators were as follows:

* To study the frescoes progressively, to analyse any discoveries and utilise the appropriate technical responses.
* To record every step of the operation in archival reports, photographs and film.
* To use only those procedures and materials which were simple, extensively tested, not harmful, and reversible.
* To repair cracks and structural damage that threatened the stability of the plaster.
* To remove layers of grime consisting of candle wax and soot that had been deposited by the burning of candles in the chapel for 500 years.
* To remove repainting by previous restorers that attempted to counteract the effects of soot and other accretions.
* To remove oil and animal fat used to counteract salination of areas where water had leaked through.
* To remove crystalline accretions of salt that had whitened areas where water had leaked through.
* To conserve surfaces that were in danger of further deterioration because of bubbling, and flaking.
* To restore sympathetically those areas where deterioration of one sort or another had obliterated details and caused loss of integrity to the whole, for example, filling a bad crack and painting the plaster in a colour matching the original.
* To maintain in small defined areas a physical historical record of the previous restorations that had taken place.

In 1979 Colalucci undertook a series of experiments to discover the right approach for the restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, ''Conflict over the Body of [[Moses]]'' by [[Matteo de Lecce]], which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on a small portion of the Eleazar and Matthan lunette.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Because of the height of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes, the precise nature of the damage and the problems that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.&lt;ref name=GC&gt;Gianluigi Colalucci's essay, ''Michelangelo's Colours Rediscovered'' in ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Massimo Giacometti. (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 the decision to undertake a total restoration was taken&lt;!--if you know who took it some of the passive voice can go--&gt;. [[Nippon Television Network Corporation]] of Japan provided major funding of US$4.2 million in exchange for the filming rights.

===Scaffold===
The team of restorers completed the first stage of the restoration, on the vertical surfaces and curved [[spandrel]]s around the upper sections of the windows, from [[aluminium]] [[scaffolding]] projecting from just below the lunettes and using the same holes in the wall that had been made for Michelangelo's scaffold. When they moved to the ceiling, they likewise employed a system similar to Michelangelo's, which involved [[cantilever]]ing a shelf outwards from the scaffolding to support a stepped and arched platform. The advantages of modern lightweight materials meant that the platform could be wheeled, facilitating easy movement along the length of the building rather than dismantling and replacement, as Michelangelo had done in 1506.&lt;ref name=FM&gt;Fabrizio Mancinelli's essay, ''Michelangelo at Work'' in ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Massimo Giacometti, (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pietrangeli, Hirst and Colalucci, eds. ''The Sistine Chapel: A Glorious Restoration'', (1994) Harry N Abrams, {{ISBN|0-8109-8176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State of the frescoes===
The findings of the investigation of 1979 were that the entire interior of the chapel, but particularly the ceiling, was covered with a grime of candle smoke comprising [[wax]] and [[soot]] ([[amorphous carbon]]). Above the windows (the main source of ventilation), the lunettes were particularly stained from the smoke and exhaust fumes of the city, being "much dirtier than the ceiling proper".&lt;ref name=FM/&gt;
The building was a little unstable and had already shifted considerably prior to Michelangelo's work of 1508, causing cracking of the ceiling, the crack in the "Judith" [[pendentive]] being so large that it had to be filled with bricks and mortar before painting. The upper part of the ceiling provided Michelangelo an irregular surface due to cracks and water seepage.&lt;ref name=JS&gt;[[John Shearman]], essay ''The Chapel of Sixtus IV'' in ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Massimo Giacometti, (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued ingress of water from the roof and from unroofed exterior walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Earlier restorations had all left their marks on the frescoes. To counteract the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small [[putti]] which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly the case for the lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Close examination revealed that apart from smoky deposits, seepage deposits and structural cracks, the thin "pictorial skin" of Michelangelo's frescoes was in excellent condition.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt; Colalucci describes Michelangelo as having employed the best possible fresco techniques, as described by [[Vasari]].&lt;ref&gt;Milanesi ed. Vasari, ''Vite...'' Book I, Chapter V, p.182, ed. Milanesi, Florence (1906), as cited by Colalucci.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the paint was well adhered and required little retouching. The plaster, or [[intonaco]], on which the paintings were executed was found, for the most part, to be secure, as previous restorers had fixed it in places with [[bronze]] pins.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

===Interventions===
Prior to the restoration the team spent six months investigating the composition and condition of the frescoes, questioning members of the team that had restored the frescoes in the 1930s and making a detailed scientific study to ascertain which solvents and methods were best employed upon particular painted surfaces.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;
[[File:Gardenbeforeandafter.jpg|thumb|left|350px|A composite image of ''The Fall and Expulsion of Adam and Eve'' by [[Michelangelo]]. The upper left is shown unrestored, the lower right is shown restored.]]
The first stage of the physical restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mm thick) that were in danger of separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a [[polyvinylacetate]] [[resin]]. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

The restorers washed the surfaces using a variety of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of [[calcium carbonate]] were treated by the application of a solution of [[dimethylformamide]]. The final step was the application of a weak solution of [[acryl group|acrylic]] [[polymer]] to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Where necessary some areas were retouched in [[watercolor painting|watercolour]], to integrate the pictorial material. These areas are distinctively textured with vertical brushstrokes, not visible from a distance but easily discernible as restoration work when viewed close up.&lt;ref name=GC /&gt;

Certain small areas were left unrestored, in order to maintain a physical record of the previous restorations that had taken place, for example, an area left with overpainting and candle wax, and another area demonstrating the attempt to counteract salination with oil.

==Environmental protection of the frescoes==
Once the many layers of candle wax, varnish, and animal glue were removed from the surface of the Sistine Chapel frescoes, they became subject to dangers that could not have been predicted by previous restorers.

One of the major dangers to the frescoes is [[exhaust fumes|automotive exhaust]], and they are also vulnerable to the effects of the crowds of tourists that pass through the chapel every day, bringing with them heat, humidity, dust and [[bacteria]] (the latter of which can biodegrade paints and pigments).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciferri|first=Orio|date=1999-03-01|title=Microbial Degradation of Paintings | journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=65|issue=3|pages=879–885|issn=0099-2240|pmc=91117|pmid=10049836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clean plaster surfaces are more in danger from these destructive elements than they were when they were covered with a layer of smoky wax.&lt;ref name="Carrier"&gt;Carrier, United Technologies, ''Sistine Chapel'', [http://search.atomz.com/search/?sp_i=1&amp;sp_q=Sistine+Chapel&amp;sp_a=sp100368b9&amp;sp_k=global&amp;sp_p=any&amp;sp_f=utf-8&amp;x=11&amp;y=9] Retrieved on 2007-09-28. NOTE: This page is no longer available.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] was from its windows in the upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown [[Air pollution|pollutants]] from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an [[air conditioning]] system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the [[United Technologies Corporation]] and was developed with the cooperation of the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]]'s Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and [[humidity]] that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. [[Bacteria]] and chemical [[pollutant]]s are filtered out.

Environmental specifications:&lt;ref name= Carrier /&gt;
* [[Air filtration]] units: remove particles down to 0.1 micrometre
* [[Air temperature]]: {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} in summer, moving gradually to {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}} in winter.
* [[Relative humidity]] at ceiling: 55% ±5%.
* [[Sensor]]s: 92, of which about half are for back-up purposes.
* [[Wiring]]: 26&amp;nbsp;km (85,000&amp;nbsp;ft)

==Response to the restoration==

===Criticism and praise===
When the restoration of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was [[James Beck (art historian)|James Beck]], of [[ArtWatch International]], who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in ''Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.''&lt;ref&gt;James Beck and Michael Daley, ''Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal'', W.W. Norton, 1995. {{ISBN|0-393-31297-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 027.jpg|thumb|''[[Jeremiah]] lamenting the destruction of Jerusalem''.]]
{{quote|In the rhetoric of this conversation, [the conservators] say that the previous restoration was no good&amp;nbsp;– now we're going to make a really good one. It's like having a facelift. How many times can people go through one without their poor faces looking like an orange peel?|source=[[James Beck (art historian)|James Beck]]&lt;ref name= OAM&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ohlson | first =Kristin | title =Conservation Wars | journal =Oberlin Alumni Magazine | volume =98 | issue =2 | pages = | date =Fall 2002 | url =http://www.oberlin.edu/alummag/oamcurrent/oam_fall2002/main_conservation_3.htm | accessdate =  2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While James Beck became "embroiled in a public debate" with Gianluigi Colalucci, Ronald Feldman, a New York art dealer, started a petition supported by 15 well-known artists including [[Robert Motherwell]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Christo]] and [[Andy Warhol]] asking Pope John Paul II to call a halt to the procedure and also the restoration of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck, ''Halt Urged in Work on Sistine and "Last Supper"'', ''New York Times'', 1987-03-06 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF1F39F935A35750C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print]. Retrieved 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

An undertaking of the restoration team was that everything would be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, [[Nippon Television Network Corporation]], had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of the restoration of the ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.

According to Kimmelman, the reason for their reluctance to produce the detailed photos, which could have put to rest the worst fears of many of the interested parties, was the intention of the company to produce a large limited-edition two-volume coffee-table book ("as large as a coffee table"). This book, when produced&lt;!--when?--&gt; retailed for US$1,000. Kimmelman refers to the fact that these photos were only made available to the few who could afford the exorbitant price as "ungenerous" and "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As the work was progressively completed, there were those who were delighted; [[Pope John Paul II]] spoke an inaugural [[homily]] after each stage. In December 1999, after the completion of the wall frescoes, he said:

{{quote|It would be difficult to find a more eloquent visual commentary on this biblical image than the Sistine Chapel, whose full splendour we can enjoy today thanks to the recently completed restoration. Our joy is shared by the faithful throughout the world, who not only cherish this place because of the masterpieces it contains, but also for the role it plays in the Church's life.|Pope John Paul II&lt;ref name=jp99/&gt;}}

Cardinal [[Edmund Szoka]], governor of [[Vatican City]], said: "This restoration and the expertise of the restorers allows us to contemplate the paintings as if we had been given the chance of being present when they were first shown."&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, ''Sistine Chapel Restored'' 1999-12-11, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/560315.stm].

Other writers were less flattering. Andrew Wordsworth of ''[[The Independent]]'', London, expressed the major point of concern:

{{quote|There seems little doubt that the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was in part painted [[fresco-secco|a secco]] (that is, once the plaster was dry), but the restorers none the less decided that radical cleaning was necessary, given the amount of dirt that had accumulated (in particular from candle smoke). As a result the ceiling now has a curiously washed-out look, with pretty but flavourless colouring&amp;nbsp;– an effect quite unlike that of Michelangelo's intensely sensual sculpture.|Andrew Wordsworth&lt;ref name= AW&gt;{{cite news

This crucial matter was also emphasised by Beck and defined in very clearly expressed terms on the website of the artist, Peter Layne Arguimbau.&lt;ref name= PLA&gt;{{cite web

===Issues raised by critics===
That part of the restoration in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by [[Michelangelo]]. The emergence of the brightly coloured [[Ancestors of Christ]] from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, the work on the ceiling proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once the ceiling was completed.&lt;ref name= PLA /&gt;&lt;ref name= Beck&gt;{{cite web

The cause for dissent lies in the analysis and understanding of the techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to their understanding of those techniques. A close examination of the frescoes of the lunettes convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in "[[buon fresco]]"; that is, the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state. In other words, Michelangelo did not work "a secco"; he did not come back later and add details onto the dry plaster.&lt;ref&gt;See reference to Colalucci's conflicting report.&lt;/ref&gt;

The restorers, by assuming that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, took a universal approach to the restoration. A decision was made that all of the shadowy layer of animal glue and "lamp black", all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of one sort or another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts and painted definition by later restorers in attempt to enliven the appearance of the work. Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that has been provided, the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster. After treatment, only that which was painted "buon fresco" would remain.&lt;ref name= PLA /&gt;

[[File:Sistine Chapel Daniel beforandafter.jpg|upright=2|centre|thumb|{{centre|''Daniel'', before and after restoration.}}]]

According to critics, the inherent problem with this approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted ''buon fresco'', that he was always satisfied with the result at the end of the day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.

A summary of the relevant statements of Colalucci, in the order that they occur in the Appendix entitled ''Michelangelo's colours uncovered'' is as follows:

{{quote|The elderly restorers who had taken part in the restoration of the 1930s were interviewed as part of the preparatory process. They claimed that Michelangelo worked over the frescoes ''a secco'' using ''velature'' or glazes as a binder. Colalucci rejects this, stating that Michelangelo worked exclusively in ''buon fresco''. Colalucci then contradicts this by stating that Michelangelo had worked ''a secco'', but "to a minimal degree" and "not at all in the lunettes".

Colalucci then talks of Michelangelo's "rigorous maintenance" of ''buon fresco'' technique, contradicting this by describing the ''a secco'' retouchings that Michelangelo made to the shoulder of Eleazar and the foot of Reboam, both of which are in the lunettes. He then says that Michelangelo worked in ''buon fresco'' with "no ''pentimenti'' proper", ([[pentimenti]] means the changes) but only small corrections in fresco.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;}}

The ongoing criticism has been that the restorers presumed to know what end result the master was seeking to achieve in every separate case across the ceiling, and by what method he sought to achieve it. The disagreements about this have been vociferous and are unresolved.&lt;ref name=PLA/&gt;&lt;ref name= Beck/&gt;

====Carbon black problem====
The restorers took for granted that all of the layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and numerous artists have suggested that Michelangelo used [[carbon black]] in a wash of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, ''a secco''. If this is the case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Colalucci refers to this opinion in his Appendix quoted above&lt;/ref&gt;

On some of the figures, however, there still remains clear evidence of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation for this is that over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, for a variety of reasons, varied his technique. Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular ''giornata'' include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.

There are still intense areas of shadow which throw the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] into relief. But it is more than relief; it is the three-dimensionality which art-lovers expect to see in the work of the man who sculpted Moses.&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt; Critics of the restoration claim that this was Michelangelo's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid side-by-side that were then worked over ''a secco'' to achieve this effect and that this is what has been lost by a too-scrupulous cleaning.&lt;ref name= PLA/&gt;

Consistently missing from the restored ceiling is the crisp ''a secco'' detailing of the architecture: the [[scallop]] shells, [[acorn]]s and "bead and reel" ornament which Michelangelo possibly would have left for completion by an assistant, when he moved on to the next panel. The treatment of these details varied considerably. In a few places, around the Ezekias spandrel, for example, the architectural detailing was painted ''buon fresco'' and remains intact.
[[File:Sistine Chapel TwoSpandrels.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|centre|alt=A comparison of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states.|Different post-restoration states in two similar spandrels. In the left spandrel, black detailing of robes, eyes and architecture is intact. In the right spandrel, these details have been lost in the cleaning.]]

A comparison of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The one on the left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the [[fictive architecture]] each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.

On the corner pendentives, each of which depicts a violent subject, the removal of the carbon black has diminished the dramatic intensity of all four scenes. This is particularly noticeable in the loss of depth in the ''Punishment of [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]]''. Where once the figure projected starkly against the darkly shadowed interior, now foreshortening, definition and drama is lost in the pastel monotone that remains.&lt;!--are the restorers admitting all this? Seems a little unbalanced in favour of the critics--&gt;

====Colour====
The curator, Fabrizio Mancinelli, quotes the 18th-century French traveller [[Jérôme Lalande|De Lalande]] in saying that the colouring of the ceiling was, by that time, monotonous, "tend[ing] towards dull red and grey". Mancinelli writes that the restoration reveals "a new Michelangelo" as a colourist and that this "new character makes much better sense of his historical position".&lt;ref name=FM/&gt; He goes on to say that perceptive viewers of the Sistine Chapel ceiling have always been aware that the range of colours used was very different from that which could be seen,&lt;ref&gt;Fabrizio Mancinelli, in the essay "Michelangelo at Work" (''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Giacometti) cites Wilson, Biagetti and Wilde.&lt;/ref&gt; and included the same pinks, apple greens, oranges, yellows and pale blues that were employed by Michelangelo's teacher, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], one of the most competent fresco painters of the Renaissance.

The brilliant palette ought to have been expected by the restorers as the same range of colours appears in the works of [[Giotto]], [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]], [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Piero della Francesca]], as well as Ghirlandaio himself and later fresco painters such as [[Annibale Carracci]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]]. The reason for employing this range of colours is that many other pigments are not usable in fresco as they have chemical properties that react badly in interaction with wet plaster.  The colour that is noticeably missing from Michelangelo's ceiling, but not ''The Last Judgment'', is the intense blue of [[lapis lazuli]]. This colour, achieved by grinding semi-precious stone, was always applied as a secondary, ''a secco'' stage, along with the gold leaf applied as haloes and decoration to robes.{{ref label|e|e|none}}
[[File:Daniel project 03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Daniel's right hand and knee. On the unrestored fresco, the intense red underpainting shows through the black ''a secco'' wash adding luminescence to the shadows. The form under the garment is achieved by the black wash.{{ref label|f|f|none}}]]
The aspect of the colouring which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the [[Libyan Sibyl]] and the [[Prophet Daniel]], which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, there is no such gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including the hose of the young man in the ''Mathan'' lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.

In some instances, the colour combinations look garish: this is particularly the case with the [[Prophet Daniel]]. A comparison of the "restored" and "unrestored" figure gives strong evidence that Michelangelo worked over this figure in a wash of carbon black, and that the technique was preplanned.&lt;ref&gt;as detailed in Arguimbau's article&lt;/ref&gt; The bright red used on the robes of Daniel and the Libyan Sibyl does not, on its own, create effective shadows. In these and many other cases it appears to have been intended as underpainting, to be seen only through a thin black wash and with the deepest shadows picked out in more intense black, as they still are on the [[Cumaean Sibyl]]. This use of bright, contrasting colours as underpainting is not a common feature of frescoes, but it is commonly employed in both [[oil painting]] and [[tempera]]. Like Daniel, the Libyan Sibyl's yellow garment once had much more subtlety in its folds and shadows than it has now.{{ref label|d|d|none}}
[[File:Jonah B.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|''Jonah'', restored. Much of the dramatic tonality of the figure has disappeared in the cleaning, diminishing the effect of the foreshortening.]]
There is absolutely no doubt that before the restoration, the whole ceiling was dirtier, more muted and more monochrome than Michelangelo ever intended, but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their stained and unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions, described by Beck and Arguimbau,&lt;ref name=PLA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt; still make their presence known, giving mass and bulk to the forms.

The painter and biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]], in his ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'', describes the figure of [[Jonah]] as it appeared in the mid-16th century:
{{quote|Then who is not filled with admiration and amazement at the awesome sight of Jonah, the last figure in the chapel? The vaulting naturally springs forward, following the curve of the masonry; but through the force of art it is apparently straightened out by the figure of Jonah, which bends in the opposite direction; and thus vanquished by the art of design, with its lights and shades, the ceiling even appears to recede.&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''Michelangelo'' from ''Lives of the Artists'',(1568) translated by George Bull, Penguin Classics, (1965) {{ISBN|0-14-044164-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The large figure of Jonah is of great significance to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The [[foreshortening]] described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme left side of the painting. All the other, less intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the [[Genius (mythology)|genii]] behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.

====Eyes====
[[File:Jesse spandrel beforeandafter.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Losses of a sort which are deemed "travesties" by critics of the restoration. The Jesse spandrel, before and after restoration. The eyes are now missing, as they are in numerous other figures, particularly among the ancestors.]]
The missing depth is not the only factor that the critics deplore. An important feature of Michelangelo's work which, in many places, has disappeared forever is the painting of the eyeballs.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; Eyes appear in many instances to have been painted ''buon fresco''. Wherever they have not been painted [[buon fresco]] but added ''a secco'', they have been removed by the restorers.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

They are an essential part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the ''Creation of Adam''. Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband-to-be. Again and again, Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel lunette are empty as are the eyes of the man in the Aminadab lunette, but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette of Jesse.

Arguimbau says:

{{quote|Have you ever felt that some things never fade and remain an inspiration for all time? That was the Sistine Chapel, now chemically stripped down of divine inspiration and looking shockingly out of place.&amp;nbsp;... It is the duty of the restorer not to alter the intent of the artist, but the scientist cannot help himself. Who cares if Colalucci discovered Michelangelo as a colorist and can explain the Colorist trends of Pontormo and Rossi. His job is to make sure the thing is stuck on there and leave it alone. In comparing before and after photos there is much proof that Colalucci removed 'a secco' passages and left many areas sketchy and thin and.{{sic}} Proof of one single change of the artist's intent is negligence of which there are many.|Arguimbau&lt;ref name=PLA/&gt;}}

Richard Serrin, in an essay entitled ''Lies and Misdemeanors: Gianluigi Colalucci's Sistine Chapel Revisited'' says:

{{quote|The [so-called] Glorious Restoration of Michelangelo's frescoes has destroyed them forever. What we say now cannot bring them back to life. We can only speak out to document the accountability of the Vatican restorers so that it does not pass unrecognized.|Richard Serrin&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite web| last =Serrin| first =Richard| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Lies and Misdemeanors, Gianluigi Colalucci's Sistine Chapel Revisted| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://mimsstudios.com/richardserrinarticle.pdf| format =PDF| doi =| accessdate =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070202045650/http://www.mimsstudios.com/richardserrinarticle.pdf| archivedate =2007-02-02| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Restoring the light==
Carlo Pietrangeli, former Director General of the Vatican Museums&lt;!--at the time of the restoration?--&gt;, writes of the restoration: "It is like opening a window in a dark room and seeing it flooded with light."&lt;ref name=CP/&gt; His words resonate with those of Giorgio Vasari who, in the 16th century, said of the Sistine Chapel ceiling:

{{quote|There is no other work to compare with this for excellence ... The ceiling has proved a veritable beacon for our art, of inestimable benefit to all painters, restoring light to a world that for centuries had been plunged into darkness.&lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt;}}

Pietrangeli, in his foreword to ''The Sistine Chapel'', written after the restoration of the lunettes, but prior to the restoration of the ceiling, commends those who had the courage to commence the restoration process, and thanks not only those who visited the restoration while it was in progress and gave the benefit of their knowledge and experience, but also those who were critical of the enterprise. Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.&lt;ref name=CP&gt;Carlo Pietrangeli, Foreword to ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed.

'''Robert Blair''' (17 April 1699 – 4 February 1746) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[poet]]. His fame rests upon his poem ''[[The Grave (poem)|The Grave]]'', which, in a later printing was illustrated by [[William Blake]].

==Biography==
[[File:William Blake - The Skeleton Reanimated.jpg|thumb|'The Skeleton Reanimated', one of [[William Blake]]'s illustrations for ''The Grave'']]
He was the eldest son of the Rev. Robert Blair, one of the king's chaplains, and was born at [[Edinburgh]]. He was educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and in the [[Netherlands]], and in 1731 was appointed to the living of Athelstaneford in [[East Lothian]]. In 1738, he married Isabella, daughter of Professor William Law, with whom he had six children. His family's wealth gave him leisure for his favourite pursuits: gardening and the study of English poets.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Blair published only three poems. One was a commemoration of his father-in-law and another was a translation. His reputation rests entirely on his third work, ''[[The Grave (poem)|The Grave]]'' (1743), which is a poem written in [[blank verse]] on the subject of death and the graveyard. It is much less conventional than its gloomy title might lead one to expect. Its religious subject no doubt contributed to its great popularity, especially in Scotland, where it gave rise to the so-called [[graveyard poets|"graveyard school" of poetry]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The poem extends to 767 lines of various merit, in some passages rising to great sublimity, and in others sinking to commonplace.

The poem is now best known for the illustrations created by [[William Blake]] following a commission from [[Robert Cromek]]. Blake's designs were engraved by [[Luigi Schiavonetti]], and published in 1808.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

See the biographical introduction prefixed to Blair's ''Poetical Works'', by Dr. Robert Anderson, in his ''Poets of Great Britain'', vol. viii. (1794). The only modern edition of ''The Grave'' is that of Professor James A. Means, which was published in 1973 by the Augustan Reprint Society, Los Angeles.

'''SELL''' ('''Syndicat des éditeurs de logiciels de loisirs''') is a French organisation that promotes the interests of video game developers. The group mainly distributes information about video game professionals to authorities and consumers. Created in 1995, the group is chaired by [[Philippe Sauze]] from [[Electronic Arts]] France. The general delegate is [[Jean Claude Larue]] (ex. [[Infogrames Entertainment, SA|Infogrames]]).

From June 1999 until the arrival in 2003 of [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]], the organisation rated the content of video games in France. Their classification system had four categories: "tous publics" (all audiences), "12 ans et plus" (12 years and over), "16 ans et plus" (16 years and over), and "interdit aux moins de 18 ans" (restricted under 18 years).

'''''Saint Jerome in the Desert''''' is a 149.8 by 106 cm oil on panel painting by [[Pinturicchio]], painted c.1475-1480 and showing [[Jerome]]. It is one of the earliest dated paintings attributed to the artist and was produced just after his contributions to the ''[[Miracles of St Bernardino]]'' series (1473). 

It is recorded as being in the Bartoccini family collection in [[Perugia]] before entering the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]], where it remained until it was sold in 1915. [[Henry Walters]] acquired it from the art dealer Luigi Grasse in 1916 on the advice of [[Bernard Berenson]]. In 1931 it formed part of the original core of the [[Walters Art Museum]] in Baltimore, where it still hangs. It was restored in 1966.

[[File:50 Euro bill watermark.jpg|thumb|A hologram on a 50 [[Euro]] banknote]]
'''Security printing''' is the field of the [[printing]] industry that deals with the printing of items such as [[banknote]]s, [[cheque]]s, [[passport]]s, [[tamper-evident]] [[label]]s, [[security tape]]s, product [[authentication]], [[stock certificate]]s, [[postage stamp]]s and [[identity card]]s. The main goal of security printing is to prevent [[forgery]], tampering, or [[counterfeit]]ing. More recently many of the techniques used to protect these high-value documents have become more available to commercial printers whether they are using the more traditional offset and flexographic presses or the newer digital platforms. Businesses are protecting their lesser-value documents such as transcripts, coupons and prescription pads by incorporating some of the features listed below to ensure that they cannot be forged or that alteration of the data cannot occur undetected.

A number of technical methods are used in the security printing industry.

== Special paper ==
Most banknotes are made of heavy [[paper]], almost always from cotton fibres for strength and durability, in some cases linen or speciality coloured or forensic fibres are added to give the paper added individuality and protect against counterfeiting. Some countries, including [[Canada]], [[Nigeria]], [[Romania]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Israel]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], produce [[Polymer banknote|polymer (plastic) banknotes]], to improve longevity and allow the inclusion of a small transparent window (a few millimeters in size) as a security feature that is difficult to reproduce using common counterfeiting techniques.

== Watermarks ==

A [[watermark]] is a recognizable image or pattern in paper that appears lighter or darker than surrounding paper when viewed with a light from behind the paper, due to paper density variations. A watermark is made by impressing a water coated metal stamp or dandy roll onto the paper during manufacturing. Watermarks were first introduced in Bologna, Italy in 1282; as well as their use in security printing, they have also been used by papermakers to identify their product. Watermarks can also be made on polymer currency, for example, Australia has its coat of arms watermarked on all its plastic bills.

=== Simulated watermarks ===

Printed with white ink, simulated watermarks have a different reflectance than the base paper and can be seen at an angle. Because the ink is white, it cannot be photocopied or scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Features|url=https://www.advlaser.com/v/vspfiles/files/pdf/security.pdf|publisher=Advantage Laser Products|accessdate=26 May 2014|location=Atlanta, GA|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intaglio printing ==

[[intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] is a printing technique in which the image is incised into a surface. Normally, copper or zinc plates are used, and the incisions are created by [[etching]] or [[engraving]] the image, but one may also use [[mezzotint]]. In printing, the surface is covered in ink, and then rubbed vigorously with tarlatan cloth or newspaper to remove the ink from the surface, leaving it in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink to the paper.

The very sharp printing obtained from the intaglio process is hard to imitate by other means. Intaglio also allows for the creation of latent images which are only visible when the document is viewed at a very shallow angle.

== Geometric lathe work ==
A [[guilloché]] is an ornamental pattern formed of two or more curved bands that interlace to repeat a circular design. They are made with a [[geometric lathe]].

[[File:Map3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A guilloché]]

== Microprinting ==
This involves the use of extremely small text, and is most often used on currency and bank checks. The text is generally small enough to be indiscernible to the naked eye. Cheques, for example, use [[microprinting|microprint]] as the signature line.

{{further|Microprinting}}

== Optically variable color-changing inks ==

[[Optically Variable Ink|Color changing inks]] are made from [[mica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weather Resistance Series, Pearlescent Pigment, Pearl EX Pigments|url=http://www.dychemco.com/pearlescent-pigment/1164252.html|publisher=Dynasty Chemicals (NingBo) Co., Ltd.|accessdate=26 May 2014|quote=Pearlescent Pigments are made from mica and they are widely used in paits, coating, printing ink, plastic, cosmetic, leather, wallpaper etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optically Variable Ink|Color changing inks]] colored magnetizable inks are prepared by including chromatic pigments of high color strength. The magnetic pigments’ strong inherent color generally reduces the spectrum of achievable shades. Generally, pigments should be used at high concentrations to ensure that sufficient magnetizable material is applied even in thin offset coats. Some magnetic pigment are best suited for colored magnetizable inks due to their lower blackness.
Homogenous magnetization (no preferred orientation) is easily obtained on pigment made of spherical particles. Best results are achieved when remanence and coercive field strength are very low and the saturating magnetization is high.

Magnetic pigments are also used in ribbon inks for coding and reading (MICR = Magnetic Ink Character Recognition).
The pigment is dispersed in a binder system (resin, solvent) or a wax compound and applied either by pressing or by hot melt to a carrier film (usually polyethylene).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magnetic pigments|date=July 2004|page=6|url=http://www.basf.pl/ecp1/Poland/pl/function/conversions:/publish/upload/02_Products_Industries/04_Business_Segments/Pigmenty/Pigmenty_magnetyczne_.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2014|publisher=BASF, The Chemical Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When pearlescent pigments are viewed at different angles the angle of the light as it's perceived makes the color appear to change as the magnetic fields within the particles shift direction.

== Holograms ==
{{Main|Security hologram}}
A [[hologram]] may be embedded either via hot-stamping foil, wherein an extremely thin layer of only a few [[micrometers]] of depth is bonded into the paper or a plastic substrate by means of a [[hot-melt adhesive]] (called a size coat) and heat from a metal die, or it may be directly embossed as holographic paper, or onto the laminate of a card itself.
When incorporated with a custom design pattern or logo, hologram hot stamping foils become security foils that protect credit cards, passports, bank notes and value documents from counterfeiting. Holograms help in curtailing forging, and duplication of products hence are very essential for security purposes. Once stamped on a product, they cannot be removed or forged, enhancing the product at the same time. Also from a security perspective, if stamped, a hologram is a superior security device as it is virtually impossible to remove from its substrate.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

== Security threads ==

Metal threads and foils, from simple iridescent features to foil color copying to foils with additional optically variable effects are often used.

There are two kinds of security threads.  One is a thin aluminum coated and partly de-metalized polyester film thread with microprinting which is embedded in the security paper as banknote or passport paper.  The other kind of security thread is the single or multicolor sewing thread made from cotton or synthetic fibers, mostly UV fluorescent, for the [[bookbinding]] of passport booklets.

On occasion, the banknote designers succumb to the Titanic effect (excess belief in the latest technology), and place too much faith in some particular trick. An example is the forgery of British banknotes in the 1990s.  British banknotes in the 1990s featured a metal strip through the paper about 1&amp;nbsp;mm wide that comes to the paper surface every 8&amp;nbsp;mm. When examined in reflected light, it appears to have a dotted metallic line running across it, but when viewed through transmitted light, the metal strip is dark and solid.

Duplicating this was thought to be difficult, but a criminal gang was able to reproduce it quickly. They used a cheap hot-stamping process to lay down a metal strip on the surface of the paper, then printed a pattern of solid bars over it using white ink to leave the expected metal pattern visible. At their trial, they were found to have forged tens of millions of pounds’ worth of notes over a period of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems|page=245|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SE-12.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2014|quote=banknote designers succumb to the Titanic effect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magnetic ink ==
Because of the speed with which they can be read by computer systems, magnetic ink character recognition is used extensively in banking, primarily for personal checks. The ink used in [[magnetic ink character recognition]] (MICR) technology is also used to greatly reduce errors in automated (or computerized) reading.

Some people believe that the magnetic ink was intended as a fraud prevention concept, yet the original intent was to have a non-optical technology so that writing on the cheque, like signatures, would not interfere with reading. The main magnetic fonts (E13-B and CMC7) are downloadable for a small fee and in addition magnetic toner is available for many printers. Some higher resolution toners have sufficient magnetic properties for magnetic reading to be successful without special toner.

== Serial numbers ==
[[Serial number]]s help make legitimate documents easier to track and audit. To help detect forgeries serial numbers will normally have a [[Check digit]] to verify the serial number.

Another method of protection is to create trap numbers within the serial number range. For example, the system may automatically invalidate numbers which are in a range of 200-300 (e.g. 210, 205 would be invalid). The system may even take single random numbers within a block (e.g. ending in 51, 37, 48 within a 200-300 range would be invalid).

== Anti-copying marks ==
In the late twentieth century advances in computer and photocopy technology made it possible for people without sophisticated training to easily copy currency. In an attempt to prevent this, banks have sought to add filtering features to the software and hardware available to the public that senses features of currency, and then locks out the reproduction of any material with these marks. One known example of such a system is the [[EURion constellation]].

== Copy-evident ==
{{Main|copy-evident document}}
Sometimes only the original document has value. An original signed [[cheque]] for example has value but a photocopy of it does not. An original prescription script can be filled but a photocopy of it should not be. Copy-evident technologies provide security to hard copy documents by helping distinguish between the original document and the copy.

The most common technology to help differentiate originals from copies is the [[void pantograph]]. Void pantographs are essentially invisible to the untrained, naked eye on an original but when scanned or copied the layout of lines, dots and dashes will reveal a word (frequently VOID and hence the name) or symbol that clearly allows the copy to be identified. This technology is available on both traditional presses (offset and flexographic) and on the newer digital platforms. The advantage of a digital press is that in a single pass through the printer a void pantograph with all the variable data can be printed on plain paper.

Copy-evident paper, sometimes marketed as ‘security paper’, is pre-printed void pantograph paper that was usually produced on an offset or flexographic press. The quality of the void pantograph is usually quite good because it was produced on a press with a very high resolution and when only a small number of originals are to be printed it can be a cost effective solution however the advent of the digital printer has rapidly eroded this benefit.

A second technology which complements and enhances the effectiveness of the void pantograph is the Verification Grid. This technology is visible on the original, usually as fine lines or symbols but when photocopied these lines and images disappear; the inverse reaction of the void pantograph. The most common examples of this technology are on the fine lines at the edge of a cheque which will disappear when copied or on a coupon when a symbol, such as a shopping cart, disappears when an unauthorized copy is made. Verification Grid is available for either traditional or digital presses.

Together the void pantograph and the Verification Grid complement each other because the reactions to copying are inverse, resulting in a higher degree of assurance that a hard copy document is an original.

== Prismatic coloration ==
The use of color can greatly assist the prevention of forgeries. By including a color on a document a color photocopier must be used in the attempt to make a copy however the use of these machines also tends to enhance the effectiveness of other technologies such as Void Pantographs and Verification Grids (see Copy-evident above).

By using two or more colors in the background and blending them together a prismatic effect can be created. This can be done on either a traditional or a digital press. When a document using this technique is attempted to be photocopied the scanning and re-creation by a color copier is inexact usually resulting in banding or blotching and thereby immediate recognition of the document as being a copy.

A frequent example of prismatic coloring is on checks where it is combined with other techniques such as the Void Pantograph to increase the difficulty of successful counterfeiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Features|url=https://www.advlaser.com/v/vspfiles/files/pdf/security.pdf|publisher=Advantage Laser Products|accessdate=26 May 2014|quote=Prismatic Two-Color Pantograph A multi-color background in which two colors change density and blend into each other, making it very difficult to reproduce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Halo ==
Carefully created images can be hidden in the background or in a picture on a document. These images cannot be seen without the help of an inexpensive lens of a specific line screening. When placed over the location of the image and rotated the image becomes visible. If the document is photocopied the Halo image is lost.

Halo can be printed on traditional or digital presses. The advantage of traditional presses is that multiple images can be overlaid in the same location and become visible in turn as the lens is rotated.

Halo is used as a technique to authenticate the originality of the document and may be used to verify critical information within the document. For example, the value of a coupon might be encoded as a Halo image that could be verified at the time of redemption or similarly the seat number on a sporting event ticket.

== False-positive testing ==
False-positive testing derives its name because the testing requires both a false and a positive reaction to authenticate a document. The most common instance is the widely available counterfeit detector marker seen in many banks and stores.

Counterfeit detector markers use a chemical interaction with the substrate, usually paper, of a document turning it a particular color. Usually a marker turns newsprint black and leaves currency or specially treated areas on a document clear or gold. The reaction and coloring varies depending upon the formulation. Banknotes, being a specially treated substrate, usually behave differently than standard newsprint or other paper and this difference is how counterfeits are detected by the markers.

False-positive testing can also be done on documents other than currencies as a means to test their authenticity. With the stroke of a marker a symbol, word or value can be revealed that will allow the user to quickly verify the document, such as a coupon. In more advanced applications the marker creates a barcode which can be scanned for verification or reference to other data within the document resulting in a higher degree of assurance of authenticity.

Photocopied documents will lack the special treating of the substrate so are easily detectable. False-positive testing generally is a one time test because once done the results remain visible so while useful as part of a coupon this technique is not suitable for ID badges for example.

== Fluorescent dyes ==
[[Fluorescent dyes]] are dyes which [[fluoresce]] under [[ultraviolet]] light or other unusual lighting. These show up as words, patterns or pictures and may be visible or invisible under normal lighting. This feature is also incorporated into many banknotes and other documents - e.g. Northern Ireland NHS prescriptions show a picture of local '8th wonder' the Giant's Causeway in UV light. Some producers include multi-frequency fluorescence, such that different elements fluoresce under specific frequencies of light.

== Registration of features on both sides ==
Banknotes are typically printed with fine alignment between the printing on each side of the note. This allows the note to be examined for this feature, and provides opportunities to unambiguously align other features of the note to the printing. Again, this is difficult to imitate accurately enough in most print shops.

== Electronic devices ==
With the advent of [[RFID]], it is possible to insert extremely small RF-active devices into the printed product to enhance document security. This is most apparent in modern biometric passports, where an RFID chip mirrors the printed information.

== [[Thermochromatic]] ink ==
Security ink with a normal "trigger" temperature of {{convert|88|F|C}}, which will either disappear or change colors when the ink is rubbed, usually by the fingertips.

== Latent images ==
Pressure-sensitive or hot stamped labels characterized with a normal (gray or colored) appearance. When viewed via a special filter (such as a polarizer) an additional, normally latent, image appears.

'''The Gingerbread Man''' (also known as '''The Gingerbread Boy''') is a [[Folklore|folktale]] about a [[gingerbread man]]'s escape from various pursuers and his eventual demise between the jaws of a [[fox]]. 
"The Gingerbread Boy "first appeared in print in the May, 1875, issue of ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'' in a [[cumulative tale]] which, like "[[The Little Red Hen]]", depends on repetitious scenes featuring an ever-growing cast of characters for its effect.&lt;ref name=SLL&gt;[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/gingerbread/index.html SurLaLune: "The Annotated Gingerbread Man."] Retrieved 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the reteller of the tale, "A girl from Maine told it to my children. It interested them so much that I thought it worth preserving. I asked where she found it and she said an old lady told it to her in her childhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Dodge |editor-first=Mary Mapes |editor-link=Mary Mapes Dodge |date=March 14, 2012 |title=St. Nicholas: A Monthly Magazine For Boys And Girls, Volume 2, Part 2... |url=

==1875 story ==
In the 1875 ''St. Nicholas'' tale, a childless old woman bakes a gingerbread man, who leaps from her oven and runs away. The woman and her husband give chase, but are unable to catch him. The gingerbread man then outruns several farm workers and farm animals, while taunting them with the phrase:

: I've run away from a little old woman,
: A little old man,

: And I can run away from you, I can!

The tale ends with a [[fox]] catching and eating the gingerbread man who cries as he is devoured, "I'm quarter gone...I'm half gone...I'm three-quarters gone...I'm all gone!"&lt;ref name=Ashliman_2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type2025.html#gingerbread |title=The Gingerbread Boy |author=&lt;!--author lost to history--&gt; |date=May 1875 |work=St. Nicholas |publisher=Scribner &amp; Company |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations on the 1875 story==
The Gingerbread Man remains a common subject for American children's literature into the 21st century. The retellings often omit the original ending ("I'm quarter gone...I'm half gone...I'm three-quarters gone...I'm all gone!")&lt;ref name=SLL /&gt; and make other changes. In some variations, the fox feigns deafness, drawing the Gingerbread Man closer and closer. Then the fox snatches and devours him. In other versions, the Gingerbread Man halts in his flight at a riverbank, and after accepting the fox's offer to ferry him across, is convinced by the fox to move ever-forward toward the fox's mouth.

In some retellings, the Gingerbread Man taunts his pursuers with the famous line: 
: Run, run as fast as you can!
: You can't catch me. I'm the Gingerbread Man!

==Folk tales==
Folk tales of the runaway food type are found in Germany, the British Isles, and Eastern Europe, as well as the United States.&lt;ref name=ashliman_1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type2025.html |title=The Runaway Pancake: folktales of Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 2025 |author=D. L. Ashliman (editor/translator) |authorlink=D. L. Ashliman|date=2000–2010 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slavic Europe|Slavic]] lands, a traditional character known as [[Kolobok]] ({{lang-ru|Колобок}}) is a ball of bread dough who avoids being eaten by various animals (collected by [[Konstantin Ushinsky]] in ''Native Word (Rodnoye slovo)'' in 1864). "The Pancake"&lt;ref name=ashliman_1/&gt; ("Pannekaken") was collected by [[Peter Asbjornsen]] and [[Jorgen Moe]] and published in ''Norske Folkeeventyr'' (1842-1844), and, ten years later, the German brothers Carl and Theodor Colshorn collected "The Big, Fat Pancake"&lt;ref name=ashliman_1/&gt; ("Vom dicken fetten Pfannekuchen") from the Salzdahlum region and published the tale in ''Märchen und Sagen'', no. 57, ([[1854 in literature|1854]]). In [[1894 in literature|1894]], Karl Gander collected "The Runaway Pancake"&lt;ref name=ashliman_1/&gt; ("Der fortgelaufene Eierkuchen") from an Ögeln cottager and peddler and published the tale in ''Niederlausitzer Volkssagen, vornehmlich aus dem Stadt- und Landkreise Guben,'' no. 319. The Roule Galette story is a similar story from France.

An interesting variation of this trope is found in the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] tale "The Little Dumpling" ("A kis gömböc"), and contrary to the title the main character is not a dumpling, but the Hungarian version of [[head cheese]]. In the tale it is the gömböc that eats the others; it first consumes the family that "made" it, and then, rolling on the road, it eats various others – including a whole army – the last of whom is a swineherd. His knife opens the gömböc from the inside, and the people run home. In another variation the gömböc bursts after eating too many people. A similar Russian tale is called "The Clay Guy" ([[:ru:Глиняный парень|Глиняный парень]]). In it, an old childless couple make themselves a clay child, who first eats all their food, then them, then a number of people, until he meets a goat who offers to jump right into his mouth, but instead uses the opportunity to ram the clay guy, shattering him and freeing everyone. The Czech folk tale [[Otesánek]] (and [[Little Otik|the 2000 movie with the same name]]) follows a similar plot.

[[Joseph Jacobs]] published "Johnny-Cake" in his ''[[English Fairy Tales]]'' (1890), basing his tale on a version found in the ''American Journal of Folk-Lore.''&lt;ref name=SLL /&gt; Jacobs' johnny-cake rolls rather than runs, and the fox tricks him by pretending to be deaf and unable to hear his taunting verse. In "The Wee Bannock" from ''More English Fairy Tales'' (1894), Jacobs records a Scottish tale with a [[bannock (food)|bannock]] as hero.&lt;ref name="JacobsMore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=Joseph|authorlink1=Joseph Jacobs|last2=Batten|first2=John D.|authorlink2=John D.

==Derivations and modern works==
The musical ''The Gingerbread Man'' (music by [[Alfred Baldwin Sloane]], book and lyrics by Frederic G. Ranken) opened on Broadway on Christmas Day 1905, and ran for five months. The massive production then moved to Chicago with most of its New York cast and continued a successful tour of smaller venues in the U.S. for at least another four years. In this show the titular character, a gingerbread man, is named [[John Dough]] ("John Dough" being another term for a gingerbread man that was current at the time). While the gingerbread man is not the main character, he was played by the crowd favorite [[Eddie Redway]] and caught the attention of audiences and critics. The gingerbread man idea was also heavily promoted by the producers: 25,000 dough statuettes were given away in New York City to promote the show. This John Dough had few resemblances to the Gingerbread Man of the 1875 story described above. He claims to be a scapegoat rather than a troublemaker: "They are looking for me high and low, I'm wanted for that, I'm wanted for this, For any old thing that has gone amiss." Ranken's John Dough gingerbread man has few qualms about being eaten; he seems to fear obscurity more: "A little boy buys me with a cent . . . And removes an arm or leg or two, As down his throat I gently float, How can that hopeful know, Unless he is told, That he's stowed in his hold, The original John Dough."&lt;ref&gt;The Cincinnati Enquirer 8 May 1906, page 7. Downloaded from Newspapers.com 16 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Minneapolis Journal 28 October 1906, page 51. Downloaded from Newspapers.com on 16 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[John Dough and the Cherub]]'' (1906) and ''[[The Road to Oz]]'' (1909), also contained a gingerbread man named John Dough. Baum's John Dough is a life-sized creation and scared of being eaten, but ultimately sacrifices his hand to save a child's life. The Baum 1906 story also helped popularize the meme of the Gingerbread Man, although Baum's tale, like Ranken's, contained few elements of the original story.

Some tales have settings and cultural connections beyond Europe, such as Eric Kimmel's ''The Runaway Tortilla'' (2000) about a desert-roving tortilla who avoids donkeys, rattlesnakes, and buckaroos only to be defeated by crafty Señor Coyote; the [[Hanukkah]] version called ''The Runaway [[Latke]]s'' (2000) by Leslie Kimmelman; and Ying Chang Compestine's [[Chinese New Year]] tale, ''The Runaway [[Rice Cake]]'' (2001). Peter Armour's ''Stop That Pickle!'' (2005) is a tale about a runaway deli pickle. ''Marsupial Sue Presents "The Runaway Pancake"'' follows a similar plotline about a pancake whose hubris gets the best of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Marsupial-Sue-Presents-The-Runaway-Pancake/John-Lithgow/9780689878480|title=Marsupial Sue Presents "The Runaway Pancake"|date=2008-10-21|isbn=9780689878480|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern twists on the tale that retain a gingerbread man as the protagonist include Janet Squires' ''The Gingerbread Cowboy''; ''The Gingerbread Kid Goes to School'' (2002) by Joan Holub; and Lisa Campbell's ''The Gingerbread Girl'' (2006). In 1992 Jon Sciezka published ''[[The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales]]''. "The Stinky Cheese Man" is a rendition of "The Gingerbread Man" where the stinky cheese man runs away from everyone fearing that they will eat him, when really everyone just wants to get away from his smell. In 2018 Stephen Dixon published a sequel entitled ''The Gingerbread Man 2: What Happened Later?''.

The tale was used by [[The Residents]] in their 1994 album ''[[Gingerbread Man (album)|Gingerbread Man]]''. Here, the gingerbread man serves as the narrator, introducing the characters in each song.

The Korean mobile game ''[[Cookie Run]]'' is motivated by this fairy tale.

The Gingerbread Man is a dangerous criminal in the [[Jasper Fforde]] Nursery Crimes series and the main antagonist in the second novel in this series, ''[[The Fourth Bear]]''.

"'''The Goblin and the Grocer'''" ({{lang-da|Nissen hos Spekhøkeren}}) is a [[fairy tale]] by Danish [[poet]] and [[author]] [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a goblin who must choose between poetry or a Christmas treat from a grocer. The tale was first published November 30, 1852, and republished several times during the author's lifetime. [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Pink Fairy Book]]'' (1897). The title is sometimes mistakenly translated into English as "''The Goblin and the Huckster''".

==Synopsis==
Once, a student lived in an attic while a grocer lived on the first floor with a house goblin.  Because the grocer gave the goblin a lump of jam and butter at [[Christmas]], the goblin belonged to the grocer.  One day, the student came to buy cheese and candles; then he discovered that his cheese was wrapped in a page from a poetry book, so he bought the book instead of the cheese, and joked that the grocer knew nothing about poetry.  The goblin, offended by the joke, used magic to make everything in the room speak and they all agreed that poetry was useless.  The goblin went to tell the student, but he saw a beautiful, marvelous tree of light in the student's room, the most splendid thing he had ever seen.  He kept going back to watch the tree of light through the peephole, but could not stay there, for the grocer gave him jam and butter. One day when there was a fire, the goblin ran to save the poetry book, and realized that he thought the book the greatest treasure in the house.  Still, he decided to divide his time between the grocer and the student, because the student has no jam.

'''''The Historical Novel''''' is a 1924 book by [[Herbert Butterfield]]. It originated in an undergraduate essay and gained the Le Bas Prize for Butterfield. It was originally published by [[Cambridge University Press]], one of the conditions for the prize.

==Summary==
The work was Butterfield's first publication. It developed from the embryo of a paper, presented to the Peterhouse History Society in the Michaelmas term, which he then expanded.

It examines the relationship between the form of the [[Historical fiction#Historical novel|historical novel]] on the one hand and the formal study of history on the other. It explores the style of historical fictions, the way in which they engage with evidence (and how that differs from the orthodox [[historical method]]) and the extent to which such a form of writing affects mainstream historical scholarship itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Historical Novel|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/regional-and-world-history-general-interest/historical-novel-essay|website=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfield sees the historical novel as a form which is a kind of 'fusion' of other styles and approaches. In particular, he sees a potential in it for a form of historical empathy that can provide deep insights into the motivations behind the actions of historical protagonists such as [[Napoleon]]; it can also be used to marshall a sense of nationalistic or patriot feeling becoming, itself, a "maker of history" rather than merely a reflector or mirror of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Groot|first1=Jerome|title=The Historical Novel|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=113525320X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82avWVrVeukC&amp;pg=PT3&amp;lpg=PT3&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fq9dzFHgBi&amp;sig=VSrtwqcq63ddSQzblX0xd-Z_smw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ftXTU-HTH-zZ0QWA5YCgAQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its purposes, according to Butterfield, was to help us 'feel' a particular epoch of the past in ways in which traditional historical writing might not because of the different role and importance of the imagination in the case of the historical novel. Another important element of historical fiction for Butterfield was its role in bringing to light the existence of uncertainty in human affairs as lived by real people: the historian, in his view, tends to have a retrospective reach which draws out trajectories and processes over time, but the characters in a historical novel live as real human beings do, being only aware of probabilities and potential situations rather than knowing precisely where certain events and phenomena are headed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowenthal|first1=David|title=The Past is a Foreign Country|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521294800|pages=226–227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMqsAQZmv5IC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G9jTU_bFBcOV7AbymYFw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work did not display Butterfield's later detestation of the form of the historical novel; later on, moreover, he referred to the arguments in his first publication in disparaging terms, arguing that it was 'a bad book'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Michael|title=The Life and Thought of Herbert Butterfield: History, Science and God|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1139502859|pages=45–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1r2DMbwZegC&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sNbTU86WN8_H7AaE_ID4CA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The New Radical''''' is a 2017 documentary film that premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in the US Documentary Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6333062/|title=The New Radical|date=1 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, uncompromising millennial radicals from the United States and the United Kingdom attack the system through dangerous technological means, which evolves into a high-stakes game with world authorities in the midst of a dramatically changing political landscape. The film contains an interview with [[Julian Assange]] at the Ecuadoran Embassy in London.

== Critical response ==
Owen Gleiberman writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "The great strength of ''The New Radical'' is that it's not on its subjects' side (or totally against them either). It's the rare documentary that lets you decide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/the-new-radical-review-1201967572/|title=Sundance Film Review: ‘The New Radical’|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|date=24 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Katie Walsh in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film's objectivity "irresponsible" and "problematic," chastising the filmmakers for not taking a side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-capsule-new-radical-review-20171130-story.html|title=Documentary 'The New Radical' perilously withholds judgment|first=Katie|last=Walsh|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Persistence of Memory''''' ({{lang-ca|La persistència de la memòria}}) is a 1931 [[painting]] by artist [[Salvador Dalí]], and one of his most recognizable works. First shown at the [[Julien Levy Gallery]] in 1932, since 1934 the painting has been in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) in [[New York City]], which received it from an anonymous donor. It is widely recognized and frequently referenced in popular culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff editor|title=Dali, The Flamboyant Surrealist|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z2lcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tVYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=dal%C3%AD%20melting%20watch&amp;pg=4025%2C4123936|accessdate=20 June 2011|newspaper=The Vindicator|date=28 January 1989|quote=The death of Salvador Dali evokes the image of his most famous painting, ''Persistence of Memory''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes referred to by more descriptive (though incorrect) titles, such as "Melting Clocks", "The Soft Watches" or "The Melting Watches".{{by whom?|date=June 2017}}

==Description==
The well-known [[surrealist]] piece introduced the image of the soft melting [[pocket watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Kirsten|title=Essential Dalí|year=1999|publisher=;Dempsey Parr|isbn=978-1-84084-509-9|quote=It includes the first appearance of what is perhaps his most enduring image: the 'soft watch'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It epitomizes Dalí's theory of "softness" and "hardness", which was central to his thinking at the time. As [[Dawn Adès]] wrote, "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order".&lt;ref&gt;Ades, Dawn. Dalí. Thames and Hudson, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation suggests that Dalí was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of special relativity]]. Asked by [[Ilya Prigogine]] whether this was in fact the case, Dalí replied that the soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a [[Camembert]] melting in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Salvador Dali |date=2008 |title=The Dali Dimension: Decoding the Mind of a Genius |format=DVD |publisher=Media 3.14-TVC-FGSD-IRL-AVRO|url=http://www.dalidimension.com/eng/index.html|quote=Surprisingly, Dalí said that his soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a Camembert cheese melting in the sun.

It is possible to recognize a human figure in the middle of the composition, in the strange "monster" (with a lot of texture near its face, and lots of contrast and tone in the picture) that Dalí used in several contemporary pieces to represent himself – the abstract form becoming something of a self-portrait, reappearing frequently in his work. The figure can be read as a "fading" creature, one that often appears in dreams where the dreamer cannot pinpoint the creature's exact form and composition. One can observe that the creature has one closed eye with several eyelashes, suggesting that the creature is also in a dream state. The iconography may refer to a dream that Dalí himself had experienced, and the clocks may symbolize the passing of time as one experiences it in sleep or the persistence of time in the eyes of the dreamer.

The orange clock at the bottom left of the painting is covered in ants. Dalí often used ants in his paintings as a symbol of decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danilian symbolism I Salvador Dalí I Espace Dalí|url=http://daliparis.com/en/salvador-dali/dalinian-symbols|website=daliparis.com|accessdate=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925181611/http://daliparis.com/en/salvador-dali/dalinian-symbols|archive-date=25 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA I Salvador Dalí.

The fly appears to be casting a human shadow as the sun hits it. ''The Persistence of Memory'' employs "the exactitude of realist painting techniques"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7qeHVrQ5X-MC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=Persistence+of+Memory+Dali+dream+surrealism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7ejjTdHmO8zOgAeOqfGYBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=exactitude%20realist%20painting%20techniques&amp;f=false "Dali's dream environments were represented through the exactitude of realist painting techniques, like those found in his ''Persistence of Memory'' (1931)."

The craggy rocks to the right represent a tip of [[Cap de Creus]] peninsula in north-eastern [[Catalonia]]. Many of Dalí's paintings were inspired by the landscapes of his life in Catalonia. The strange and foreboding shadow in the foreground of this painting is a reference to Mount Pani.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moodbook.com/history/modernism/salvador-dali-surreal.html Salvador Dali.

Dalí returned to the theme of this painting with the variation ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]]'' (1954), showing his earlier famous work systematically fragmenting into smaller component elements, and a series of rectangular blocks which reveal further imagery through the gaps between them, implying something beneath the surface of the original work; this work is now in the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], while the original ''Persistence of Memory'' remains at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. Dalí also produced various [[lithograph]]s and [[sculpture]]s on the theme of soft watches late in his career. Some of these sculptures are the ''Persistence of Memory'', the ''Nobility of Time'', the ''Profile of Time'', and the ''Three Dancing Watches''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalisculptureeditions.com/Index.asp?Sez=Sculpture Dalis Sculpture Editions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708222040/http://www.dalisculptureeditions.com/Index.asp?Sez=Sculpture |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Silmarillion''''' &lt;small&gt;(pronounced: [[Sindarin|/sɪlmaˈrɪljɔn/]])&lt;/small&gt; is a collection of [[Mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] works by English writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], edited and published posthumously by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]], in 1977, with assistance from [[Guy Gavriel Kay]].&lt;ref name="Silf"&gt;{{Harv|Silmarillion|1977|loc=Foreword|Ref=Silmarillion}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Silmarillion'', along with J. R. R. Tolkien's other works, forms an extensive, though incomplete, narrative that describes the universe of [[Eä]] in which are found the lands of [[Valinor]], [[Beleriand]], [[Númenor]], and [[Middle-earth]], within which ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' take place.

After the success of ''The Hobbit'', Tolkien's publisher requested a sequel. Tolkien sent them an early draft of ''The Silmarillion'' but they rejected the work as being obscure and "too Celtic". The result was that Tolkien began work on "A Long Expected Party", the first chapter of what he described at the time as "a new story about [[Hobbit]]s", which became ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref name=beleriand&gt;{{Citation|title=The Lays of Beleriand|last=Tolkien |first=J.R.R.|publisher=Ballantine|editor=Christopher Tolkien|pages=433–4|isbn=0-345-38818-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Silmarillion'' comprises five parts. The first part, ''[[Ainulindalë]]'', tells of the creation of Eä, the "world that ''is''". ''[[Valaquenta]]'', the second part, gives a description of the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]], the supernatural powers in Eä. The next section, ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the history of the events before and during the [[First Age]], including the wars over the [[Silmaril]]s that gave the book its title. The fourth part, ''[[Akallabêth]]'', relates the history of the Downfall of Númenor and its people, which takes place in the [[Second Age]]. The final part, ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]'', is a brief account of the circumstances which led to and were presented in ''The Lord of the Rings''.

The five parts were initially separate works, but it was the elder Tolkien's express wish that they be published together.&lt;ref name="Silf" /&gt; Because J. R. R. Tolkien died before he finished revising the various legends, Christopher gathered material from his father's older writings to fill out the book. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely new material in order to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=My father's "eviscerated" work – son of Hobbit scribe J.R.R.

==Overview==
''The Silmarillion'', like Tolkien's other [[Middle-earth writings]], was meant to have taken place at some time in Earth's past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#165, 211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this idea, ''The Silmarillion'' is meant to have been translated from [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s three-volume ''[[Red Book of Westmarch|Translations from the Elvish]]'', which he wrote while at [[Rivendell]].&lt;ref name="BoLTF"&gt;{{ME-ref|BolT|Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters in the book include:
*"The [[Music of the Ainur]]"
*"Quenta Silmarillion" (the history of the [[Silmaril]]s and the war of the [[Noldor]] against [[Morgoth]])
*"Of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]]"
*"[[Túrin Turambar]]" (closely associated with "[[Narn i Hîn Húrin|Narn i Chîn Húrin: The Tale of the Children of Húrin]]" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'') &lt;!-- please note Chîn is the correct spelling --&gt;
*"Of [[Tuor]] and The Fall of [[Gondolin]]"
*"Of the Voyage of [[Eärendil]] and the [[War of Wrath]]"

The inside title page contains an inscription written in [[Tengwar]]. In the common script, it reads "The tales of the [[First Age]] when [[Morgoth]] dwelt in Middle-earth and the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] made war upon him for the recovery of the Silmarils to which are appended the downfall of Númenor and the history of the [[Rings of Power]] and the Third Age in which these tales come to their end."

==Synopsis==
{{Silmarillion}}

===''Ainulindalë'' and ''Valaquenta''===
{{Main article|Ainulindalë|Valaquenta}}

The first section of ''The Silmarillion'', ''Ainulindalë'' ("The Music of the [[Ainu (Middle-earth)|Ainur]]"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex"&gt;{{Harv|Silmarillion|1977|loc=Index of Names|Ref=Silmarillion}}&lt;/ref&gt;), takes the form of a primary creation narrative. Eru ("The One"&lt;ref&gt;(Silmarillion 1977, pp. 15, 329)&lt;/ref&gt;), also called [[Eru Ilúvatar|Ilúvatar]] ("Father of All"), first created the Ainur, a group of eternal spirits or [[demiurge]]s, called "the offspring of his thought". Ilúvatar brought the Ainur together and showed them a theme, from which he bade them make a great music. [[Morgoth|Melkor]] – whom Ilúvatar had given the "greatest power and knowledge" of all the Ainur – broke from the harmony of the music to develop his own song. Some Ainur joined him, while others continued to follow Ilúvatar, causing discord in the music. This happened thrice, with Eru Ilúvatar successfully overpowering his rebellious subordinate with a new theme each time. Ilúvatar then stopped the music and showed them a vision of [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] and its peoples. The vision disappeared after a while, and Ilúvatar offered the Ainur a chance to enter into Arda and govern over the new world.

Many Ainur descended, taking physical form and becoming bound to that world. The greater Ainur became known as the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], while the lesser Ainur were called the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]]. The Valar attempted to prepare the world for the coming inhabitants (Elves and [[Men (Middle-earth)|Men]]), while Melkor, who wanted Arda for himself, repeatedly destroyed their work; this went on for thousands of years until, through waves of destruction and creation, the world took shape.

''Valaquenta'' ("Account of the Valar"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;) describes Melkor and each of the 14 Valar in detail, as well as a few of the Maiar. It also reveals how Melkor seduced many Maiar – including those who would eventually become [[Sauron]] and the [[Balrog]]s – into his service.

===''Quenta Silmarillion''===
{{Main article|Quenta Silmarillion}}

''Quenta Silmarillion'' ("The History of the [[Silmaril]]s"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;), which makes up the bulk of the book, is a series of interconnected tales set in the First Age that make up the tragic saga of the three jewels, the Silmarils.

The Valar had attempted to fashion the world for [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], but Melkor continually destroyed their handiwork. After he destroyed the two lamps that illuminated the world, the Valar moved to [[Aman (Middle-earth)|Aman]], a continent to the west of Middle-earth, where they established their home called [[Valinor]]. [[Yavanna]] created [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] that illuminated Valinor and left Middle-earth to darkness and Melkor. Soon after, stars created by [[Varda]] began to shine and the [[Awakening of the Elves|Elves awoke]]. The elves originally formed three groups: the [[Vanyar]], the [[Noldor]], and the [[Teleri]], though some elves were captured and enslaved by Melkor, eventually to be bred into [[orc]]s. Knowing the danger the Elves were in, the Valar decided to fight Melkor to keep the Elves safe. After defeating and capturing Melkor, they invited the Elves to live in Aman. Many Elves travelled to Aman, while others refused and still others stopped along the way, including the Elves who later became the [[Sindar]], ruled by the Elf King [[Thingol]] and [[Melian]], a Maia. Of the three tribes that set out, all of the [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]], and many of the [[Teleri]] reached Aman.

In Aman, [[Fëanor]], son of [[Finwë]], King of the Noldor, created the Silmarils, jewels that glowed with the light of the Two Trees. Melkor, who had been held in captivity by the Valar, was eventually released after feigning repentance. Upon release, Melkor deceived Fëanor into believing that his eldest half-brother [[Fingolfin]] was attempting a coup against [[Finwë]]. This rift led to the banishment of [[Fëanor]] from the Noldor city [[Tirion]], and Fëanor thereafter created the fortress Formenos to the North of [[Tirion]]. Finwë moved to Formenos to live with Fëanor, his favourite of three sons, and there they safely kept the Silmarils. After many years, Fëanor travelled to Tirion to make amends with Fingolfin, while Finwë stayed at Formenos. While making amends, Melkor destroyed the Two Trees with the help of [[Ungoliant]], a dark spider spirit Melkor found in Avathar, on the Southeast side of Aman. Together, Melkor and Ungoliant then escaped to Formenos, killed Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and fled to Middle-earth. Melkor kept the Silmarils and banished Ungoliant, later attacking the Elvish kingdom of [[Doriath]], ruled by the Elf King [[Thingol]] and his wife [[Melian]]. He was defeated in the [[Battles of Beleriand|first of five battles of Beleriand]], however, and barricaded himself in his northern fortress of [[Angband]].

Fëanor and his sons swore an oath of vengeance against Melkor – and against anyone who withheld the Silmarils from them, even the Valar. Fëanor persuaded most of the Noldor to pursue Melkor, whom [[Fëanor]] renamed as [[Morgoth]], into Middle-earth. Fëanor's sons seized ships from the Teleri, attacking and killing many of them, and left the other Noldor to make the voyage by foot. Upon arriving in Middle-earth, the Noldor under Fëanor attacked Melkor and defeated his host, though Fëanor was slain by Balrogs. After a period of peace, Melkor attacked the Noldor but was again defeated and besieged. Nearly 400 years later, he broke the siege and drove the Noldor back.

After the destruction of the Trees and the theft of the Silmarils, the Valar created the moon and the sun. At the same time, Men awoke, some of whom later arrived in Beleriand and allied themselves with the Elves. [[Beren]], a man who had survived the latest battle, wandered to Doriath, where he fell in love with the elf [[Lúthien]], the king's daughter. The king sought to prevent their marriage by imposing what he believed an impossible task: retrieving one of the Silmarils from Melkor. But together, Beren and Lúthien embarked on this quest. [[Sauron]], a powerful servant of Melkor, imprisoned Beren along the way; but with Lúthien's help he escaped, crept into Melkor's fortress, and stole a Silmaril from Melkor's crown. Having achieved the task, the first union of man and elf was formed, though Beren was soon mortally wounded and Lúthien also died of grief. However she convinced the Vala [[Mandos]] to revive Beren and herself, choosing to sacrifice her immortality in favour of a mortal life with her beloved.

The Noldor, seeing that a mortal and an elf-woman could infiltrate Angband, perceived that Melkor was not invincible. They attacked again with a great army of Elves, [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and Men. But they were deceived by Melkor, who had secretly darkened the hearts of many of the men. Thus it was that the Elvish host were utterly defeated, due in part to the treachery of some Men. However, many Men remained loyal to the Elves and were honoured thereafter.

None received more honour than the brothers [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]]. Huor died in battle, but Melkor captured Húrin, and cursed him to watch the downfall of his kin. Húrin's son, [[Túrin Turambar]], was sent to Doriath, leaving his mother and unborn sister behind in his father's kingdom (which had been overrun by the enemy). Túrin achieved many great deeds of valour, the greatest being the defeat of the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Glaurung]]. Despite his heroism, however, Túrin was plagued by the curse of Melkor, which led him unwittingly to murder his friend [[Beleg]] and to marry and impregnate his sister [[Nienor Níniel|Nienor]], whom he had never met before, and who had lost her memory through Glaurung's enchantment. Before their child was born, the bewitchment was lifted as the dragon lay dying. Nienor, realizing what grew within her, took her own life. Upon learning the truth, Túrin threw himself on his sword.

Huor's son, [[Tuor]], became involved in the fate of the hidden Noldorin kingdom of Gondolin. He married the elf [[Idril]], daughter of [[Turgon]], Lord of [[Gondolin]] (the second union between Elves and Men). When Gondolin fell, betrayed from within by [[Maeglin]], Tuor saved many of its inhabitants from destruction. All of the Elvish kingdoms in Beleriand eventually fell, and the refugees fled to a haven by the sea created by Tuor. The son of Tuor and Idril, [[Eärendil]] the [[Half-elven]], was betrothed to [[Elwing]], herself descended from Beren and Lúthien. Elwing brought Eärendil the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien, and using its light Eärendil travelled across the sea to Aman to seek help from the Valar. The Valar obliged; they attacked and defeated Melkor, completely destroying his fortress [[Angband]] and sinking most of [[Beleriand]]; and they expelled Melkor from Arda. This ended the First Age of Middle-earth. The last two Silmarils were taken by [[Fëanor]]'s surviving sons [[Maedhros]] and Maglor. However, Maedhros killed himself by leaping into a fiery chasm with a Silmaril while Maglor threw his into the sea and spent the rest of his days wandering along the shores of the world, singing his grief.

Eärendil and Elwing had two children: [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]]. As descendants of immortal elves and mortal men, they were given the choice of which lineage to belong to: Elrond chose to belong to the Elves, his brother to Men. Elros became the first king of Númenor and lived to 500 years old, being given an extended life in return for choosing to be a Man.

===''Akallabêth''===
{{Main article|Akallabêth}}

''Akallabêth'' ("The Downfallen"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;) comprises about 30 pages, and recounts the rise and fall of the island kingdom of [[Númenor]], inhabited by the [[Dúnedain]]. After the defeat of Melkor, the Valar gave the island to the [[Edain|three loyal houses of Men]] who had aided the Elves in the war against him. Through the favour of the Valar, the Dúnedain were granted wisdom and power and life more enduring than any other of mortal race had possessed, making them comparable to the High-Elves of [[Aman (Middle-earth)|Aman]]. Indeed, the isle of Númenor lay closer to Aman than to Middle-earth. But their power lay in their bliss and their acceptance of mortality. The fall of Númenor came about in large measure through the influence of the corrupted Maia [[Sauron]] (the chief servant of Melkor), who arose during the Second Age and tried to conquer Middle-earth.

The Númenóreans moved against Sauron, who saw that he could not defeat them by force and allowed himself to be taken as a prisoner to Númenor. There he quickly enthralled the king, [[Ar-Pharazôn]], urging him to seek out the immortality that the Valar had apparently denied him, thus nurturing the seeds of envy that the Númenóreans had begun to hold against the Elves of the West and the Valar. So it was that all the knowledge and power of Númenor was turned towards seeking an avoidance of death; but this only weakened them and sped the gradual waning of the lifespans to something more similar to that of other Men. Sauron urged them to wage war against the Valar themselves to win immortality, and to worship his master Melkor, whom he said could grant them their wish. Ar-Pharazôn created the mightiest army and fleet Númenor had seen, and sailed against Aman. The Valar and Elves of Aman, stricken with grief over their betrayal, called on [[Ilúvatar]] for help. When Ar-Pharazôn landed, Ilúvatar destroyed his fleet and drowned Númenor itself as punishment for the rebellion against the rightful rule of the Valar. Ilúvatar created a great wave, such as had never before been seen, which utterly destroyed and submerged the isle of Númenor, killing all but those Dúnedain who had already sailed east, and changing the shape of all the lands of Middle-earth.

Sauron's physical manifestation was also destroyed in the ruin of Númenor, but as a Maia, his spirit returned to Middle-earth, no longer able to take upon himself the fair form he once had. Some Númenóreans who had remained loyal to the Valar were spared and were washed up on the shores of Middle-earth. Among these survivors were [[Elendil]] their leader, a descendant of Elros, and his two sons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] who had also saved a seedling from Númenor's white tree, the ancestor of that of Gondor. They founded the Númenórean Kingdoms in Exile:  [[Arnor]] in the north and [[Gondor]] in the south.  Elendil reigned as High-king of both kingdoms, but committed the rule of Gondor jointly to Isildur and Anárion.  The power of the kingdoms in exile was greatly diminished from that of Númenor, "yet very great it seemed to the wild men of Middle-earth".

At the end, it is mentioned that the sunken Númenor came to be called "Atalantë", a name not used when it existed. This led many readers to the conclusion that Númenor is [[Atlantis]]; this direct link was, however, denied by Tolkien himself, who asserted that it's a natural word following the constructs of [[Quenya]].

===''Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age''===
{{Main article|Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age}}

The concluding section of the book, comprising about 20 pages, describes the events that take place in Middle-earth during the Second and [[Third Age]]s. In the Second Age, Sauron emerged as the main power in Middle-earth, and the Rings of Power were forged by Elves led by [[Celebrimbor]]. Sauron secretly forged [[One Ring|his own ring]] to control the others, which led to war between the peoples of Middle-earth and Sauron, culminating in the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|War of the Last Alliance]], in which Elves and the remaining Númenóreans united to defeat Sauron, bringing the Second Age to an end. The Third Age began with the passing of the [[One Ring]] to [[Isildur]], who was ambushed at the [[Gladden Fields]] shortly afterwards, and lost the ring in the [[Anduin|River Anduin]]. This section also gives a brief overview of the events leading up to and taking place in ''The Lord of the Rings'', including the waning of Gondor, the re-emergence of Sauron, the [[White Council]], [[Saruman]]'s treachery, and Sauron's final destruction along with the One Ring, after which the ages of magic end.

Tolkien first began working on the stories that would become ''The Silmarillion'' in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#115}}&lt;/ref&gt; intending them to become an English mythology that would explain the origins of English history and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#131, 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this early work was written while Tolkien, then a British officer returned from France during World War I, was in hospital and on sick leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#165, 180, 282}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the first story, "[[The Fall of Gondolin]]", in late 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#163, 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He called his collection of nascent stories ''The Book of Lost Tales''.&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt; This became the name for the first two volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', which include these early texts. The stories employ the narrative device of a mariner named Eriol (in later versions, an Anglo-Saxon named [[Ælfwine of England|Ælfwine]]) who finds the island of [[Tol Eressëa]], where the Elves live; and the Elves tell him their history.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|BolT|Chapter I, "The Cottage of Lost Play"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tolkien never completed ''The Book of Lost Tales''; he left it to compose the poems "[[The Lay of Leithian]]" and "[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]".&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt;

The first complete version of ''The Silmarillion'' was the "Sketch of the Mythology" written in 1926&lt;ref name="LoB1"&gt;{{ME-ref|LoB|Chapter I, "The Lay of the Children of Húrin"}}&lt;/ref&gt; (later published in Volume IV of ''The History of Middle-earth''). The "Sketch" was a 28-page synopsis written to explain the background of the story of [[Túrin]] to R. W. Reynolds, a friend to whom Tolkien had sent several of the stories.&lt;ref name="LoB1" /&gt; From the "Sketch" Tolkien developed a fuller narrative version of ''The Silmarillion'' called ''Quenta Noldorinwa''&lt;ref name="SoMEP"&gt;{{ME-ref|SoME|Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also included in Volume IV). The ''Quenta Noldorinwa'' was the last version of ''The Silmarillion'' that Tolkien completed.&lt;ref name="SoMEP" /&gt;

In 1937, encouraged by the success of ''The Hobbit'', Tolkien submitted to his publisher [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] an incomplete but more fully developed version of ''The Silmarillion'' called ''Quenta Silmarillion'',&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt; but they rejected the work as being obscure and "too [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]]".&lt;ref name="Letter19"&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher instead asked Tolkien to write a sequel to ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref name="Letter19" /&gt; Tolkien began to revise ''The Silmarillion'', but soon turned to the sequel, which became ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|LRoW|Part II, Chapter VI, "Quenta Silmarillion"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He renewed work on ''The Silmarillion'' after completing ''The Lord of the Rings'',&lt;ref name="MRF"&gt;{{ME-ref|MR|Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he greatly desired to publish the two works together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#124}}&lt;/ref&gt; But when it became clear that would not be possible, Tolkien turned his full attention to preparing ''The Lord of the Rings'' for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s Tolkien returned to ''The Silmarillion'', but much of his writing from this time was concerned more with the theological and philosophical underpinnings of the work than with the narratives themselves. By this time, he had doubts about fundamental aspects of the work that went back to the earliest versions of the stories, and it seems that he felt the need to resolve these problems before he could produce the "final" version of ''The Silmarillion''.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt; During this time he wrote extensively on such topics as the nature of evil in Arda, the origin of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], the customs of the Elves, the nature and means of Elvish rebirth, and the "flat" world and the story of the Sun and Moon.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt; In any event, with one or two exceptions, he wrought little change to the narratives during the remaining years of his life.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt;

===Posthumous publication===

For several years after his father's death, Christopher Tolkien compiled a ''Silmarillion'' narrative. Christopher's intentions seem to have been mostly to use the latest writings of his father's that he could,{{citation needed&lt;!--ME-fact--&gt;|date=November 2007}} and to keep as much internal consistency (and consistency with ''The Lord of the Rings'') as possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|UT|Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he admitted that a complete consistency was impossible.&lt;ref name="Silf" /&gt; As explained in ''The History of Middle-earth'', Christopher drew upon numerous sources for his narrative, relying on post-Lord of the Rings works where possible, but ultimately reaching back as far as the 1917 ''Book of Lost Tales'' to fill in portions of the narrative which his father had planned to write but never addressed. In one later chapter of ''Quenta Silmarillion'', "Of the Ruin of Doriath", which had not been touched since the early 1930s, he had to construct a narrative practically from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|WotJ|Part Three, Chapter V "The Tale of Years"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final result, which included genealogies, maps, an index, and the first-ever released Elvish word list, was published in 1977.
Because of Christopher's extensive explanations (in ''The History of Middle-earth'') of how he compiled the published work, much of ''The Silmarillion'' has been debated by readers. Christopher's task is generally accepted as very difficult given the state of his father's texts at the time of his death: some critical texts were no longer in the Tolkien family's possession, and Christopher's task compelled him to rush through much of the material. Christopher reveals in later volumes of ''The History of Middle-earth'' many divergent ideas which do not agree with the published version. Christopher Tolkien has suggested that, had he taken more time and had access to all the texts, he might have produced a substantially different work. But he was compelled by considerable pressure and demand from his father's readers and publishers to produce something publishable as quickly as possible{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.

In October 1996, Christopher Tolkien commissioned illustrator [[Ted Nasmith]] to create full-page full-colour artwork for the first illustrated edition of ''The Silmarillion''. It was published in 1998, and followed in 2004 by a second edition featuring corrections and additional artwork by Nasmith.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Christopher Tolkien published most of his father's Middle-earth writings as the 12-volume ''The History of Middle-earth'' series. In addition to the source material and earlier drafts of several portions of ''The Lord of the Rings'', these books greatly expand on the original material published in ''The Silmarillion'', and in many cases diverge from it. There is much that Tolkien intended to revise but only sketched out in notes, and some new texts surfaced after the publication of ''The Silmarillion''. These books also make it clear just how [[Unfinished work|unfinished]] the later parts of ''The Silmarillion'' really were: some parts were never rewritten after the early versions in ''Lost Tales''.

===Influences===
{{Main article|J. R. R. Tolkien's influences}}
''The Silmarillion'' is a complex work exhibiting the influence of many sources. A major influence was the [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]] epic ''[[Kalevala]]'', especially the tale of [[Kullervo]]. Influence from [[Greek mythology]] is also apparent. The island of [[Númenor]], for example, recalls [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#154, 227}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, Tolkien later described in a letter to Christopher Bretherton as merely a "curious chance".

Greek mythology also colours the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], who borrow many attributes from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="Olympian"&gt;{{Citation

Influence of the Bible and traditional Christian narrative are seen in ''The Silmarillion'' in the conflict between Melkor and Eru Ilúvatar, a parallel of the polarity of Lucifer and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Chance|2001|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, ''The Silmarillion'' tells of the creation and fall of the Elves, as ''Genesis'' tells of the creation and fall of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Medieval Christian cosmology shows its influence especially in the account of the creation of the universe as the manifestation of a sort of song sung by God with which the angels harmonize until the fallen angel introduces discord. St. Augustine's writings on music, as well as the extensive medieval tradition of the divine harmony—more familiar to us today in the notion of the "[[music of the spheres]]"—served as bases for this telling of creation.

[[Celtic mythology]] show its influence in the exile of the [[Noldor]]in Elves, for example, that borrow elements from the story of [[Irish legend]]s of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]].&lt;ref name="Celtic"&gt;Fimi, Dimitra (August 2006). {{"'}}Mad' Elves and 'Elusive Beauty': Some Celtic Strands of Tolkien's Mythology". ''Folklore'', '''117'''(2), 156–170 . {{JSTOR|30035484}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh influence is seen in the Elvish language [[Sindarin]], that Tolkien gave "a linguistic character very like (though not identical with) [[Welsh language|British-Welsh]] ... because it seems to fit the rather 'Celtic' type of legends and stories told of its speakers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
At the time of release, reviews of ''The Silmarillion'' were generally mixed to negative. ''The Silmarillion'' was criticized for being too serious, lacking the light-hearted moments that were found in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and especially ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{Citation

Robert M. Adams of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' called ''The Silmarillion'' "an empty and pompous bore", "not a literary event of any magnitude", and even claimed that the main reason for its "enormous sales" was the "Tolkien cult" created by the popularity of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', predicting that more people would buy ''The Silmarillion'' than would ever read it.&lt;ref name="NYRB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert M. "The Hobbit Habit". ''New York Review of Books'', 24 November 1977. Quoted in Johnson ''J.R.R. Tolkien: six decades of criticism'' (1986), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[School Library Journal]]'' called it "only a stillborn postscript" to Tolkien's earlier works.&lt;ref name="SLJ" /&gt; [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]] of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' even went so far as to say that "Tolkien can't actually write".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Nonetheless, a few reviewers praised the scope of Tolkien's creation. ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' acknowledged that "what is finally most moving is … the eccentric heroism of Tolkien's attempt".&lt;ref name="NYTBR" /&gt; ''TIME'' described ''The Silmarillion'' as "majestic, a work held so long and so powerfully in the writer's imagination that it overwhelms the reader".&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt; The ''[[Horn Book Magazine]]'' even lauded the "remarkable set of legends conceived with imaginative might and told in beautiful language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Influence in music==
*The Dutch [[progressive rock]] guitarist [[Jan Akkerman]] recorded a track called "The Silmarillion" on his 1977 album ''Meditation''.
*The British [[neo-progressive rock]] band [[Marillion]] were formed in Aylesbury, England, in 1979 as Silmarillion but shortened their name in 1981 to avoid any trademark conflict.
*The Austrian [[black metal]] band [[Summoning (band)|Summoning]] formed in 1993 and have also released numerous concept albums based on this and other works by Tolkien.
*The German [[power metal]] band [[Blind Guardian]] released ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'' in 1998, a [[concept album]] based upon ''The Silmarillion''. The album contains not only songs but also spoken passages narrating parts of the story.
*The German [[Drum &amp; Bass]] [[DJ]] [[Mathis Mootz]] released ''War of Sound'' in 2003, a [[glitch music|clicks n' cuts]] side project as m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which contains spoken word samples from an adaptation of ''The Silmarillion''.
*The Irish [[Celtic metal]] band [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]] released a song called the "Fall of Gondolin" on their 2004 album ''[[Pagan (album)|Pagan]]''.
*The Australian [[independent music|indie]] band [[The Middle East (band)|The Middle East]] incorporate many elements from ''The Silmarillion'' in their song "Beleriand" from their 2009 album ''[[The Recordings of the Middle East]]''.
*The Swedish a cappella group [[Riltons Vänner]] incorporates loose influences of ''The Silmarillion'' in the lyrics of their song "Folket från Eä" (English: "The people from Eä"), written by Peter Sydén, from their 2005 album ''Här är passion''.
*The Norwegian classical composer [[Martin Romberg]] has written three full-scale symphonic poems, Quendi (2008), Telperion et Laurelin (2014), and Fëanor (2017), inspired by passages from ''The Silmarillion''. The works were premiered by orchestras in [[Southern France]] between 2009 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/alpes-maritimes/nice/orchestre-philharmonique-nice-fete-ses-70-ans-1337143.html|title= Concert Review Orchestre Philharmonique de Nice 2017, Fëanor|publisher=France 3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orchestre-avignon.com/artistes/martin-romberg/|title= Martin Romberg at Orchestre régional Avignon-Provence|publisher=Orchestre régional Avignon-Provence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The South Bank Show''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] arts magazine show. It was originally produced by [[London Weekend Television]] and broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] between 1978 and 2010. A new version of the series began on [[Sky Arts]] from 27 May 2012.&lt;ref name="rt revival"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-02/sherlock-and-twenty-twelve-up-for-south-bank-awards|title=Sherlock and Twenty Twelve up for South Bank Awards|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceived, written and presented by former [[BBC]] arts broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg]], the show aims to bring both [[high art]] and [[popular culture]] to a mass audience.

==History==
===ITV (1978-2010)===
The programme was a replacement for ''[[Aquarius (UK TV series)|Aquarius]]'', the arts series which had been running since 1970. Presenter [[Melvyn Bragg]] was already well known for his arts broadcasting on BBC television, notably ''[[Monitor (UK TV series)|Monitor]]'' and [[BBC Two]]'s ''The Lively Arts''. It first aired on 14 January 1978, covering many subjects,  including  [[Germaine Greer]], [[Gerald Scarfe]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. It is the longest continuously running arts programme on UK television. From the beginning the series' intent was to mix high art and popular culture. This has remained, and the programme has always focused predominantly on art of the 20th and 21st centuries.

For much of its life, the show was produced by [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT) for the ITV network.

In May 2009, ITV announced that the show was to come to an end. Although it was originally reported that the show was ending due to Bragg's retirement,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/may/06/itv-the-south-bank-show-melvyn-bragg "ITV to axe The South Bank Show when Melvyn Bragg retires next year"], ''The Guardian'' (London), 6 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Bragg later made it clear that he decided to leave after they ended the show, and thought ending it was a mistake; according to him, "they've killed the show, so I thought, I'll go as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://living.scotsman.com/books/Interview-Melvyn-Bragg--Man.5640953.jp | title=Interview: Melvyn Bragg - Man out of time |date= 9 November 2009 | work=[[The Scotsman]] | author=Chitra Ramaswamy | accessdate=9 November 2009| quote='It did [shock me] a bit, especially from [ITV chairman] [[Michael Grade|Michael [Grade]]],' says Bragg before steeling himself.

On Monday 28 December 2009 the final edition of ''The South Bank Show'' was broadcast featuring [[The Royal Shakespeare Company]] as its subject. Melvyn Bragg announced on this programme, after the final South Bank Show Awards in January 2010, there would be a series of ten ''South Bank Show Revisited'' programmes transmitted in early 2010 featuring updates on previous ''South Bank Show'' subjects.

===Sky Arts (2012-present)===
At the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] awards show in January 2010, Lord Melvyn Bragg said he was baffled by ITV's decision to axe ''The South Bank Show'' after 30 years on air. Also at the awards show, [[Prince Charles]] said in a taped testimonial that it was the end of one of the most important beacons of arts in this country which this country was lucky enough to enjoy.

In July 2010, it was revealed that Bragg had bought the rights to the brand and had first right of access to ''The South Bank Show'' archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/19/south-bank-show-sky-arts | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Maggie | last=Brown | title=Lord Bragg takes South Bank Show to Sky Arts | date=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sky Arts]] broadcasts ''South Bank Show'' archive editions and hosted the [[South Bank Sky Arts Award]]s on 25 Jan 2011, presented by Melvyn Bragg, accompanied by a new arrangement of ''The South Bank Show'' theme.

[[Sky Arts]] revived ''The South Bank Show'' with a new series starting 27 May 2012.&lt;ref name="rt revival"/&gt;

==Theme music and visuals==
[[File:Hands of God and Adam.jpg|thumb|250px|The iconic image of the Hand of God giving life to Adam, used since the series' inception.]] 
The [[theme music]] is taken from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]'' composed in 1977 for his brother, the cellist [[Julian Lloyd Webber]]. This is based on the theme from [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]]'s "[[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|24th Caprice]]". The brand image of the programme is an animated version of a detail from [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] painting, specifically the image of the Hand of God giving life to [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]. It shows the two hands meeting, generating a [[lightning]] bolt.

== Podcast ==
From 18 September 2006, ITV have begun releasing a [[podcast]] of the interviews from the show, including extra material not included in the broadcast editions. There are plans to release past interviews as part of the podcast as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title       = ''The South Bank Show'' Podcast RSS |publisher   = [[itv.com]] |date        =  |url         = http://download.itv.com/southbankshow/podcast.xml |accessdate  = 21 May 2013 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100127143608/http://download.itv.com/southbankshow/podcast.xml |archivedate = 27 January 2010 |df          = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The programme has been awarded  more than 110 awards (including 12 [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTAs]], 5 [[Prix Italia]] and 4 [[Royal Television Society|RTS Award]]s). Pat Gavin's animated [[title sequence]]s have won two BAFTAs.

==Parodies==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
The comedy series ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' often parodied ''The South Bank Show''. It does this in a series of sketches called ''South Bank'', a cross between ''The South Bank Show'' and the American cartoon ''[[South Park]]'', set in the [[South Bank]] of London. In these sketches, Melvyn Bragg is [[Stan Marsh]], [[Alan Yentob]] is [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Mark Lawson]] is [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] is [[Kenny McCormick]].

A sketch in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]'' featured [[Vic Reeves]] as Melvyn Bragg (with felt-tip marks on his face) presenting a feature on fictional folk singers Mulligan and O'Hare. Reeves depicts Bragg as an unlikely ''[[The A-Team|A-Team]]'' obsessive.

[[Harry Enfield]]'s TV film ''[[Norbert Smith - a Life]]'' is a parody edition of ''The South Bank Show''.

[[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]]'s second series of ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' featured a reference to a fictional episode of ''The South Bank Show'' focused on madcap children's television presenters [[Dick and Dom]].

''[[Private Eye]]'' tends to parody Melvyn Bragg's name, and ''[[Spitting Image]]'' would rather accentuate his nasal accent.

[[Benny Hill]] once parodied Bragg in a 1978 episode of ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'' as Melvyn Dragg. The name of the show was also parodied, and it was called "The South Blank Show."

'''''ToryBoy The Movie''''' is a 2011 [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]-style British documentary feature film directed by and starring [[John Walsh (filmmaker)|John Walsh]]. It follows Walsh as he becomes a political candidate for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the north east England constituency of [[Middlesbrough]]. 

==Background==
A staunch [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporter all his life, Walsh had become disillusioned with the party. When [[David Cameron]] opened the door to allow non party members to run for the Conservative candidacy ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/5377839/David-Cameron-to-open-up-candidate-list-to-everyone.html|title=David Cameron to 'open up candidate list to everyone'|author=Chris Irvine|date=24 May 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Walsh decided to do just that and document his experiences on camera.&lt;ref name="Young People"&gt;[https://youngpeopleinpolitics.org.uk/inspiration/interviews/ John Walsh interview, Young People In Politics, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; He came third in the election; Stuart Bell remained the MP of Middlesbrough,&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-13960870|title=Tory Boy takes on Sir Stuart Bell in documentary film|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but increased the Conservative vote to its highest in thirty years with an 18.8% share of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/c92.stm|title=BBC News - Election 2010 - Constituency - Middlesbrough|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The film==
The film was based on the 72 hours of footage made by Walsh on the campaign trail.&lt;ref name="Young People"/&gt; It made the case that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Stuart Bell]] should not be the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) of [[Middlesbrough]], as Bell was absent so often from Middlesbrough that he is an unsuitable candidate. Walsh showed the finished film in a free showing a year after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723|title=Toryboy The Movie documentary up for award|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=5 August 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ''Who Can I vote For?'' website a humorous warning is given, "this film contains strong language throughout and scenes of politicians that some viewers may find offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/person/493/john-walsh|title=John Walsh for Member of Parliament for Middlesbrough in the 2010 General Election|website=Who Can I Vote For? by Democracy Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Amesbury]] appeared in the documentary protesting outside the Conservative conference in Manchester.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Walsh paid homage to the great title designer [[Saul Bass]] and recreated his angular animations to create a fresh approach to telling this story. “This map cap comedy best captured the visual style and the transition of the film was making from a serious expose of the political shenanigans in the North East, to a political satire.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewhitebalance.com/work/toryboy-the-movie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh said that he took a risk making this film in an article with Digital Journal "For something like this, an investigative film, there will be some who think that I have exceeded my brief as a candidate. I would say that it is right to look at injustice and in this country people have died so that we may all have the right to question those in authority and those in public office."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/11509&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' discussed the possible of the film forcing a new by election as a result of its findings. Walsh said he had been serious about becoming an MP and had self-funded his £15,000 election campaign. "When I got to Middlesbrough I found a town that politics had forgotten and a MP who was there in name only, a truly depressingly affair.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The film received positive reviews, with a high score of 8.8 on [[IMDb]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740117/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2011 the film was nominated for the [[Grierson Awards]] for "Best Documentary on a Contemporary Theme".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.griersontrust.org/grierson-awards/past-awards/2011/the-grierson-awards-2011-shortlist/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://lfs.org.uk/content/john-walshs-tory-boy-movie-shortlisted-grierson-awards&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Radio Times]]'' film review by Jeremy Aspinall on the film's re-release gave it four stars, and called it "A revealing and droll fly-on-the-wall documentary. It's a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations. Who would have thought politics could be so entertaining?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie|title=Toryboy the Movie|author=Jeremy Aspinall|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Details of the film's award nomination was covered by the Middlesbrough ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Irish Post]]'' Walsh’s “documentary about a rookie Conservative candidate aimed to provide an insight into British political culture, and in doing so uncovered the next big political scandal.” &lt;ref&gt;http://irishpost.co.uk/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Moss]], the [[BBC]]'s North East &amp; Cumbria Political editor, "some silliness aside, it is a thought-provoking insight into the way our political system works or doesn't work on the ground... But I'm not sure he quite nails down a case against Stuart Bell.. And John Walsh doesn't help his case with some of the content in the film."&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; [[Liberal Democratic Party|Liberal Democrat]] commentator Mark Pack wrote on his blog that "John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is. It is a hugely enjoyable documentary, which mixes humour, drama and education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markpack.org.uk/29694/toryboy-john-walsh-portrays-life-on-the-campaign-trail-as-it-really-is/|title=ToryBoy: John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is|date=1 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A screening at the [[Frontline Club]] took place on 22 November 2011 followed by a Q&amp;A with John Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineclub.com/toryboy_visits_the_frontline_club/|title=ToryBoy visits the Frontline Club|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire Magazine]]'' gave it three stars and called it a "shit stirring exposé of local politics that will make you cross".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=510147455692929&amp;set=pb.191458757561802.-2207520000.1384175778.&amp;type=3&amp;theater screenshot at Facebook] 20 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2017}} Samuel Scott from review site DVD Compare gave it a B- and wrote "I found this documentary very intriguing and very honest. John is a very likable character, and I wouldn't hesitate in voting for someone with so much passion for a second."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3637 DVD Compare] 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Doc Geeks commented that the film was "a blunt exposé combined with a tinge of lightheartedness. Satirical animation cleverly frames Britain in its political context".&lt;ref&gt;[http://docgeeks.com/2011/11/14/review-toryboy-the-movie/ Doc Geeks] November 14th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, novelist [[Christopher Fowler]] wrote that ''ToryBoy The Movie'' was "a snapshot of our country’s political apathy in microcosm. It’s heartbreaking to see people blindly supporting their own demise as if they’re playing some kind of long game they’ll probably never live to see the outcome of. Oh, and it’s also very funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christopherfowler.co.uk/blog/2011/12/02/review-toryboy/|title=Re:View – ‘Toryboy’ - Christopher Fowler|website=www.christopherfowler.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the DVD was released Ben Kamal interviewed Walsh for the Aberdeen student newspaper ''[[Gaudie]]'', and wrote "I was prepared for some careful sneering in the interview and subsequent write-up. This did not (and could not) transpire: firstly because of the film, which comes across as [[Frank Capra]] scripted by [[Evelyn Waugh]]; secondly because of Walsh himself. He is warm, patient and generous, to my own shock I liked him and if you watch the film you'll like him too."&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/gaudie/docs/feb_25] 25 February 2014, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; "Dave", a reviewer at the website 60 Minutes With, wrote "''ToryBoy the Movie'' is a fantastic documentary and one in which you will be cheering for John despite what political party you follow. His journey from his Labour roots through to a Tory campaign is superbly documented and will have you both laughing and feeling his frustration in equal measure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://60minuteswith.co.uk/reviews/review-toryboy-movie/ 60 Minutes With], 15 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' article by Lucy Richardson she reveals that “at the pre-election hustings, where Sir Stuart does not make an appearance, he tells voters that he will have Sir Stuart jailed before Christmas if elected.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/9120025.Jolt_from_the_blue/&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the film release, Lord [[Michael Ashcroft]] wrote on his blog: "I’d defy anyone with an interest in politics not to enjoy this film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2012/05/lord-ashcroft-two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-ge.html|title=Lord Ashcroft: Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that "despite the zany tone of the film, it also has a hard-hitting message which questions whether one MP in his safe seat, and perhaps other MPs in similar situations, do enough to justify their salary and expenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordashcroft.com/2012/05/two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-general-election/|title=Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election - Lord Ashcroft|date=6 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 the political Guido Fawkes website also known as Order Order, ran an article entitled “Inside The Greatest Election Scandal of All Time” says that Walsh “lifted the lid on the real-life world of political campaigning.”&lt;ref&gt;https://order-order.com/2017/04/28/inside-greatest-election-scandal-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Mangazine]]’s Joe Zadeh’s article suggests a link between how Labour in Middlesbrough lost the votes of blue collar people and its shift to the right. He cited ToryBoy The Movie as an example of this shift.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev445j/how-labour-lost-the-working-class&lt;/ref&gt;

In a podcast interview with BritFlicks Walsh talks about ToryBoy and the difficulties in making the film and also his plans to develop lost [[Ray Harryhausen]] film projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://britflicks.com/blog.aspx?blogid=24084&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2018/01/01/interview-john-walsh-tory-boy-the-movie-ray-harryhausen-podcast/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Although not explicitly inspired by the film, Neil Macfarlane, in a report for local newspaper''[[Teesside Gazette]]'', asked "Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?" when he failed to answer over 100 telephone calls made to his constituency office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/teessiders-getting-enough-sir-stuart-3693031|title=Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=6 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' story was picked up by national newspapers. ''[[The Independent]]'' asked "is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/no-surgeries-for-14-years--is-sir-stuart-bell-britains-laziest-mp-2350953.html No surgeries for 14 years - is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?], ''Independent'', 7 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;Richard Moss [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14847291 Middlesbrough MP Sir Stuart Bell fights laziest MP tag], BBC, 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guardian'' fact-checked the "laziest MP" claim and found that the laziest MP was [[Roger Godsiff]] but the report did confirm that Sir Stuart Bell did not maintain the pivotal role for a MP, an office in their constituency. &lt;ref name="reality check"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/08/reality-check-britain-s-laziest-mp|title=Reality check: Who are Britain's laziest parliamentarians?|author=Polly Curtis|work=the Guardian|date=8 September 2011}}: "Bell has been an MP for nearly 30 years and has had a distinguished career in parliament as a frontbench spokesman on trade and industry in opposition and the spokesman for the Church of England in the House of Commons and member of the House of Commons commission until last year.

One measure of their parliamentary work is the proportion of votes they turn up to."&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party said it would be totally unacceptable if constituents had been unable to contact their MP. [[Ed Miliband]] and the Labour Party expect the highest standards from Labour representatives. It is totally unacceptable if the public cannot reach their MP.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/labour-launches-probe-middlesbrough-mp-3693109|title=Labour launches probe into Middlesbrough MP|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=8 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sir Stuart Bell did have a right of reply, which appeared in the short film ''ToryBoy The AfterMath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2014/05/john-walsh-toryboy-the-aftermath-or-the-town-that-politics-forgot.html|title=John Walsh: ToryBoy – the aftermath (or: the Town That Politics Forgot…)|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's expose nearly forced a By Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/|title=Documentary 'could force by-election'|work=The Northern Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's re-release in 2015 caused more controversy after a showing in Middlesbrough by [[Teesside University]] was cancelled to avoid breaching union rules on political neutrality in the run up to the general election. According to Walsh's interview with ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-408518499/director-upset-as-toryboy-film-screening-cancelled&lt;/ref&gt; the film was booked in by the Student Union, but at the last minute the screening was halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2015/04/john-walsh-toryboy-the-move-banned-in-middlesbrough.html|title=ToryBoy The Movie – banned in Middlesbrough|author=John Walsh|work=Conservative Home|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Brown [http://mmj.tees.ac.uk/~project22/index5d95.html?p=863 Student Union involved in row over planned screening of controversial Toryboy the Movie], ''[[The North Crowd]]'' 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it's a shame really," said Walsh.

==Re-releases==
The film received a re-release in cinemas in 2015 in the lead up to the [[2015 UK General Election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishpost.co.uk/entertainment/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election|title=Satirical film ToryBoy The Movie returns to big screen|work=The Irish Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/11807584.BAFTA_nominated_Greenwich_filmmaker_s_controversial_ToryBoy_returns_to_cinemas_before_election/|title=BAFTA-nominated Greenwich filmmaker's controversial ToryBoy returns to cinemas before election|work=News Shopper}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Community cinema screenings were given and included a Q&amp;A from Walsh. &lt;ref&gt;http://hithergreencinema.com/2014/05/a-little-bit-of-politics-tory-boy-the-movie-plus-director-john-walsh-and-qa-with-your-local-candidates/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soundtrack ==
The film used older film ques from films across the last six decades to create a unique soundscape. ''[[Radio Times]]'' described it as "a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations and music from films like ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie/|title=Toryboy the Movie – review - cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5692">A '''tour manager''' (or '''concert tour manager''') is the person who helps to organize the administration for a schedule of appearances of a [[musical ensemble|musical group (band) or artist]] at a sequence of [[Music venue|venue]]s (a [[concert tour]]). In general, [[road manager]]s handle small to medium-sized tours, and tour managers are used on large-scale tours.

The performances on a concert tour are booked by the act’s [[Talent agent#Music agents|booking agent]], who works with [[Promoter (entertainment)|concert promoters]] to place the act in suitable venues and [[Music festival|festivals]] in a time frame and territory agreed with the act’s [[Talent manager|management]]. Individual concert promoters negotiate the financial, technical and hospitality requirements of the artist  and make an offer to the booking agent for the show. The tour is announced and tickets put on sale when agreement is reached on the tour dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddell|last2=Barnet|last3=Berry|title=This Business of Concert Promotion and Touring: A Practical Guide to Creating, Selling, Organizing, and Staging Concerts|publisher=Billboard Books|location=New York|year=2007|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As modern concert touring involves complex financial, legal and technical arrangements, the booking agent or artist manager hire a concert tour manager to organize the logistics. Concert tour managers are usually [[freelancer]]s working on a tour-by-tour basis.

==Duties==

The tour manager is given the itinerary for the tour by the booking agent. Working from this itinerary, the tour manager handles the following activities.

===Financial===
The itinerary includes information about the potential ticket income (fees) for each show. Using this information the tour manager can produce a budget for the tour, calculating costs for crew wages, [[per diem]]s, accommodation, transport, sound, lighting and video equipment, visas and work permits, rehearsals and other expenses such as booking agent commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|title=The Tour Book|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston|year=2007|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weekly reports are submitted to the business manager. Tour manager are on financial stabilities due to them being ahead of the whole tour.

===Advancing===
Advancing is the process of contacting each promoter and venue to ensure the entire [[Rider (theater)|artist's technical and hospitality demands]] (the ''rider'') are met and to resolve any problems the promoter or venue can foresee. The artist's rider covers catering, production (sound, lights, stagehands needed), security, general show, and legal issues. During the advancing process the tour manager checks contact names and addresses, arrival times, equipment load-in times, sound check and performance times, any supporting/opening acts, and live music curfews.

This information is collated into a "tour book" which is issued to the band and crew.

===On the road===
The tour manager travels with the band on the tour. The job on the road varies depending on the type and success level of the act. A tour manager's day-to-day workload can include:&lt;ref&gt;One for the Road: How to Be a Music Tour Manager by Mark Workman&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joan Jonas Vertical Roll.jpg|thumb|Still from ''Vertical Roll'']]
'''''Vertical Roll''''' is a 1972 [[video art]] piece by American video and [[performance art|performance]] artist [[Joan Jonas]]. It is a sequel to Jonas' first video work ''Organic Honey's Visual Telepathy''. Jonas' interfacing with the material grammar of video was significant to the late 1960s and early 1970s experimentation with new video technology. Among others, [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], [[Nam June Paik]] and [[Peter Campus]] also contributed to the emergent material discourse of video art.

==The video==
Shot in [[Ace Gallery]] Los Angeles, Vertical Roll features Jonas performing a series of actions under her [[alter-ego]] ''Organic Honey'', the [[belly dancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.utah.edu/~klm6/3905/vertical_roll.html "Joan Jonas: Vertical Roll"], The University of Utah, Accessed 04-26-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The video was shot during one of the rehearsals for Jonas' ''Organic Honey'' performance, and while it is mostly based off the structure of a vertical roll it does contain some images from ''Visual Telepathy''.&lt;ref name=five10&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finklepearl|first1=Tom|last2=Jonas|first2=Joan|title=Joan Jonas:five works|date=2003|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|location=Queens Museum of Art|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Jonas the video offered a new means to approach perception and offer "multiple and simultaneous points of view".&lt;ref name=five10/&gt; Vertical Roll provided Jonas a means to explore the disjunction between performance and a recording of that performance. She places a heavy emphasis on time, and both physical and mental space in her explanation of the work.

===The Vertical Roll===
''Vertical Roll'' combines both video and the performance space. As an installation alongside the ''Organic Honey'' performance it makes use of both live action and recorded video.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Hanhardt, "From Screen to Gallery: Cinema, Video and Installation Art Practices" in "American Art" Vol 22, No. 2., (The University of Chicago Press, Summer 2008), Accessed 27-04-2015&lt;/ref&gt; The performance, on and off camera, plays on the disjunction between the two modes of presentation. Jonas' intentional mediation of "the monitor's receiving and transmitting frequencies"&lt;ref name=Crimp9/&gt; causes the image being displayed to repeatedly travel vertically from the bottom of the screen to the top resulting in the "[[synch roll|vertical roll]]" for which the piece is titled. The vertical roll, in and of itself, is one "of the primary technical features of video".&lt;ref name=Crimp130&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crimp|first1=Douglas|title=Sloan Jonas: Scripts and Descriptions|date=1982|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|page=130|chapter=De-Synchronization in Joan Jonas's Performances'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonas' manipulation of the vertical hold function on a CRT monitor to mimic the vertical movement of film through a projector, placing the piece in clear dialog with the cinematic tradition.&lt;ref name="Martin Kremer 2004 p. 10-19"&gt;Martin Kremer, "Get rid of the Knots" in ''Afterall: A Journal of Art, Context, and Enquiry'', Issue 9 (Spring/Summer 2004), The University of Chicago Press on behalf of Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, University of the Arts London, p. 10-19&lt;/ref&gt; This dialog is seen in Jonas' technical handling of the video in which video "shifts have to become registered either by camera movement... or by cutting".&lt;ref name=Krauss&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krauss|first1=Rosalind|title=Video: The Aesthetics of Narcissism|journal=October|date=1976|issue=1|pages=60–61|doi=10.2307/778507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cast as an “electronic erotic seductress,” the multiple costumes and roles performed by Jonas critically examine the ever-changing, but consistently unequal roles of women. The ''Organic Honey'' videos showcased Jonas' early exploration into "the narcissistic qualities of video"&lt;ref&gt;Tom Finklepearl, Joan Jonas, ''Joan Jonas: Five Works'' eds. Warren Niesluchowski, Valerie Smith (New York: Queens Museum of Art, 2003), p. 6, Accessed 27-04-2015&lt;/ref&gt; and would later provide the foundation for proceeding video works. The camera [[gaze]]s at Jonas, [[Feminist film theory#the gaze and female spectatorship|implicating]] the viewer in the work and further, with her body. Jonas presents her collection of images through multiple perspectives that are dependent "in terms of the camera's distance and its orientation to horizontal ground".&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; The de-synchronization of the monitor's receiving and transmitting frequencies results in the constant wiping away of the images on screen which renders the images recognizable but gives them the illusion of being invisible. The illusion created is perceptual. it is "one of a continuous dissolve through time and space".&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; ''Vertical Roll'' introduces the paradigm of the body existing in a space between the video and the monitor. The monitor becomes a metaphorical stand-in for the reel and this metaphor is only further enhanced through the continuous action of the vertical roll which references the "physical reality of the tape deck".&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; Creating a sense of fragmentation, the vertical roll relentlessly pounds at the images of the artist as she moves through a series of performed identities. Characterized a "disjunctive self portrait" by the [[Electronic Arts Intermix]], the image content of the work is strongly mediated by the mirror-like function of the camera, scrutinized by the lens and subjected to violence by the vertical roll.&lt;ref&gt;"Vertical Roll" Electronic Arts Intermix, 2013. http://www.eai.org/title.htm?id=2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===De-synchronization===
The disparity between the video monitor, the repeating percussive sound, and the on-screen image are examples of the use of de-synchronization as a conceptual tool for revealing the contingency of [[Sensory analysis#Perception|perceptual]] experience. This disparity relies on the instability of Jonas' images juxtaposed with their cementation as visible through the use of the video medium.&lt;ref name=Crimp9&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crimp|first1=Douglas|title=Sloan Jonas: Scripts and Descriptions|date=1982|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|page=9|chapter=De-Synchronization in Joan Jonas's Performances'}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the perceptual confusions created in Jonas' ''Vertical Roll'' can be seen in the sequence where "Jonas bangs a spoon against a mirror, creating the illusions of a relationship between the sounds and the image disturbance".&lt;ref name=Crimp130/&gt; Jonas matches action and sound to the timing of the vertical roll &lt;ref name="Video is Being Invented"&gt;Bruce Kurtz, [http://vasulka.org/archive/Writings/VidBeingInvented.pdf "Video is Being Invented"] in "Arts Magazine" (1973), p. 41,Accessed 27-04-2015&lt;/ref&gt; which creates the idea of simultaneous occurrences in the video.

Temporality is made a part of ''Vertical Roll'' through the disjunctive nature of the video, and this sense of time is "understood as propulsion towards an end."&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; Time is visualized through a constant wiping away of the image. Through de-synchronization, the artist posed a challenge to the supposed [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of experience from the senses, potentially uncovering pretenses or dispositions that inform the processing of sensory data.&lt;ref name=Crimp9/&gt; The images on screen seem to decompose in their constant scanning from the bottom to the top of the screen.&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; Jonas further enhances the effects of de-synchronization through her movements which are "choreographed in relation to the action of the vertical roll."&lt;ref name=Crimp9/&gt;

Jonas explores the notion of the frame extensively in ''Vertical Roll'' as an expression of “standing one’s ground against external forces.” &lt;ref name="Martin Kremer 2004 p. 10-19"/&gt; By recording  a CRT playing back video, Jonas creates a frame within a frame, and then creating the image that the frame is collapsing in on itself every half second or so by adjusting the vertical roll on the monitor. While visually excluding the outside world nearly the entire piece, sounds accompanying the crashing frame dictate some kind of external operator attempting to beat along with the CRT’s image, expanding the scope of the piece beyond the video. In the concluding moments of her video Jonas breaks the frame entirely when she inserts her head in between the camera and the monitor, entering from the outer edge of the frame, destroying the symbolic wall the camera creates and adding another level of spatial fragmentation and self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Artists' Video: An International Guide|last = Zippay|first = Lori|publisher = Electronic Arts Intermix|year = 1991|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of Jonas' head is an act of agency independent of the vertical roll. It renders the vertical roll visible and reveals the space of the video to the viewer,&lt;ref name=Crimp130/&gt; shattering its perceptual illusion. The disjunction caused by the concluding moments of this video highlights the implications of video presented, or displayed, in the space of the monitor.&lt;ref name="Video is Being Invented"/&gt;

Jonas claims that Vertical Roll finds a likeness to [[The Garden of Forking Paths]] a work by [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref name=five10/&gt;
