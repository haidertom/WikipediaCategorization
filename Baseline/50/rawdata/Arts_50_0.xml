'''Aesthetics''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|s|ˈ|θ|ɛ|t|ɪ|k|s|,_|i:|s|-}}) is a branch of [[philosophy]] that explores the nature of [[art]], [[beauty]], and [[taste (sociology)|taste]], with the creation and appreciation of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Aesthetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its more technical [[Epistemology|epistemological]] perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and [[senses|sensori-emotional values]], sometimes called [[judgement|judgment]]s of [[Feeling|sentiment]] and taste.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Nick. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ Aesthetic Judgment]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 02-28-2003/10-22-2007. Retrieved 07-24-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetics studies how artists imagine, create and perform works of art; how people use, enjoy, and criticize art; and what happens in their minds when they look at paintings, listen to music, or read poetry, and understand what they see and hear. It also studies how they feel about art—why they like some works and not others, and how art can affect their moods, beliefs, and attitude toward life.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "Aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as "critical reflection on art, culture and [[nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1998) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/adx.18.2.27949030|title =  Review of ''ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AESTHETICS 4 vol.''

==Etymology==
The word ''aesthetic'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang |grc|αἰσθητικός}} (''aisthetikos'', meaning "esthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception"), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι (''aisthanomai'', meaning "I perceive, feel, sense" and related to {{lang |grc|αἴσθησις}} (''aisthēsis'', "sensation").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD |aesthetic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "aesthetics" was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the German philosopher [[Alexander Baumgarten]] in his dissertation ''Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus'' ("Philosophical considerations of some matters pertaining the poem") in 1735;&lt;ref name= "Guyer 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last = Guyer |first =Paul |title= Values of Beauty: Historical Essays in Aesthetics |date= 13 June 2005 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-60669-1 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Bje-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Baumgarten chose "aesthetics" because he wished to emphasize the experience of art as a means of knowing. Aesthetics, a not very tidy intellectual discipline, is a heterogeneous collection of problems that concern the arts primarily but also relate to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = George | last = T. Dickie | title = aesthetics | work = Encyclopedia Americana | volume = 1 | editor1-first = Barbara | editor1-last = Letta Cole | editor2 = et. al. | place = Danbury | publisher = Grolier | year = 1993 | page = 234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; even though his later definition in the fragment ''Aesthetica'' (1750) is more often referred to as the first definition of modern aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = N | last = Wilson | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8pXhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 | title = Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece | page = 20 | publisher = Routledge | date = 31 Oct 2013 | ISBN = 1-136-78800-X | accessdate = 2015-05-12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics and the philosophy of art==
{{quotation|Aesthetics is for the artist as [[Ornithology]] is for the birds.|[[Barnett Newman]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php Barnett Newman Foundation, Chronology, 1952] Retrieved 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art'', By Arthur Coleman Danto, p.1, Published by Open Court Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8126-9540-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8126-9540-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For some, aesthetics is considered a synonym for the philosophy of art since [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields. In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an [[art object]]), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an [[work of art|art work]].

Philosophical aesthetics has not only to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but also has to give a [[definition]] of what art is. Art is an [[autonomous]] entity for philosophy, because art deals with the [[senses]] (i. e. the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose. Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics: art as [[knowledge]] or art as action, but aesthetics is neither [[epistemology]] nor ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert]], ''Introduction to Aesthetics'' (''Einführung in die Ästhetik''), Munich, Wilhelm Fink, 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aestheticians compare historical developments with theoretical approaches to the arts of many periods. They study the varieties of art in relation to their physical, social, and culture environments. Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic judgment, universals and ethics==

===Aesthetic judgment&lt;!--'Aesthetic judgment' redirects here--&gt;===

Aesthetics examines our [[Bloom's taxonomy#The affective domain (emotion-based)|affective domain]] response to an object or phenomenon Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. However, '''aesthetic judgments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; usually go beyond sensory discrimination.

For [[David Hume]], delicacy of taste is not merely "the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition", but also our sensitivity "to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''Essays Moral, Political, Literary'', Indianapolis: Literary Fund, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for [[pleasure]].

For [[Immanuel Kant]]  (''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', 1790), "enjoyment" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but [[The Critique of Judgment|judging something]] to be "beautiful" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once. Kant (1790) observed of a man "If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to ''me''," because "Everyone has his own ([[sense]] of) [[taste]]". The case of "beauty" is different from mere "agreeableness" because, "If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things." [[Roger Scruton]] has argued similarly.

Viewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to [[mass culture]]. Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1984). Distinction. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-674-21277-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=|accessdate=|last = Zangwill|first = Nick|work = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date = 26 August 2014|editor-last = Zalta|editor-first = Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation. However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Władysław|last = Tatarkiewicz|title = A History of Six Ideas: an essay in aesthetics |date = 1980|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/A_history_of_six_ideas.html?id=eD4qAQAAMAAJ|publisher=PWN/Polish Scientific Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Factors involved in aesthetic judgment====
[[File:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|thumb|[[Rainbow]]s often have aesthetic appeal.]]

Judgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in [[instinct]]ual ways to [[facial expression]]s, and even behaviours like the [[gag reflex]]. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither [[soup]] nor [[beard]]s are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. For example, the [[awe]] inspired by a [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] landscape might physically manifest with an increased heart-rate or pupil dilation; physiological reaction may express or even cause the initial awe. As seen, emotions are conformed to 'cultural' reactions, therefore aesthetics is always characterized by 'regional responses', as Francis Grose was the first to affirm in his ‘Rules for Drawing Caricaturas: With an Essay on Comic Painting’ (1788), published in W. Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty, Bagster, London s.d. (1791? [1753]), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–24. Grose can therefore be claimed to be the first critical 'aesthetic regionalist' in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics in contrast to the perilous and always resurgent dictatorship of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Yvonne|last = Bezrucka|title = The Invention of Northern Aesthetics in 18th-Century English Literature |date = 2017|url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/the-invention-of-northern-aesthetics-in-18th-century-english-literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. [[Victorian Era|Victorians]] in Britain often saw [[African sculpture]] as ugly, but just a few decades later, [[Edwardian Era|Edwardian]] audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to [[Human sexuality|sexual]] desirability. Thus, judgments of [[Architectural design values|aesthetic value]] can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or [[morality|moral]] value.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and [[Industrial design]]: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a current context, one might judge a [[Lamborghini]] to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last = Korsmeyer |editor-first = Carolyn |title =Aesthetics: The Big Questions|date = 1998|publisher =Wiley-Blackwell |isbn = 978-0631205944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that [[free will|will]] and [[Desire (emotion)|desire]] were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet [[preference]] and [[choice]] have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers. The point is already made by [[David Hume|Hume]], but see Mary Mothersill, "Beauty and the Critic's Judgment", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.

A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. For instance, the source of a painting's beauty has a different character to that of beautiful music, suggesting their aesthetics differ in kind.&lt;ref&gt;Consider Clement Greenberg's arguments in "On Modernist Painting" (1961), reprinted in Aesthetics: A Reader in Philosophy of Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinct inability of language to express aesthetic judgment and the role of [[Social constructionism|Social construction]] further cloud this issue.

===Aesthetic universals===
The philosopher [[Denis Dutton]] identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton]]'s ''Aesthetic Universals'' summarized by [[Steven Pinker]] in ''[[The Blank Slate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

# Expertise or virtuosity. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.
# Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.
# [[Style (visual arts)|Style]]. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.
# Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.
# Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
# Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.

Artists such as Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist [[Thomas Hirschhorn]] deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. "Rules of composition" that might be read into [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' or [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4′33″]]'' do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realization). Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea "art" itself) were non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art''. (Amsterdam: Rodopi. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic ethics===
Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1932)'Ethics', with James Tufts. In: '' The Collected Works of John Dewey, 1882–1953 '' Edited Jo-Ann Boydston: Carbonsdale: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being "fair"—the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoagepub.com/products/content/p478d75b79b1ea.php Peace Education - Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations] infoagepub.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/|title=Peace Education : Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations|first=Page, James|last=S.|date=22 October 2017|website=eprints.qut.edu.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for [[peace education]].

==New Criticism and ''The Intentional Fallacy''==
During the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.  For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B., et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaut|first1=Berys|last2=  Livingston|first2 = Paisley|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7r27dci51FcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title =The Creation of Art| page = 3|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date =2003|isbn = 9780521812344}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from [[Formalism (art)|formalists]] stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==Derivative forms of aesthetics==
A large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.

===Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis===
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|left|Example of the [[Dada]] aesthetic, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Fountain'' 1917]]

Early-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, [[Eli Siegel]], American philosopher and poet, founded [[Aesthetic Realism]], the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green |first=Edward |title=Donald Francis Tovey, Aesthetic Realism and the Need for a Philosophic Musicology |publisher=International Revue of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music |year= 2005 |page= 227 |jstor=30032170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel |first= Eli |title=Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites? |publisher=''Journal of Aesthetics &amp; Art Criticism |year= 1955 |jstor=425879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various attempts have been made to define [[Post-Modern]] Aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify "beauty" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the [[Rococo]].

[[Benedetto Croce|Croce]] suggested that "expression" is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Aesthetic Attitude|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aesth-at/|last = King|first = Alexandra|work = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshall McLuhan]] suggested that art always functions as a "counter-environment" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosswiler|first1=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|isbn=978-1-4331-1067-2|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I19crS0qJ78C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=mcluhan+on+art+as+counter-environment#v=onepage&amp;q=mcluhan%20on%20art%20as%20counter-environment&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Adorno]] felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]] attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in ''The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture''. [[Arthur Danto]] has described this reaction as "kalliphobia" (after the Greek word for beauty, κάλλος ''kallos'').&lt;ref&gt;'Kalliphobia in Contemporary Art' in ''Art Journal'' v. 63 no. 2 (Summer 2004) p.&amp;nbsp;24–35&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Malraux]] explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later). The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Massumi]] suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]].&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, Brian, (ed.), A Shock to Thought. Expression after Deleuze and Guattari. London &amp; NY: Routeledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-23804-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter Benjamin echoed Malraux in believing aesthetics was a comparatively recent invention, a view proven wrong in the late 1970s, when Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory. [[Denis Dutton]] in "The Art Instinct" also proposed that an aesthetic sense was a vital evolutionary factor.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] re-invokes the Kantian distinction between [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. Sublime painting, unlike [[kitsch]] [[realism (visual arts)|realism]], "...&amp;nbsp;will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''What is Postmodernism?'', in ''The Postmodern Condition'', Minnesota and Manchester, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''Scriptures: Diffracted Traces'', in Theory, Culture and Society, Volume 21, Number 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] inaugurated aesthetical thinking in [[Psychoanalysis]] mainly via the "Uncanny" as aesthetical affect.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, "The Uncanny" (1919). Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Work of Sigmund Freud, 17:234-36. London: The Hogarth Press&lt;/ref&gt; Following Freud and [[Merleau-Ponty]],&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice (1964), "The Visible and the Invisible". Northwestern University Press. {{ISBN|0-8101-0457-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]] theorized aesthetics in terms of sublimation and the Thing.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis (The Seminar of Jacques Lacan Book VII), NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation of [[Marxist aesthetics]] to post-modern aesthetics is still a contentious area of debate.

===Recent aesthetics===
[[Guy Sircello]] has pioneered efforts in analytic philosophy to develop a rigorous theory of aesthetics, focusing on the concepts of beauty,&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''A New Theory of Beauty''. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; love&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''Love and Beauty''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and sublimity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], "How Is a Theory of the Sublime Possible?" ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism''
Vol. 51, No. 4 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 541–550&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to romantic theorists Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis.

British philosopher and theorist of [[conceptual art]] aesthetics, [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]], makes the point that "'[[post-conceptual art]]' aesthetic does not concern a particular type of [[contemporary art]] so much as the historical-[[ontological]] condition for the production of contemporary art in general&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All: Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 3 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne noted that [http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf contemporary art is 'post-conceptual] in a public lecture delivered in 2010.

Gary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of alienation, and [[Louis Althusser]]'s antihumanism, using elements of Freud's group psychology, defining a concept of the 'aesthetic level of practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Tedman, G. (2012) ''Aesthetics &amp; Alienation'', Zero Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregory Loewen]] has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object. The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual's identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life. As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Loewen]], Aesthetic Subjectivity, 2011 pages&amp;nbsp;36–7, 157, 238)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and science===
[[File:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|thumb|The [[Mandelbrot set]] with continuously coloured environment]]

The field of [[experimental aesthetics]] was founded by [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] in the 19th century. Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]-based, [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] approach. The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on [[experiment|experimental methods]] is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art,&lt;ref&gt;Kobbert, M. (1986), ''Kunstpsychologie'' ("Psychology of art"), Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt&lt;/ref&gt; music, or modern items such as websites&lt;ref&gt;Thielsch, M. T. (2008), ''Ästhetik von Websites. Wahrnehmung von Ästhetik und deren Beziehung zu Inhalt, Usability und Persönlichkeitsmerkmalen.'' ("The aesthetics of websites. Perception of aesthetics and its relation to content, usability, and personality traits."), MV Wissenschaft, Münster&lt;/ref&gt; or other IT products&lt;ref&gt;Hassenzahl, M. (2008), ''Aesthetics in interactive products: Correlates and consequences of beauty''. In H. N. J. Schifferstein &amp; P. Hekkert (Eds.): ''Product Experience.'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;287–302). Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; is studied. Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the [[natural science]]s. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] or [[neuroscience]] ([[neuroaesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (2007), ''Recent trends in the psychological study of aesthetics, creativity, and the arts''. In ''Empirical Studies of the Arts'', 25(2), p.&amp;nbsp;121–141.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. (Aesthetics as [[information processing]]). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, {{ISBN|3-211-81216-4}}, {{ISBN|978-3-211-81216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] described an [[algorithm]]ic theory of beauty which takes the [[subjectivity]] of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer's previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1576418|title=Low-Complexity Art|first=Jürgen|last=Schmidhuber|date=22 October 1997|publisher=|journal=Leonardo|volume=30|issue=2|pages=97–103|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/1576418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html|title=THEORY OF BEAUTY - FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS - LOW-COMPLEXITY ART|website=www.idsia.ch|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely related to the principles of [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[minimum description length]]. One of his examples: [[mathematician]]s enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their [[formal language]]. Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few [[bit]]s of information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Jürgen Schmidhuber|first =Jürgen |last= Schmidhuber |title = Facial beauty and fractal geometry|website = Cogprint Archive|url =http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130215106/http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |archivedate=30 November 2012 |date = 7 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]]. Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity &amp; Creativity. Proc. 10th Intl. Conf. on Discovery Science (DS 2007) p.&amp;nbsp;26–38, LNAI 4755, Springer, 2007. Also in Proc. 18th Intl. Conf. on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2007) p. 32, LNAI 4754, Springer, 2007. Joint invited lecture for DS 2007 and ALT 2007, Sendai, Japan, 2007. {{arxiv|0709.0674}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing inspiration from less detailed 15th century proportion studies by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's [[Beauty|beautiful]] and what's [[interesting]], stating that interestingness corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty. Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive [[artificial neural network]]; see also [[Neuroesthetics]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary [[interest (emotion)|interest]]ingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward. A [[reinforcement learning]] algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional [[interesting]] input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of [[Artificial intelligence|artificial]] [[curiosity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]].

===Truth in beauty and mathematics===
Mathematical considerations, such as [[symmetry]] and [[complexity]], are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics. This is different from the aesthetic considerations of [[applied aesthetics]] used in the study of [[mathematical beauty]]. Aesthetic considerations such as [[symmetry]] and [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] are used in areas of philosophy, such as [[Categorical imperative|ethics]] and [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] to [[define]] [[truth]], outside of [[empirical]] considerations. Beauty and [[Truth]] have been argued to be nearly synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry, [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as reflected in the statement "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" in the poem [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]], or by the Hindu motto "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)). The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by [[processing fluency]], which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, [[Norbert Schwarz|Schwarz, N]], Winkielman, P: "Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience?", ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 8(4):364-382&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, Brun, M, Mitterndorfer, K: "The use of heuristics in intuitive mathematical judgment", ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review'', 15(6):1174–1178&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientists including the mathematician [[David Orrell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order  |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-300-18661-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and physicist [[Marcelo Gleiser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gleiser|first=Marcelo |title=A Tear at the Edge of Creation: A Radical New Vision for Life in an Imperfect Universe |publisher=Free Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4391-0832-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the emphasis on aesthetic criteria such as symmetry is equally capable of leading scientists astray.

===Computational approaches===
In 1928, the mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]] created an aesthetic measure ''M = O/C'' as the ratio of order to complexity.&lt;ref name="Akiba2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akiba|first1=Fuminori|title=Preface: Natural Computing and Computational Aesthetics|journal=Natural Computing and Beyond|volume=6|date=2013|pages=117–118|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-54394-7_10|series=Proceedings in Information and Communications Technology|isbn=978-4-431-54393-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=R. |last1=Datta |first2=D. |last2=Joshi |first3=J. |last3=Li |first4=J. |last4=Wang |title=Studying aesthetics in photographic images using a computational approach |booktitle=Europ.

The Acquine engine, developed at [[Penn State University]], rates natural photographs uploaded by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acquine.alipr.com |title=Aesthetic Quality Inference Engine - Instant Impersonal Assessment of Photos |publisher=Penn State University |accessdate=21 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090509101935/http://acquine.alipr.com/| archivedate= 9 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been relatively successful attempts with regard to chess{{explain|date=October 2018}} and music.&lt;ref&gt;Manaris, B., Roos, P., Penousal, M., Krehbiel, D., Pellicoro, L. and Romero, J.; A Corpus-Based Hybrid Approach to Music Analysis and Composition; Proceedings of 22nd Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-07); Vancouver, BC; 839-845 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A relation between [[Max Bense]]'s mathematical formulation of aesthetics in terms of "redundancy" and "complexity" and theories of musical anticipation was offered using the notion of Information Rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dubnov, S.; Musical Information Dynamics as Models of Auditory Anticipation; in Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems, Ed. W. Weng, IGI Global publication, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary aesthetics===
{{main|Evolutionary aesthetics}}
Evolutionary aesthetics refers to [[evolutionary psychology]] theories in which the basic aesthetic preferences of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' are argued to have [[evolution|evolved]] in order to enhance survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shimura|first1=Arthur P.|last2=Palmer|first2=Stephen E.|title=Aesthetic Science: Connecting Minds, Brains, and Experience|date=January 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example being that humans are argued to find beautiful and prefer [[landscape]]s which were good [[habitat]]s in the ancestral environment. Another example is that body symmetry and proportion are important aspects of [[physical attractiveness]] which may be due to this indicating good health during body growth. Evolutionary explanations for aesthetical preferences are important parts of [[evolutionary musicology]], [[Darwinian literary studies]], and the study of the [[evolution of emotion]].

===Applied aesthetics===
{{Main|Applied aesthetics}}

As well as being applied to art, aesthetics can also be applied to cultural objects, such as crosses or tools. For example, aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by speakers working for the US Information Agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ |title=Tangential symbols: using visual symbolization to teach pharmacological principles of drug addiction to international audiences |journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=1139–46 |date=December 1993 |pmid=7510314 |doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1993.tb03913.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art slides were linked to slides of pharmacological data, which improved attention and retention by simultaneous activation of intuitive right brain with rational left. It can also be used in topics as diverse as [[Mathematical beauty|mathematics]], [[gastronomy]], fashion and website design.&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/visual_aesthetics.html |title=Visual Aesthetics |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date= |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T. &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing dimensions of perceived visual aesthetics of web sites. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 60, 269–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The philosophy of aesthetics as a practice has been criticized by some sociologists and writers of art and society. [[Raymond Williams]] argues that there is no unique and or individual aesthetic object which can be extrapolated from the art world, but that there is a continuum of cultural forms and experience of which ordinary speech and experiences may signal as art. By "art" we may frame several artistic "works" or "creations" as so though this reference remains within the institution or special event which creates it and this leaves some works or other possible "art" outside of the frame work, or other interpretations such as other phenomenon which may not be considered as "art".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] disagrees with Kant's idea of the "aesthetic". He argues that Kant's "aesthetic" merely represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure as opposed to other possible and equally valid "aesthetic" experiences which lay outside Kant's narrow definition.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Timothy Laurie argues that theories of musical aesthetics "framed entirely in terms of appreciation, contemplation or reflection risk idealizing an implausibly unmotivated listener defined solely through musical objects, rather than seeing them as a person for whom complex intentions and motivations produce variable attractions to cultural objects and practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp.&amp;nbsp;283–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afro-Surrealism''' or '''Afrosurrealism''' is a literary and cultural aesthetic that is a response to mainstream [[surrealism]] in order to reflect the lived experience of [[people of color]]. First coined by [[Amiri Baraka]] in 1974,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=D. Scot|first1=Miller|title=Call it Afro-Surreal|url=http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/|website=San Francisco Bay Guarian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this movement focuses on the present day experience of African Americans.  Afro-Surrealism is based on the manifesto written by D. Scot Miller, in which he says, "Afro-Surrealism sees that all 'others' who create from their actual, lived experience are surrealist..."  The manifesto delineates Afro-Surrealism from Surrealism and Afro-Futurism. The manifesto also declares the necessity of Afro-Surrealism, especially in [[San Francisco]], California. The manifesto lists ten tenants that Afro-Surrealism follows including how "Afro-Surrealists restore the cult of the past," and how "Afro-Surreal presupposes that beyond this visible world, there is an invisible world striving to manifest, and it is our job to uncover it."

Afro-Surrealism can be seen in music, photography, film, the visual arts and poetry. Notable practitioners of Afro-Surrealism include [[Ted Joans]], [[Bob Kaufman]], [[Krista Franklin]], [[Kool Keith]], [[Terrence Nance]], [[Will Alexander (poet)|Will Alexander]], [[India Sky Davis]], [[Kara Walker]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Starr Finch]], Romare Bearden and [[Christopher Burch (artist)|Christopher Burch]].

== Influence ==
The AfroSurreal arts movement came about after D. Scot Miller penned The Afrosurreal Manifesto for The San Francisco Bay Guardian in May, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/&lt;/ref&gt; Until that time, the term "Afrosurreal Expressionism" was used solely to describe the writings of Henry Dumas by Amiri Baraka. Later that year, Miller spoke with Baraka about extending the term by shortening the description. It was agreed by the two of them that "Afrosurreal" without the "expressionism" would allow further exploration of the term.  [http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/10/28/anti-doofus-agenda/].  Afrosurrealism may have some similar origins to [[surrealism]] in the mid-1920s, in that an aspect of it [Negritude] came after [[André Breton]] wrote the [[Surrealist Manifesto]], but as Leopold Senghor points out in Miller's manifesto, “European Surrealism is empirical. African Surrealism is mystical and metaphorical.”.&lt;ref&gt;http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Afro-Surrealism incorporates aspects of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], [[Négritude]] and Black Radical Imagination as described by Professor Robin DG Kelley in his definitive work Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination (2003),&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2017/05/a-converstion-with-robin-d-g-kelley/&lt;/ref&gt; and further with his definitive Afrosurreal historical anthology, Black, Brown, &amp; Beige:
Surrealist Writings from Africa and the Diaspora (2009).&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/book/3194&lt;/ref&gt;  Aspects of Afro-Surrealism can be traced to Martiniquan Suzanne Césaire’s discussion of the “revolutionary impetus of surrealism” in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Editor’s Notes|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.editor.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 1–2|volume = 5|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though much has been written and said about artist/activist/statesmen Aimé Césaire, much more needs to written about his partner Suzanne, a brilliant surrealist thinker, and mother of the Afrosurreal aesthetic. Her quest for “The Marvelous” over the “miserablism” expressed in the usual arts of protest inspired the Tropiques surrealist group, and especially René Ménil.

“The true task of mankind consists solely in the attempt to bring the marvelous into real life,” Ménil says in “Introduction to the Marvelous,”[1930s] “so that life can become more encompassing. So long as the mythic imagination is not able to overcome each and every boring mediocrity, human life will amount to nothing but useless, dull experiences, just killing time, as they say.”

Suzanne Césaire’s proclamation, “Be in permanent readiness for The Marvelous,” quickly became a credo of the movement; the word “marvelous” has since become re-contextualized with regard to contemporary black arts and interventions.&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2016/10/afrosurreal-the-marvelous-and-the-invisible/&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1956 essay for ''[[Présence Africaine]]'' Haitian novelist [[Jacques Stephen Alexis]] wrote,'' "What, then, is the Marvellous, except the imagery in which a people wraps its experience, reflects its conception of the world and of life, its faith, its hope, its confidence in man, in a great justice, and the explanation which it finds for the forces antagonistic to progress?"''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introduction: The No-Theory Chant of Afrosurrealism|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.francis03.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 95–112|volume = 5|issue = 1|first = Terri|last = Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Alexis is seen to have an acute sense of reality that is not dissimilar to traditional surrealism, and his coining of the term "Marvelous Realism" reflects how he was influenced by the earlier works of the Negritude/Black Surrealist Movement.

== Development ==
Afro-Surrealism was coined by [[Amiri Baraka]] in his 1974 essay on Black Arts Movement avant-garde writer [[Henry Dumas]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/10/01/433229181/henry-dumas-wrote-about-black-people-killed-by-cops-then-he-was-killed-by-a-cop&lt;/ref&gt;  Baraka notes that Dumas is able to write about ancient mysteries that were simultaneously relevant to the present day. This idea that the past resurfaces to haunt the present day is a crucial to Afro-Surrealism.

Cinematographer [[Arthur Jafa]] expanded the field of Afro-Surrealism by experimenting with film. Jafa introduces the idea of "the alien familiar," in order to represent the Black experience and its innate surreal characteristics. "I want it to have something that I and my friends call 'the alien familiar.' If a work succeeds in a way or is able to conjure what a Black cinema would be or what this hypothetical manifestation of this particular tradition in the cinematic arena might be, it should be both alien because you’ve never seen anything quite like it, and at the same time, it should be familiar on some level to Black audiences."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jafa, “The Notion of Treatment: Black Aesthetics and Film, based on an interview with Peter Hassli and additional discussions with Pearl Bowser,” in Oscar Micheaux and His Circle: African-American Filmmaking and Race Cinema of the Silent Era, ed. Pearl Bowser et al. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This focus on the alien aspect of the Black experience, and on Black folk culture, are what separate Afro-Surrealism from magical realism and surrealism.

=== The Future-Past ===
&lt;ref&gt;Miller, D. S. "Afrosurreal Manifesto: Black Is the New black—a 21st-Century Manifesto." ''Black Camera'', vol. 5 no. 1, 2013, pp. 113-117. ''Project MUSE'', muse.jhu.edu/article/525948.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Afro-Futurism which speculates on black possibilities in the future, Afrosurrealism, as Miller describes, is about the present. Rather than speculate on the coming of the four horseman, Afrosurrealists understand that they rode through too long ago. Through Afrosurrealism, artists expose this form of the future past that is "RIGHT NOW." Most Afrosurrealists reject the study of the future pushing themselves to focus on the present, the future that has already past.

=== The everyday lived experience ===

Much of Afro-Surrealism is concerned with the everyday life because it is said that there is nothing more surreal than the Black experience.  According to Terri Francis, "Afrosurrealism is art with skin on it where the texture of the object tells its story, how it weathered burial below consciousness, and how it emerged somewhat mysteriously from oceans of forgotten memories and discarded keepsakes. This photograph figures Afrosurrealism as bluesy, kinky-spooky."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Meditation|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.francis02.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 94-94|volume = 5|issue = 1|first = Terri|last = Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present day realism ===
In the manifesto from which present day Afrosurrealism is based, writer D. Scot Miller states in a response to Afrofuturism:

"Afro-Futurism is a diaspora intellectual and artistic movement that turns to science, technology, and science fiction to speculate on black possibilities in the future. Afro-Surrealism is about the present. There is no need for tomorrow’s-tongue speculation about the future. Concentration camps, bombed-out cities, famines, and enforced sterilization have already happened. To the Afro-Surrealist, the Tasers are here. The Four Horsemen rode through too long ago to recall. What is the future? The future has been around so long it is now the past."

As The AfroSurreal Manifesto and Afrofuturism come to the fore in artistic, commercial and academic circles, the struggle between the specific and “the scent” of present-day manifestations of Black absurdity has come with it, posing interesting challenges to both movements. For Afrofuturists, this challenge has been met by inserting Afrocentric elements into its growing pantheon, the intention being to centralize Afrofuturist focus back on the continent of Africa to enhance its specificity. For the Afrosurrealists, the focus has been set at the “here and now” of contemporary Black arts and situations in the Americas, Antilles, and beyond, searching for the nuanced “scent” of those current manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2017/05/the-electrical-scent-of-damas-negritude-the-harlem-renaissance-and-the-afrosurreal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Afro-Surrealist scholar Rochelle Spencer identifies at least three different subgenres of black speculative art, and Spencer argues that Afro-Surrealism is the most present-focus, though it is not devoid of technology and may include allusions to modern technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Black Science Fiction Studies Matter|url = http://www.themarysue.com/black-science-fiction-studies-matter/|website = www.themarysue.com|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Francis, the juxtaposition between the old and the present day is what makes Afro-Surrealism so unique. As Francis puts it, "Surrealism here, the Afro-surreal, like the marvelous discussed above, is actually a realism so real, so contrary to the norms of publicized blackness, that it represents a rupture, a radical break from ordinary understanding such that the old feels new—because it was never known.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~blackcam/pastIssues/Fall2013.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of Afrosurrealist Works ==

=== ''Zong!,'' M. NourbSe Philip and Setaey Adamu Boateng ===
In &lt;ref&gt;Philip, Marlene Nourbese. Zong! Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;''Zong!'', M. NourbSe Philip crafts a powerful counter-narrative surrounding the events of the [[Zong massacre|''Zong'' massacre]]. Utilizing the words from the legal decision to build her poetry, Philip rejects the idea of an archival past. Instead Philip looks to the present moment to understand how to read this legal decision and understand the case. Following the footsteps of Toni Morrison’s ''Beloved'', Philip presupposes the notion of a past that is not past allowing these past artifacts to haunt the present moment. Rather than organize the fragments, Philip allows the fragments to tell themselves. This is not to say that Philip gives the fragments voices, but instead gives them space. The space in the poem allows Philip’s audience to hear the silence of these voices, to truly understand the missing narratives form the past and the role that has on the present.

=== ''Beloved'', Toni Morrison ===
As mentioned earlier, Toni Morrison’s &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Toni. Beloved: A Novel. New York: Knopf : Distributed by Random House, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;''Beloved'' remains an important milestone for Afrosurrealists. Here, Morrison imagines a narrative of a slave women grieving the death of her baby daughter, Beloved. With no trace of a past, Beloved reappears of on the steps of 124, confused and looking for her mother. Following this moment, the novel crafts a haunting tale of a woman seeking to understand the sudden reappearance of her daughter and the scars left behind from slavery. In ''Beloved,'' Morrison attempts to come to grip with the legacies left by slavery, challenging the notion that these legacies exits only from the past. From the epigraph, “''Sixty Million and more'',” Morrison presupposes there is no way to count those affected from slavery and additionally, that the number is ever-growing into the present. In her award-winning novel, Morrison expands the idea of the past, attempting to demonstrate the past is ever present and moreover, that the past is RIGHT NOW.

==Life and career==
Dr Sprinkle was born Ellen F. Steinberg on July 23, 1954, in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], to a [[Russian-Jewish]] mother and a [[Polish-Jewish]] father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| url = http://shtetlmontreal.com/2011/02/18/dr-annie-sprinkle-on-shtetl/|title=Dr. Annie Sprinkle on ''Shtetl''|series=Shtetl: Your Alternative Jewish Magazine|airdate=February 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is known as the "prostitute and porn star turned sex educator and artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seductive aesthetics of postcolonialism|first=Rekha|last=Menon|publisher=Hampton Press|date=May 1, 2010|quote="How can one miss, the ''Sex Goddess,'' Annie Sprinkle (the postporn modern artist), Tantric inspired cosmic Kali, Sprinkle as the Neo Sacred Prostitute / Goddess.

E.|last=Rees|publisher=A &amp;amp; C Black|date=August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hardcore from the Heart.'' She then performed two-women shows with [[Elizabeth Stephens|Beth Stephens]] titled ''Exposed; Experiments in Love, Sex, Death and Art'', ''Dirty Sex Ecology'', ''Earthly: An Ecosex Bootcamp'', and ''Ecosex Walking Tour.''&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Lawrence &amp; [[Ellen Evert Hopman]] (1996) ''People of the Earth: The New Pagans Speak Out.'' (Reissued as ''Being a Pagan: Druids, Wiccans &amp; Witches Today'' in 2002. Destiny Books. {{ISBN|0-89281-904-9}}.) Interview.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work and publications, spanning over four decades, are studied in courses at numerous universities, in theater history, [[women's studies]], [[performance studies]], GLBTQ studies, and [[film studies]] courses. She also is a faculty member at the Oakland, California-based [[The New School of Erotic Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Vitzthum | first = Virginia | title = Annie Sprinkle swims forward | url = http://www.salon.com/health/col/vitz/2000/02/08/sprinkle/ | work = [[Salon.com]] | publisher = Salon Media Group | date = February 8, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Ellen Steinberg, Dr Sprinkle began working at the ticket booth at Tucson's Plaza Cinema at 18, when ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' was playing.&lt;ref name=rialto&gt;{{cite web | title = Annie Sprinkle: The Early Years (audio podcast interview) | url = http://www.therialtoreport.com/2013/04/07/podcast-05-annie-sprinkle-the-early-years/ | website = therialtoreport.com | publisher = The Rialto Report | date = April 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was busted, and when Steinberg had to appear in court as a witness, she met and fell in love with ''Deep Throat's'' director, [[Gerard Damiano]], and became his mistress, following him to New York City, where she lived for twenty-two years.&lt;ref name=rialto /&gt; Not long after becoming Damiano's mistress, Steinberg began working in porn herself and, at that time, started calling herself '''“Annie.”''' (Below can be found more details about the stage name she adopted.) Annie's first porn movie was ''Teenage Deviate,'' which was released in 1975. Perhaps her best known mainstream porn featured role was in ''Deep Inside Annie Sprinkle'' (co-directed by Sprinkle and sexploitation veteran [[Joseph W. Sarno]]) which was the No. 2 grossing porn film of 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=June 18, 2009|first=Reg|last=Little|work=Oxford Times|title=Iffley and the former porn star|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/features/4435987.Iffley_and_the_former_porn_star/|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Annie Sprinkle Neo Sacred Prostitute.jpg|thumb|left|Artwork depicting Annie Sprinkle as "The Neo Sacred Prostitute" (own concept).]]
In 1991, Sprinkle created the ''Sluts and Goddesses'' workshop, which became the basis for her 1992 production ''The Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop – Or How To Be A Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps,'' which was co-produced and co-directed with videographer [[Maria Beatty]], and featured music by composer [[Pauline Oliveros]]. Sprinkle pioneered new genres of sexually explicit film and video such as edu-porn, gonzo, post porn, xxx docudrama, art porn, and feminist erotica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chandler | first = Meghan | title = The erotic anatomies of Charles Estienne and Annie Sprinkle | journal = [[Porn Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–401 | doi = 10.1080/23268743.2014.958385 | date = October 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprinkle has also presented many sex workshops with fellow sex facilitator [[Barbara Carrellas]], with whom she presented the stage production ''Metamorphosex.''&lt;ref name="Rees1"/&gt;

She starred in [[Nick Zedd]]'s experimental films ''War Is Menstrual Envy'' (1992), ''Ecstasy in Entropy'' (1999), and ''Electra Elf: The Beginning'' (2005).

Dr Sprinkle has appeared in almost 200 films, including [[hard-core pornography|hard-]] and [[softcore pornography]], [[B movie]]s, loops, numerous documentaries, various TV shows including four [[HBO]] ''[[Real Sex]]'' programs. She has also produced, directed, and starred in several of her own films, such as ''Annie Sprinkle's Herstory of Porn,'' ''Annie Sprinkle's Amazing World of Orgasm,'' and ''Linda/Les &amp; Annie--The First Female to Male Transsexual Love Story.'' These films played in hundreds of film festivals, in museums and galleries. Her work in adult films earned her a spot on the Adult Star Path of Fame in [[Edison, New Jersey]], and she was inducted to both the [[List of members of the AVN Hall of Fame|AVN Hall of Fame]]&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Starr |first1=Astoria |title=13 AVN Hall of Fame 80's and 90's Stars: Where Are They Now? |url=https://www.therichest.com/expensive-lifestyle/entertainment/13-avn-hall-of-fame-80s-and-90s-stars-where-are-they-now/ |date=12 May 2016 |publisher=therichest.com |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[XRCO Hall of Fame]] in 1999. For three decades, she has presented her work as a visiting artist at many major universities and colleges in the US and Europe. Currently her lecture presentation is called "My Life and Work as a Feminist Porn Activist, Radical Sex Educator, and Ecosexual." She has also presented dozens of "Free Sidewalk Sex Clinics," offering free sex education to the public in public space.

Dr Sprinkle's work has always been about sexuality, with a political, spiritual, and artistic bent. In December 2005, she committed to doing seven years of art projects about love with her art collaborator and eventual wife, Beth Stephens. They called this their ''Love Art Laboratory.'' Part of their project was to do an experimental art wedding each year, and each year had a different theme and color. The seven-year structure was adapted to their project by invitation of artist [[Linda Montano|Linda M. Montano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benn |first=D. |title=Annie Sprinkle on the Adult Star Path of Fame: 43 Stars Laid in New Jersey |url=http://www.pornonewsnetwork.com/news.php?id=863 |website=pornonewsnetwork.com |publisher=Porno News Network |date=2006 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprinkle and Stephens have done twenty-one art weddings, eighteen with ecosexual themes. They married the Earth, Sky, Sea, Moon, Appalachian Mountains, the Sun, and other non-human entities in nine different countries.

Dr Sprinkle and her partner [[Beth Stephens]] became pioneers of ecosexuality, a kind of earth-loving sexual identity, which states, “The Earth is our lover.” Their Ecosex Manifesto proclaims that anyone can identify as an Ecosexual along with being “GLBTQI, heterosexual, asexual, and/or Other.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://sexecology.org/research-writing/ecosex-manifesto/ | title=Ecosex Manifesto | accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Sprinkle has also long championed sex worker rights and health care. She has also worked as a prostitute from 1973-1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Bell | first = Shannon | author-link = Shannon Bell | contribution = Writing the prostitute body: feminist reproductions | editor-last = Bell | editor-first = Shannon | editor-link = Shannon Bell | title = Reading, writing, and rewriting the prostitute body | pages = 79–80, 203 | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780253208590 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bpZRowUJfgUC&amp;pg=PA203 Preview.]&lt;br /&gt;

Dr Sprinkle identifies as a [[sex-positive feminist]], and much of her activist and sex education work reflects this philosophy. In 2009, she appeared in the French documentary film ''Mutantes: Punk, Porn, Feminism,'' speaking about the beginnings of the movement as well as her own contributions to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1576434/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm| title=Mutantes at IMDb| accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Dr Sprinkle and her wife/collaborator [[Beth Stephens]] were official artists in [[Documenta 14]], widely considered to be the most significant art exhibition in the world{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. They presented performances and visual art, lectured, and previewed their new film documentary, Water Makes Us Wet: An Ecosexual Adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/15/nature-ecosexual-annie-sprinkle-porn-star-queer|title=Nature is your lover, not your mother: meet ecosexual pioneer Annie Sprinkle|last=Theobald|first=Stephanie|date=2017-05-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGx-s9gj6rM|title=Video: "Ecosexual Walking Tour" of female porn activist Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens in Kassel during documenta 14.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nickname==
As noted above, Steinberg first gave herself the name '''“Annie”''' when she started working in pornography. As her career continued, she had an epiphany one night and she says that on that night," as if from the goddess herself," the name '''“Annie Sprinkle”''' came to her. She thought the name appropriate because "I was attracted by the sprinkles over ice cones (I am a bit of a sugaraholic!) and I love waterfalls, urine, vaginal fluids, sweat, anything wet. So the name 'Annie Sprinkle' seemed perfect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Annie Sprinkle |work=Miradas |language=Spanish |url=http://www.eictv.co.cu/miradas/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=531&amp;Itemid=93 |others=escrito por Redacción de Miradas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501234022/http://www.eictv.co.cu/miradas/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=531&amp;Itemid=93 |archive-date=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Applied aesthetics''' is the application of the branch of philosophy of aesthetics to cultural constructs.
{{TOC right}}

==Architecture and interior design==

Although structural integrity, cost, the nature of building materials, and the functional utility of the building contribute heavily to the design process, architects can still apply aesthetic considerations to buildings and related [[architecture|architectural]] structures. Common aesthetic design principles include ornamentation, edge delineation, texture, flow, solemnity, symmetry, color, granularity, the interaction of sunlight and shadows, transcendence, and harmony.

[[Interior design]]ers, being less constrained by structural concerns, have a wider variety of applications to appeal to aesthetics. They may employ color, color harmony, wallpaper, ornamentation, furnishings, fabrics, textures, lighting, various floor treatments, as well as adhere to aesthetic concepts such as [[feng shui]].

==Digital art==

A new art form struggling for acceptance is [[digital art]], a by-product of computer programming that raises new questions about what truly constitutes art.  Although paralleling many of the aesthetics in traditional media, digital art can additionally draw upon the aesthetic qualities of cross-media tactile relationships; interactivity; autonomous generativity; complexity and interdependence of relationships; suspense; and playfulness.

Artists working in this type of art are often forced to justify their use of a computer rather than a traditional medium, leading to, like the debate over Warhol's "Brillo Pad Boxes", a question of what constitutes art.

The criticisms of digital art are many. For example, graphics programs allow perfect shading to be achieved with little to no effort. In other types of programs, there is a sense that because of the variety of tools, filters, distortions, etc., that an artist has a veritable image factory at their disposal. The various criticisms ultimately come down to the issue of "what effort is the artist putting into their work?"

The 3d art community frequently references that while the programs they utilize render and shade the objects, their efforts are more akin to the sculptor or architect, presenting an aesthetically arranged, lighted, and textured scene. The users of the other programs such as Photoshop or Gimp point out that while they may have many tools at their disposal, the art itself must be that much more detailed and imaginative to stand out. In both cases there is the challenge of overcoming the barriers of limited technology and the lack of direct contact with one's medium.

==Education and social sciences==

Educators are also interested in how aesthetic designs influence the ways that students think and learn. Some historical figures like [[John Dewey]] have approached education through aesthetics. More recently, Elliot Eisner and jan jagodzinski have reopened the debate. Other researchers with [[postmodern]] or [[poststructural]] influences have done the same, these include Cleo H. Cherryholmes and [[Michel Foucault]]. Aesthetics in education has been linked to [[pragmatism]] as well as other areas of curriculum development and implementation.

See ''Understanding Curriculum," Chapter 11, Understanding Curriculum as Aesthetic Text, by William F. Pinar, William M. Reynolds, Patrick Slattery and Peter Taubman (1995) for more information.

==Fashion design==

[[Fashion design]]ers use a variety of techniques to allow people to express the truth about their unconscious minds by way of their clothing. To create wearable personality designers use fabric, cut, colour, scale, references to the past, texture, color harmony, distressing, transparency, insignia, accessories, beading and embroidery.
It is also used to find the average size of things, to make a product suitable for a high number of customers.

==Film, television, and video==

[[Film]] combines many diverse disciplines, each of which may have their own rules of aesthetics. The aesthetics of [[cinematography]] are closely related to still [[photography]], but the movement of the subject(s), or the camera and the intensities, colors, and placement of the [[lighting]] are highly important. [[Sound recording]], editing, and mixing are other, highly important areas of film, often closely related with the [[Film score|musical score]]. As in [[Theatre]], [[art direction]], in the design of the sets and shooting locations also applies, as well as [[costume design]] and [[makeup]]. All of these disciplines are closely inter-twined and must be brought together by the aesthetic sensibilities of the [[Film director|director]].

[[Montage sequence|Montage]], or editing is probably the one discipline unique to film, video, and television. The timing, rhythm and progression of shots form the ultimate composition of the film. This procedure is one of the most critical element of [[post production]], and incorporates sound editing and mixing, as well as the design and execution of digital [[special effects]].

In the case of a [[video installation]], the method of presentation becomes critical. The work may be screened on a simple [[video monitor|monitor]], projected on a wall or other surface, or incorporated into a larger sculptural installation. A video installation may also involve sound, with similar considerations to be made based on speaker design and placement, volume, and tone.

==Gastronomy==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}
{{Original research|section|date=December 2007}}
Although [[culinary|food]] is a basic and frequently experienced commodity, careful attention to the aesthetic possibilities of foodstuffs can turn eating into [[gastronomy]]. Chefs inspire our aesthetic enjoyment through the visual sense using colour and arrangement; they inspire our senses of taste and smell using [[spices]], diversity/contrast, anticipation, seduction, and decoration/garnishes. In regard to [[drinking water]], there are formal criteria for aesthetic value including [[odour]], [[colour]], [[total dissolved solids]] and clarity. There are numerical standards in the [[United States|U.S.]] for aesthetic acceptability of these parameters.

Note, however, a use of a word translated to "culinary" in Adorno's aesthetics. Adorno distinguishes between technically accurate and "beautiful" musical interpretation, and an interpretation higher which brings out the "truth" in the musical text: interpretations more rehearsed, with more time for rehearsal, but which might sound strange to audiences pandered-to by popular conductors (perhaps in the way Glenn Gould enstranges the music of Beethoven).

Unfortunately for the ordinary reader of Adorno, this isn't something technical such as "original instruments". It is instead the work of art that doesn't pander to what the audience "wants"...its whims.

This is linked to a Marxist interpretation which instead of treating the audience as an all-powerful "customer" adopts a teacherly or even priestly stance "above" the mere audience, something only the most "snobbish" of French chefs would dare, proposing to teach it to like Higher Things.

There are rarefied forms of *haute* cuisine; but note that common sense usually has a horselaugh about precious Yuppies eating designer food which it withholds about concert-goers listening to Berg; your man in the street merely thinks the latter crowd to be odd jobs, and doesn't resent them, meaning that ethical judgements play a role in aesthetic judgements that specialists in ethics, and specialists in aesthetics, systematically disregard...but which artists such as Tolstoy regarded as central.

Based on Adorno's theory of the (merely) culinary as not being "art", this would seem to mean that it is a joke, for an Adornoite (if such a person exists meaningfully), to treat cooking as an art form or eating as art appreciation.

Monty Python would often reverberate with this sort of arcana in a strange way: in the Mr. Creosote passage of The Meaning of Life, an enormously fat man is persuaded by the fawning waiter to have one more sweet whereupon Mr. Creosote throws up all over the dining room. Note that the scene has more claims to be art, despite being nauseating, than designer food.

This MAY be an unconscious comment on any theory of art that blindly equates "fine dining" and a visit to the picture galleries, a sort of tourist equation in which picture galleries are overrun in fact by post-prandial Mr. Creosotes. Even the ordinary man in the street would say that the starving artist visiting the gallery has a "better" apprehension of the higher, more inner, more elusive aura of the art work than Mr. Creosote, which means that for some authors, including Adorno, there is a nexus between ethics (which nearly tracks aesthetics polyphonically, where we use "good" and "bad" in ethics to characterise people and their deeds, and in aesthetics to judge what to buy).

The possibility of a rejection of the culinary in art starts with Kant's theory of the sublime but does not end there; post Holocaust (with its Nazis playing Bach: with Adorno's questions about poetry after Auschwitz) the culinary, and whether the German officer enjoying a "fine" meal has much of anything to do with art, become important aesthetic questions.

A Marxist theory of art would probably conclude that the chef cannot be an artist, lacking autonomy and beholden to the customer, Mr. Creosote, in all regards.

==Humor==

{{Further|Humor|Jokes|Mathematical humor}}
There is a developed theory of the aesthetics of jokes and humor, including a mathematical and logical analysis.

==Industrial design==

[[Industrial Design]]: Designers need many aesthetic qualities to improve the marketability of manufactured products: smoothness, shininess/reflectivity, texture, pattern, curviness, color, simplicity, usability, velocity, symmetry, naturalness, and modernism.
The staff of the Design Aesthetics section focuses on design, appearance and the way people perceive products. Design aesthetics is interested in the appearance of products; the explanation and meaning of this appearance is studied mainly in terms of social and cultural factors. The distinctive focus of the section is research and education in the field of sensory modalities in relation to product design. These fields of attention generate design baggage that enables engineers to design products, systems, and services, and match them to the correct field of use.

==Information technology==

Aesthetics in [[information technology]] has focused upon the study of [[human-computer interaction]] and creating [[user-friendly]] devices and [[software applications]]. [[Software]] itself has aesthetic dimensions ("[[software aesthetics]]"), as do information-technology-mediated processes and experiences such as computer [[video games]] and [[virtual reality]] simulations. [[Digital culture]] is a distinct aesthetic to judge the appeal of digital environments such as [[Web browser]]s, [[website]]s, and icons, as well as visual and aural art produced exclusively with digital technologies. The notion of [[cyberspace]] has sometimes been linked to the concept of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

Aesthetics in information technology do also apply to the act of designing [[software]] itself. Numerous [[programmers]] profess to experiencing a dimension of [[elegance]] in the functionality and structuring of software at the [[source code]] level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html Preface to the First Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a short, powerful expression that clearly expresses the intent of the code can be considered "beautiful" to the poor programmer charged with maintaining said code. This contrasts with code that is (as code all too often is) short, cryptic, unclear, and unnecessarily "clever". In-line documentation, while not strictly code, can be considered something a programmer would need to be good at in order to write beautiful code. Correctly done, documentation can accentuate the effect of beautiful code, when it is clear, concise, explains the intent of the programmer, and expands the understanding that one can gain by simply looking at the code. Comments that are redundant (only explain what the code already explains), cryptic, and overly long or short can detract from beautiful code. Aesthetics in programming can also have a practical level: Under the right conditions, elegant code can run faster and more efficiently, and (most importantly) be less prone to errors.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Knuth,  "Literate Programming", http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this would say that the need to justify "good design" by reference to "cost savings" means that "good design" isn't "art" insofar as art is autonomous, and many aestheticians would have to say that art emerges in applications only in excess of cost savings. In information technology, theorists of "user friendliness" have to justify their "user friendly" applications and often disregard basic statistics when most users like a system, but a significant minority hate it.

That is, they may discard the standard deviation of their data in order to sell a good design for the best price, and this has nothing to do with art insofar as art is a useful signifier (if you cost-justify everything you are a businessman and not an artist).

A folk phenomenon among real programmers is in fact their frequent hatred of practice described in books as best practice and good design. A Marxist theory of industrial "art" would ascribe this to alienation, in which subaltern programmers never produce code they own in any meaningful sense, with the problem that the same sort of alienation, soldiering, and bloody-mindedness appeared, it seems, in Soviet computing shops.

The most sophisticated writings on the topic of aesthetics are to be found in the late [[Edsger Dijkstra|Edsger Wybe Dijkstra's]] corpus of papers and notes on computing: in Dijkstra, the art is real, but Ying with respect to the Yang of applications; Dijkstra seemed to have refused any analysis of programming as other than applied mathematics and, strange to say, never pursued what Adorno (the midcentury theoretician of whom Dijkstra was apparently unaware) called a purely culinary elegance...despite the protests of others that his work was "hard to digest", in Adorno's words not very culinary.

Dijkstra's beauty refused the notion of accessibility as do many "artistic" works ancient and modern: it was hard as is the Grosse Fuge, Beethoven's syncopated and neo-primitive late movement. In fact, no aesthetician makes "user friendliness" canonical and necessary in a work of art, strange to say in an era when supposedly the masses rule through the market; for most art theorists, it is nice if the canaille can enjoy some pretty rondo of Mozart and whistle it on the street, but would deny that this property must be shared by the Masonic prelude and fugue or the Requiem mass.

This makes strange any claim that a programmer making his work "user friendly" to all comers is some sort of artist by virtue of that. For Dijsktra, truth was primary, and beauty the automatic result.

==Landscape design==

[[Landscape architecture|Landscape designers]] draw upon design elements such as axis, line, landform, horizontal and vertical planes, texture, and scale to create aesthetic variation within the landscape. They may additionally make use of aesthetic elements such as pools or fountains of water, plants, seasonal variance, stonework, fragrance, exterior lighting, statues, and lawns.

==Literature==

{{main|Literary merit}}
In [[poetry]], [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s and [[non-fiction]], authors use a variety of techniques to appeal to our aesthetic values. Depending on the type of writing an author may employ rhythm, illustrations, structure, time shifting, juxtaposition, dualism, imagery, fantasy, suspense, analysis, humor/cynicism, and thinking aloud.

==Maps==

Aesthetics in [[cartography]] relates to the visual experience of map reading and can take two forms: responses to the map itself as an aesthetic object (e.g., through detail, colour, and form) and also the subject of the map symbolised, often the landscape (e.g., a particular expression of terrain which forms an imagined visual experience of the aesthetic).

Cartographers make aesthetic judgments when designing maps to ensure that the content forms a clear expression of the theme(s). Antique maps are perhaps especially revered due to their aesthetic value, which may seem to be derived from their styles of ornamentation. As such, aesthetics are often wrongly considered to be a by-product of design. If it is taken that aesthetic judgments are produced within a certain social context, they are fundamental to the cartographer's symbolisation and as such are integral to the function of maps.

==Marketing==

As opposed to Industrial Design, which focuses on the aesthetic qualities of consumer products (see below), the use of aesthetics in marketing concerns itself with the "trade dress" of a product, such as its branding, its commercial representation, or the reputation of its producer. Marketing professionals may tickle the consumer's aesthetic appreciation of sassyness, [[sophistication]], color-harmony, stylishness, catchy jingles, slogans, craftsmanship, soothingness, attentiveness, authenticity, or the related perceived experiences associated with product consumption.

Marketing consists of intriguing the human mind to think in a direction where it would not have done so previously - or not without outside input. Human curiosity, self gain or mental adjustment is what drives marketing development itself.

==Mathematics==

{{Main|Mathematical beauty}}
{{Further|mathematical humor}}
The aesthetics of [[mathematics]] are often compared with music and poetry. Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the indescribable beauty of mathematics when he said "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful." Math appeals to the "senses" of logic, order, novelty, elegance, and discovery. Some concepts in math with specific aesthetic application include sacred ratios in [[geometry]], the intuitiveness of axioms, the complexity and intrigue of fractals, the solidness and regularity of [[polyhedra]], and the [[serendipity]] of relating theorems across disciplines.  There is a developed aesthetic and theory of humor in [[mathematical humor]].

==Music==

{{main|Aesthetics of music}}
Some of the aesthetic elements expressed in [[music]] include lyricism, [[harmony]], hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, volume dynamics, resonance, playfulness, color, subtlety, elatedness, depth, and mood (see [[musical development]]). Aesthetics in music are often believed to be highly sensitive to their context: what sounds good in modern [[rock music]] might sound terrible in the context of the early [[baroque music|baroque]] age.

==Neuroesthetics==

[[Cognitive science]] has also considered aesthetics, with the advent of [[neuroesthetics]], pioneered by [[Semir Zeki]], which seeks to explain the prominence of great art as an embodiment of biological principles of the brain, namely that great works of art capture the essence of things just as vision and the brain capture the essentials of the world from the ever-changing stream of sensory input. ''See also'' [[Vogelkop bowerbird]].

==Performing arts==

[[Theater|Performing arts]] appeal to our aesthetics of storytelling, grace, balance, class, timing, strength, shock, humor, costume, irony, beauty, drama, suspense, and sensuality. Whereas live stage performance is usually constrained by the physical reality at hand, film performance can further add the aesthetic elements of large-scale action, fantasy, and a complex interwoven musical [[film score|score]]. [[Performance art]] often consciously mixes the aesthetics of several forms. [[Role-playing games]] are sometimes seen as a performing art with an aesthetic structure of their own, called [[role-playing game theory|RPG theory]].

==Two-dimensional and plastic arts==

Aesthetic considerations within the [[visual arts]] are usually associated with the sense of [[visual perception|vision]]. A painting or sculpture, however, is also perceived spatially by recognized associations and context, and even to some extent by the senses of smell, hearing, and touch. The form of the work can be subject to an aesthetic as much as the content.

In painting, the aesthetic convention that we see a three-dimensional representation rather than a two-dimensional canvas is so well understood that most people do not realize that they are making an aesthetic interpretation. This notion is the basis of [[abstract impressionism]].

In the United States during the postwar period, the "push-pull" theories of [[Hans Hofmann]], positing a relation between color and perceived depth, strongly influenced a generation of prominent abstract painters, many of whom studied under Hofmann and were generally associated with [[abstract expressionism]]. Hofmann's general attitude toward abstraction as virtually a moral imperative for the serious painter was also extremely influential.

Some aesthetic effects available in visual arts include variation, juxtaposition, repetition, field effects, symmetry/asymmetry, perceived mass, subliminal structure, linear dynamics, tension and repose, pattern, contrast, perspective, 3 dimensionality, movement, rhythm, unity/Gestalt, matrixiality and proportion.

==Urban life==

[[Image:Clifton suspension bridge from hotwells 600.jpg|thumb|300px|Towns and cities have been planned with aesthetics in mind; here in [[Bristol]] (England), 19th century private sector development was designed to appear attractive.]]
Over half of mankind lives in cities; although it represents a lofty goal, [[urban planning|planning]] and achieving urban aesthetics ([[beautification]]) involves a good deal of historical luck, happenstance, and indirect gestalt. Nevertheless, aesthetically pleasing cities share certain traits: ethnic and cultural variety, numerous microclimates that promote a diversity of vegetation, sufficient public transportation, Public art and freedom of expression in the community in the forms of sculpture, [[graffiti]] and [[street art]], a range of build-out (or zoning) that creates both densely and sparsely populated areas, scenic neighboring geography (oceans or mountains), public spaces and events such as [[park]]s and [[parade]]s, musical variety through local radio or street musicians, and enforcement of laws that abate noise, crime, and pollution.

==Website Design==

Recent research suggests that the visual aesthetics of computer interface is a strong determinant of users’ satisfaction and pleasure. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses found that users’ perceptions consist of different main dimensions. Lavie and Tractinsky found two main dimension which they termed  “classical aesthetics”  and “expressive aesthetics”.&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T., &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing Dimensions of Perceived Visual Aesthetics of Websites. International Journal of Human Computer Studies , 269-298.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''Classical Aesthetics'' - pertains to aesthetic notions that presided from antiquity until the 18th century. These notions emphasize orderly and clear design and are closely related to many of the 	design rules advocated by usability experts.
*''Expressive Aesthetics'' - created by the designers’ creativity and originality and by the ability to break design conventions.
While both dimensions of perceived aesthetic are drawn from a pool of aesthetic judgments, they are clearly distinguishable from each other. &lt;br /&gt;
In a recent study Moshagen and Thielsch found four core dimensions of website aesthetics:&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Simplicity
* Diversity
* Colors
* Craftsmanship

Simplicity and diversity have repeatedly been treated as formal parameters of aesthetic objects throughout the history of empirical aesthetics. Colors are a very critical property of aesthetic objects. Craftsmanship addresses the skillful and coherent integration of the relevant design dimensions. While simplicity is highly correlated to classical aesthetics as mentioned by Lavie and Tractinsky, the other three factors could be treated as deeper differentiation of expressive aesthetics.

&lt;br /&gt;
'''Best practices for aesthetic Website Design'''&lt;br /&gt;
•	Create visual clues based on groupings; related items or links are grouped together while unrelated items are separated.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings and subheadings to allow visual scanning of content.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings, subheadings, font sizes, bold fonts and italic fonts in proportion to the importance of the item.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Align elements on a page so that they are all visually connected; size all elements on the page to create balance and unity; nothing should look out of place unless you have a specific reason for the effect.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Choose a font style that supports the site atmosphere and stick to it; limit styles to 2 at the most.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use images and photos for visual appeal and to communicate ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use one set of design elements across your website.

'''Website Design Aesthetics and Credibility''' &lt;br /&gt;
Website design influences user’s perception of site credibility. One of the factors that influences whether users stay or go on a web page is the page aesthetics. Another reason may involve a user's judgment about the site's credibility. Findings indicate that when the same content is presented using different levels of aesthetic treatment, the content with a higher aesthetic treatment was judged as having higher credibility. We call this the amelioration effect of visual design and aesthetics on content credibility. Holmes suggests that this effect is operational within the first few seconds in which a user views a web page. Given the same content, a higher aesthetic treatment will increase perceived credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, J., &amp; Robins, D. (2008). Aesthetics and Credibility in Web Site Design. Information Processing and Management: an International Journal , 386-399.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Architectural design values''' make up an important part of what influences [[architect]]s and [[designer]]s when they make their design decisions. However, architects and designers are not always influenced by the same values and intentions. Value and intentions differ between different [[Architectural style|architectural movements]]. It also differs between different [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] and schools of design as well as among individual [[List of architects|architects]] and [[List of industrial designers|designers]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.{{cite web|url=http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724174839/http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences in values and intentions are directly linked to the [[Timeline of architecture|pluralism in design]] outcomes that exist within architecture and design. It is also a big contributing factor as to how an architect or designer operates in his/her relation to clients.

Different design values tend to have a considerable history and can be found in numerous design movements. The influence that each design value has had on design movements and individual designers has varied throughout history.

==Aesthetic design values==
The expansion of architectural and industrial design ideas and vocabularies which took place during the last century has created a diverse [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] reality within these two domains. This pluralistic and diverse aesthetic reality has typically been created within different architectural and industrial design movements such as: [[Modernism]], [[Postmodernism]], [[Deconstructivism]], [[Post-structuralism]], [[Neoclassicism]], New Expressionism, Supermodernism etc.&lt;ref&gt;KRIEGER, P. (2004) Contextualism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;STEER, L. M. (2004) Supermodernism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FLORES"&gt;FLORES, C. A. H. (2004) Symbolism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these aesthetic realities represent a number of divergent aesthetic values, in addition to differences in general values and theories found within these movements.&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt; Some of the stylistic distinctions found in these diverse aesthetic realities reflects profound differences in design values and thinking,&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt; but this is not the case for all stylistic distinctions, as some stylistic distinctions builds on similar thinking and values.

These aesthetic values and their diverse aesthetic expressions are to some degree a reflection of the development that has taken place in the art community. In addition, more general changes have taken place in Western societies, due to technological development, new economic realities, political changes etc. However, these diverse aesthetic expressions are also a reflection of individual architects and industrial designers’ personal expression, based on designers’ tendency to experiment with form, materials, and ornament to create new aesthetic styles and aesthetic vocabulary. Changes in aesthetic styles and expressions have been, and still are, both synchronic and diachronic, as different aesthetic styles are produced and promoted simultaneously.&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt;

A number of values which cannot be classified as aesthetic design values have influenced the development of the aesthetic reality, as well as contributed to the pluralistic aesthetic reality which characterises contemporary architecture and industrial design.

Aesthetic Design Values, contains seven values.

===Artistic aspects and self-expression===
It is characterised by a belief that individual self-expression—or one’s inner spiritual self and creative imagination, inner resources and intuition—should be utilised and/or be the base used when designing.&lt;ref name="Gelernter"&gt;Gelernter, M. (1995). Sources of architectural form: a critical history of Western design theory. Manchester, Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These sentiments are closely linked to a number of artistic values found in movements like [[Expressionism]] and the [[Avant-garde]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Fedders, K. (2004). Archigram. Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. R. S. Sennott. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn. 1: 57 - 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heynen, H. (2004). Avant-garde. Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. R. S. Sennott. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn. 1: 97 - 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this design value is closely related to abstract forms and expression, personal creative liberty, elitism and being ahead of the rest of society.

===The spirit of the time design value===
This design value is based on the conception that every age has a certain spirit or set of shared attitudes that should be utilised when designing. The [[Zeitgeist|Spirit of the Times]] denotes the intellectual and cultural climate of a particular era,&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1965). Of the standard of taste: and other essays. Indianapolis, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.&lt;/ref&gt; which can be linked to an experience of a certain worldview, sense of taste, [[collective consciousness]] and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Gelernter" /&gt; Thus “form expression” which can be found, to some  extent in the “air” of a given time and each generation, should generate an aesthetic style that expresses the uniqueness related to that time.&lt;ref name="BROLIN"&gt;Brolin, B. C. (2000). Architectural ornament: banishment and return. New York, Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The structural, functional and material honesty design value===
Structural Honesty is linked to the notion that a structure shall display its “true” purpose and not be decorative etc.&lt;ref name="BROLIN" /&gt; Functional honesty is linked to the idea that a building or product form shall be shaped on the basis of its intended function, often known as “[[form follows function]]”. Material honesty implies that materials should be used and selected on the bases of their properties,&lt;ref&gt;KAUFMANN, E. (1955) Architecture in the age of reason; baroque and postbaroque in england, italy, and france, Cambridge, Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the characteristics of a material should influence the form it is used for.&lt;ref&gt;NESBITT, K. (1996) Theorizing a new agenda for architecture: an anthology of architectural theory 1965-1995, New York, Princeton Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a material must not be used as a substitute for another material as this subverts the materials “true” properties and it is “cheating” the spectator.&lt;ref&gt;WHITELEY, N. (1993) Design for society, London, Reaktion Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The simplicity and minimalism design value===
This design value is based on the idea that [[Minimalism|simple forms]], i.e. aesthetics without considerable ornaments, simple geometry, smooth surfaces etc., represents forms which are both truer to “real” art and represents “folk” wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;TOY, M. (1999) EDITORIAL. IN TOY, M. (Ed.) Aspects of minimal architecture II. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RUBY, I. &amp; RUBY, A. (2003) Essential, Meta-, Trans-. The Chimeras of Minimalist Architecture. IN RUBY, I. (Ed.) Minimal architecture. Munich, Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value implies that the more cultivated a person becomes, the more decoration disappears. In addition, it is linked to the notion that simple forms will free people from the everyday clutter, thus contribute to tranquillity and restfulness.&lt;ref&gt;SILVESTRIN, C. (1999) Royal Academy and AD International Forum, Something or Nothing: Minimalism in Art and Architecture 8. IN TOY, M. (Ed.) Aspects of minimal architecture II. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature and organic design value===
This design value is based on the idea that [[Natural building|nature]] (i.e. all sorts of living organisms, numerical laws etc.) can provide inspiration, functional clues and aesthetic forms that architects and industrial designers should use as a basis for designs.&lt;ref&gt;ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS, H. (2003) Zoomorphic : new animal architecture, London, Laurence King Publ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;PEARSON, D. (2001) New organic architecture: the breaking wave, Berkeley, University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Designs based on this value tend to be characterized by free-flowing curves, asymmetrical lines and expressive forms. This design value can be summed up in “form follows flow” or “of the hill” as opposed to “on the hill”.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;

===The classic, traditional and vernacular aesthetics design value===
This value is based on a belief that a building and product should be designed from timeless principles that transcend particular designers, cultures and climates.&lt;ref name="Gelernter" /&gt; Implicit in this design value is the notion that if these forms are used, the public will appreciate a structure’s timeless beauty and understand immediately how to use a given building or product.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004"&gt;BEATLEY, T. &amp; WHEELER, S. M. (2004) The sustainable urban development reader, London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value is also linked to [[Vernacular architecture|regional differences]] i.e. varying climate etc. and folklore cultures, which creates distinctive aesthetical expressions.&lt;ref name="GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ"&gt;GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ, V. (2004) Regionalism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The regionalism design value===
This design value is based on the belief that building—and to some degree products—should be designed in accordance with the particular characteristics of a specific place.&lt;ref name="GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ" /&gt; In addition, it is linked to the aim of achieving visual harmony between a building and its surroundings, as well as achieving continuity in a given area.&lt;ref&gt;ABEL, C. (1997) Architecture and identity: towards a global eco-culture, Oxford, Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it strives to create a connection between past and present forms of building. Finally, this value is also often related to preserving and creating regional and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;LEFAIVRE, L. &amp; TZONIS, A. (2003) Critical regionalism: architecture and identity in a globalized world, Munich, Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social design values==
Many architects and industrial designers have a strong motivation to serve the public good and the needs of the user population.&lt;ref&gt;SYMES, M., ELEY, J. &amp; SEIDEL, A. D. (1995) Architects and their practices: a changing profession, Oxford, Butterworth Architecture.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, social awareness and social values within architecture and design reflect, to some degree, the emphasis these values are given in society at large.

It should be noted that social values can have an aesthetical impact, but these aspects will not be explored as the main aesthetical impact found in design has been covered in the previous sections. [[Social design]] values are at times in conflict with other design values. This type of conflict can manifest itself between different design movements, but it can also be the cause of conflicts within a given design movement. It can be argued that conflicts between social values and other design values often represent the continuing debate between Rationalism and Romanticism commonly found within architecture and industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;JOHNSON, D. L. (2004) Rationalism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Design Values category consisting of four design values.

===The social change design value===
This design value can be described as a commitment to change society for the better through architecture and industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;ZIPF, C. W. (2004) Arts and crafts movement. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HUGHES, R. (1991) The shock of the new art and the century of change, London, Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value is closely connected and associated with political movements and subsequent building programs.&lt;ref&gt;HATCH, C. R. (1984) The scope of social architecture, New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt; Architects and industrial designers that are committed to the design value of social change often see their work as a tool for transforming the built environment and those who live in it.&lt;ref name="SANOFF"&gt;SANOFF, H. (2000) Community participation methods in design and planning, New York, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The consultation and participation design value===
This design value is based on a belief that it is beneficial to involve [[Participatory design|stakeholders in the design process]].&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt; This value is connected to a belief that user involvement leads to:
#Meeting social needs and an effective use of resources.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;
#Influencing in the design process as well as awareness of the consequences etc.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PREISER, W. F. E., WHITE, E. T. &amp; RABINOWITZ, H. Z. (1988) Post-occupancy evaluation, New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Providing relevant and up-to-date information for designers.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ZIMRING, C. M. &amp; REIZENSTEIN, J. E. (1981) A Primer on [[post occupancy evaluation]]: uses and techniques of an increasingly valued tool. Architecture (AIA Journal), 70, 52 - 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The crime prevention design value===
This design value is based on the belief that the built environment can be manipulated to reduce crime levels,&lt;ref&gt;PRESS, M., COOPER, R. &amp; EROL, R. (2001) Design as a tool for social policy: the case of 'design against crime'. The Fourth European Academy of Design Conference. Aveiro Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt; which is attempted accomplished through three main strategies that are: 
#Defensible space.&lt;ref&gt;NEWMAN, O. (1972) Defensible space: crime prevention through urban design, New York, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN"&gt;COLQUHOUN, I. (2004) Design out crime: creating safe and sustainable communities, Amsterdam, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Crime prevention through environmental design.&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN" /&gt;
#Situational crime prevention.&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WEKERLE, G. R. &amp; WHITZMAN, C. (1995) Safe cities: guidelines for planning, design, and management, New York ; London, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 'Third world' design value===
This is based on an eagerness to help developing countries [[Architecture for Humanity|through architecture]] and design (i.e. a response to the needs of the poor and destitute within the [[Third World]]).&lt;ref&gt;SERAGELDIN, I. (1997) The architecture of empowerment a survey. IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;STRASSMANN, P. W. (1998) Third world housing. IN VAN VLIET, W. (Ed.) The Encyclopedia of housing. Thousand Oaks, Calif, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value implies that social and economic circumstances found in the Third World necessitate the development of special solutions, which are distinct from what the same architects and industrial designers would recommend for the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;YUNUS, M. (1997) Foreword. IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ÖZKAN, S. (1997) Architecture to change the world? IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental design values==
The 20th century has been marked by the re-emergence of environmental values within Western societies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Concern for the environment is not new and can be found to a varying degree throughout history, and it is rooted in a number of perspectives including the aim of managing the ecosystems for sustained resource yields (sustainable development), and the idea that everything in nature has an intrinsic value (nature protection and preservation). Generally behind these types of thinking are the concepts of stewardship and that the present generation owes duties to generations not yet born.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;THOMPSON, I. H. (2000) Aesthetic, social and ecological values in landscape architecture: a discourse analysis. Ethics, place and environment, 3, 269-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental problems and challenges found in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a development where environmental values became important in some sections of Western societies. It is therefore not surprising{{According to whom|date=March 2012}} that these values can also be found among individual architects and industrial designers. The focus on [[environmental design]] has been marked with the rediscovery and further development of many “ancient” skills and techniques.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In addition, new technology that approaches environmental concerns is also an important characteristic of the environmental approach found among architects and industrial designers. These rather different approaches to environmental building and product technology can be illustrated with the development of environmental [[high-tech architecture]], and the more “traditional” environmental movement within is ecological based architecture.&lt;ref name="CUFF, D"&gt;CUFF, D. (2000) Epilogue. IN KOSTOF, S. (Ed.) ''The Architect : chapters in the history of the profession''. Berkeley, Calif., University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental technology, along with new environmental values, have affected development in cities across the world. Many cities have started to formulate and introduce "eco-regulations concerning renewable resources, energy consumption, sick buildings, smart buildings, recycled materials, and sustainability".&lt;ref name="CUFF, D" /&gt; This may not be surprising, as about 50% of all energy consumption in Europe and 60% in the US is building-related.&lt;ref name="CUFF, D" /&gt; However, environmental concerns are not restricted to energy consumption; environmental concerns take on a number of perspectives generally, which are reflected in the focus found among architects and industrial designers.

The environmental design values category consists of three design values.

===Green and sustainability===
This value is based on a belief that a [[Sustainable design|sustainable]] and/or environmentally friendly building approach is beneficial to users, society and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;MCDONALD, M. K. (2004) Sustainability and sustainable architecture. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) ''Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture''. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Key concepts within this design value are: energy conservation, resource management, recycling, cradle-to-cradle, toxic free materials etc.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOSTAEDI, A. (2002) Sustainable architecture: low tech houses, Barcelona, Carles Broto i Comerma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOSTAEDI, A. (2003) Sustainable architecture: high tech housing, Barcelona, Carles Broto i Comerma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WINES, J. &amp; JODIDIO, P. (2000) Green architecture, Köln, Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-use and modification===
This is based on a belief that existing buildings, and to some degree products, can be continuously used through updates.&lt;ref&gt;KALNER, S. (2004) Adaptwe re-use. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this value there are two separate schools of thought with regards to aesthetics: one camp focuses on new elements that are sublimated to an overall aesthetic, and the other advocates for aesthetical contrast, dichotomy and even dissonance between the old and the new.&lt;ref name="POWELL, K. 1999"&gt;POWELL, K. (1999) Architecture reborn: the conversion and reconstruction of old buildings, London, Laurence King.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
This design value is based on the belief that the built environment can contribute to ensuring a [[Sick building syndrome|healthy living environment]].&lt;ref name="FRANK"&gt;FRANK, L. D., ENGELKE, P. O. &amp; SCHMID, T. L. (2003) Health and community design: the impact of the built environment on physical activity, Washington, DC, Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BARTON, H., TSOUROU, C. &amp; WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. REGIONAL OFFICE FOR, E. (2000) Healthy urban planning: a WHO guide to planning for people, London, Published on behalf of the World Health Organization Regional.&lt;/ref&gt; Built into this design value, are principles like: buildings should be freestanding; sites need to be distributed to maximize the amount of sunlight that reaches individual structures.&lt;ref name="FRANK" /&gt; Similarly, there is an emphasis on health based construction and reduction of toxic emissions through selection of appropriate materials.&lt;ref&gt;BAKER-LAPORTE, P., ELLIOTT, E. &amp; BANTA, J. (2001) Prescriptions for a healthy house: a practical guide for architects, builders, and homeowners, Santa Fe, InWord Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional design values==
Within both architecture and industrial design there is a long tradition of being both inspired by and re-use design elements of existing buildings and products. This is the case even if many architects and industrial designers argue that they are primarily using their creativity to create new and novel design solutions. Some architects and industrial designers have openly led themselves be inspired by existing building and products traditions, and have even used this inspiration as the main base for their designs solutions.

This design tradition has a considerable history, which can be indicated in many of the labels associated with this tradition; this includes labels such as [[Classicism]], Vernacular, Restoration and Preservation etc. In addition, as indicated in the previous section “Classic, Traditional and Vernacular aesthetics”, an important element of this tradition is to re-use and be inspired by already existing aesthetical elements and styles. However, the traditional approach also implies other aspects such as functional aspects, preserving existing building traditions as well as individual buildings and products.

The Traditional Design Values category, consisting of three distinct values.

===The tradition based design value===
This relies on a belief that traditional “designs” are the preferred typology and template for buildings and products, because they “create” timeless and “functional” designs.&lt;ref&gt;AMUNDSON, J. A. &amp; MILLER, C. C. (2004) Classicism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this design value there are three main strategies:
#Critical traditionalist/regionalist i.e. interpreting the traditional typologies and templates and applying them in an abstracted modern vocabulary.&lt;ref name="TILMAN"&gt;TILMAN, J. T. (2004) Historicism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Revivalists i.e. adhering to the most literal traditional form.&lt;ref name="TILMAN" /&gt;
#Contextualists who use historical forms when the surroundings “demands” it.&lt;ref name="TILMAN" /&gt;

===The design value of restoration and preservation===
This is based on a commitment to preserve the best of buildings and products for future generations.&lt;ref name="POWELL, K. 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ROSS"&gt;ROSS, M. (1996) Planning and the heritage: policy and procedures, London, E &amp; FN Spon.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value tends to represent restoring a building or product to its initial design and is usually rooted in three perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;TOMLAN, M. A. (2004) Historic preservation. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; These are: 
#An archaeological perspective (i.e. preserving buildings and products of historical interest).&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;
#An artistic perspective i.e. a desire to preserve something of beauty.&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;
#A social perspective (i.e. a desire to hold on to the familiar and reassuring).&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;

===The vernacular design value===
This value is based on a belief that a simple life and its design, closely linked to nature, are superior to that of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;OLIVER, P. (2004) Vernacular Architecture. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MORTON, P. (2004) Primitivism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; The design value of [[Vernacular architecture|Vernacular]] includes key concept such as: 
#Reinvigorating tradition (i.e. evoking the vernacular).
#Reinventing tradition i.e. the search for new paradigms.
#Extending tradition i.e. using the vernacular in a modified manner.
#Reinterpreting tradition i.e. the use of contemporary idioms.&lt;ref&gt;RUDOFSKY, B. (1964) Architecture without architects: a short introduction to non-pedigree architecture, New York, Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender-based design values==
This design values is closely linked to the feminist movement and theory developed within the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;WEISMAN, L. K. (1992) Discrimination by design: a feminist critique of the man-made environment, Urbana, University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WEISMAN"&gt;WEISMAN, L. K. (2000) Prologue: 'women's environmental rights: a manifesto'. IN BORDEN, I., RENDELL, J. &amp; PENNER, B. (Eds.) Gender space architecture: an interdisciplinary introduction. London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Design values based on gender are related to three tenets found in architecture and industrial design,&lt;ref&gt;ATTFIELD, J. (1989) Form/female follows function/male: Feminist critiques of design. IN WALKER, J. A. &amp; ATTFIELD, J. (Eds.) Design history and the history of design. London, Pluto.&lt;/ref&gt; which are: 
#Gender differences related to critique and reconstruction of architectural practice and history.&lt;ref name="MORTON"&gt;MORTON, P. (2004) Feminist Theory. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The struggle for equal access to training, jobs and recognition in architecture and design.&lt;ref name="MORTON" /&gt;
#The focus on gender based theories for the built environment, the architectural discourse, and cultural value systems.&lt;ref name="MORTON" /&gt;

Designers that adhere to the Design values based on gender typically have a focus on creating buildings that do not have the same barriers that children, parents and the elderly experience in much of the built environment.&lt;ref name="WEISMAN" /&gt; It also implies a focus on aesthetics that are deemed to be more 'feminine' than the 'masculine' aesthetics often created by male designers.

==The economic design value==
Many architects and industrial designers often dread the financial and business side of architecture and industrial design practice, as their focus is often geared towards achieving successful design quality rather than achieving successful economic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;PYE, D. (1978) The nature and aesthetics of design, London, Barrie &amp; Jenkins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JACKSON, L. (Ed.) (1992) Strategic study of the profession: phase 1: strategic overview, London, Royal Institute of British Architects.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the basis for a design value that can be characterised as 'voluntarism' or 'charrette ethos'.&lt;ref&gt;BLAU, J. R. (1984) Architects and firms: a sociological perspective on architectural practice, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This value is commonly found among practising architects and designers. The 'volunteer' value is founded in the belief that good architecture and design requires commitment beyond the prearranged time, accountant’s budget, and normal hours.&lt;ref name="CUFF"&gt;CUFF, D. (1991) Architecture: the story of practice, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit in the 'volunteer' value are elements of the following claim present: 
#Best design works comes from offices or individual designers which are willing to put in overtime (sometimes unpaid) for the sake of the design outcome.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;
#Good architecture and design is rarely possible within fees offered by clients.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;
#Architects and designers should care enough about buildings or products to uphold high design standards regardless of the payment offered.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;

The 'volunteer' design value can be seen as a reaction to and a rejection of the client’s influence and control over the design project.

==The novel design value==
It is common within contemporary architecture and industrial design to find emphasis on creating novel design solutions. This emphasis is often accompanied by an equally common lack of emphasis on studying of the appropriateness of any already existing design solution.&lt;ref&gt;PORTER, D. (2000) Why do architects wear black? thinking beyond the trap. IN TOFT, A. E. (Ed.) Ethics in architecture : architectural education in the epoch of virtuality.

The novel design value has historical roots dating back to early design movements such as [[Modernism]], with is emphasis on “starting from zero”.&lt;ref&gt;WOLFE, T. (1981) From bauhaus to our house, London, Picador.&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration of original and novel design solutions is, by many designers and design scholars, considered one of the main aspects of architecture and design. This design value is often manifested through the working methods of designers. Some architects and designers with their emphasis on the “big idea” will have a tendency to cling to major design ideas and themes, even if these themes and ideas are faced with insurmountable challenges.&lt;ref&gt;LAWSON, B. (1997) How designers think: the design process demystified, Oxford, Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ROWE, P. G. (1987) Design thinking, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CROSS, N. (2004) Expertise in design: an overview. Design Studies, 25, 427 - 441.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the emphasis on design novelty is also associated with progress and new design solutions that, without this emphasis, would not see the light of day.

The design value of novelty is not generally accepted within either architecture or design. This is indicated by the debate in architecture, focusing on whether buildings should harmonize with the surroundings in that they are situated in or not.&lt;ref&gt;COLLINS, P. (1971) Architectural judgement, London, Faber &amp; Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally is the debate where architecture should be based on traditional topology and design styles i.e. classical and vernacular base architecture or if it should be an expression of its time. The same issues are indicated within the industrial design domain where it has been debated if retro design should be accepted or not as good design.

==Mathematical and scientific design values==
A movement to base architectural design on scientific and mathematical understanding started with the early work of [[Christopher Alexander]] in the 1960s, ''[[Notes on the synthesis of form]]''. Other contributors joined in, especially in investigations of form on the urban scale, which resulted in important developments such as Bill Hillier's [[Space syntax]] and Michael Batty's work on [[Spatial analysis]]. In architecture, the four-volume work [[The Nature of Order]] by Alexander summarizes his most recent results. An alternative architectural theory based on scientific laws, as for example [[A Theory of Architecture]]  is now competing with purely aesthetic theories most common in architectural academia.  This entire body of work can be seen as balancing and often questioning design movements that rely primarily upon aesthetics and novelty. At the same time, the scientific results that determine this approach in fact verify traditional and vernacular traditions in a way that purely historical appreciation cannot.

Social and environmental issues are given a new explanation, drawing upon biological phenomena and the interactivity of groups and individuals with their built environment. The new discipline of [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] developed by [[E. O. Wilson]] plays a major role in explaining the human need for intimate contact with natural forms and living beings. This insight into the connection between human beings and the biological environment provides a new understanding for the need for ecological design. An extension of the biophilic phenomenon into artificial environments suggests a corresponding need for built structures that embody the same precepts as biological structures. These mathematical qualities include fractal forms, scaling, multiple symmetries, etc.. Applications and extensions of Wilson's original idea are now carried out by Stephen R. Kellert in the [[Biophilia hypothesis]], and in by [[Nikos Salingaros]] and others in the book "Biophilic Design".

An '''artist's impression''' or '''artist's interpretation''' is the representation of an object or a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available. It could be an image, a sound, a video or a model. Artist's impressions are often created to represent concepts and objects that cannot be seen by the naked eye; that are very big, very small, in the past, in the future, fictional, or otherwise abstract in other ways. For example, in architecture, artists' impressions are used to showcase the design of planned buildings and associated landscape.&lt;ref name="BobMargaret2004"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Bob Giddings | author2=Margaret Horne | title=Artists' Impressions in Architectural Design | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekhXDjNF2bkC&amp;pg=PA1 | accessdate=24 May 2013 | date=9 March 2004 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn=978-0-203-36246-4 | pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists' impressions are particularly prominent in [[space art]].&lt;ref name="NASA's Space Art Program"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newatlas.com/how-are-planets-painted/42763/ |title=Artist's Impression: How to Paint a Planet |last=Powell |first=Dominic |date=2016-04-16 |website=New Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Attitudes of Lady Hamilton by Novelli.jpg|thumb|right|Emma, [[Lady Hamilton]] made the striking of attitudes into an art form, portraying classical themes such as the [[Judgement of Paris]].]]
'''Attitude''' as a term of [[fine art]] refers to the [[human position|posture]] or [[gesture]] given to a [[Figurative art|figure]] by a [[painting|painter]] or [[sculptor]].&lt;ref&gt;John Craig, ''A New Universal Etymological, Technological, and Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language Embracing All the Terms Used in Art, Science, and Literature'' (London, 1844), p. 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG0Tup952oMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA130&amp;dq=attitude+intitle:dictionary+intitle:art&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; It applies to the [[human body|body]] and not to a [[mental state]]&lt;!--this link to a disambiguation page is deliberate--&gt;, but the arrangement of the body is presumed to serve a communicative or expressive purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Woldmar Ruoff, ''The Standard Dictionary of Facts'' (The Frontier press company, 1916), p. 222 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mm0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA222&amp;dq=attitude+intitle:dictionary+intitle:art&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a [[Convention (norm)#Others|conventional]] attitude in art is [[proskynesis]] to indicate submissive respect toward [[Christian God|God]], [[emperor]]s, [[cleric]]s of high status, and religious [[icon]]s; in [[Byzantine art]], it is particularly characteristic in depictions of the emperor paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Ross, ''Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996), p. 205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=b-5YPoia7qwC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22PROSKYNESIS.+The+Greek+term%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 20th- and 21st-century [[art history]], "attitude" is used most often to label one of these conventional postures; another example is the [[orans]] pose.

"Attitude" was arguably more important as an [[aesthetic]] term in the 19th century, when it was defined in one art-related dictionary as

&lt;blockquote&gt;the posture or disposition of the limbs and members of a figure, by which we discover the action in which it is engaged, and the very sentiment supposed to be in the mind of the person represented. It comprehends all the motions of the body, and requires a perfect knowledge of [[wikt:ponderation|ponderation]], and whatever refers to the [[center of gravity|centre of gravity]]; but whatsoever attitude be given to any figure, that attitude must show the beautiful parts, as much as the subject will permit, let the subject be what it will. It must, besides, have such a turn as, without departing from probability, or from the character of the figure, may diffuse a [[beauty]] over the action. It is allowed that the choice of fine attitudes constitutes the greatest part of the beauties of grouping.&lt;ref&gt;John Gould, ''Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Artists: Comprising Painters, Sculptors, Engravers, and Architects, from the Earliest Ages to the Present Time'' (London: E.

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871-1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The '''Bengal School of Art''' commonly referred as '''Bengal School''',&lt;ref name=ngma/&gt; was an [[art movement]] and a style of [[Indian painting]] that originated in [[Bengal]], primarily [[Kolkata]] and [[Shantiniketan]], and flourished throughout [[India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. Also known as 'Indian style of painting' in its early days, it was associated with [[Indian nationalism]] ([[swadeshi]]) and led by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871-1951), but was also promoted and supported by British arts administrators like [[Ernest Binfield Havell|E. B. Havell]], the principal of the [[Government College of Art, Kolkata]] from 1896; eventually it led to the development of the [[modern Indian painting]].&lt;ref name=ngma/&gt;&lt;ref name=benartmitter&gt;{{cite book |title=Art and nationalism in colonial India, 1850-1922: occidental orientations |last=Mitter |first=Partha |authorlink= |author2= |year= 1994|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-44354-8 |chapter=How the past was salvaged by Swadeshi artists |pages=267–306 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mRTtkri8E0C |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=benartatlas&gt;{{cite book |title=Atlas of world art |last=Onians |first=John |authorlink= |author2= |year= 2004|publisher=Laurence King Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-85669-377-6 |page= 304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Bengal}}
The Bengal school arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the [[Western world|West]], the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havell]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitter|first=Partha |title=Indian art |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FHxsDV1GDOIC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Ernest+Binfield+Havell+education#v=onepage&amp;q=Ernest%20Binfield%20Havell%20education&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-284221-8|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/arts/design/20bose.html|title=Art Review: Indian Modernism via an Eclectic and Elusive Artist|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=August 19, 2008|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havell was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by [[Mughal painting|Mughal art]], a style that he and Havell believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asianist]] model of art. Through the paintings of 'Bharat Mata', Abanindranath established the pattern of patriotism. Painters and artists of Bengal school were [[Nandalal Bose]], M.A.R Chughtai, [[Sunayani Devi]] (sister of Abanindranath Tagore), [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Kalipada Ghoshal]], [[Asit Kumar Haldar]], [[Sudhir Khastgir]], Kshitindranath Majumdar, [[Sughra Rababi]], [[D. P. Roy Choudhury|Debi Prasad Roychoudhury]], Bireswar Sen, [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], Kiron Sinha,TP [[Gaganendranath Tagore]] (Tagore's brother)

The Bengal school's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. {{As of|2012}}, there has been a surge in interest in the Bengal school of art among scholars and connoisseurs.&lt;ref name=benarttoi&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-12/special-report/31051756_1_bengal-school-bengal-art-bengal-masters| title=For many art lovers, it's back to the old school| last=Ghose | first=Archana Khare |newspaper=Times of India| location=New Delhi|date=12 February 2012|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
However, Bengal continues to produce some of the best artists of modern India. There is a department in the Government College Of Art &amp; Craft that has been training students the traditional style of tempera and wash painting for almost a century now. These students are carrying the legacy of the Bengal School artists, who, initially, were a group of artists, following Abanindranath's style and sharing his aesthetic vision. Among them, Dhirendranath Brahma is the living legend of the Bengal School of Art. He is a master of calligraphy and has innumerable students who are carrying on the tradition of Bengal School of painting. Among the other renowned artists of this style of painting are Ajoy Ghosh, Sankarlal Aich, Amal Chaklader, Narendranath De Sarkar, Sukti Subhra Pradhan &amp; Ratan Acharya. 
Some of the best known artists of present-day Bengal are [[Jogen Chowdhury]], [[Mrinal Kanti Das]], [[Gopal Sanyal]], [[Ganesh Pyne]], [[Manishi Dey]], [[Shanu Lahiri]], Ganesh Haloi &lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Shanu Lahiri dead|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130202/jsp/calcutta/story_16510654.jsp#.UUISlTeEnuo|newspaper=The Telegraph (Calcutta)|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Samir Aich, [[Bikash Bhattacharjee]], Sudip Roy, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and  [[Devajyoti Ray]].
Sanat Chatterjee is one of the last living pioneers of Bengal School of art. He studied under Asit Kumar Haldar for around fifteen years.

==R. Siva Kumar's disagreement ==
{{main article|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}
[[R. Siva Kumar]], who has been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and their approach to art since the early 80s, refutes the practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the '''Bengal School of Art'''. According to Siva Kumar, 'This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice'.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas on this issue are formulated in the catalogue essay of the exhibition [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]].

'''Blog fiction''' is a form of blogging that can be defined as any forms of narrative written and published through online web journals such as LiveJournal. Fictional blogs are a changing phenomenon with great potential to young writers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, AA, Fictional Blogs, Uses of Blogs, Peter Lang, Bruns, A &amp; Jacobs, J (ed), New York, pp. 199-210. {{ISBN|0820481246}} (2006) [Research Book Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 20th century, there were various authors who were leading the change to bring about the end of the print book. They intend to replace it with a mode of expression that was nonlinear and free to cross as many boundaries as the ever-increasing powers of the computers were making possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.mga.edu/eds/ebookviewer/ebook?sid=9590c575-d91b-46ef-a66d-65d75126b5d6@sessionmgr102&amp;ppid=Page-__-107&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EK {{full citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Readers generally cannot access the university proxy link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, blog fiction was developed in 1965; however, it was referred to as a hypertext or web. Well-known philosopher and sociologist Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext. He defined hypertext as "a body of pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that is could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper." Although Ted Nelson was given credit for combining the term and defining hypertext, many people were confused on what tasks it could complete. Most people assumed that it involved linking, like the World Wide Web. After much confusion and speculation about hypertext, the first Hypertext Conference was held in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commforum.mit.edu/hypertext-in-historical-context-vannevar-bush-and-ted-nelson-revisited-bc527272125|title=Hypertext in Historical Context: Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson Revisited|date=30 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake or real blogs==
Fictional blogging is all about expressing ideas and creativity. Blog fiction or fictional blogging help readers find who they are. 

Fake blogs, also known as flogs, are misleading web sites that launch [[scareware]] and post ads and comments to a real blog site to lure readers to the page. The con artists who run these sites currently make an estimated $750 million a year by selling products of miracle cures to phony anti-virus software and items of questionable value. Most of them have one article posing as impartial new report commenting on a miracle product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scambusters.org/fakeblog.html|title=8 Clues That Point to a Fake Blog.html|website=www.scambusters.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real blog fiction===

Fictional blogging can be a personal journal or diary that is posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|title=What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Though many critics and literary scholars dismiss blog fiction as an inferior and faddish literary form, there is a trend towards the recognition of blogs as a legitimate arena of fiction production. For instance, self-publishing provider Lulu sponsors the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]], which began in 2006. The Blooker prize is an award given to the best "blook" of the year: a work of fiction begun as blog fiction and then transformed into a printed publication. Thus, even despite the radical and democratizing potential of blog fiction, printed works still maintain greater authority and "official" status in the world of fiction and academia. 

Some people{{who|date=December 2017}} say blog fiction is not true blogging and that blogs should not contain fake content. However, blog fiction and regular blogging are all the same.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In fictional blogging, writers talk about fictional subject matter and also write about real life events but with fictional characteristics. Blog fiction is what a blogger makes of it.

A  '''causal loop''' in the context of [[time travel]] or the [[causal structure]] of [[spacetime]], is a sequence of events (actions, information, objects, people)&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel/index.html#CauLoo |last=Smith|first=Nicholas J.J.|date=2013 |title=Time Travel |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=June 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lobo"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |arxiv=gr-qc/0206078 |bibcode=2003ntgp.conf..289L |chapter= Time, Closed Timelike Curves and Causality |title=The Nature of Time: Geometry, Physics and Perception |series=NATO Science Series II |page=3 |last=Lobo|first=Francisco|year=2003 |isbn=1-4020-1200-4 |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which an event is among the causes of another event, which in turn is among the causes of the first-mentioned event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Rea|first=Michael|title=Metaphysics: The Basics|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-57441-9|edition=1. publ.|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=v1IsAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA78 78]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Rea|first1=Michael C.|title=Arguing about Metaphysics|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-415-95826-4|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such causally-looped events then exist in spacetime, but their origin cannot be determined.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lobo" /&gt; A hypothetical example of a causality loop is given of a [[billiard ball]] striking its past self: the billiard ball moves in a path towards a time machine, and the future self of the billiard ball emerges from the time machine ''before'' its past self enters it, giving its past self a glancing blow, altering the past ball's path and causing it to enter the time machine at an angle that would cause its future self to strike its past self the very glancing blow that altered its path.&lt;ref name="Thorne"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Thorne | first = Kip S. | authorlink = Kip Thorne | title = [[Black Holes and Time Warps]] | publisher = W.

==Terminology in physics, philosophy, and fiction==
Backwards time travel would allow for causal loops involving events, information, people or objects whose histories form a closed loop, and thus seem to "come from nowhere."&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The notion of objects or information which are "self-existing" in this way is often viewed as paradoxical,&lt;ref name="Lobo" /&gt; with several authors referring to a causal loop involving information or objects without origin as a  ''bootstrap paradox'',&lt;ref name="Everett"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Everett|first1=Allen|last2=Roman|first2=Thomas|title=Time Travel and Warp Drives|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-22498-5|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dm5xt_XbFyoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA136 136–139]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Visser|first=Matt|title=Lorentzian Wormholes: From Einstein to Hawking|date=1996|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=1-56396-653-0|p=213}} "A second class of logical paradoxes associated with time travel are the bootstrap paradoxes related to information (or objects, or even people?) being created from nothing."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klosterman"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|last1=Klosterman |first1=Chuck |title=Eating the Dinosaur |date=2009 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781439168486|edition=1st Scribner hardcover|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZurDFJtAWwC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60 60–62]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toomey2012"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Toomey|first=David|title=The New Time Travelers|date=2012|publisher=W.

Heinlein]]'s time travel story "[[By His Bootstraps]]".&lt;ref name="Klosterman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv |last=Ross |first=Kelley L. |title=Time Travel Paradoxes |date=1997 |url=http://www.friesian.com/paradox.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980118212457/http://www.friesian.com/paradox.htm |archivedate=January 18, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[time loop]]" is sometimes used to refer to a causal loop,&lt;ref name="Klosterman" /&gt; but although they appear similar, causal loops are unchanging and self-originating, whereas time loops are constantly resetting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=Time Travel in Popular Media|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew|last2=Ormrod|first2=Joan|year=2015|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|isbn=9780786478071|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a causal loop paradox involving information is given by Everett: suppose a time traveler copies a mathematical proof from a textbook, then travels back in time to meet the mathematician who first published the proof, at a date prior to publication, and allows the mathematician to simply copy the proof. In this case, the information in the proof has no origin.&lt;ref name="Everett"/&gt; A similar example is given in the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' of a time-traveler who copies Beethoven's music from the future and publishes it in Beethoven's time in Beethoven's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Holmes|first=Jonathan|work=Radio Times|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-10/doctor-who-what-is-the-bootstrap-paradox|title=Doctor Who: what is the Bootstrap Paradox?|date=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everett gives the movie ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]'' as an example involving an object with no origin: an old woman gives a watch to a playwright who later travels back in time and meets the same woman when she was young, and gives her the same watch that she will later give to him.&lt;ref name="Everett" /&gt;

Krasnikov writes that these bootstrap paradoxes - information or an object looping through time - are the same; the primary apparent paradox is a physical system evolving into a state in a way that is not governed by its laws.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001"&gt;{{cite|last=Krasnikov|first=S.|year=2001|title=The time travel paradox|journal=Phys. Rev. D|volume=65|issue=6|page=06401 |arxiv=gr-qc/0109029|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65f4013K |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.65.064013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|4}} He does not find this paradoxical, and attributes problems regarding the validity of time travel to other factors in the interpretation of general relativity.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001" /&gt;{{Rp|14–16}}

A 1992 paper by physicists Andrei Lossev and [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]] labeled such items without origin as ''Jinn'', with the singular term ''Jinnee''.&lt;ref name="Lossev1992"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Lossev|first=Andrei |last2=Novikov|first2=Igor|date=15 May 1992|title=The Jinn of the time machine: non-trivial self-consistent solutions|journal=Class.

The term ''predestination paradox'' is used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise to mean "a time loop in which a time traveler who has gone into the past causes an event that ultimately causes the original future version of the person to go back into the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Okuda|first1=Michael|last2=Okuda|first2=Denise|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia|date=1999|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-53609-5|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the phrase was created for a sequence in a 1996 episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' titled "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry J.|last2=Hutzel|first2=Gary|title=Star Trek: The Magic of Tribbles|date=2001|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-7434-4623-2|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W6bvoGUg7G8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA31 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the phrase had been used previously to refer to belief systems such as [[Calvinism]] and some forms of [[Marxism]] which encouraged followers to strive to produce certain outcomes while at the same time teaching that the outcomes were predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Daniels|first=Robert V.|date=May–June 1960|title=Soviet Power and Marxist Determinism|journal=Problems of Communism|volume=9|p=[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015059418874;view=1up;seq=159 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smeenk and Morgenstern use the term "predestination paradox" to refer specifically to situations in which a time traveler goes back in time to try to prevent some event in the past, but ends up helping to cause that same event.&lt;ref name="smeenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgenstern"&gt;{{cite|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Research/TechReports/TR2013-950/TR2013-950.pdf |title=Foundations of a Formal Theory of Time Travel |last=Morgenstern|first=Leora|year=2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-fulfilling prophecy==
A [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be ''truly'' known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. [[Predestination]] does not necessarily involve a [[supernatural]] power, and could be the result of other "infallible foreknowledge" mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Craig|first=William Lane|year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dummett|first=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|isbn13=9780198240112|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pp=356, 370–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which [[Oedipus]] becomes the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother.

''Evolution of the Universe'', p. 169: "The close of time curves does not necessarily imply a violation of causality, since the events along such a closed line may be all 'self-adjusted'—they all affect one another through the closed cycle and follow one another in a self-consistent way."&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 paper by Novikov and several others, "Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves",&lt;ref name="Friedman1990" /&gt; the authors suggested the ''principle of self-consistency,'' which states that ''the only solutions to the laws of physics that can occur locally in the real Universe are those which are globally self-consistent.'' The authors later concluded that time travel need not lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of what type of object was sent to the past.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Physicist [[Joseph Polchinski]] argued that one could avoid questions of free will by considering a potentially paradoxical situation involving a [[billiard ball]] sent back in time. In this situation, the ball is fired into a [[wormhole]] at an angle such that, if it continues along its course, it will exit in the past at just the right angle to hit its earlier self, knocking it off course, which would stop it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Thorne referred to this problem as "Polchinski's paradox".&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt; Two students at Caltech, Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar Klinkhammer, went on to find a solution that avoided any inconsistencies. In the revised scenario, the ball would emerge from the future at a different angle than the one that had generated the paradox, and delivers its past self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole. This blow changes its trajectory by just the right degree, meaning it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self the necessary glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case. Later analysis by Thorne and [[Robert Forward]] showed that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could actually be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Echeverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne published a paper discussing these results in 1991;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Echeverria|1991}}| first=Fernando | last=Echeverria |author2=Gunnar Klinkhammer |author3=Kip Thorne | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/6469/ | title=Billiard balls in wormhole spacetimes with closed timelike curves: Classical theory | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | year=1991 | issue=4 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.44.1077 | pages=1077|bibcode = 1991PhRvD..44.1077E }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, they reported that they had tried to see if they could find ''any'' initial conditions for the billiard ball for which there were no self-consistent extensions, but were unable to do so. Thus it is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Earman | first = John | title = Bangs, Crunches, Whimpers, and Shrieks: Singularities and Acausalities in Relativistic Spacetimes | publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 1995 | isbn = 0-19-509591-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|184}} The lack of constraints on initial conditions only applies to spacetime outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime; the constraints on the chronology-violating region might prove to be paradoxical, but this is not yet known.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188" /&gt;{{Rp|187–188}}

Novikov's views are not widely accepted. Visser views causal loops and Novikov's self-consistency principle as an ad hoc solution, and supposes that there are far more damaging implications of time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Nahin | first =Paul J. | title = Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction | publisher =American Institute of Physics |year= 1999 | isbn = 0-387-98571-9|pp=345–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krasnikov similarly finds no inherent fault in causal loops, but finds other problems with time travel in general relativity.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001" /&gt;{{Rp|14–16}}

==Quantum computation with negative delay==
Physicist [[David Deutsch]] shows in a 1991 paper that quantum computation with a negative delay&amp;mdash;backwards time travel&amp;mdash;could solve NP problems in [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial time]],&lt;ref name="Deutsch1991"&gt;{{cite journal | first=David | last=Deutsch | url= http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197 | title= Quantum mechanics near closed timelike lines | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | issue = 10 | year=1991 | doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197 | pages=3197–3217 | bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scott Aaronson]] later extended this result to show that the model could also be used to solve [[PSPACE]] problems in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American|date=March 2008|title=The Limits of Quantum Computers|pages=68–69|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/limitsqc-draft.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Scott | last=Aaronson |author2=John Watrous | url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/ctc.pdf | title=Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume = 465 | year=2009 | issue = 2102 | doi=10.1098/rspa.2008.0350 | pages=631–647 | bibcode=2009RSPSA.465..631A|arxiv = 0808.2669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch shows that quantum computation with a negative delay produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning.&lt;ref name="Deutsch1991" /&gt; Researchers published in 2014 a simulation validating Deutsch's model with photons.&lt;ref name=RingbauerEtAl2014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martin Ringbauer|author2=Matthew A.

'''Children's literature''' or '''juvenile literature''' includes stories, books, magazines, and poems that are enjoyed by children. Modern children's literature is classified in two different ways: genre or the intended age of the reader.

Children's literature can be traced to stories and songs, part of a wider [[oral tradition]], that adults shared with children before publishing existed. The development of early children's literature, before printing was invented, is difficult to trace. Even after printing became widespread, many classic "children's" tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience. Since the fifteenth century much literature has been aimed specifically at children, often with a moral or religious message. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is known as the "Golden Age of Children's Literature", because many classic children's books were published then.

== Introduction ==
There is no single or widely used definition of children's literature.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|15–17}} It can be broadly defined as anything that children read&lt;ref name=nodel&gt;{{cite book|last=Nodelman|first=Perry|title=The Hidden Adult: Defining Children's Literature|year= 2008|publisher= [[JHU]]|page=4| url=https://books.google.com/?id=wKosfJZhUwQC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-8018-8980-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more specifically defined as [[fiction]], [[non-fiction]], [[poetry]], or [[drama]] intended for and used by children and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Library of Congress|title=Children's Literature|url=https://www.loc.gov/acq/devpol/chi.pdf|work=LIbrary of Congress Collections Policy Statement|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20thc&gt;{{cite book|last= Chevalier|first= Tracy|title=Twentieth-Century Children's Writers|year=1989|publisher=[[St. James Press]]|location= [[Chicago]]|isbn= 0-912289-95-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xvii}} One writer on children's literature defines it as "all books written for children, excluding works such as [[comic book]]s, joke books, [[cartoon book]]s, and non-fiction works that are not intended to be read from front to back, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference materials".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2006, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others would argue that comics should also be included: "Children's Literature studies has traditionally treated comics fitfully and superficially despite the importance of comics as a global phenomenon associated with children".&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, C. "Abstract":, "Comic Art, Children's Literature, and the New Comic Studies." ''The Lion and the Unicorn'', vol. 30 no. 3, 2006, pp. 360-382. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/uni.2006.0031 [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202582/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'' notes that "the boundaries of [[genre]]&amp;nbsp;... are not fixed but blurred".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first= Peter (editor)|title= International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature|year=1996|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P74RiK3CRGkC&amp;pg=PP4|isbn= 978-0-203-16812-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Sometimes, no agreement can be reached about whether a given work is best categorized as literature for adults or children. Some works defy easy categorization. [[J.K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series was written and marketed for young adults, but it is also popular among adults. The series' extreme popularity led ''[[The New York Times]]'' to create a separate best-seller list for children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|title=The ''Times'' Plans a Children's Best-Seller List|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 24, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/books/the-times-plans-a-children-s-best-seller-list.html|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the widespread association of children's literature with picture books, spoken narratives existed before [[printing]], and the root of many children's tales go back to ancient storytellers.&lt;ref name=Arbuth&gt;{{cite book|last=Arbuthnot|first=May Hill|title=Children and Books|year=1964|publisher=[[Scott, Foresman Publishers|Scott, Foresman]]|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} [[Seth Lerer]], in the opening of ''Children's Literature: A Reader's History from Aesop to Harry Potter'', says, "This book presents a history of what children have heard and read&amp;nbsp;... The history I write of is a history of ''reception''."&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|2}}

== History ==
&lt;!--Note to future editors: This should not be a list of books published but an encyclopedic summary of significant advances and changes around the world. Please keep this from becoming a mere list. See note on talk page for order of information for this section--&gt;
Early children's literature consisted of spoken stories, songs, and poems that were used to educate, instruct, and entertain children.&lt;ref name=random&gt;{{cite web|title=To Instruct and Delight A History of Children's Literature| url=http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/024children.html|publisher=Randon History|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was only in the eighteenth century, with the development of the concept of childhood, that a separate genre of children's literature began to emerge, with its own divisions, expectations, and [[Western canon|canon]].&lt;ref name=nikola&gt;{{cite book|last= Nikolajeva|first= María (editor) |author-link=Maria Nikolajeva |title= Aspects and Issues in the History of Children's Literature|year= 1995|publisher= Greenwood| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ubZL9V1L9fEC&amp;pg=PR9|isbn= 978-0-313-29614-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|x-xi}} The earliest of these books were educational books, books on conduct, and simple ABCs--often decorated with animals, plants, and anthropomorphic letters. &lt;ref&gt;•Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, French historian [[Philippe Ariès]] argues in his book ''[[Centuries of Childhood]]'' that the modern concept of childhood only emerged in recent times. He explains that children were in the past not considered as greatly different from adults and were not given significantly different treatment.&lt;ref name=shav&gt;{{cite book|last= Shavit|first= Zohar|title= Poetics of Children's Literature|year= 2009|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8203-3481-3| url=https://books.google.com/?id=NerYSgnlnaIC&amp;pg=PP10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} As evidence for this position, he notes that, apart from instructional and didactic texts for children written by [[cleric]]s like [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] and [[Ælfric of Eynsham]], there was a lack of any genuine literature aimed specifically at children before the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMunn|first=Meradith Tilbury|author2=William Robert McMunn|title=Children's Literature in the Middle Ages|journal=[[Children's Literature (journal)|Children's Literature]]|year=1972|volume= 1|pages=21| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/chl/summary/v001/1.mcmunn.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|doi=10.1353/chl.0.0064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brad&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Johanna|title=From Chapbooks to Plumb Cake: The History of Children's Literature|year=2007|publisher=[[ProQuest]]|isbn=978-0-549-34070-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=65KJo_XpLoYC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

Other scholars have qualified this viewpoint by noting that there was a literature designed to convey the values, attitudes, and information necessary for children within their cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Wyile|first= Andrea Schwenke (editor)|title=Considering Children's Literature: A Reader|year=2008|publisher=Broadview|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MWTY0BK5jbIC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the ''[[Play of Daniel]]'' from the 12th century.&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|46}}&lt;ref name=kline&gt;{{cite book|last= Kline|first= Daniel T.|title= Medieval Literature for Children|year= 2003|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8153-3312-8| url=https://books.google.com/?id=TcxBsWXg9mYC&amp;pg=PR4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Pre-modern children's literature, therefore, tended to be of a [[didactic]] and [[Morality|moralistic]] nature, with the purpose of conveying [[Conduct book|conduct]]-related, educational and [[Religious book|religious]] lessons.&lt;ref name=kline /&gt;{{rp|6–8}}

=== Early-modern Europe ===
[[File:Hornbook Mexican.png|left|thumb|An early Mexican [[hornbook]] pictured in Tuer's ''History of the Horn-Book'', 1896.]]
During the 17th century, the concept of childhood began to emerge in Europe. Adults saw children as separate beings, innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them.&lt;ref name=shav /&gt;{{rp|6–7}}&lt;ref name=reynolds&gt;{{cite book|last= Reynolds|first= Kimberley|title= Children's Literature: A Very Short Introduction|year=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} The English philosopher [[John Locke]] developed his theory of the [[tabula rasa]] in his 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.  In Locke's philosophy, ''tabula rasa'' was the theory that the (human) mind is at birth a "blank slate" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's [[sense|sensory]] experiences. A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions. Locke himself emphasized the importance of providing children with "easy pleasant books" to develop their minds rather than using force to compel them; "children may be cozen'd into a knowledge of the letters; be taught to read, without perceiving it to be anything but a sport, and play themselves into that which others are whipp'd for." He also suggested that picture books be created for children.

In the nineteenth century, a few children's titles became famous as classroom reading texts. Among these were the fables of Aesop and Jean de la Fontaine and Charles Perraults's 1697 ''Tales of Mother Goose''&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;. The popularity of these texts led to the creation of a number of nineteenth century fantasy and fairy tales for children which featured magic objects and talking animals. &lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence on this shift in attitudes came from [[Puritanism]], which stressed the importance of individual salvation. Puritans were concerned with the spiritual welfare of their children, and there was a large growth in the publication of "good godly books" aimed squarely at children.&lt;ref name=random /&gt; Some of the most popular works were by [[James Janeway]], but the most enduring book from this movement, still read today, especially In modernised versions, is ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678) by [[John Bunyan]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''The New Amplified Pilgrim's Progress'' (both book and dramatized audio) – as retold by James Pappas. Published by Orion's Gate (1999) and ''The Evergreen Wood: An Adaptation of the "Pilgrim's Progress" for Children'' written by Linda Perry, illustrated by Alan Perry. Published by Hunt &amp; Thorpe, 1997. [[The Pilgrim's Progress#Retellings]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chapbook]]s, pocket-sized pamphlets that were often folded instead of being stitched,&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|32}} were published in Britain; illustrated by [[Woodcut|woodblock printing]], these inexpensive booklets reprinted popular [[ballads]], historical re-tellings, and folk tales.

[[Hornbook]]s also appeared in England during this time, teaching children basic information such as the alphabet and the [[Lord's Prayer]].&lt;ref name=questia&gt;{{cite book|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia: Children's Literature|year=2009|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117011194|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422190423/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117011194|archive-date=2012-04-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were brought from England to the [[British America|American colonies]] in the mid-17th century. The first such book was a [[catechism]] for children written in verse by the Puritan [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]]. Known as ''[[Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes]]'', it was published in 1646, appearing both in England and [[Boston]]. Another early book, ''[[The New England Primer]]'', was in print by 1691 and used in schools for 100 years. The [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] begins, "In Adam's fall We sinned all&amp;nbsp;...", and continues through the alphabet. It also contained religious maxims, [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]], spelling help and other educational items, all decorated by [[woodcut]]s.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|35}}

In 1634, the ''[[Pentamerone]]'' from Italy became the first major published collection of European folk tales. [[Charles Perrault]] began recording [[fairy tale]]s in France, publishing his first collection in 1697. They were not well received among the French literary society, who saw them as only fit for old people and children. In 1658, Jan Ámos [[Comenius]] in [[Bohemia]] published the informative illustrated ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'', for children under six learning to read. It is considered to be the first picture book produced specifically for children.&lt;ref name=reynolds /&gt;{{rp|7}}

The first [[Denmark|Danish]] children's book was ''The Child's Mirror'' by [[Niels Bredal]] in 1568, an adaptation of a [[Courtesy book]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] priest [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]. ''A Pretty and Splendid Maiden's Mirror'', an adaptation of a [[Germany|German]] book for young women, became the first [[Sweden|Swedish]] children's book upon its 1591 publication.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|700, 706}} Sweden published fables and a children's magazine by 1766.

In [[Italy]], [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] released ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' in the 1550s. Called the first European storybook to contain fairy-tales, it eventually had 75 separate stories and written for an adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Opie |first=Iona |author2=[[Peter Opie]]  |authorlink=Iona Opie |title=The Classic Fairy Tales |page=20|location=Oxford and New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1974 |isbn=0-19-211559-6|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Russia]]'s earliest children's books, [[Primer (textbook)|primers]], appeared in the late 16th century.

=== Origins of the modern genre ===
[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|[[Brothers Grimm]], [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]] (left) and [[Jakob Grimm]] (right) from an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]

The modern children's book emerged in mid-18th-century England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-the-newbery-award-got-its-name/|title=How the Newbery Award Got Its Name}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing [[politeness|polite]] middle-class and the influence of [[John Locke|Lockean]] theories of childhood innocence combined to create the beginnings of childhood as a concept. ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'', written and published by [[John Newbery]], is widely considered the first modern children's book, published in 1744. It was a landmark as the first children's publication aimed at giving enjoyment to children,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kodomo.go.jp/ingram/e/section1/index.html|title=Early Children's Literature: From moralistic stories to narratives of everyday life}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing a mixture of rhymes, picture stories and games for pleasure.&lt;ref name=marks&gt;{{cite book|last= Marks|first= Diana F.|title=Children's Book Award Handbook|year= 2006|publisher= [[Libraries Unlimited]]|location= Westport, Conn|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery believed that play was a better enticement to children's good behavior than physical discipline,&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, John Rowe. ''Written for Children''. (1990). New York: HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0-06-446125-4}}, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the child was to record his or her behavior daily.

The book was child–sized with a brightly colored cover that appealed to children—something new in the publishing industry. Known as gift books, these early books became the precursors to the [[toy book]]s popular in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Lundin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lundin, Anne H. |year=1994 |title=Victorian Horizons: The Reception of Children's Books in England and America, 1880–1900 |journal=The Library Quarterly |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |volume=64 |issue= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery was also adept at marketing this new genre. According to the journal ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn (journal)|The Lion and the Unicorn]]'', "Newbery's genius was in developing the fairly new product category, children's books, through his frequent advertisements&amp;nbsp;... and his clever ploy of introducing additional titles and products into the body of his children's books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Susina|first= Jan|title= Editor's Note: Kiddie Lit(e): The Dumbing Down of Children's Literature |journal= The Lion and the Unicorn |date=June 1993|volume= 17|issue= 1|pages= v–vi| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/uni/summary/v017/17.1.susina.html| accessdate=30 July 2012 |doi=10.1353/uni.0.0256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;



The improvement in the quality of books for children, as well as the diversity of topics he published, helped make Newbery the leading producer of children's books in his time. He published his own books as well as those by authors such as [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[Oliver Goldsmith]];&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;ref name="Rose, 219"&gt;Rose, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; the latter may have written ''[[The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes]]'', Newbery's most popular book.

Another philosopher who influenced the development of children's literature was [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who argued that children should be allowed to develop naturally and joyously. His idea of appealing to a children's natural interests took hold among writers for children.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|41}} Popular examples included [[Thomas Day]]'s ''[[The History of Sandford and Merton]]'', four volumes that embody Rousseau's theories. Furthermore, [[Maria Edgeworth|Maria]] and [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]]'s ''[[Practical Education]]: The History of Harry and Lucy'' (1780) urged children to teach themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Leader, Zachary, ''Reading Blake's Songs'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7Q9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau's ideas also had great influence in Germany, especially on [[Philanthropinum|German Philanthropism]], a movement concerned with reforming both education and literature for children. Its founder, [[Johann Bernhard Basedow]], authored ''Elementarwerk'' as a popular textbook for children that included many illustrations by [[Daniel Chodowiecki]]. Another follower, [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]], created an adaptation of ''Robinson Crusoe'' that went into over 100 printings. He became Germany's "outstanding and most modern"&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|736}} writer for children. According to Hans-Heino Ewers in ''The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "It can be argued that from this time, the history of European children's literature was largely written in Germany."&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|737}}

The [[Brothers Grimm]] preserved and published [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|the traditional tales]] told in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Silvey&gt;{{cite book|last=Silvey|first=Anita (editor)|title=The Essential Guide to Children's Books and their Creators|year= 2002|publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]]|location= New York|isbn=0-618-19082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|184}} They were so popular in their home country that modern, realistic children's literature began to be looked down on there. This dislike of non-traditional stories continued there until the beginning of the next century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|739–740}} The Grimms's contribution to children's literature goes beyond their collection of stories, as great as that is. As professors, they had a scholarly interest in the stories, striving to preserve them and their variations accurately, recording their sources.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|259}} 

A similar project was carried out by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] scholars [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], who collected Norwegian fairy tales and published them as ''[[Norwegian Folktales]]'', often referred to as ''Asbjørnsen and Moe''. By compiling these stories, they preserved Norway's literary heritage and helped create the Norwegian written language.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|260}}

Danish author and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]] traveled through Europe and gathered many well-known fairy tales and created new stories in the fairy tale genre.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Elias Bredsdorff, ''Hans Christian Andersen: the story of his life and work 1805–75'', Phaidon (1975) {{ISBN|0-7148-1636-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Switzerland]], [[Johann David Wyss]] published ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' in 1812, with the aim of teaching children about family values, good husbandry, the uses of the natural world and self-reliance. The book became popular across Europe after it was translated into French by [[Isabelle de Montolieu]].

[[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s tale "[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]" was published in 1816 in a German collection of stories for children, ''Kinder-Märchen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nutcracker|last=Hoffmann|first=E.

=== Golden age ===
The shift to a modern genre of children's literature occurred in the mid-19th century; [[didacticism]] of a previous age began to make way for more humorous, child-oriented books, more attuned to the child's imagination. The availability of children's literature greatly increased as well, as paper and [[printing]] became widely available and affordable, the population grew and literacy rates improved.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|654–655}}

''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' by [[Thomas Hughes]] appeared in 1857, and is considered to be the founding book in the [[school story]] tradition.&lt;ref name=knowles&gt;{{cite book|last= Knowles|first= Murray|title= Language and Control in Children's Literature|year= 1996|publisher= [[Psychology Press]]| url=https://books.google.com/?id=2mh6pCDCZ5EC&amp;pg=PP7|isbn= 978-0-203-41975-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}} However, it was [[Lewis Carroll]]'s fantasy, ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', published in 1865 in England, that signaled the change in writing style for children to an imaginative and empathetic one. Regarded as the first "English masterpiece written for children"&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|44}} and as a founding book in the development of fantasy literature, its publication opened the "First Golden Age" of children's literature in Britain and Europe that continued until the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=knowles /&gt;{{rp|18}} Another important book of that decade was ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby]]'', by Reverend [[Charles Kingsley]] (1862), which became extremely popular in England, and remains a classic of British children's literature.

In 1883, [[Carlo Collodi]] wrote the first Italian fantasy novel, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', which was translated many times. In that same year, [[Emilio Salgari]], the man who would become "the adventure writer par excellence for the young in Italy"&lt;ref&gt;Lawson Lucas, A. (1995) "The Archetypal Adventures of Emilio Salgari: A Panorama of his Universe and Cultural Connections New Comparison", ''A Journal of Comparative and General Literary Studies'', Number 20 Autumn&lt;/ref&gt; first published his legendary character ''[[Sandokan]]''. In Britain, ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Princess and Curdie]]'', by [[George MacDonald]], appeared in 1872 and 1883, and the adventure stories ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'', both by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], were extremely popular in the 1880s. [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' was first published in 1894, and [[J. M. Barrie]] told the story of [[Peter Pan]] in the novel  ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' in 1911. [[Johanna Spyri]]'s two-part novel ''[[Heidi]]'' was published in Switzerland in 1880 and 1881.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|749}} In the US, children's publishing entered a period of growth after the [[American Civil War]] in 1865. Boys' book writer [[William Taylor Adams|Oliver Optic]] published over 100 books. In 1868, the "epoch-making book"&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|45}} ''[[Little Women]]'', the fictionalized autobiography of [[Louisa May Alcott]], was published. This "[[coming of age]]" story established the genre of realistic family books in the United States. [[Mark Twain]] released ''[[Tom Sawyer]]'' in 1876, and in 1880 another bestseller, ''[[Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings]]'', a collection of [[African American]] folk tales adapted and compiled by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], appeared.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|478}}

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a plethora of children's novels began featuring realistic, non-magical plotlines. Certain titles received international success such as Robert Louis Stevenson's ''Treasure Island'' (1883), L.M. Montgomery's ''Anne of Green Gables'' (1908), and Louisa May Alcott's ''Little Women'' (1869) &lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

== National traditions ==

=== China ===
The Chinese [[Revolution of 1911]] and [[World War II]] brought political and social change that revolutionized children's literature in China. Western science, technology, and literature became fashionable. China's first modern publishing firm, [[Commercial Press]], established several children's magazines, which included ''Youth Magazine'', and ''Educational Pictures for Children''.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|832–833}} The first Chinese children's writer was [[Sun Yuxiu]], an editor of Commercial Press, whose story ''The Kingdom Without a Cat'' was written in the language of the time instead of the classical style used previously. Yuxiu encouraged novelist [[Mao Dun|Shen Dehong]] to write for children as well. Dehong went on to rewrite 28 stories based on classical Chinese literature specifically for children. In 1932, [[Zhang Tianyi]] published ''Big Lin and Little Lin'', the first full-length Chinese novel for children.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|833–834}}

The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution of 1949]] changed children's literature again. Many children's writers were denounced, but Tianyi and [[Ye Shengtao]] continued to write for children and created works that aligned with [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideology. The 1976 death of [[Mao Zedong]] provoked more changes that swept China. Many writers from the early part of the century were brought back, and their work became available again. In 1990, ''General Anthology of Modern Children's Literature of China'', a fifteen-volume anthology of children's literature since the 1920s, was released.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|834–835}}

Literature for children developed as a separate category of literature especially in the [[Victorian era]]. Some works became internationally known, such as those of [[Lewis Carroll]], ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. At the end of the Victorian era and leading into the Edwardian era, [[Beatrix Potter]] was an author and illustrator, best known for her children's books, which featured animal characters. In her thirties, Potter published ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' in 1902. Potter eventually went on to publish 23 children's books and become a wealthy woman. Michael O. Tunnell and James S. Jacobs, professors of children’s literature at Brigham Young University, write, "Potter was the first to use pictures as well as words to tell the story, incorporating coloured illustration with text, page for page."&lt;ref name="Tunnell 80–86"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tunnell|first=Michael O.|last2=Jacobs|first2=James S.|date=2013-10-01|title=The Origins and History of American Children's Literature|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/TRTR.1201/abstract|journal=The Reading Teacher|language=en|volume=67|issue=2|pages=80–86|doi=10.1002/TRTR.1201|issn=1936-2714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another classic of the period is [[Anna Sewell]]'s animal novel ''[[Black Beauty]]'' (1877).

In the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern picture book were illustrated books of poems and short stories produced by English illustrators [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Walter Crane]], and [[Kate Greenaway]]. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. Some British artists made their living illustrating novels and children's books; among them were [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Cicely Mary Barker]], [[W. Heath Robinson]], [[Henry Justice Ford|Henry J. Ford]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], and [[George Cruikshank]].

The [[Kailyard school]] of Scottish writers, notably [[J. M. Barrie]], creator of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' (1904), presented an idealised version of society and brought fantasy and folklore back into fashion. In 1908, [[Kenneth Grahame]] wrote the children's classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' and the [[Scouts]] founder [[Robert Baden-Powell]]'s first book ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' was published. Inspiration for [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s novel ''[[The Secret Garden]]'' (1910) was the [[Great Maytham Hall]] Garden in Kent. In 1920 [[Hugh Lofting]] created the character [[Doctor Dolittle]] who appears in a series of [[Doctor Dolittle#The books|twelve books]].

The Golden Age of Children's Literature ended with [[World War I]] in Great Britain and Europe, and the period before [[World War II]] was much slower in children's publishing. The main exceptions in England were the publications of ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' by [[A. A. Milne]] in 1926, the first ''[[Mary Poppins]]'' book by [[P. L. Travers]] in 1934, ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in 1937, and the Arthurian novel ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' by [[T. H. White]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Peter (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|978-0-203-16812-7}}, pp. 682-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's [[paperback]] books were first released in England in 1940 under the [[Puffin Books]] imprint, and their lower prices helped make book buying possible for children during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Peter (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature'', pp. 475-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enid Blyton]]'s books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies. Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into almost 90 languages. She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]], [[The Famous Five (novel series)|The Famous Five]], [[The Secret Seven]], and [[The Adventure Series]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Sheila G. (1982), ''The Blyton Phenomenon''. Andre Deutsch, {{ISBN|978-0-233-97441-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these children's stories, ''[[Five on a Treasure Island]]'', was published in 1942.

In the 1950s, the book market in Europe began recovering from the effects of two world wars. An informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the "Inklings". Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. C. S. Lewis published the first installment of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series in 1950 while Tolkien is best known in addition to ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as the author of  ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. (1954) Another significant writer of fantasy stories is [[Alan Garner]] author of ''[[Elidor]]'' (1965), and ''[[The Owl Service]]'' (1967). The latter work is an adaptation of the myth of [[Blodeuwedd]] from the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', set in modern [[Wales]], and for it Garner won the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a British author.&lt;ref name=medal1967&gt;[http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=91 (Carnegie Winner 1967)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106194213/http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=91 |date=2013-01-06 }}.

[[Mary Norton (author)|Mary Norton]] wrote ''[[The Borrowers]]'' (1952), featuring tiny people who borrow from humans. [[Dodie Smith]]'s ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' was published in 1956. [[Philippa Pearce]]'s ''[[Tom's Midnight Garden]]'' (1958) has him opening the garden door at night and entering into a different age. The heroine of ''[[Charlotte Sometimes (novel)|Charlotte Sometimes]]'' by Penelope Farmer (1969) is already shaken by her arrival in a girls' boarding school when she finds herself waking as another girl in the same bed, but decades earlier. Closer to reality, Jenny in ''[[No One Must Know]]'' (1962) by [[Barbara Sleigh]] is a newcomer in the street who faces a landlord's pet ban. She needs urgent help from nearby children to hide her cat and kittens.

[[Roald Dahl]] rose to prominence with his children's [[fantasy novels]], often inspired from experiences from his childhood, with often unexpected endings, and unsentimental, dark humour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-man-who-liked-to-make-up-stories-2158052.html Once upon a time, there was a man who liked to make up stories ...] ''[[The Independent]]'' (Sunday, 12 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl was inspired to write ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1964), featuring the eccentric candymaker [[Willy Wonka]], having grown up near two chocolate makers in England who often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies into the other's factory. His other works include ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1961), ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' (1971), ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'' (1983), and ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'' (1988).

==== Adventure fiction for children ====
Adventure stories written specifically for children began in the 19th century. Early examples include [[Johann David Wyss]]' ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' (1812), [[Frederick Marryat]]'s ''[[The Children of the New Forest]]'' (1847) and [[Harriet Martineau]]'s ''The Peasant and the Prince'' (1856).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Hunt, Peter]]. (Editor). ''Children's literature: an illustrated history''. Oxford University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-212320-3}}  (pp.&amp;nbsp;98–100)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victorian era saw the development of the genre, with [[William Henry Giles Kingston|W.H.G. Kingston]], [[Robert Michael Ballantyne|R. M. Ballantyne]] and [[G. A. Henty]] specializing in the production of adventure fiction for boys.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Butts, Dennis,"Adventure Books" in [[Jack Zipes|Zipes, Jack]], ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature''. Volume One. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-19-514656-1}} (pp.&amp;nbsp;12–16).&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired writers who normally catered to adult audiences to write for children, and an example is [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s (1850–94) classic [[Piracy|pirate]] story ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883).&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

In the years after the First World War, writers such as [[Arthur Ransome]]  (1884–1967) developed the adventure genre by setting the adventure in Britain rather than distant countries. Ransome began publishing in 1930 his [[Swallows and Amazons]] series of children's books about the school-holiday adventures of children, mostly in the English [[Lake District]] and the [[Norfolk Broads]]. Many of the books involve sailing; fishing and camping are other common subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Brogan, ''The Life of Arthur Ransome''. Jonathan Cape, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biggles]] was a popular series of [[adventure book]]s for young boys, about James Bigglesworth, a fictional pilot and [[adventurer]], by [[W. E. Johns]]. Biggles made his first appearance in the story ''The White Fokker'', published in the first issue of ''[[Light Aircraft Association|Popular Flying]]'' magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, ''The Camels Are Coming'' (both 1932). Johns continued to write Biggles books until his death in 1968, the series eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes – including novels and short story collections – most of the latter with a common setting and time. These included novels about a woman pilot in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF), Flight Officer Joan Worralson, better known as "[[Worrals]]".

[[Geoffrey Trease]] and [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 1995, (p.&amp;nbsp;208–9)&lt;/ref&gt; brought a new sophistication to the historical adventure novel.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; [[Philip Pullman]] in the [[Sally Lockhart]] novels and [[Julia Golding]] in the [[Cat Royal]] series have continued the tradition of the historical adventure.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

==== Magazines and comics ====
An important aspect of British children's literature has been [[comic books]] and [[List of early-20th-century British children's magazines and annuals|magazines]]. Amongst the most popular comics have been ''[[The Dandy]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-19284222 BBC News, 16 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Beano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/pixar/11766202/Was-Pixars-Inside-Out-inspired-by-The-Beano.html ''The Telegraph'', 27 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Important early magazines or [[story papers]] for older children were the ''[[Boys Own Paper]]'', which was published from 1879 to 1967&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data071.html#BOYSOWNMAGAZINEUK Galatic Central]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Girl's Own Paper]]'' published from 1880 until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data207.html Galatic Central]&lt;/ref&gt; Other story papers for older boys were ''[[The Hotspur]]'' (1933 to 1959) and ''[[The Rover (story paper)|The Rover]]''–which started in 1922 and was absorbed into ''Adventure'' in 1961 and ''[[The Wizard (DC Comics)|The Wizard]]'' in 1963, and eventually folded in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishcomics.20m.com/home.htm British Comics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many prominent authors contributed to the ''Boys Own Paper'': [[cricket]]er [[W.G. Grace]] wrote for several issues, along with authors [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Jules Verne]] and [[R.M. Ballantyne]], as well as [[Robert Baden-Powell]], the inspiration for the [[Scout Movement]], Between 1941–61 there was 60 issues with stories about [[Biggles]] by [[W. E. Johns]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boysown.info/|title=Boys Own Paper featuring the work of Captain W E Johns|last=rogerharris@biggles.info|website=www.boysown.info|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1960s occasional contributors included [[Isaac Asimov]] and the respected astronomer [[Patrick Moore]].

Many contributors to ''The Girls Own Paper'' were not known outside the paper's pages but they also included [[Noel Streatfeild]], [[Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd]], [[Rosa Nouchette Carey]], [[Sarah Doudney]] (1841–1926), [[Angela Brazil]], [[Lucy Maud Montgomery]], [[Richmal Crompton]], [[Fanny Fern]], and [[Baroness Orczy]]. Between 1940–47 [[Captain W. E. Johns]] contributed sixty stories featuring the female pilot [[Worrals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.girlsown.info|title=Girls Own Paper featuring the work of Captain W E Johns|last=rogerharris@biggles.info|website=www.girlsown.info|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Eagle (British comics)|Eagle]]'' was a popular British comic for boys, launched in 1950 by [[Marcus Morris (publisher)|Marcus Morris]], an Anglican vicar from Lancashire. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sabin, ''Adult comics: an introduction'' (illustrated ed.), London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1993, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science museum"&gt;{{Citation | title = Dan Dare and the Birth of Hi-Tech Britain | url = http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/dan_dare.aspx | publisher = sciencemuseum.org.uk | accessdate = 19 June 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100721103622/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/dan_dare.aspx | archivedate = 21 July 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, "[[Dan Dare]], Pilot of the Future", created with meticulous attention to detail.&lt;ref name="ODNB Hampson"&gt;{{Citation | last = Varah | first = Chad | authorlink = Chad Varah | title = Hampson, Frank (1918–1985) | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | year = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31192 | accessdate = 16 June 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/31192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribute"&gt;{{Citation | title = A Tribute to Frank Hampson 1918–1985 | url = http://www.tameside.gov.uk/blueplaque/frankhampson | publisher = tameside.gov.uk | date = 12 September 2007 | accessdate = 24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times Hampson"&gt;{{Citation | last = Crompton | first = Alastair | title = Where Eagle dared | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/598/936/79880174w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS201560409&amp;dyn=5!xrn_10_0_CS201560409&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | publisher = ''The Times'', hosted at infotrac.galegroup.com | date = 25 October 1985 | page = 12 | issue = 62278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular stories included "Riders of the Range" and "P.C. 49".

Children's literature has been a part of American culture since Europeans first settled in America. The earliest books were used as tools to instill self-control in children and preach a life of morality in Puritan society. 18th-century American youth began to shift away from the social upbringing of its European counterpart, bringing about a change in children's literature. It was in this time that ''A Little Book for Little Children'' was written by T.W. in 1712. It includes what is thought to be the earliest nursery rhyme and one of the earliest examples of a text book approaching education from the child's point of view, rather than the adult's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bingham|author2=Scholt|title=Fifteen Centuries of Children's Literature|date=1980|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-22164-2|pages=99,107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous books of American children's literature is [[L. Frank Baum]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', published in 1900. "By combining the English fondness for word play with the American appetite for outdoor adventure", Connie Epstein in ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature'' says Baum "developed an original style and form that stands alone".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|479}} Baum wrote fourteen more Oz novels, and other writers continued the [[List of Oz books|Oz series]] into the twenty-first century.

Demand continued to grow in [[North America]] between World War I and World War II, helped by the growth of libraries in both Canada and the United States. Children's reading rooms in libraries, staffed by specially trained librarians, helped create demand for classic juvenile books. Reviews of children's releases began appearing regularly in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and in ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' magazine began to regularly publish reviews of children's releases, and the first Children's Book Week was launched in 1919. In that same year, [[Louise Seaman Bechtel]] became the first person to head a juvenile book publishing department in the country. She was followed by [[May Massee]] in 1922, and [[Alice Dalgliesh]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|479–480}}

The [[American Library Association]] began awarding the [[Newbery Medal]], the first children's book award, in 1922.&lt;ref name=newbery&gt;{{cite web|title=Newbery Awards|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caldecott Medal]] for illustration followed in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caldecott Medal Awards |url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/caldecotthonors/caldecottmedal#30s |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] about her life on the [[American frontier]], ''[[Little House in the Big Woods]]'' appeared in 1932.&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|471}} In 1937 [[Theodor Seuss Geisel|Dr. Seuss]] published his first book, entitled, ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]''. The [[young adult book]] market developed during this period, thanks to sports books by popular writer [[John R. Tunis]]', the novel ''[[Seventeenth Summer]]'' by [[Maureen Daly]], and the ''[[Sue Barton (juvenile series)|Sue Barton]]'' nurse book series by [[Helen Dore Boylston]].&lt;ref name=cart&gt;{{cite book|last=Cart|first=Michael|title=Young Adult Literature: From Romance to Realism|year=2010|publisher=[[ALA Editions]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4RJ8rOTTgC|isbn=978-0-8389-1045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

The already vigorous growth in children's books became a boom in the 1950s, and children's publishing became big business.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|481}} In 1952, American journalist [[E. B. White]] published ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'', which was described as "one of the very few books for young children that face, squarely, the subject of death".&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|467}} [[Maurice Sendak]] illustrated more than two dozen books during the decade, which established him as an innovator in book illustration.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|481}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] that began in 1957, provided increased interest and government money for schools and libraries to buy science and math books and the non-fiction book market "seemed to materialize overnight".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|482}}

The 1960s saw an age of new realism in children's books emerge. Given the atmosphere of social revolution in 1960s America, authors and illustrators began to break previously established taboos in children's literature. Controversial subjects dealing with alcoholism, death, divorce, and child abuse were now being published in stories for children. Maurice Sendak's ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'' in 1963 and [[Louise Fitzhugh]]'s ''[[Harriet the Spy]]'' in 1964 are often considered the first stories published in this new age of realism.&lt;ref name="Tunnell 80–86" /&gt;

[[Esther Forbes]] in ''[[Johnny Tremain]]'' (1943) and [[Mildred D. Taylor]] in ''[[Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry]]'' (1976) continued the tradition of the historical adventure in an American setting.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; The modern children's adventure novel sometimes deals with controversial issues like terrorism, as in [[Robert Cormier]]'s ''[[After the First Death]]'' in 1979, and warfare in the [[Third World]], as in [[Peter Dickinson]]'s ''AK'' in 1990.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

In books for a younger age group, Bill Martin and John Archambault's ''[[Chicka Chicka Boom Boom]]'' (1979) presented a new spin on the [[alphabet book]]. [[Laura Numeroff]] published ''[[If You Give a Mouse a Cookie]]'' in 1985 and went on to create a series of similarly named books that is still popular for children and adults to read together.

[[Lloyd Alexander]]'s [[The Chronicles of Prydain]] (1964-1968) was set in a fictionalized version of medieval Britain.

=== Continental Europe ===
The period from 1890 until [[World War I]] is considered the Golden Age of Children's Literature in [[Scandinavia]]. [[Erik Werenskiold]], [[Theodor Kittelsen]], and [[Dikken Zwilgmeyer]] were especially popular, writing folk and fairy tales as well as realistic fiction. The 1859 translation into English by [[George Webbe Dasent]] helped increase the stories' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hunt, (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 705,&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential and internationally most successful Scandinavian children's books from this period is [[Selma Lagerlöf]]s ''[[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils]]''. [[Astrid Lindgren]] (''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'') and [[Jostein Gaarder]] (''[[Sophie's World]]'') are two of the best-known Scandinavian writers internationally.

The interwar period saw a slow-down in output similar to Britain, although "one of the first mysteries written specifically for children," ''[[Emil and the Detectives]]'' by [[Erich Kästner]], was published in Germany in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Silvey, (editor) (2002). ''The Essential Guide to Children's Books and their Creators''. New York: Houghton Mifflin, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;  German writers [[Michael Ende]] (''[[The Neverending Story]]'') and [[Cornelia Funke]] (''[[Inkheart]]'') achieved international success with their fantasy books.

The period during and following World War II became the Classical Age of the picture book in Switzerland, with works by [[Alois Carigiet]], [[Felix Hoffmann (illustrator)|Felix Hoffmann]], and [[Hans Fischer (painter)|Hans Fischer]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hunt, (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis. pp. 683–685, 399, 692, 697, 750.&lt;/ref&gt; 1963 was the first year of the [[Bologna Children's Book Fair]] in Italy, which was described as "the most important international event dedicated to the children's publishing".&lt;ref name=bologna&gt;{{cite web|title=Italy {{!}} Bologna Children's Book Fair|url=http://culture360.org/event/italy-bologna-childrens-book-fair/|publisher=Culture360|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For four days it brings together writers, illustrators, publishers, and book buyers from around the world.&lt;ref name=bologna /&gt;

Swiss author Marcus Pfister's ''[[Rainbow Fish]]'' series has received international acclaim since 1992.

=== Russia and the Soviet Union ===
[[File:Stamp-russia2010-children-books-block.png|thumb|Postal stamp of Russia celebrating children's books.]]

[[Russian folktale]]s were collected by [[Aleksandr Afanasyev]] in his three volume ''Narodnye russkie skazki'', and a selection of these were published in ''Русские детские сказки'' (Russian Children's Fairy Tales) in 1871. By the 1860s, [[literary realism]] and non-fiction dominated children's literature. More schools were started, using books by writers like [[Konstantin Ushinsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose ''Russian Reader'' included an assortment of stories, fairy tales, and fables. Books written specifically for girls developed in the 1870s and 1880s. Publisher and journalist [[Evgenia Tur]] wrote about the daughters of well-to-do landowners, while [[Alexandra Nikitichna Annenskaya]]'s stories told of middle-class girls working to support themselves. [[Vera Zhelikhovsky]], [[Elizaveta Kondrashova]], and [[Nadezhda Lukhmanova]] also wrote for girls during this period.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|767}}

Children's non-fiction gained great importance in Russia at the beginning of the century. A ten-volume children's encyclopedia was published between 1913 and 1914. [[Vasily Avenarius]] wrote fictionalized biographies of important people like [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Alexander Pushkin]] around the same time, and scientists wrote for books and magazines for children. Children's magazines flourished, and by the end of the century there were 61. [[Lidia Charskaya]] and {{ill|Klavdiya Lukashevich|ru|Лукашевич, Клавдия Владимировна}} continued the popularity of girls' fiction. [[Realism (literature)|Realism]] took a gloomy turn by frequently showing the maltreatment of children from lower classes. The most popular boys' material was [[Sherlock Holmes]], and similar stories from detective magazines.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|768}}

The state took control of children's literature during the [[October Revolution]]. [[Maksim Gorky]] edited the first children's, ''Northern Lights'', under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule. People often label the 1920s as the Golden Age of Children's Literature in Russia.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|769}} [[Samuil Marshak]] led that literary decade as the "founder of (Soviet) children's literature".&lt;ref name=shray&gt;{{cite book|last=Shrayer|first=Maxim (editor)|title=An Anthology of Jewish-Russian Literature: 1801–1953|year=2007|publisher=[[M.

In 1932, professional writers in the Soviet Union formed the [[USSR Union of Writers]], which served as the writer's organization of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. With a children's branch, the official oversight of the professional organization brought children's writers under the control of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|state]] and the police. [[Communism|Communist principles]] like [[Common ownership|collectivism]] and [[solidarity]] became important themes in children's literature. Authors wrote biographies about revolutionaries like [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Pavlik Morozov]]. [[Alexander Belyayev]], who wrote in the 1920s and 1930s, became Russia's first [[science fiction]] writer.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|770}} According to Ben Hellman in the ''International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "war was to occupy a prominent place in juvenile reading, partly compensating for the lack of adventure stories", during the Soviet Period.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|771}} More political changes in Russia after [[World War II]] brought further change in children's literature. Today, the field is in a state of flux because some older authors are being rediscovered and others are being abandoned.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|772}}

The series is considered representative of Brazilian children's literature and the Brazilian equivalent to children's classics such as [[C. S. Lewis]], [[The Chronicles of Narnia]] and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]] series.{{according to whom|date=January 2017}} The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato's 1920 short story "A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado", and was later republished as the first chapter of "Reinações de Narizinho", which is the first novel of the series.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The main setting is the "Sítio do Picapau Amarelo", where a boy (Pedrinho), a girl (Narizinho) and their living and thinking anthropomorphic toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning. On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as [[Neverland]], the mythological [[Ancient Greece]], an underwater world known as "Reino das Águas Claras" (Clear Waters Kingdom), and even the outer space. The "Sítio" is often symbolized by the character of [[Emilia (Sítio do Picapau Amarelo)|Emília]], Lobato's most famous creation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Christian missionaries]] first established the [[Calcutta School-Book Society]] in the 19th century, creating a separate genre for children's literature in that country. Magazines and books for children in native languages soon appeared.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|808}} In the latter half of the century, [[Raja Shivprasad]] wrote several well-known books in [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|810}} A number of respected [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writers began producing [[Bengali literature]] for children including [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], who translated some stories and wrote others himself. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Rabindranath Tagore]] wrote plays, stories, and poems for children, including one work illustrated by painter [[Nandalal Bose]]. They worked from the end of the 19th century into the beginning of the 20th century. Tagore's work was later translated into English, with Bose's pictures.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811}} [[Behari Lal Puri]] was the earliest writer for children in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. His stories were [[Didacticism|didactic]] in nature.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|815}}

The first full-length children's book was ''Khar Khar Mahadev'' by [[Narain Dixit]], which was serialized in one of the popular children's magazines in 1957. Other writers include [[Premchand]], and poet [[Sohan Lal Dwivedi]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811}} In 1919, [[Sukumar Ray]] wrote and illustrated [[Nonsense verse|nonsense rhymes]] in the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language, and children's writer and artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]] finished ''Barngtarbratn''. Bengali children's literature flourished in the later part of the twentieth century. Educator [[Gijubhai Badheka]] published over 200 books in the [[Children's literature in Gujarati language]], and many of them are still popular.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|812}} Other popular Gujarati children's authors were [[Ramanlal Soni]] and [[Jivram Joshi]]. In 1957, political cartoonist [[K. Shankar Pillai]] founded the [[Children's Book Trust]] publishing company. The firm became known for high quality children's books, and many of them were released in several languages. One of the most distinguished writers is Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] in [[Oriya literature]], who wrote many good books for children, including ''Pari Raija'', ''Kuhuka Raija'', ''Panchatantra'', and ''Adi Jugara Galpa Mala''. He wrote biographies of many historical personalities, such as ''Kapila Deva''. In 1978, the firm organized a writers' competition to encourage quality children's writing. The following year, the Children's Book Trust began a writing workshop and organized the First International Children's Book Fair in [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|809}} Children's magazines, available in many languages, were widespread throughout India during this century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811–820}}

Originally, for centuries, stories were told by Africans in their native languages, many being told during social gatherings. Stories varied between mythic narratives dealing with creation and basic proverbs showcasing human wisdom. These narratives were passed down from generation to generation orally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shafii|first1=Zainab|title=Aesthetics of Children’s Literature in Nigeria: a Study of Selected Books|url=http://kubanni.abu.edu.ng:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/7940/1/AESTHETICS%20OF%20CHILDREN%E2%80%99S%20LITERATURE%20IN%20NIGERIA%20A%20STUDY%20OF%20SELECTED%20BOOKS.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805183328/http://kubanni.abu.edu.ng:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/7940/1/AESTHETICS%20OF%20CHILDREN%E2%80%99S%20LITERATURE%20IN%20NIGERIA%20A%20STUDY%20OF%20SELECTED%20BOOKS.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 August 2017|publisher=Zainab Shafii|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its Independence in 1960, Nigeria has witnessed a rise in the production of children's literature by its people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Umer|first1=Marie Linton|title=Children’s Literature in Nigeria Revolutionary Omissions|date=1997|pages=191–206|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18757421-90000224|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the past three decades contributing the most to the genre. Most children's books depict the African culture and lifestyle, and trace their roots to traditional folktales, riddles, and proverbs. Authors who have produced such works include [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Cyprian Ekwensi]], [[Amos Tutuola]], [[Flora Nwapa]], and [[Buchi Emecheta]]. Publishing companies also aided in the development of children's literature.

== Classification ==
Children's literature can be divided into categories, either according to [[Literary genre|genre]] or the intended age of the reader.
[[File:The return of Rama.jpg|thumb|A [[Abanindranath Tagore|Tagore]] illustration of a Hindu myth]]

=== By genre ===
A literary genre is a category of literary compositions. Genres may be determined by technique, tone, content, or length.  According to Anderson,&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson 2006&lt;/ref&gt; there are six categories of children's literature (with some significant subgenres):
* [[Picture books]], including concept books that teach the [[alphabet]] or [[counting]] for example, pattern books, and wordless books.
* [[Literature|Traditional literature]], including folktales, which convey the legends, customs, superstitions, and beliefs of people in previous civilizations. This genre can be further broken into subgenres: [[myth]]s, [[fable]]s, [[legend]]s, and [[fairy tale]]s
* [[Fiction]], including [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]], [[Literary realism|realistic fiction]], and [[historical fiction]]
* [[Non-fiction]]
* [[Biography]] and [[autobiography]]
* [[Poetry]] and verse.

=== By age category ===
The criteria for these divisions are vague, and books near a borderline may be classified either way. Books for younger children tend to be written in simple language, use large print, and have many illustrations. Books for older children use increasingly complex language, normal print, and fewer (if any) illustrations. The categories with an age range are listed below:
* [[Picture book]]s, appropriate for pre-readers or children ages 0–5.
* [[Early reader]] books, [[appropriate for children]] ages 5–7.  These books are often designed to help a child build his or her reading skills.
* [[Chapter book]]s, appropriate for children ages 7–12.
** Short chapter books, appropriate for children ages 7–9.
** Longer chapter books, appropriate for children ages 9–12.
* [[Young adult fiction]], appropriate for children ages 12–18.

== Illustration ==
[[File:orbispictus.JPG|thumb|A late 18th-century reprint of ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'' by [[Comenius]], the first children's picture book.]]

Pictures have always accompanied children's stories.&lt;ref name=lerer&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerer|first=Seth|title=Children's Literature: A Reader's History, from Aesop to Harry Potter|year=2008|publisher=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|320}} A [[papyrus]] from [[Diocese of Egypt (Late Antiquity)|Byzantine Egypt]], shows illustrations accompanied by the story of [[Hercules]]' labors.&lt;ref&gt;Cribiore, Raffaella, ''Gymnastics of the Mind'', pg. 139 [[Princeton University]], 2001, cited in Lerer, Seth, ''Children's Literature'', pg. 22, [[University of Chicago]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern children's books are [[illustration|illustrated]] in a way that is rarely seen in adult literature, except in [[graphic novel]]s. Generally, artwork plays a greater role in books intended for younger readers (especially pre-literate children). Children's picture books often serve as an accessible source of high quality art for young children. Even after children learn to read well enough to enjoy a story without illustrations, they continue to appreciate the occasional drawings found in chapter books.

According to Joyce Whalley in ''The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "an illustrated book differs from a book with [[illustration]]s in that a good illustrated book is one where the pictures enhance or add depth to the text."&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|221}} Using this definition, the first illustrated children's book is considered to be ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'' which was published in 1658 by the [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravian]] author [[Comenius]]. Acting as a kind of encyclopedia,''Orbis Pictus'' had a picture on every page, followed by the name of the object in [[Latin]] and German. It was translated into English in 1659 and was used in homes and schools around Europe and Great Britain for years.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|220}}

Early children's books, such as ''Orbis Pictus'', were illustrated by [[woodcut]], and many times the same image was repeated in a number of books regardless of how appropriate the illustration was for the story.&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|322}} Newer processes, including copper and steel [[engraving]] were first used in the 1830s. One of the first uses of [[Chromolithography]] (a way of making multi-colored prints) in a children's book was demonstrated in ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', published in Germany in 1845. English illustrator [[Walter Crane]] refined its use in children's books in the late 19th century. [[File:Crane frog4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Crane]]'s [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]] illustration for ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]'', 1874.]]

Another method of creating illustrations for children's books was [[etching]], used by [[George Cruikshank]] in the 1850s. By the 1860s, top artists were illustrating for children, including Crane, [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Kate Greenaway]], and [[John Tenniel]]. Most pictures were still black-and-white, and many color pictures were hand colored, often by children.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|224–226}} ''The Essential Guide to Children's Books and Their Creators'' credits Caldecott with "The concept of extending the meaning of text beyond literal visualization".&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|350}}

Twentieth-century artists such as [[Kay Nielson]], [[Edmund Dulac]], and [[Arthur Rackham]] produced illustrations that are still reprinted today.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|224–227}} Developments in printing capabilities were reflected in children's books. After World War II, [[Offset printing|offset lithography]] became more refined, and painter-style illustrations, such as [[Brian Wildsmith]]'s were common by the 1950s.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|233}}

== Scholarship ==
Professional organizations, dedicated publications, individual researchers and university courses conduct scholarship on children's literature. Scholarship in children's literature is primarily conducted in three different disciplinary fields: literary studies/cultural studies (literature and language departments and humanities), library and information science, and education. (Wolf, et al., 2011).

Typically, children's literature scholars from literature departments in universities (English, German, Spanish, etc. departments), cultural studies, or in the humanities conduct literary analysis of books. This [[literary criticism]] may focus on an author, a thematic or topical concern, genre, period, or literary device and may address issues from a variety of critical stances (poststructural, postcolonial, New Criticism, psychoanalytic, new historicism, etc.). Results of this type of research are typically published as books or as articles in scholarly journals.

The field of Library and Information Science has a long history of conducting research related to children's literature.

Most educational researchers studying children's literature explore issues related to the use of children's literature in classroom settings.  They may also study topics such as home use, children's out-of-school reading, or parents' use of children's books. Teachers typically use children's literature to augment classroom instruction.

Popular classics such as ''[[The Secret Garden]]'', ''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'', ''[[Peter Pan]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' have been criticized for their [[racial stereotyping]].&lt;ref name="cracked.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flood|first1=Alison|title=Pippi Longstocking books charged with racism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/09/pippi-longstocking-books-racism|website=the guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Byrd|first1=M.

The academic journal ''Children’s Literature Review'' provides critical analysis of many well known children’s books. In its 114th volume, the journal discuses the cultural stereotypes in Belgian cartoonist [[Herge]]’s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'' series in reference to its depiction of people from the Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Tintin|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=114|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the scramble for Africa which occurred between the years of 1881 and 1914 there was a large production of children's literature which attempted to create an illusion of what life was like for those who lived on the African continent. This was a simple technique in deceiving those who only relied on stories and secondary resources. Resulting in a new age of books which put a “gloss” on imperialism and its teachings at the time. Thus encouraging the idea that the colonies who were part of the African continent were perceived as animals, savages and un human like. Therefor needing cultured higher class Europeans to share their knowledge and resources with the locals. Also promoting the idea that the people within these places were as exotic as the locations themselves.  &lt;blockquote&gt;Examples of these books include:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Lou lou chez les negres (1929) - lou lou among the blacks
* Baba Diène et Morceau de sucre (1939)
* Original Barbar series promoting the french civilizing mission
* TINTIN au Congo (1931) - Where Tintin goes to teach lessons in Congo about their country, Belgium

Writer Mary Renck Jalongo In ''Young Children and Picture Books'' discusses damaging stereotypes of [[Native Americans in children's literature]], stating repeated depictions of indigenous people as living in the 1800s with feathers and face paint cause children to mistake them as fictional and not as people that still exist today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jalongo|first1=Mary Renck|title=Young Children and Picture Books|date=2004|publisher=National Association for the Education of Young Children|location=Washington, DC|page=39|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depictions of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people in [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]’s ''[[Little House on the Prairie]]'' and [[J.M.

In the French illustrator [[Jean de Brunhoff]]’s 1931 picture book ''Histoire de Babar, le petit elephant (The Story of [[Babar the Elephant|Babar]], The Little Elephant)'', prominent themes of [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] have been noted and identified as propaganda.

A. Rey]] and [[Margret Rey]]’s ''[[Curious George]]'' first published in 1941 has been criticized for its blatant slave and colonialist narratives. Critics claim the man with the yellow hat represents a colonialist poacher of European descent who kidnaps George, a monkey from Africa, and sends him on a ship to America. Details such as the man in colonialist uniform and Curious George's lack of tail are points in this argument. In an article, ''The Wall Street Journal'' interprets it as a "barely disguised slave narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=John J.|title=Curious George's Journey to the Big Scree|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113883544357862588|website=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munson|first1=Kyle|title=Does monkey tale speak of slavery?|url=http://archive.desmoinesregister.com/article/20060210/LIFE01/602100343/Munson-Does-monkey-tale-speak-slavery-|website=The Des Moines Register|publisher=The Des Moines Register|accessdate=8 December 2015|df=}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peacock|first1=Scot|last2=Marion|first2=Allison|title=Margret and H.

=== Gender roles and representation of women ===
Some of the earliest children’s stories that contain feminist themes are [[Louisa May Alcott]]’s ''[[Little Women]]'' and [[Frank L. Baum]]’s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. With many women of this period being represented in children’s books as doing housework, these two books deviated from this pattern. Drawing attention to the perception of housework as oppressive is one of the earliest forms of the feminist movement. ''Little Women'', a story about four sisters, is said to show power of women in the home and is seen as both conservative and radical in nature. The character of Jo is observed as having a rather contemporary personality and has even been seen as a representation of the feminist movement. It has been suggested that the feminist themes in ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' result from influence of Baum's mother-in law, [[Matilda Gage]], an important figure in the [[suffragist]] movement. Baum's significant political commentary on capitalism, and racial oppression are also said to be part of Gage's influence. Examples made of these themes is the main protagonist, [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] who is punished by being made to do housework. Another example made of positive representations of women is in Finnish author [[Tove Jansson]]'s [[Moomin]] series which features strong and individualized female characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=18–20, 25–45 &amp; 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a surge in the production and availability of [[feminist children's literature]] as well as a rise in [[gender neutrality]] in children's literature.

In addition to perpetuating stereotypes about appropriate behavior and occupations for women and girls, children's books frequently lack female characters entirely, or include them only as minor or unimportant characters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the book ''Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics'', scholar [[Alison Lurie]] says most adventure novels of the 20th century, with few exceptions, contain boy protagonists while female characters in books such as those by [[Dr. Seuss]], would typically be assigned the gender-specific roles of receptionists and nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=43 &amp; 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' characters written by [[A. A. Milne]], are primarily male, with the exception of the character [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]], who is a mother to [[Roo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even animals and inanimate objects are usually identified as being male in children's books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The near-absence of significant female characters is paradoxical because of the role of women in creating children's literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the one hand ''Growing up with Dick and Jane'' highlights the heterosexual, [[nuclear family]] and also points out the gender-specific duties of the mother, father, brother and sister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kismaric|first1=Carole|last2=Heiferman|first2=Marvin|title=Growing up with Dick and Jane: Learning and Living the American Dream|date=1996|publisher=Collins San Francisco,|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Young Children and Picture Books'', on the other hand, encourages readers to avoid books with women who are portrayed as inactive and unsuccessful as well as intellectually inferior and subservient to their fellow male characters to avoid children’s books that have repressive and [[sexist]] stereotypes for women.&lt;ref name="Young Children and Picture Books" /&gt;

In her book ''Children’s Literature: From the fin de siècle to the new millennium'', professor Kimberley Reynolds claims gender division stayed in children's books prominently until the 1990s. She also says that [[capitalism]] encourages gender-specific marketing of books and toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, adventure stories have been identified as being for boys and domestic fiction intended for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Deborah Cogan|last2=Webb|first2=Jean|title=Introducing Children's Literature: From Romanticism to Postmodernism. London: Routledge|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Publishers often believe that boys will not read stories about girls, but that girls will read stories about both boys and girls; therefore, a story that features male characters is expected to sell better.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Why are there so few girls in children’s books?|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/08/why-are-there-so-few-girls-in-childrens-books/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2016-01-08|access-date = 2016-01-09|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Jennie|last = Yabroff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in appealing to boys is also seen in the Caldecott awards, which tend to be presented to books that are believed to appeal to boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reynolds also says that both boys and girls have been presented by limited representations of appropriate behaviour, identities and careers through the illustrations and text of children’s literature. She argues girls have traditionally been marketed books that prepare them for domestic jobs and motherhood. Conversely, boys are prepared for leadership roles and war.&lt;ref name="Northcote House"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 20th century, more than 5,000 children's picture books were published in the U.S; during that time, male characters outnumbered female characters by more than 3 to 2, and male animals outnumbered female animals by 3 to 1.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=Janice|last2=Fairchild|first2=Emily|last3=Grauerholz|first3=Liz|last4=Pescosolido|first4=Bernice A.|last5=Tope|first5=Daniel|date=31 March 2011|title=Gender in Twentieth-Century Children’s Books:  Patterns of Disparity in Titles and Central Characters|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243211398358|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=25|issue=2|pages=197–226|issn=0891-2432|lay-url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/08/why-are-there-so-few-girls-in-childrens-books|lay-source=Why are there so few girls in children's books?|lay-date=8 January 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No children's picture book that featured a protagonist with an identifiable gender contained only female characters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''I’m Glad I’m a Boy! I’m Glad I’m a Girl!'' (1970) by [[Whitney Darrow Jr.]] was criticized for its narrow depictions of careers for both boys and girls. The book informs the reader that boys are doctors, policemen, pilots, and Presidents while girls are nurses, meter maids, stewardesses and First Ladies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Popova|first1=Maria|title=I’m Glad I’m a Boy!

In his article, entitled “Gender Equality: A Case Study of Janaki Sooriyarachichi’s Picture Book ''The Flying Train'',” Dr. Mehdi Ghasemi draws attention to the ways Janaki Sooriyarachchi – the writer and illustrator of ''The Flying Train'' – validates feminine and masculine voices and visions and balances gender issues both in the story book's narratives and illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Ghasemi, Mehdi. “Gender Equality: A Case Study of Janaki Sooriyarachichi’s Picture Book The Flying Train.” Libri &amp; Liberi, vol. 3 (1), 2014: 43-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate over controversial content ===

A widely discussed and debated topic by critics and publishers in the children’s book industry is whether outdated and offensive content, specifically racial stereotypes, should be changed upon the printing of new editions. Some question if certain books should be banned&lt;ref name="Adios Barbie" /&gt; while others believe original content should remain but publishers should make additions that guide parents in conversations with their children about the problematic elements of the particular story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Kavitha|title=Are some children's classics unsuitable for kids?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jul/22/childrens-classics-unsuitable-kids|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marche|first1=Stephen|title=How to Read a Racist Book to Your Kids|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/magazine/how-to-read-a-racist-book-to-your-kids.html?_r=3|website=The New York Times Magazine|publisher=The New York Times Magazine|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see racist stereotypes as cultural artifacts that should be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Children’s Culture Reader'', scholar [[Henry Jenkins]] references [[Herbert Kohl]]’s essay ''Should We Burn Babar?'' which raises the debate whether children should be educated on how to think critically towards oppressive ideologies rather than ignore historical mistakes. Jenkins suggests that parents and educators should trust children to make responsible judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Henry|title=The Children's Cultural Reader|date=1998|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York and London|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some books have been altered in newer editions and significant changes can be seen, such as illustrator [[Richard Scarry]]’s book ''[[Best Word Book Ever]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ha|first1=Thu-Huong|title=Spot the difference: This update to a classic children’s book reimagines gender roles|url=http://qz.com/545860/richard-scarrys-update-to-a-classic-childrens-book-reimagines-gender-roles-for-boys-and-girls/|website=Quartz|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roald Dahl]]’s book ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''.&lt;ref name="The New York Times Magazine" /&gt; In other cases classics have been rewritten into updated versions by new authors and illustrators. Several versions of ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'' have been remade as more appropriate and without prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jalongo|first1=Mary Renck|title=Young Children and Picture Books|date=2004|publisher=National Association for the Education of Young Children|location=Washington, DC|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on early childhood development ===

[[Bruno Bettelheim]] in ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'', uses [[psychoanalysis]] to examine the impact that [[fairy tales]] have on the developing child. Bettelheim states the unconscious mind of a child is affected by the ideas behind a story, which shape their perception and guides their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bettelheim|first1=Bruno|title=The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=United States|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, author and illustrator [[Anthony Browne (author)|Anthony Browne]] contends the early viewing of an image in a [[picture book]] leaves an important and lasting impression on a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research, a child’s most crucial individual characteristics are developed in their first five years. Their environment and interaction with images in picture books have a profound impact on this development and are intended to inform a child about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacCann|first1=Donnarae|last2=Richard|first2=Olga|title=The child's first books; a critical study of pictures and texts|date=1973|publisher=Wilson|location=New York|page=1 &amp; 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children’s literature critic [[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Peter Hunt]] argues that no book is innocent of harbouring an [[ideology]] of the culture it comes from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Peter|title=Literature for Children Contemporary Criticism|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics discuss how an author’s ethnicity, gender and social class inform their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nodelman|first1=Perry|title=The Hidden Adult: Defining Children's Literature|date=2008|publisher=Johns Hopkins United Press|location=Baltimore|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Kimberley Reynolds suggests books can never be neutral as their nature is intended as instructional and by using its language, children are imbedded with the values of that society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming childhood as a culturally constructed concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds states that it is through children’s literature that a child learns how to behave and to act as a child should, according to the expectations of their culture. She also attributes [[capitalism]], in certain societies, as a prominent means of instructing especially middle class children in how to behave.&lt;ref name="Northcote House" /&gt; The "image of childhood"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is said to be created and perpetuated by adults to affect children "at their most susceptible age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Egoff|first1=Sheila A.|title=Thursday's Child: Trends and Patterns in Contemporary Children's Literature|date=1981|publisher=American Library Association|location=Chicago, Ill|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kate Greenaway]]’s illustrations are used as an example of imagery intended to instruct a child in the proper way to look and behave.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In [[Roberta Seelinger Trites]]'s book ''Disturbing the Universe: Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature'', she also argues adolescence is a social construct established by ideologies present in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trites|first1=Roberta Seelinger|title=Disturbing the Universe Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature|date=2000|publisher=U of Iowa|location=Iowa City|page=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study ''The First R: How Children Learn About Race and Racism'', researcher Debra Ausdale studies children in multi-ethnic daycare centres. Ausdale claims children as young as three have already entered into and begun experimenting with the race ideologies of the adult world. She asserts racist attitudes are assimilated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ausdale|first1=Debra|last2=Feagin|first2=Joe R.|title=The First R: How Children Learn Race and Racism|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md}}&lt;/ref&gt; using interactions children have with books as an example of how children internalize what they encounter in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ausdale|first1=Debra|last2=Feagin|first2=Joe R.|title=The First R: How Children Learn Race and Racism|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md|pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30184">The '''creative industries''' refers to a range of economic activities which are concerned with the generation or exploitation of knowledge and information. They may variously also be referred to as the [[cultural industry|cultural industries]] (especially in Europe {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=14}} or the creative economy {{harv|Howkins|2001}}, and most recently they have been denominated as the Orange Economy in Latin America and the Caribbean ([http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896 Buitrago &amp; Duque 2013]).

Howkins' creative economy comprises [[advertising]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[crafts]], [[design]], [[fashion]], [[film industry|film]], [[music industry|music]], [[performing arts]], [[publishing]], [[research and development|R&amp;D]], [[software]], [[toy]]s and [[game]]s, [[Television|TV]] and [[radio]], and [[video game]]s {{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}. Some scholars consider that education industry, including public and private services, is forming a part of creative industry.&lt;ref&gt;Kultur &amp; Kommunikation for Nordic Innovation Centre (2007), [http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2008/Creative%20Industries%20education%20in%20the%20Nordic%20countries%20-%20A%20brief%20portrait.pdf "Creative Industries Education in the Nordic Countries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518105107/http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2008/Creative%20Industries%20education%20in%20the%20Nordic%20countries%20-%20A%20brief%20portrait.pdf |date=2015-05-18 }}; Mœglin, Pierre (2001), Les Industries éducatives, Paris, Puf&lt;/ref&gt; There remain, therefore, different definitions of the sector {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv| DCMS| 2006}}.

The creative industries have been seen to become increasingly important to economic well-being, proponents suggesting that "[[human creativity]] is the ultimate economic resource" {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002|p=xiii}}, and that "the industries of the twenty-first century will depend increasingly on the generation of knowledge through creativity and innovation" {{Harv|Landry|Bianchini|1995|p=4}}.

==Definitions==
Various commentators have provided varying suggestions on what activities to include in the concept of "creative industries" {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}{{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|pp=11–12}}, and the name itself has become a contested issue – with significant differences and overlap between the terms "creative industries", "cultural industries" and "creative economy" {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|pp=11–14}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|p=12}}.

Lash and Urry suggest that each of the creative industries has an "irreducible core" concerned with "the exchange of finance for rights in [[intellectual property]]", {{harv|Lash|Urry|1994|p=117}}. This echoes the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS) definition which describes the creative industries as:

:"those industries which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property" {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}

{{As of | 2015}} the DCMS definition recognizes nine ''creative sectors'', namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/394668/Creative_Industries_Economic_Estimates_-_January_2015.pdf|title=Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport – Creative Industries Economic Estimates January 2015|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=13 January 2015|website=gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=16 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210124534/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/394668/Creative_Industries_Economic_Estimates_-_January_2015.pdf|archivedate=10 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Advertising]] and [[marketing]]
# [[Architecture]] &lt;!--and [[landscaping]] (e.g. [https://www.salford.gov.uk/d/Development_Prospectus.pdf Development prospectus])--&gt;
# [[Crafts]]
# [[Design]]: [[product design|product]], [[graphic design|graphic]] and [[fashion design]]&lt;!--(see also [[communication design]])--&gt;
# [[film]], [[Television|TV]], [[Videography|video]], [[radio]] and [[photography]]
# [[Information technology|IT]], [[software engineering|software]] and [[computer services]]
# [[Publishing]]
# [[Museum]]s, [[art gallery|galleries]] and [[libraries]]
# [[Music industry|Music]], [[performing arts|performing]] and [[visual arts]]

To this list [[John Howkins]] would add [[toys]] and games, also including the much broader area of [[research and development]] in science and technology {{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}. It has also been argued{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that [[gastronomy]] belongs in such a list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macedefence.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/does-cuisine-have-a-place-in-the-creative-economy-and-what-role-does-creative-leadership-play-in-its-production/|title=Does cuisine have a place in the Creative Economy and what role does Creative Leadership play in its production?|author=|date=18 May 2011|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503134414/https://macedefence.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/does-cuisine-have-a-place-in-the-creative-economy-and-what-role-does-creative-leadership-play-in-its-production/|archivedate=3 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various fields of [[engineering]] do not appear on this list, that emerged from the DCMS reports. This was due, probably, to the fact that engineers occupy relevant positions in "non-cultural" corporations, performing activities of project, management, operation, maintenance, risk analysis and supervision, among others. However, historically and presently, several tasks of engineers can be regarded as highly creative, inventive and innovative. The contribution of engineering is represented by new products, processes and services.

Hesmondhalgh reduces the list to what he terms "the core cultural industries" of [[advertising]] and marketing, [[broadcasting]], [[Film industry|film]], internet and [[Music industry|music]] industries, [[publishing|print]] and [[electronic publishing]], and [[computer games|video and computer games]]. His definition only includes those industries that create "texts"' or "cultural artefacts" and which engage in some form of industrial reproduction {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|pp=12–14}}.

The DCMS list has proven influential, and many other nations{{which|date=June 2013}} have formally adopted it. It has also been criticised. It has been argued{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that the division into sectors obscures a divide between [[lifestyle business]], non-profits, and larger businesses, and between those who receive state subsidies (e.g., film) and those who do not (e.g., computer games). The inclusion of the antiques trade often comes into question, since it does not generally involve production (except of reproductions and fakes). The inclusion of all computer services has also been questioned {{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=13}}.

Some areas, such as [[Hong Kong]], have preferred to shape their policy around a tighter focus on copyright ownership in the [[value chain]]. They adopt the [[WIPO]]'s classifications, which divide up the creative industries according to who owns the copyrights at various stages during the production and distribution of creative content.

The [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) has denominated them for Latin America and the Caribbean as the Orange Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896|title=The Orange Economy: An Infinite Opportunity|first1=Buitrago Restrepo, Pedro|last1=Felipe|first2=Duque Márquez,|last2=Iván|date=1 October 2013|website=iadb.org|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110092916/http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as the "group of linked activities through which ideas are transformed into cultural goods and services whose value is determined by intellectual property."

Others{{who|date=June 2013}} have suggested a distinction between those industries that are open to mass production and distribution (film and video; videogames; broadcasting; publishing), and those that are primarily craft-based and are meant to be consumed in a particular place and moment ([[visual arts]]; [[performing arts]]; cultural heritage).

==How creative workers are counted==
The DCMS classifies enterprises and occupations as creative according to what the enterprise primarily produces, and what the worker primarily does. Thus, a company which produces records would be classified as belonging to the music [[industrial sector]], and a worker who plays piano would be classified as a [[musician]].

The primary purpose of this is to quantify – for example it can be used to count the number of firms, and the number of workers, creatively employed in any given location, and hence to identify places with particularly high concentrations of creative activities.

It leads to some complications which are not immediately obvious. For example, a security guard working for a music company would be classified as a creative employee, although not as creatively occupied.

The total number of creative employees is then calculated as the sum of:

* All workers employed in creative industries, whether or not creatively occupied (e.g. all musicians, security guards, cleaners, accountants, managers, etc. working for a record company)
* All workers that are creatively occupied, and are not employed in creative industries (for example, a piano teacher in a school). This includes people whose second job is creative, for example somebody who does weekend [[Gig (musical performance)|gigs]], writes books, or produces artwork in their spare time

==Properties or characteristics==
[[File:Township Cat.JPG|thumb|200px|A toy cat produced in a South-African township, made from used plastic bags and old wire]]

According to Caves (2000), creative industries are characterized by seven economic properties:

#''Nobody knows principle'': Demand uncertainty exists because the consumers' reaction to a product are neither known beforehand, nor easily understood afterward.
#''Art for art's sake'': Workers care about originality, technical professional skill, harmony, etc. of creative goods and are willing to settle for lower wages than offered by 'humdrum' jobs.
#''Motley crew principle'': For relatively complex creative products (e.g., films), the production requires diversely skilled inputs. Each skilled input must be present and perform at some minimum level to produce a valuable outcome.
#''Infinite variety'': Products are differentiated by quality and uniqueness; each product is a distinct combination of inputs leading to infinite variety options (e.g., works of creative writing, whether poetry, novel, screenplays or otherwise).
#''A list/B list'': Skills are vertically differentiated. Artists are ranked on their skills, originality, and proficiency in creative processes and/or products. Small differences in skills and talent may yield huge differences in (financial) success.
#''Time flies'': When coordinating complex projects with diversely skilled inputs, time is of the essence.
#''Ars longa'': Some creative products have durability aspects that invoke [[copyright]] protection, allowing a creator or performer to collect rents.

The properties described by Caves have been criticized for being too rigid (Towse, 2000). Not all creative workers are purely driven by 'art for art's sake'. The 'ars longa' property also holds for certain noncreative products (i.e., licensed products). The 'time flies' property also holds for large construction projects. Creative industries are therefore not unique, but they score generally higher on these properties relative to non-creative industries.

==Difference from the 'cultural industries'==
There is often a question about the boundaries between creative industries and the similar term of '''[[Cultural industry|cultural industries]]'''. Cultural industries are best described as an adjunct-sector of the creative industries. Cultural industries include industries that focus on [[cultural tourism]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[museum]]s and [[Library|libraries]], [[sports]] and [[outdoor activities]], and a variety of 'way of life' activities that arguably range from local pet shows to a host of [[Hobbies|hobbyist]] concerns. Thus cultural industries are more concerned about delivering other kinds of value—including cultural wealth and social wealth—rather than primarily providing monetary value. (See also [[Cultural Institutions Studies|cultural institutions studies]].)

==The creative class==
Some authors, such as the American [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]], argue for a wider focus on the products of [[knowledge workers]], and judge the '[[creative class]]' (his own term) to include nearly all those offering professional knowledge-based services.

===The creative class and diversity===
Florida's focus leads him to pay particular attention to the nature of the creative [[workforce]]. In a study of why particular US cities such as San Francisco seem to attract creative producers, Florida argues that a high proportion of workers from the '[[creative class]]' provide a key input to creative production, which enterprises seek out. He seeks to quantitatively establish the importance of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and [[multiculturalism]] in the cities concerned, for example the existence of a significant public gay community, ethnic and religious variety, and tolerance. {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002}}

==Economic contribution==
Globally, Creative Industries excluding software and general scientific [[research and development]] are said to have accounted for around 4% of the world's economic output in 1999, which is the last year for which comprehensive figures are currently available. Estimates of the output corresponding to scientific [[Research and Development]] suggest that an additional 4-9% might be attributable to the sector if its definition is extended to include such activities, though the figures vary significantly between different countries.

Taking the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as an example, in the context of other sectors, the creative industries make a far more significant contribution to output than [[hospitality]] or [[utilities]] and deliver four times the output due to [[agriculture]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. In terms of employment and depending on the definition of activities included, the sector is a major employer of between 4-6% of the UK's [[working population]], though this is still significantly less than employment due to traditional areas of work such as [[retail]] and [[manufacturing]].

Within the creative industries sector and again taking the UK as an example, the three largest sub-sectors are [[design]], [[publishing]], and [[television]] and [[radio]]. Together these account for around 75% of revenues and 50% of employment.

The complex [[supply chains]] in the creative industries sometimes make it challenging to calculate accurate figures for the [[gross value added]] by each sub-sector. This is particularly the case for the service-focused sub-sectors such as [[advertising]], whereas it is more straightforward in product-focused sub-sectors such as [[crafts]]. Not surprisingly, perhaps, competition in product-focused areas tends to be more intense with a tendency to drive the production end of the supply chain to become a [[commodity business]].

There may be a tendency for publicly funded creative industries development services to inaccurately estimate the number of creative businesses during the mapping process. There is also imprecision in nearly all tax code systems that determine a person's profession, since many creative people operate simultaneously in multiple roles and jobs.  Both these factors mean that official statistics relating to the Creative Industries should be treated with caution.

The creative industries in Europe make a significant contribution to the EU economy, creating about 3% of EU GDP – corresponding to an annual market value of €500 billion – and employing about 6 million people. In addition, the sector plays a crucial role in fostering innovation, in particular for devices and networks. The EU records the second highest TV viewing figures globally, producing more films than any other region in the world. In that respect, the newly proposed [[Creative Europe|'Creative Europe' programme]] (July 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/index_en.htm|title=Creative Europe - European Commission|author=|date=|website=Creative Europe|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430180132/http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/index_en.htm|archivedate=30 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will help preserve cultural heritage while increasing the circulation of creative works inside and outside the EU. The programme will play a consequential role in stimulating cross border co-operation, promoting peer learning and making these sectors more professional. The Commission will then propose a financial instrument run by the European Investment Bank to provide debt and equity finance for cultural and creative industries. The role of the non-state actors within the governance regarding Medias will not be neglected anymore. Therefore, building a new approach extolling the crucial importance of a European level playing field industry may boost the adoption of policies aimed at developing a conducive environment, enabling European companies as well as citizens to use their imagination and creativity – both sources of innovation -, and therefore of competitiveness and sustainability. It supposes to tailor the regulatory and institutional frameworks in supporting private-public collaboration, in particular in the Medias sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }} with Violaine Hacker&lt;/ref&gt; The EU therefore plans to develop clusters, financing instruments as well as foresight activities to support this sector. The European Commission wishes to assist European creators and audiovisual enterprises to develop new markets through the use of digital technology, and asks how policy-making can best help achieve this. A more entrepreneurial culture will have to take hold with a more positive attitude towards risk-taking, and a capacity to innovate anticipating future trends. Creativity plays an important role in human resource management as artists and creative professionals can [[Lateral thinking|think laterally]]. Moreover, new jobs requiring new skills created in the post-crisis economy should be supported by labour mobility to ensure that people are employed wherever their skills are needed.

===In the US===
In the introduction to a 2013 special issue of ''Work and Occupations'' on artists in the US workforce, the guest editors argue that by examining the work lives of artists, one can identify characteristics and actions that help both individual workers and policy makers adapt to changing economic conditions.  Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper cite multiple sources to suggest artists' skill sets allow them to "work beyond existing markets and create entirely new opportunities for themselves and others".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), [http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506232653/http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html |date=2015-05-06 }}, in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Lingo and Tepper suggest artistic workers are "catalysts of change and innovation" because they "face special challenges managing ambiguity, developing and sustaining a relative identity, and forming community in the context of an individually based enterprise economy" (2013). Because of these adaptive skills, the suggestion is that "studying how artists cope with uncertainty and the factors that influence their success should be relevant for understanding these broader social and economic trends facing today's (and tomorrow's) workforce."&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), [http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506232653/http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html |date=2015-05-06 }} in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of artist-as-change-agent changes the questions researchers ask of creative economies. Old research questions would focus on topics like "skills, work practices, contracts, wage differentials, employment incentives, formal credentials, employment pipelines, and labor flows of differentiated occupational categories". Examples of new questions include:
# How do artists both create changes in the labor market itself and the way cultural work is done?
# What is their process of innovation and enterprise?
# What is the nature of their work and the resources they draw upon?
# How do different network structures produce different opportunity spaces?
# How do artistic workers create and manage planned serendipity—the spaces and exchanges that produce unexpected collaborations and opportunities? 
# How do creative workers broker and synthesize across occupational, genre, geographic, and industry boundaries to create new possibilities? (Tepper &amp; Lingo, 2013)&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Wider role==
As some first world countries struggle to compete in traditional markets such as [[manufacturing]], many now see the creative industry as a key component in a new [[knowledge economy]], capable perhaps of delivering [[urban regeneration]], often through initiatives linked to exploitation of [[cultural heritage]] that leads to increased [[tourism]]. It is often argued that, in future, the ideas and imagination of countries like the [[United Kingdom]] will be their greatest asset; in support of this argument, a number of universities in the UK have started to offer [[creative entrepreneurship]] as a specific area for study and research. Indeed, UK government figures reveal that the UK's creative industries account for over a million jobs and brought in £112.5 billion to the UK economy (DCMS ''Creative Industries Mapping Document'' 2001), although the data sets underlying these figures are open to question.

In recent years, creative industries have become 'increasingly attractive to governments outside the developed world'.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stuart, Ryan, Mark David, Keane, Michael &amp; Ordonez, Diego (2008), ‘Financing Creative Industries in Developing Countries’, in Diana Barrowclough and Zeljka Kozul-Wright eds, [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/17984/1/17984.pdf "Creative Industries and Developing Countries: Voice, Choice and Economic Growth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050038/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/17984/1/17984.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, Routledge, London and New York, pp. 65-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) XI High Level Panel on Creative Industries and Development commissioned several studies to identify challenges and opportunities facing the growth and development of creative industries in developing industries. As Cunningham ''et al.'' (2009) put it, 'the harnessing of creativity brings with it the potential of new wealth creation, the cultivation of local talent and the generation of creative capital, the development of new export markets, significant multiplier effects throughout the broader economy, the utilisation of information communication technologies and enhanced competitiveness in an increasingly global economy'. A key driver of interest in creative industries and development is the acknowledgement that the value of creative production resides in ideas and individual creativity, and developing countries have rich cultural traditions and pools of creative talent which lay a basic foundation for creative enterprises. Reflecting the growing interest in the potential of creative industries in developing countries, in October 2011 a Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy was created within the Indonesian government with well-known economist [[Mari Pangestu|Dr Mari Pangestu]] appointed as the first minister to hold the position.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6091">'''Dancing England''' was a series of showcase traditional dance concerts held at the Derby Assembly Rooms from 1979 to 1987. They were devised and curated by Phil Heaton and John Shaw, members of the Black Cap Sword Dancers, and two very notable characters on the Nottingham and Derby folk and dance scene of the 1970s. Dancing England was set up to showcase the best of traditional dance in the UK, along with unique and/or interesting folk customs to celebrate the UK's wide cultural heritage.

==Dancing England gone by==

In 1979 Phil and John of Black Cap decided to hold a 'Feast' and invite the best dancers from across the UK as their guests, and so the idea of Dancing England was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-nut.net/articles/phil.php] The Nut on the Web. Retrieved on 2016-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was held in the evening and consisted of a series of performances by dance teams across all the styles of UK traditional dance; [[Morris dance|Cotswold Morris]], [[Rapper sword]], [[Long Sword dance|Longsword]], North West, [[Clog dance (British)|step clog dancing]], [[Border Morris|Border]], [[Molly dance|Molly]], and much more. There were also performances by [[Mummers play|mummers]] and [[Pace Egg play|Pace Eggers]], musicians and from some of the more idiosyncratic traditional teams; notably [[Britannia Coco-nut Dancers|The Britannia Coconut Dancers]], [[Abbots Bromley Horn Dance|Abbotts Bromley Horn Dancers]] and the [[Whittlesey#Whittlesea Straw Bear|Whittlesey Straw Bear]]. There were stalls selling music, ephemera and crafts, films, workshops and talks. The event was refreshed with plenty of real ale, and finished with a ceilidh late at night.

==Daughter of Dancing England==

After Dancing England came to an end in 1987, there was a brief reprise in 1993 at the same venue for the Daughter of Dancing England event. This only ran for one year, and both Dancing England and Daughter of same were sadly missed.

==The Dancing England Rapper Tournament (DERT)==

Dancing England featured a rapper sword competition in the afternoon prior to the evening concert, in homage to the Newcastle Tournament of Music and Art which was held in the city from just after the Great War until the 1950s. Following the sad demise of Dancing England in 1987, the competition continued under the name of [[Dancing England Rapper Tournament|DERT]] and now travels around the country being hosted by a different rapper sword team every year.

==The modern Dancing England Series, 2017 onwards==

2019 - Nottingham Playhouse; Saturday 26th January 2019

2017 - Sheffield City Hall; Saturday 18 February 2017.

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Dance of Death (CCLXIIIIv).jpg|thumb|right|''The Dance of Death'' (1493) by [[Michael Wolgemut]], from the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' of [[Hartmann Schedel]]]]

The '''''Danse Macabre''''' (from the [[French language]]), also called the '''''Dance of Death''''', is an artistic genre of [[allegory]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]] on the universality of [[death]]: no matter one's station in life, the Dance Macabre unites all.

The Danse Macabre consists of the dead or a [[Death (personification)|personification of death]] summoning representatives from all walks of life to dance along to the [[grave]], typically with a [[pope]], [[emperor]], [[monarch|king]], [[child]], and [[laborer]]. They were produced as [[memento mori|mementos mori]], to remind people of the fragility of their lives and how vain were the glories of earthly life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04617a.htm | title=Dance of Death | date=2007-02-20 | work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins are postulated from illustrated sermon texts; the earliest recorded visual scheme was a now-lost mural at [[Holy Innocents' Cemetery]] in Paris dating from 1424 to 1425.

==Paintings==
The earliest recorded visual example is the lost mural on the south wall of the cemetery of the Holy Innocents in Paris, which was painted in 1424-25 during the regency of [[John, Duke of Bedford]]: with its emphatic inclusion of a dead crowned king at a time when France did not have a crowned king, the mural may well have had a political subtext.&lt;ref&gt;Oosterwijk (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; There were also painted schemes in [[Basel]] (the earliest dating from c.1440); a series of paintings on canvas by [[Bernt Notke]], in [[Lübeck]] (1463); the initial fragment of the original Bernt Notke painting (accomplished at the end of the 15th century) in the [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn|St Nicholas' Church]], [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] ([[Danse Macabre (Notke)|Danse Macabre]]); the painting at the back wall of the chapel of Sv. Marija na Škrilinama in the [[Istria]]n town of Beram (1471), painted by Vincent of [[Kastav]]; the painting in the [[Holy Trinity Church (Hrastovlje)|Holy Trinity Church, Hrastovlje]], Istria by [[John of Kastav]] (1490).  

A notable example was painted on the cemetery walls of the Dominican Abbey in [[Bern]] by [[Niklaus Manuel Deutsch]] in 1516/7.
This work was destroyed when the wall was torn down in 1660, but a 1649 copy by [[Albrecht Kauw]] is extant.
There was also a Dance of Death painted around 1430 and displayed on the walls of Pardon Churchyard at Old [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London, with texts by [[John Lydgate]], known as the 'Dauce of (St) Poulys', which was destroyed in 1549.

[[File:Danse Macabre - Guyot Marchand9 (Abbot and Bailiff).jpg|thumb|''La Danse macabre'' ([[Abbot]] and [[Bailiff]]). Paris, [[Guy Marchant]], 1486]]

The deathly [[crisis of the Late Middle Ages|horrors of the 14th century]] such as recurring [[famine]]s, the [[Hundred Years' War]] in [[France]], and, most of all, the [[Black Death]], were culturally assimilated throughout Europe. The omnipresent possibility of sudden and painful death increased the religious desire for [[penance]], but it also evoked a hysterical desire for amusement while still possible; a last dance as cold comfort. The danse macabre combines both desires: in many ways similar to the mediaeval [[mystery play]]s, the dance-with-death allegory was originally a [[didacticism|didactic]] dialogue poem to remind people of the inevitability of death and to advise them strongly to be prepared at all times for death (see ''[[memento mori]]'' and ''[[Ars moriendi]]'').

Short verse dialogues between Death and each of its victims, which could have been performed as plays, can be found in the direct aftermath of the Black Death in [[Germany]] and in [[Spain]]  (where it was known as the ''Totentanz'' and ''la Danza de la Muerte'', respectively). The French term ''danse macabre'' may derive from the Latin ''Chorea Machabæorum'', literally "dance of the Maccabees."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/233217?rskey=m8A5At&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false# OED.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/macabre Dictionary.reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2 Maccabees]], a [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]] of the [[Bible]], the grim [[martyr]]dom of a [[woman with seven sons|mother and her seven sons]] is described and was a well-known mediaeval subject. It is possible that the Maccabean Martyrs were commemorated in some early French plays or that people just associated the book's vivid descriptions of the martyrdom with the interaction between Death and its prey.

An alternative explanation is that the term entered France via Spain, the {{lang-ar |مقابر}}, ''maqabir'' (cemetery) being the root of the word. Both the dialogues and the evolving paintings were ostensive penitential lessons that even illiterate people (who were the overwhelming majority) could understand.

==Frescoes==
[[Fresco]]es and murals dealing with death had a long tradition and were widespread, e.g. the legend of the Three Living and the Three Dead: on a ride or hunt, three young gentlemen meet three cadavers (sometimes described as their ancestors) who warn them, ''Quod fuimus, estis; quod sumus, vos eritis'' (What we were, you are; what we are, you will be). Numerous mural versions of that legend from the 13th century onwards have survived (for instance, in the [[:de:Heiligen-Geist-Hospital (Wismar)|Hospital Church]] of [[Wismar]] or the residential [[Longthorpe Tower]] outside [[Peterborough]]). Since they showed pictorial sequences of men and corpses covered with shrouds, those paintings are sometimes regarded as cultural precursors of the new genre.

A ''danse macabre'' painting may show a round dance headed by Death or a chain of alternating dead and live dancers. From the highest ranks of the mediaeval hierarchy (usually [[pope]] and [[emperor]]) descending to its lowest (beggar, peasant, and child), each mortal's hand is taken by a skeleton or an extremely decayed body. The famous ''Totentanz'' by Bernt Notke in [[St. Mary's Church, Lübeck]] (destroyed during the Allied [[bombing of Lübeck in World War II]]), presented the dead dancers as very lively and agile, making the impression that they were actually dancing, whereas their living dancing partners looked clumsy and passive. The apparent class distinction in almost all of these paintings is completely neutralized by Death as the ultimate equalizer, so that a sociocritical element is subtly inherent to the whole genre. The ''Totentanz'' of [[Metnitz]], for example, shows how a pope crowned with his [[mitre]] is being led into Hell by the dancing Death.

{{Wide image|Totentanz LübeckR.jpg|2000px|''Lübecker Totentanz'' by [[Bernt Notke]] (around 1463, destroyed in a bombing raid in 1942)|alt=A mural depicting a chain of alternating living and dead dancers}}

Usually, a short dialogue is attached to each victim, in which Death is summoning him (or, more rarely, her) to dance and the summoned is moaning about impending death. In the first printed ''Totentanz'' textbook (Anon.: Vierzeiliger oberdeutscher Totentanz, Heidelberger Blockbuch, approx. 1460), Death addresses, for example, the emperor:
[[File:Bernt Notke Danse Macabre.jpg|thumb|500px|Bernt Notke: ''Surmatants'' (''Totentanz'') in [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn]].]]  
[[File:Totentanz in Hrastovlje.JPG|thumb|The famous Danse Macabre in [[Hrastovlje]] in the [[Holy Trinity Church (Hrastovlje)|Holy Trinity Church]]]]

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Emperor, your sword won't help you out
Sceptre and crown are worthless here
I've taken you by the hand
For you must come to my dance
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

At the lower end of the ''Totentanz'', Death calls, for example, the peasant to dance, who answers:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
I had to work very much and very hard
The sweat was running down my skin
I'd like to escape death nonetheless
But here I won't have any luck
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

}}{{anchor|Holbein}}The famous designs by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] (1497–1543) for his Dance of Death series were drawn in 1526 while he was in [[Basel]].  They were cut in wood by the accomplished [[Formschneider]] (block cutter) [[Hans Lützelburger]].  William Ivins (quoting W.J. Linton) writes of Lützelburger's work: "'Nothing indeed, by knife or by graver, is of higher quality than this man's doing,' for by common acclaim the originals are technically the most marvelous woodcuts ever made." &lt;ref&gt;Ivins, p.234.&lt;/ref&gt;  These woodcuts soon appeared in proofs with titles in German.  The first book edition, containing forty-one woodcuts, was published at Lyons by the Treschsel brothers in 1538.  The popularity of the work and the currency of its message are underscored by the fact that there were eleven editions before 1562 and over the sixteenth century perhaps as many as a hundred unauthorized editions and imitations.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1947), p.32&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten further designs were added in later editions.

The ''Dance of Death'' (1523–26) refashions the late-medieval [[allegory]] of the ''danse macabre'' as a reformist satire, and one can see the beginnings of a gradual shift from traditional to reformed religion.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 96–103.&lt;/ref&gt;  That shift had many permutations however, and in a thoroughly detailed study Natalie Zemon Davis has shown that the contemporary reception and afterlife of Holbein's designs lent themselves to neither purely Catholic or Protestant doctrine, but could be outfitted with different surrounding prefaces and sermons as printers and writers of different political and religious leanings took them up.  Most importantly, it was "The pictures and the Bible quotations above them were the main attractions ... Both Catholics and Protestants wished, through the pictures, to turn men's thoughts to a Christian preparation for death.".&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1538 edition which contained Latin quotations from the Bible above Holbein's designs, and a French quatrain below composed by [[Gilles Corrozet]], actually did not credit Holbein as the artist.  It bore the title: Les simulachres &amp; / HISTORIEES FACES / DE LA MORT, AUTANT ELE/gammēt pourtraictes, que artifi/ciellement imaginées. / A Lyon. / Soubz l'escu de COLOIGNE. / M.D. XXXVIII. ("Images and Illustrated facets of Death, as elegantly depicted as they are artfully conceived.")&lt;ref&gt;See External links to access to this work, including English translation, online.&lt;/ref&gt;  These images and workings of death as captured in the phrase "historiees faces" of the title "are the particular exemplification of the way death works, the individual scenes in which the lessons of mortality are brought home to people of every station." &lt;ref&gt;Gundersheimer, introduction, p.xi.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his preface to the work Jean de Vauzèle, the Prior of Montrosier, addresses Jehanne de Tourzelle, the Abbess of the Convent at St. Peter at Lyons, and names Holbein's attempts to capture the ever-present, but never directly seen, abstract images of death "simulachres."  He writes: "... simulachres les dis ie vrayement, pour ce que simulachre vient de simuler, &amp; faindre ce que n'est point." ("Simulachre they are most correctly called, for simulachre derives from the verb to simulate and to feign that which is not really there.")  He next employs a trope from the [[memento mori]] (remember we all must die) tradition and a metaphor from printing which well captures the undertakings of Death, the artist, and the printed book before us in which these simulachres of death barge in on the living: "Et pourtant qu'on n'a peu trouver chose plus approchante a la similitude de Mort, que la personne morte, on d'icelle effigie simulachres, &amp; faces de Mort, pour en nos pensees imprimer la memoire de Mort plus au vis, que ne pourroient toutes les rhetoriques descriptiones de orateurs." &lt;ref&gt;As reproduced in Gundersheimer, 1971. p.5. Register Aiii of original.&lt;/ref&gt; ("And yet we cannot discover any one thing more near the likeness of Death than the dead themselves, whence come these simulated effigies and images of Death's affairs, which imprint the memory of Death with more force than all the rhetorical descriptions of the orators ever could.").

[[File:Holbein Danse Macabre 37.jpg|right|thumb|Hans Holbein, Simolachri, Historie, e Figure de la Morte.  In Lyone Appresso.  Giovan Frellone, M.D. XLIX. (1549)]]

Holbein's series shows the figure of "Death" in many disguises, confronting individuals from all walks of life. None escape Death's skeletal clutches, not even the pious.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 56–58, and Landau &amp; Parshall, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Davis writes, "Holbein's pictures are independent dramas in which Death comes upon his victim in the midst of the latter's own surroundings and activities.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p.101&lt;/ref&gt;  This is perhaps nowhere more strikingly captured than in the wonderful blocks showing the plowman earning his bread by the sweat of his brow only to have his horses speed him to his end by Death.  The Latin from the 1549 Italian edition pictured here reads: "In sudore vultus tui, vesceris pane tuo." ("Through the sweat of thy brow you shall eat your bread"), quoting Genesis 3.19.  The Italian verses below translate: ("Miserable in the sweat of your brow,/ It is necessary that you acquire the bread you need eat,/ But, may it not displease you to come with me,/ If you are desirous of rest.").   Or there is the nice balance in composition Holbein achieves between the heavy-laden traveling salesman insisting that he must still go to market while Death tugs at his sleeve to put down his wares once and for all: "Venite ad me, qui onerati estis." ("Come to me, all ye who [labor and] are heavy laden"), quoting Matthew 11.28.  The Italian here translates: ("Come with me, wretch, who are weighed down,/ Since I am the dame who rules the whole world:/ Come and hear my advice,/ Because I wish to lighten you of this load.").&lt;ref&gt;Simolachri, Historie, e Figure de la Morte.  In Lyone Appresso.  Giovan Frellone, M.D. XLIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Death and the Maiden" and other allusions==
The motif ''[[Death and the Maiden (motif)|Death and the Maiden]]'', is related to, and may have been derived from, the ''Danse Macabre''. It has received numerous treatments in various media—most prominently Schubert's quartet of that name. Further developments of the ''Danse Macabre'' motif include ''[[Death and the King's Horseman]]'', "[[Death and the Senator]]", "[[Death and the Compass]]", and ''Death and the Physician''.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary aesthetics''' refers to [[evolutionary psychology]] theories in which the basic [[aesthetic]] preferences of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' are argued to have [[evolution|evolved]] in order to enhance survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;

Based on this theory, things like color preference, preferred mate body ratios, shapes, emotional ties with objects, and many other aspects of the aesthetic experience can be explained with reference to human [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang, H.M., Chen, K. H., &amp; Chou, G. J. 2011. 'Pleasurable elements in emotional design,' ''Designing Pleasurable Products and Interfaces.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aesthetics and evolutionary psychology ==
Many animal and human traits have been argued to have evolved in order to enhance survival and reproductive success. [[Evolutionary psychology]] extends this to psychological traits including aesthetical preferences. Such traits are generally seen as being [[adaptation]]s to the environment during the [[Pleistocene era]] and are not necessarily adaptative in our present environment. Examples include disgust of potentially harmful spoiled foods; pleasure from sex and from eating sweet and fatty foods; and fear of spiders, snakes, and the dark.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. 'Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology' in "The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics". Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

All known cultures have some form of art. This universality suggests that art is related to evolutionary adaptations. The strong emotions associated with art suggest the same.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;

== Landscape and other visual arts preferences ==
[[File:La Gran Sabana.jpg|thumb|San Rafael [[Gran Sabana]], [[Venezuela]].]]
An important choice for a mobile organism is selecting a good [[habitat]] to live in. Humans are argued to have strong aesthetical preferences for [[landscape]]s which were good habitats in the ancestral environment. When young human children from different nations are asked to select which landscape they prefer, from a selection of standardized landscape photographs, there is a strong preference for [[savanna]]s with trees. The East African savanna is the ancestral environment in which much of human evolution is argued to have taken place. There is also a preference for landscapes with water, with both open and wooded areas, with trees with branches at a suitable height for climbing and taking foods, with features encouraging exploration such as a path or river curving out of view, with seen or implied game animals, and with some clouds. These are all features that are often featured in calendar art and in the design of [[public park]]s.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;

A survey of art preferences in many different nations found that realistic painting was preferred. Favorite features were water, trees as well as other plants, humans (in particular beautiful women, children, and well-known historical figures), and animals (in particular both wild and domestic large animals). Blue, followed by green, was the favorite color. Using the survey, the study authors constructed a painting showing the preferences of each nation. Despite the many different cultures, the paintings all showed a strong similarity to landscape calendar art. The authors argued that this similarity was in fact due to the influence of the Western calendar industry. Another explanation is that these features are those evolutionary psychology predicts should be popular for evolutionary reasons.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;

== Physical attractiveness ==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}
{{See also|Fluctuating asymmetry}}
Various evolutionary concerns have been argued to influence what is perceived to be physically attractive.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Bjorn. 2006. 'The Rules of Attraction in the Game of Love,' "Live Science.""&lt;/ref&gt;

Such evolutionary based preferences are not necessarily static but may vary depending on environmental cues. Thus, availability of food influences which female body size is attractive which may have evolutionary reasons. Societies with food scarcities prefer larger female body size than societies having plenty of food. In Western society males who are hungry prefer a larger female body size than they do when not hungry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nettle | first1 = D. | title = Ecological influences on human behavioural diversity: A review of recent findings | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2009.05.013 | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 24 | issue = 11 | pages = 618–24| year = 2009 | pmid =  19683831| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary musicology ==
{{Main|Evolutionary musicology}}

Evolutionary musicology is a subfield of [[biomusicology]] that grounds the psychological mechanisms of [[music perception]] and [[music production (music psychology)|production]] in [[evolutionary theory]]. It covers [[Animal communication|vocal communication]] in non-human animal species, theories of the evolution of human music, and cross-cultural human universals in musical ability and processing. It also includes evolutionary explanations for what is considered aesthetically pleasing or not.

== Darwinian literary studies ==
{{Main|Darwinian literary studies}}

Darwinian Literary Studies (aka Literary Darwinism) is a branch of [[literary criticism]] that studies [[literature]], including aesthetical aspects, in the context of evolution.{{Synthesis inline|date=August 2018}}

== Evolution of emotion ==
{{Main|Evolution of emotion}}
Aesthetics are tied to emotions. There are several explanations regarding the [[evolution of emotion]].{{Synthesis inline|date=August 2018}}

One example is the emotion [[disgust]] which has been argued to have evolved in order to avoid several harmful actions such as infectious diseases due to contact with spoiled foods, feces, and decaying bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tybur | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Lieberman | first2 = D. | last3 = Griskevicius | first3 = V. | doi = 10.1037/a0015474 | title = Microbes, mating, and morality: Individual differences in three functional domains of disgust | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–122 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19586243| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexy son hypothesis, handicap principle, and arts ==
[[File:Peacock Wooing Peahen.jpg|thumb|alt=|A male [[peacock]] does its best to court a female, dancing and displaying its extravagant plumage.]]

The [[sexy son hypothesis]] suggests that a [[female]] optimal choice among potential [[Mating|mate]]s is a male whose genes will produce male [[offspring]] with the best chance of [[reproductive success]] by having trait(s) being attractive to other females. Sometimes the trait may have no reproductive benefit in itself, apart from attracting females, because of [[Fisherian runaway]]. The peacock's tail may be one example. It has also been seen as an example of the [[handicap principle]].

It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what is needed for survival on the savanna. One explanation could be that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the equivalent of the peacock's tail for humans. According to this theory superior execution of art was important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;

'''Face of Canada''' is an [[art exhibition]] displaying paintings of notable Canadians. It was showcased on July 1, 2011 at [[Canada Place]] in [[Vancouver]], displaying over 100 [[Oil paint|oil]] [[Portrait painting|portraits]] of notable individuals, both past and present, that helped shape the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://vancouversun.com/life/food/Canadian+artist+open+Vancouver+Canada+exhibit+featuring+portraits+famous/5026251/story.html |title=Canadian artist to open Vancouver Canada Day exhibit featuring 100 portraits of famous Canadians |publisher=Vancouversun.com |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
The concept was derived by Canadian artist, [[William Meire]]. Born in [[Vancouver]],  September 2, 1966, Meire traveled to 49 countries studying art.&lt;ref name="gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://williammeiregallery.com/ |title=William Meire Art Gallery |publisher=Williammeiregallery.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painting [[Impressionism|impressionist]] landscapes professionally, in an array of mediums over the past 10 years, Meire turned his interest to portraiture work in oil. After seeing [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] win the men's [[hockey]] in the [[2010 Olympic Games]] and feeling a sense of national pride, he started the 'Great Canadians,' a small series which eventually led to the Face of Canada.&lt;ref name="gallery"/&gt; After much research, Meire realized the great number of notable Canadians who have shaped and changed the nation, and affected many lives. On July 1, 2011, crowds came to see the one-day solo exhibition of over 100 oil portraits at Canada Place, which has now become part of Canada's national heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theprovince.com/entertainment/Face+Canada+exhibit+draws+Canada+crowds/5036685/story.html |title=Story - Entertainment |publisher=The Province |date= |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912122824/http://www.theprovince.com/entertainment/Face+Canada+exhibit+draws+Canada+crowds/5036685/story.html |archivedate=2011-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fedoskino miniature''' ({{lang-ru|федоскинская миниатюра}}) is a traditional Russian lacquer miniature painting on ''[[papier-mache]]'', named after its original center Fedoskino (Федоскино), an old village near [[Moscow]] widely known from the late 18th century. The contemporary Fedoskino painting preserves the typical features of Russian folk art. 

The use of [[oil paint]], typically applied in many layers, is a distinctive feature of a Fedoskino miniature, as well as the use of [[mother-of-pearl]], pure [[gold]] or [[silver]] leaf under segments of the background to create the effect of a shimmering glow or silvery sparkle. Many boxes are painted inside and outside in imitation [[tortoiseshell]], birch bark, [[mahogany]] or [[tartan]].

The heyday of Fedoskino miniature fell on the second half of the 19th century, and the works of that time are known as 'lukutins', named after the merchants Lukutins, who owned the Fedoskino factory at that time. Some of the factory craftsmen had artistic education, and lots of them had come from icon painting studios. 

The popular motifs used in Fedoskino miniature are all sorts of tea-drinking with [[samovar]], [[Troika (driving)|troikas]] (carriage-and-three), and scenes from Russian peasant life.

'''Folklore studies''', also known as '''folkloristics''', and occasionally '''tradition studies''' or '''folk life studies''' in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=England, National Folklore Survey|journal=Folklore|volume=127|issue=3|pages=257–269|doi=10.1080/0015587X.2016.1198178|year = 2016|last1 = Widdowson|first1 = J. D. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the formal academic discipline devoted to the study of [[folklore]]. This term, along with its synonyms,&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to Alan Dundes, this term was first introduced in an address by [[Charles Leland]] in 1889. He spoke in German to the Hungarian Folklore Society and referenced "Die Folkloristik". {{harv|Dundes|2005|page=386}} In contemporary scholarship, the word ''Folkloristics'' is favored by Alan Dundes, and used in the title of his publication {{harv|Dundes|1978}}. The term ''Folklore Studies'' is defined and used by [[Simon Bronner]], see {{harv|Bronner|1986|page=xi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; gained currency in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the [[cultural artifact|folklore artifacts]] themselves. It became established as a field across both Europe and North America, coordinating with ''Volkskunde'' (German), ''folkermimne'' (Norwegian), and ''folkminnen'' (Swedish), among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Brunvald|1996|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The importance of folklore and folklore studies was recognized globally 1982 in the [[UNESCO]] document "Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13141&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO Recommendation 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UNESCO again in 2003 published a [[Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]]. Parallel to these global statements, the American Folklife Preservation Act (P.L. 94-201),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/folklife/public_law.html | title=Public Law 94-201 (The Creation of the American Folklife Center, Library of Congress)}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by the [[United States Congress]] in conjunction with the Bicentennial Celebration in 1976, included a definition of folklore, also called [[folklife]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...[Folklife] means the traditional expressive culture shared within the various groups in the United States: familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, regional; expressive culture includes a wide range of creative and symbolic forms such as custom, belief, technical skill, language, literature, art, architecture, music, play, dance, drama, ritual, pageantry, handicraft; these expressions are mainly learned orally, by imitation, or in performance, and are generally maintained without benefit of formal instruction or institutional direction." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This law was added to the panoply of other legislation designed to protect the natural and cultural heritage of the United States. It gives voice to a growing understanding that the cultural diversity of the United States is a national strength and a resource worthy of protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To fully understand the term ''folklore studies'', it is necessary to clarify its component parts: the terms '''folk''' and '''lore'''. Originally the word ''folk'' applied only to rural, frequently poor, frequently illiterate peasants. A more contemporary definition of ''folk'' is a social group which includes two or more persons with common traits, who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions. "Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]] or to a [[Family folklore|single family.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harv |Dundes|1969|page=13|footnote=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded social definition of ''folk'' supports a wider view of the material considered to be ''folklore artifacts''. These now include "things people make with words (verbal lore), things they make with their hands (material lore), and things they make with their actions (customary lore)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wilson|2006|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The folklorist studies the [[traditional]] artifacts of a group. They study the groups, within which these customs, traditions and beliefs are transmitted.

'''Transmission''' of these artifacts is a vital part of the folklore process. Without communicating these beliefs and customs within the group over space and time, they would become cultural shards relegated to cultural archaeologists. These [[Cultural artifacts|folk artifacts]] continue to be passed along informally within the group, as a rule anonymously and always in multiple variants. For the folk group is not individualistic, it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community. This is in direct contrast to [[high culture]], where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law.

The folklorist strives to understand the '''significance''' of these beliefs, customs and objects for the group. For "folklore ''means'' something -- to the tale teller, to the song singer, to the fiddler, and to the audience or addressees".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|2007a|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cultural units&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group. That meaning can however shift and morph. So [[Halloween]] of the 21st century is not the All Hallows' Eve of the Middle Ages, and even gives rise to its own set of  [[Poisoned candy myths|urban legends]] independent of the historical celebration. The cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water; now these customs signify identification as an Orthodox Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an increasingly theoretical sophistication of the social sciences, it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group, it is indeed all around us.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not have to be old or antiquated. It continues to be created, transmitted and in any group can be used to differentiate between "us" and "them". All cultures have their own unique folklore, and each culture has to develop and refine the techniques and methods of folklore studies most effective in identifying and researching their own. As an academic discipline, folklore studies straddles the space between the Social Sciences and the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not always the case. The study of folklore originated in Europe in the first half of the 19th century with a focus on the oral folklore of the rural peasant populations. The "[[Kinder- und Hausmärchen]]" of the [[Brothers Grimm]] (first published 1812) is the best known but by no means only collection of verbal folklore of the European peasantry. This interest in stories, sayings and songs, i.e. verbal lore, continued throughout the 19th century and aligned the fledgling discipline of folklore studies with Literature and Mythology. By the turn into the 20th century, European folklorists remained focused on the oral folklore of the homogeneous peasant populations in their regions, while the American folklorists, led by [[Franz Boas]], chose to consider [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures in their research, and included the totality of their customs and beliefs as folklore. This distinction aligned American folklore studies with cultural anthropology and ethnology, using the same techniques of data collection in their field research. This divided alliance of folklore studies between the humanities and the social sciences offers a wealth of theoretical vantage points and research tools to the field of folklore studies as a whole, even as it continues to be a point of discussion within the field itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Zumwalt|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public folklore]] is a relatively new offshoot of folklore studies; it started after the Second World War and modeled itself on the seminal work of [[Alan Lomax]] and [[Ben Botkin]] in the 1930s which emphasized [[applied folklore]]. Public sector folklorists work to document, preserve and present the beliefs and customs of diverse cultural groups in their region. These positions are often affiliated with museums, libraries, arts organizations, public schools, historical societies, etc. The most renowned of these is the [[American Folklife Center]] at the Smithsonian, together with its [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] held every summer in Washington, DC. Public folklore differentiates itself from the academic folklore supported by universities, in which collection, research and analysis are primary goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The terms '''folklore studies''' and '''folklore''' belong to a large and confusing word family. We have already used the synonym pairs '''Folkloristics / Folklife Studies''' and '''folklore / folklife''', all of them in current usage within the field. ''Folklore'' was the original term used in this discipline. Its synonym, ''folklife'', came into circulation in the second half of the 20th century, at a time when some researchers felt that the term ''folklore'' was too closely tied exclusively to oral lore. The new term ''folklife'', along with its synonym ''folk culture'', is meant to categorically include all aspects of a culture, not just the oral traditions. [[Folk process]] is used to describe the refinement and creative change of artifacts by community members within the folk tradition that defines the folk process.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book | title=Story/telling | publisher=Univ. Queensland Press | author1=Levy, Bronwen Ann|author2=Murphy, Ffion  | year=1991 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Rhqzx0oPOgC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22folk+process%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22folk%20process%22&amp;f=false | page=43| isbn=9780702232022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professionals within this field, regardless of the other words they use, consider themselves to be '''folklorists'''.

Other terms which might be confused with folklore are [[popular culture]] and [[Vernacular culture]], both of which vary from folklore in distinctive ways. '''Pop culture''' tends to be in demand for a limited time; it is generally mass-produced and communicated using mass media. Individually, these tend to be labeled [[fads]], and disappear as quickly as they appear. The term '''vernacular culture''' differs from folklore in its overriding emphasis on a specific locality or region. For example, [[vernacular architecture]] denotes the standard building form of a region, using the materials available and designed to address functional needs of the local economy. ''Folk architecture'' is a subset of this, in which the construction is not done by a professional architect or builder, but by an individual putting up a needed structure in the local style. In a broader sense, all folklore is vernacular, i.e. tied to a region, whereas not everything vernacular is necessarily folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also further cognates used in connection with folklore studies. '''Folklorism''' refers to "material or stylistic elements of folklore [presented] in a context which is foreign to the original tradition." This definition, offered by the folklorist Hermann Bausinger, does not discount the validity of meaning expressed in these "second hand" traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Smidchens|1999|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Walt Disney films and products belong in this category of folklorism; the fairy tales, originally told around a winter fire, have become animated film characters, stuffed animals and bed linens. Their meaning, however far removed from the original story telling tradition, does not detract from the importance and meaning they have for their young audience. '''[[Fakelore]]''' refers to artifacts which might be termed ''pseudo-folklore''; these are manufactured items claiming to be traditional. The folklorist [[Richard Dorson]] coined this word, clarifying it in his book "Folklore and Fakelore".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorson|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current thinking within the discipline is that this term places undue emphasis on the origination of the artifact as a sign of authenticity of the tradition. The adjective '''folkloric''' is used to designate materials having the character of folklore or tradition, at the same time making no claim to authenticity.

==Methodology==
There are several goals of active folklore research. The first objective is to identity tradition bearers within a social group and to collect their lore, preferably in situ. Once collected, these data need to be documented and preserved to enable further access and study. The documented lore is then available to be analyzed and interpreted by folklorists and other cultural historians, and can become the basis for studies of either individual customs or comparative studies. There are multiple venues, be they museums, journals or folk festivals to present the research results. The final step in this methodology involves advocating for these groups in their distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wilson|2006|pages=81–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific tools needed by folklorists to do their research are manifold. 
* The researchers must be comfortable in '''fieldwork'''; going out to meet their informants where they live, work, and perform. 
* They need to access '''archives''' housing a vast array of unpublished folklore collections. 
* They will want work with '''folk museums''', to both view the collections, and present their own findings. 
* '''Bibliographies''' maintained by libraries and on line contain an important trove of articles from around the world. 
* The use of '''indexes''' allow them to view and use the categorization of artifacts which have already been established. 
* All work by a folklorist must be appropriately '''annotated''' in order to provide identifiable sources of the work. 
* For all folklorists '''terminology''' becomes a skill to master as they rub elbows not only with related academic fields but also with the colloquial understanding (what exactly is a fairy tale?). This shared vocabulary, with varying and sometimes divergent shades of meaning, needs to be used thoughtfully and consistently. 
* The use of '''printed sources''' to locate and identify further variants of a folk tradition is a necessary adjunct to the field research. 
* Because the transmission of folk artifacts preceded and ignored the establishment of national and political boundaries, it is important to cultivate '''international connections''' to folklorists in neighboring countries and around the world to compare both the artifacts researched and the methodology used. 
* A knowledge of the '''history of folklore studies''' is called for to identify the direction and more importantly the biases which the field has taken in the past, enabling us to temper the current analysis with more impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorson|1972|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In a more dramatic and less technical approach, Henry Glassie describes the tools of the folklore trade: "[Folklorists were the] hunters and gatherers of academe…still rooting about in reality, hunting down and gathering up facts that we brought back alive. In those days [the 1960s] … we were delighted to be allowed to enter the university, set up camp, and practice our humble, archaic trade. They had let us in and we honored the established disciplines around us by stealing all we could. While the more advanced people around us slept, we slid in the shadows past their fires, rifled their baggage, stole their books, learned their language, and came to be able to ape their culture in a way that we at least found convincing. In our excitement we did not stop to ponder whether their theories sorted well with our traditional preoccupations. We learned the schemes of those we perceived to be higher in the academic hierarchy than ourselves, then applied those schemes to our own topics. We felt mature.{{harv|Glassie|1983|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The folklorist also rubs shoulders with researchers, tools and inquiries of neighboring fields:  literature, anthropology, cultural history, linguistics, geography, musicology, sociology, psychology. This is just a partial list of the fields of study related to folklore studies, all of which are united by a common interest in subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|Paredes|1972|page=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===From antiquities to lore===
It is well-documented that the term "folklore" was coined in 1846 by the Englishman [[William Thoms]]. He fabricated it for use in an article published in the August 22, 1846 issue of [[The Athenaeum (British magazine)|''The Athenaeum'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thoms consciously replaced the contemporary terminology of   "popular antiquities" or "popular literature" with this new word. Folklore was to  emphasize the study of a specific subset of the population: the rural, mostly illiterate peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his published call for help in documenting antiquities, Thoms was echoing scholars from across the European continent to collect artifacts of older, mostly oral cultural traditions still flourishing among the rural populace. In Germany the [[Brothers Grimm]] had first published their "[[Kinder- und Hausmärchen]]" in 1812. They continued throughout their lives to collect [[Volkskunde|German folk tales]] to include in their collection. In [[Danish folklore#History|Scandinavia]], intellectuals were also searching for their authentic [[Teutons|Teutonic roots]] and had labeled their studies ''Folkeminde'' (Danish) or ''Folkermimne'' (Norwegian).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Europe and America, other early collectors of folklore were at work. [[Thomas Crofton Croker]] published fairy tales from southern Ireland and, together with his wife, documented [[keening]] and other Irish funereal customs. [[Elias Lönnrot]] is best known for his collection of epic Finnish poems published under the title [[Kalevala]]. [[John Fanning Watson]] in the United States published the "Annals of Philadelphia".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/annalsofphiladel01wats | title=Annals of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, in the olden time; being a collection of memoirs, anecdotes, and incidents of the city and its inhabitants, and of the earliest settlements of the inland part of Pennsylvania, from the days of the founders ... Embellished with engravings| publisher=[Philadelphia] The author| date=1850-1860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing industrialization, urbanization, and the rise in literacy throughout Europe in the 19th century, folklorists were concerned that the oral knowledge and beliefs, the [[Oral traditions|lore]] of the rural folk would be lost. It  was posited that the stories, beliefs and customs were surviving fragments of a cultural mythology of the region, pre-dating Christianity and rooted in pagan peoples and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This thinking goes in lockstep with the rise of [[nationalism]] across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some British folklorists,{{which|date=August 2018}} rather than lamenting or attempting to preserve rural or pre-industrial cultures, saw their work as a means of furthering industrialization, scientific rationalism, and [[disenchantment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Josephson-Storm|2017|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the need to collect these vestiges of rural traditions became more compelling, the need to formalize this new field of cultural studies became apparent. The British ''[[Folklore Society]]'' was established in 1878 and the ''[[American Folklore Society]]'' was established a decade later. These were just two of a plethora of academic societies founded in the latter half of the 19th century by educated members of the emerging middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For literate, urban intellectuals and students of folklore the '''folk''' was someone else and the '''past''' was recognized as being something truly different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folklore became a measure of the [[Social progress|progress of society]], how far we had moved forward into the industrial present and indeed removed ourselves from a past marked by poverty, illiteracy and superstition. The task of both the professional folklorist and the amateur at the turn of the 20th  century was to collect and classify cultural artifacts from the pre-industrial rural areas, parallel to the drive in the life sciences to do the same for the natural world.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; "Folk was a clear label to set materials apart from modern life…material specimens, which were meant to be classified in the natural history of civilization. Tales, originally dynamic and fluid, were given stability and concreteness by means of the printed page."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewed as fragments from a pre-literate culture, these stories and objects were collected without context to be displayed and studied in museums and anthologies, just as bones and potsherds were gathered for the life sciences. [[Kaarle Krohn]] and [[Antti Aarne]] were active collectors of folk poetry in Finland. The Scotsman [[Andrew Lang]] is known for his 25 volumes of [[fairy tales|Andrew Lang's Fairy Books]] from around the world. [[Francis James Child]] was an American academic who collected English and Scottish popular ballads and their American variants, published as the [[Child Ballads]]. In the United States, both [[Mark Twain]] and [[Washington Irving]] drew on folklore to write their stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[Samuel Clemens]] was also a charter member of the American Folklore Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|2005|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aarne–Thompson and the historic-geographic method===
By the beginning of the 20th century these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries. A system to organize and categorize them became necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv| Georges|1995|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antti Aarne published a first classification system for folktales in 1910. It was later expanded into the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]] by [[Stith Thompson]] and remains the standard classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. As the number of classified artifacts grew, similarities were noted in items which had been collected from very different geographic regions, ethnic groups and epochs.

In an effort to understand and explain the similarities found in tales from different locations, the Finnish folklorists Julius and Kaarle Krohne developed the [[Julius Krohn#Scientific work|Historical-Geographical method]], also called the Finnish method.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wolf-Knuts|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using multiple variants of a tale, this investigative method attempted to work backwards in time and location to compile the original version from what they considered the incomplete fragments still in existence. This was the search for the "Urform,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which by definition was more complete and more "authentic" then the newer, more scattered versions. The historic-geographic method has been succinctly described as a "quantitative mining of the resulting archive, and extraction of distribution patterns in time and space". It is based on the assumption that every text artifact is a variant of the original text. As a proponent of this method, [[Walter Anderson (folklorist)|Walter Anderson]] proposed additionally a '''Law of Self-Correction''', i.e. a feedback mechanism which would keep the variants closer to the original form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Anderson is best known for his monograph ''[[King John and the Bishop|Kaiser und Abt]]'' (Folklore Fellows' Communications 42, Helsinki 1923) on folktales of type AT 922.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the first decades of the 20th century that Folklore Studies in Europe and America began to diverge. The Europeans continued with their emphasis on oral traditions of the pre-literate peasant, and remained connected to literary scholarship within the universities. By this definition, folklore was completely based in the European cultural sphere; any social group that did not originate in Europe was to be studied by [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] and [[cultural anthropologists]]. In this light, some twenty-first century scholars have interpreted European folkloristics as an instrument of [[internal colonialism]], in parallel with the imperialistic dimensions of early 20th century cultural anthropology and [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Josephson-Storm|2017|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike contemporary anthropology, however, many early European folklorists were themselves members of the prioritized groups that folkloristics was intended to study; for instance, Andrew Lang and [[James George Frazer]] were both themselves Scotsmen and studied rural folktales from towns near where they grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Josephson-Storm|2017|pages=128–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this, American folklorists, under the influence of the German-American [[Franz Boas]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], sought to incorporate other cultural groups living in their region into the study of folklore. This included not only customs brought over by northern European immigrants, but also African Americans, [[Acadians]] of eastern Canada, [[Cajuns]] of Louisiana, [[Hispanics]] of the American southwest, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Not only were these distinct cultural groups all living in the same regions, but their proximity to each other caused their traditions and customs to intermingle. The lore of these distinct social groups, all of them Americans, was considered the bailiwick of American folklorists, and aligned American folklore studies more with ethnology than with literary studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Zumwalt|1988|pages=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Depression and the Federal Writers' Project===
Then came the 1930s and the worldwide [[Great Depression]]. In the United States the [[Federal Writers' Project]] was established as part of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]. Its goal was to offer paid employment to thousands of unemployed writers by engaging them in various cultural projects around the country. These white collar workers were sent out as field workers to collect the oral folklore of their regions, including stories, songs, idioms and dialects. The most famous of these collections is the [[Slave Narrative Collection]]. The folklore collected under the auspices of the Federal Writers Project during these years continues to offer a goldmine of primary source materials for folklorists and other cultural historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=10, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As chairman of the Federal Writers' Project between 1938 and 1942, [[Benjamin A. Botkin]] supervised the work of these folklore field workers. Both Botkin and [[John Lomax]] were particularly influential during this time in expanding folklore collection techniques to include more detailing of the interview context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant move away from viewing the collected artifacts as isolated fragments, broken remnants of an incomplete pre-historic whole. Using these new interviewing techniques, the collected lore became embedded in and imbued with meaning within the framework of its contemporary practice. The emphasis moved from the lore to the folk, i.e. the groups and the people who gave this lore meaning within contemporary daily living.

===German Folklore in the Third Reich ===
In Europe during these same decades, folklore studies were drifting in a different direction. Throughout the 19th century folklore had been naively tied to romantic ideals of the soul of the people, in which folk tales and folksongs recounted the lives and exploits of ethnic folk heroes. Folklore chronicled the mythical origins of different peoples across Europe and established the beginnings of national pride (read: [[nationalism]]). By the first decade of the 20th century there were scholarly societies as well as individual folklore positions within universities, academies and museums, however the study of German Volkskunde had yet to be defined as an academic discipline. 

In the 1920s this originally innocent movement was usurped by nationalistic political forces in several European countries, first and foremost in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorson|1972|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bendix|1998|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this decade that an unfortunate congruence with national socialist ideology was seen to take place; the vocabulary of German Volkskunde, words such as Volk (folk), Rasse (race), Stamm (tribe) and Erbe (heritage) mapped neatly into the political dogmas of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi]] party. The expressed goal of the National Socialists was to re-establish the purity of the Germanic, i.e. Nordic, tribes in Europe. The German philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]] was one of the main apologists for this ideology.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In his study ''Erbschaft dieser Zeit'' (1935) (translation ''Heritage of Our Times'', Polity, 1991) Ernst Bloch examined how the more mythological way of scholarly thought of the 19th century was revived by the National Socialists.&lt;/ref&gt; “Nazi ideology presented racial purity as the means to heal the wounds of the suffering German state following World War I. Hitler painted the ethnic heterogeneity of Germany as a major reason for the country’s economic and political weakness, and he promised to restore a German realm based on a cleansed, and hence strong, German people. Racial or ethnic purity” was the goal of the Nazis, intent on forging a [[Greater Germanic Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bendix|1997|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the decades immediately following the Second World War, departments of Folklore were being established in multiple German universities. However an analysis of just what part folklore studies played in justifying and supporting the criminal abuses during the Third Reich did not begin until 20 years after World War II in West Germany. The scholarship, in particular the works of Hermann Bausinger and Wolfgang Emmerich in the 1960s, pointed out that the vocabulary current in Volkskunde was ideally suited for the kind of ideology that the National Socialists had built up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lixfeld|Dow|1994|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then another 20 years before convening the 1986 Munich conference on Folklore and National Socialism. This continues to be a difficult and painful discussion within the German folklore community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lixfeld|Dow|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
Following World War II, the discussion continued about whether to align folklore studies with literature or ethnology. Within this discussion, many voices were actively trying to identify the optimal approach to take in the analysis of folklore artifacts. One major change had already been initiated by Franz Boas. Culture was no longer viewed in evolutionary terms; each culture has its own integrity and completeness, and was not progressing either toward wholeness or toward fragmentation. Individual artifacts must have meaning within the culture and for individuals themselves in order to assume [[Cultural relativism|cultural relevance]] and assure continued transmission. Because the European folklore movement had been primarily oriented toward oral traditions, a new term, [[folklife]], was introduced to represent the full range of traditional culture. This included [[music]], [[dance]], [[storytelling]], [[crafts]], [[costume]], [[foodways]] and more.

Folklore became more than just stuff, it became a verb. Folklore was the event of doing within a given context, for a specific audience, using artifacts as necessary props in the communication of traditions between individuals and within groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|1972|page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, these new areas of folklore studies became articulated in [[performance studies]], where traditional behaviors are evaluated and understood within the context of their performance. It is the meaning within the social group that becomes the focus for these folklorists, foremost among them [[Richard Bauman]]n&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Baumann|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enclosing any performance is a framework which signals that the following is something outside of ordinary communication. For example, [[Joke#Telling jokes|"So, have you heard the one…"]] automatically flags the following as a joke. A performance can take place either within a cultural group, re-iterating and re-enforcing the customs and beliefs of the group. Or it can be performance for an outside group, in which the first goal is to set the performers apart from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Baumann|1971|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This analysis then goes beyond the artifact itself, be it dance, music or story-telling. It goes beyond the performers and their message. As part of performance studies, the audience becomes part of the performance. If any folklore performance strays too far from audience expectations, it will likely be brought back by means of a negative feedback loop at the next iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both performer and audience are acting within the "Twin Laws" of [[Folk process|folklore transmission]], in which novelty and innovation is balanced by the conservative forces of the familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even further, the presence of a [[Participant observation#Impact of researcher involvement|folklore observer]] at a performance of any kind will influence the performance itself in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Because folklore is firstly an act of communication between parties, it is incomplete without inclusion of the reception in its analysis. The understanding of folklore performance as communication leads directly into [[Linguistics#Anthropology|modern linguistic theory]] and [[communication studies]]. Words both reflect and shape our worldview. Oral traditions, particularly in their stability over generations and even centuries, provide significant insight into the ways in which insiders of a culture see, understand, and express their responses to the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In his chapter "Folklore and Cultural Worldview", Toelken provides an illuminating comparison of the worldview of European Americans with Navajos. In the use of language, the two cultural groups express widely differing understandings of their spatial and temporal place in the universe.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three major approaches to folklore interpretation were developed during the second half of the 20th century. [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology|Structuralism]] in folklore studies attempts to define the structures underlying oral and customary folklore.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, a [[joke]] uses words within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh. A [[fable]] uses anthropomorphized animals and natural features to illustrate a moral lesson, frequently concluding with a moral. These are just a few of the many formulaic structures used in oral traditions.&lt;/ref&gt; Once classified, it was easy for structural folklorists to lose sight of the overarching issue: what are the characteristics which keep a form constant and relevant over multiple generations? [[Structural functionalism|Functionalism]] in folklore studies also came to the fore following World War II; as spokesman, [[William Bascom]] formulated the [[William Bascom#Four functions of folklore|4 functions of folklore]]. This approach takes a more top-down approach to understand how a specific form fits into and expresses meaning within the culture as a whole.&lt;ref group=note&gt;An example of this are the [[Joke#Joke cycles|joke cycles]] that spontaneously appear in response to a national or world tragedy or disaster.&lt;/ref&gt; A third method of folklore analysis, popular in the late 20th century, is the [[Psychoanalytic theory|Psychoanalytic]] Interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=187ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; championed by [[Alan Dundes]]. His monographs, including a study of homoerotic subtext in American football&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1978|title=Into the Endzone for a Touchdown}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anal-erotic elements in German folklore,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; were not always appreciated and involved Dundes in several major folklore studies [[Alan Dundes#Controversy|controversies]] during his career. True to each of these approaches, and any others one might want to employ (political, women's issues, material culture, urban contexts, non-verbal text, ad infinitum), whichever perspective is chosen will spotlight some features and leave other characteristics in the shadows.

With the passage in 1976 of the American Folklife Preservation Act, folklore studies in the United States came of age. This legislation follows in the footsteps of other legislation designed to safeguard more tangible aspects of our [[Cultural Heritage|national heritage]] worthy of protection. This law also marks a shift in our national awareness; it gives voice to the national understanding that diversity within the country is a unifying feature, not something that separates us.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://folkways.si.edu/mission-history/smithsonian | title=Mission and History}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We no longer view cultural difference as a problem to be solved, but as a tremendous opportunity. In the diversity of American folklife we find a marketplace teeming with the exchange of traditional forms and cultural ideas, a rich resource for Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This diversity is celebrated annually at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] and many other [[List of folk festivals|folklife fests]] around the country.

==Leaning into the 21st century== 
With the advent of the [[digital age]], the question once again foregrounds itself concerning the relevance of [[folklore]] in this new century. Yet the profession grows and articles and books on folklore topics proliferate. That said, the traditional role of the folklorist is indeed changing.

===Globalization===
America is known as a land of immigrants; with the exception of the first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian nations]], everyone originally came from somewhere else. Americans are proud of their [[cultural diversity]]. For folklorists, this country represents a trove of cultures rubbing elbows with each other, mixing and matching into exciting combinations as new generations come up. It is in the study of their folklife that we begin to understand the cultural patterns underlying the different ethnic groups. Language and customs provide a window into their view of reality. "The study of varying worldviews among ethnic and national groups in America remains one of the most important unfinished tasks for folklorists and anthropologists."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv| Toelken|1996|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also Dundes (2005), pg. 387. [Folklore studies is] "a discipline which has been ahead of its time in recognizing the importance of folklore in promoting ethnic pride and in providing invaluable data for the discovery of native cognitive categories and patterns of worldview and values."&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to a widespread concern, we are not seeing a loss of diversity and increasing [[cultural homogenization]] across the land.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The newness of this discussion can be seen in the references for [[Cultural homogenization]]; all sources listed have been published in 21st century.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, critics of this theory point out that as different cultures mix, the cultural landscape becomes multifaceted with the intermingling of customs. People become aware of other cultures and pick and choose different items to adopt from each other. One noteworthy example of this is the [[Hanukkah bush|Jewish Christmas Tree]], a point of some contention among American Jews.

[[Public folklore|Public sector folklore]] was introduced into the [[American Folklore Society]] in the early 1970s. These public folklorists work in museums and cultural agencies to identify and document the diverse folk cultures and folk artists in their region. Beyond this, they provide performance venues for the artists, with the twin objectives of entertainment and education about different ethnic groups. Given the [[List of folk festivals|number of folk festivals]] held around the world, it becomes clear that the cultural multiplicity of a region is presented with pride and excitement. Public folklorists are increasingly being involved in economic and community development projects to elucidate and clarify differing world views of the social groups impacted by the projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet usage===
With the advent of the internet, the transmission of individual folklore artifacts to a worldwide audience is done in a flash. We are no longer dependent upon individual performers to find us with their song and dance; now they just broadcast across the net. An example of this is [[Joke#Electronic joking|electronic joking]], which has become as common as oral joking and can reach a much larger audience with just a button click. The folk group is no longer exclusively defined by physical presence and locality, it also exists in the connectivity of cyberspace. With this, diffusion of folklore is skewed away from a live performance toward a multiplicity of new venues and social groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Mason|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new transmission modes apply not only to oral folklore. Traditional skills and handicrafts can be videotaped and uploaded to [[YouTube]], enabling any interested individual anywhere in the world access to this record of specific traditional skills.&lt;ref group=note&gt;One example is found on the YouTube channel for Primitive Technology. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA&lt;/ref&gt; No longer anchored in time and space, both the social group and the channels of folklore transmission have expanded across the globe.

===Computerized databases and big data===
Once folklore artifacts have been recorded on the World Wide Web, they can be collected in large electronic databases and even moved into collections of [[big data]]. This compels folklorists to find new ways to collect and [[data curation|curate]] these data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes |2005|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these new challenges, electronic data collections provide the opportunity to ask different questions, and combine with other academic fields to explore new aspects of traditional culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computational humor]] is just one new field that has taken up the traditional oral forms of jokes and anecdotes for study, holding its first dedicated conference in 1996. This takes us beyond gathering and categorizing large joke collections. Scholars are using computers firstly to recognize jokes in context,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sacks|1974|pages=337–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further to attempt to create jokes using [[artificial intelligence]].

===Binary thinking of the computer age===
As we move forward in the digital age, the [[binary opposition|binary thinking]] of the 20th century [[Structuralism|structuralists]] remains an important tool in the folklorist's toolbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=184–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that binary thinking was invented in recent times along with computers; only that we became aware of both the power and the limitations of the "either/or" construction. In folklore studies, the multiple binaries underlying much of the theoretical thinking have been identified – {dynamicism : conservatism}, {anecdote : myth}, {process : structure}, {performance : tradition}, {improvisation : repetition}, {variation : traditionalism},  {repetition : innovation};&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to overlook the original binary of the first folklorists: {traditional : modern} or {old : new}. Bauman re-iterates this thought pattern in claiming that at the core of all folklore is the dynamic tension between tradition and variation (or creativity).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|2008|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noyes&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Noyes|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses similar vocabulary to define [folk] group as "the ongoing play and tension between, on the one hand, the fluid networks of relationship we constantly both produce and negotiate in everyday life and, on the other, the imagined communities we also create and enact but that serve as forces of stabilizing allegiance."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thinking only becomes problematic in light of the theoretical work done on [[binary opposition]], which exposes the values intrinsic to any binary pair. Typically, one of the two opposites assumes a role of dominance over the other. The categorization of binary oppositions is "often value-laden and ethnocentric", imbuing them with illusory order and superficial meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Goody|1977|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear and non-linear concepts of time===
Another baseline of western thought has also been thrown into disarray in the recent past. In western culture, we live in a time of [[progress (history)|progress]], moving forward from one moment to the next. The goal is to become better and better, culminating in perfection. In this model time is linear, with direct causality in the progression. "You reap what you sow", "A stitch in time saves nine", "Alpha and omega", the Christian concept of an [[afterlife]] all exemplify a cultural understanding of time as linear and progressive. In folklore studies, going backwards in time was also a valid avenue of exploration. The goal of the early folklorists of the [[Folkloristics#Aarne–Thompson and the historic-geographic method|historic-geographic school]] was to reconstruct from fragments of folk tales the Urtext of the original mythic (pre-Christian) world view. When and where was an artifact documented? Those were the important questions posed by early folklorists in their collections. Armed with these data points, a grid pattern of [[Spacetime|time-space]] coordinates for artifacts could be plotted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|pages=271–274}}, {{harv|Dorst|2016|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awareness has grown that different cultures have different concepts of time (and space). In his study "The American Indian Mind in a Linear World", Donald Fixico describes an alternate concept of time. "Indian thinking" involves "'seeing' things from a perspective emphasizing that circles and cycles are central to world and that all things are related within the Universe." He then suggests that "the concept of time for Indian people has been such a continuum that time becomes less relevant and the rotation of life or seasons of the year are stressed as important."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rouse|2012|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;This blanket interpretation has been questioned by some as too simplistic in its sweeping application to all Native American tribes. See {{harv|Rouse|2012|page=14ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more specific example, the folklorist [[Barre Toelken]] describes the Navajo as living in circular times, which is echoed and re-enforced in their sense of space, the traditional circular or multi-sided [[hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|pages=275ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking the European mechanistic devices of marking time (clocks, watches, calendars), they depended on the cycles of nature: sunrise to sunset, winter to summer. Their stories and histories are not marked by decades and centuries, but remain close in, as they circle around the constant rhythms of the natural world.

Within the last decades our time scale has expanded from unimaginably small ([[nanoseconds]]) to unimaginably large ([[deep time]]). In comparison, our working concept of time as {past : present : future} looks almost quaint. How do we map "tradition" into this multiplicity of time scales? Folklore studies has already acknowledged this in the study of traditions which are either done in an annual cycle of circular time (ex. Christmas, May Day), or in a life cycle of linear time (ex. baptisms, weddings, funerals). This needs to be expanded to other traditions of oral lore. For folk narrative is NOT a linear chain of isolated tellings, going from one single performance on our time-space grid to the next single performance. Instead it fits better into a non-linear system, where one performer varies the story from one telling to the next, and the performer's understudy starts to tell the story, also varying each performance in response to multiple factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cybernetics===
[[Cybernetics]] was first developed in the 20th century; it investigates the functions and processes of systems. The goal in cybernetics is to identify and understand a system's closed signaling loop, in which an action by the system generates a change in the environment, which in turn triggers feedback to the system and initiates a new action. The field has expanded from a focus on mechanistic and biological systems to an expanded recognition that these theoretical constructs can also be applied to many cultural and societal systems, including folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once divorced from a model of tradition that works solely on a linear time scale (i.e. moving from one folklore performance to the next), we begin to ask different questions about how these folklore artifacts maintain themselves over generations and centuries.

The oral tradition of [[jokes]] as an example is found across all cultures, and is documented as early as 1600 B.C.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The earliest recorded joke is on an Egyptian papyrus dated at 1600 B.C. See [[:Joke#Printed jokes and the solitary laugh]].&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the subject matter varies widely to reflect its cultural context, the form of the joke remains remarkably consistent. According to the theories of cybernetics and its secondary field of [[autopoiesis]], this can be attributed to a closed loop auto-correction built into the system maintenance of oral folklore. Auto-correction in oral folklore was first articulated by the folklorist [[Walter Anderson (folklorist)|Walter Anderson]] in his monograph on the [[King John and the Bishop|King and the Abbot]] published 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Anderson|1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain the stability of the narrative, Anderson posited a “double redundancy”, in which the performer has heard the story from multiple other performers, and has himself performed it multiple times. This provides a feedback loop between repetitions at both levels to retain the essential elements of the tale, while at the same time allowing for the incorporation of new elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic of cybernetics and autopoiesis is self-generation within a system. Once again looking to jokes, we find new jokes generated in response to events on a continuing basis. The folklorist Bill Ellis accessed internet humor message boards to observe in real time the creation of topical jokes following the 9/11 terrorist attack in the United States. "Previous folklore research has been limited to collecting and documenting successful jokes, and only after they had emerged and come to folklorists' attention. Now, an Internet-enhanced collection creates a time machine, as it were, where we can observe what happens in the period before the risible moment, when attempts at humour are unsuccessful.", that is before they have successfully mapped into the traditional joke format.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ellis|2002|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Second-order cybernetics]] states that the system observer affects the systemic interplay; this interplay has long been recognized as problematic by folklorists. The act of observing and noting any folklore performance raises without exception the performance from an unconscious habitual acting within a group, to and for themselves, to a performance for an outsider. "Naturally the researcher's presence changes things, in the way that any new entrant to a social setting changes things. When people of different backgrounds, agendas, and resources interact, there are social risks, and where representation and publication are taking place, these risks are exacerbated..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.afsnet.org/default.asp?page=HumanSubjects | title=AFS Position Statement on Research with Human Subjects - American Folklore Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;For a further discussion of this, see also {{harv|Schmidt-Lauber|2012|page=362ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glitch art''' is the practice of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes by either corrupting digital data or physically manipulating electronic devices. Glitches appear in visual art such as the film ''A Colour Box'' (1935) by [[Len Lye]], the video sculpture ''TV Magnet'' (1965) by [[Nam June Paik]] and more contemporary work such as ''Panasonic TH-42PWD8UK Plasma Screen Burn'' (2007) by [[Cory Arcangel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Menkman | first = Rosa | author-link = Rosa Menkman | contribution = Glitch Studies Manifesto | editor1-last = Lovink | editor1-first = Geert | editor2-last = Somers-Miles | editor2-first = Rachel | title = Video Vortex Reader II: Moving Images Beyond YouTube | volume =  | pages = 336–347 | publisher = Institute of Network Cultures | place = Amsterdam | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-90-78146-12-4 | contribution-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110827222833/http://www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/%236reader_VideoVortex2PDF.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==

In a technical sense, a [[glitch]] is the unexpected result of a malfunction, especially occurring in software, video games, images, videos, audio, and other digital artefacts. Early examples of glitches used in [[new media art|media art]] include ''Digital TV Dinner'' (1978) created by Jamie Fenton and Raul Zaritsky, with glitch audio done by Dick Ainsworth. This video was made by manipulating the [[Bally Astrocade|Bally video game console]] and recording the results on videotape.&lt;ref name=betancourt&gt;Betancourt, Michael. (2015) [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/Betancourt_TheInventionofGlitchVideo.pdf The Invention of Glitch Video: Digital TV Dinner (1978) (preview)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term glitch came to be associated with music in the mid 90s to describe a genre of experimental/noise/electronica (see [[Glitch (music)|glitch music]]). Shortly after, as VJs and other visual artist began to embrace the glitch as an aesthetic of the digital age, glitch art came to refer to a whole assembly of visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, Michael. (2003) "Welcome to Cyberia" [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/MAEX_Welcome_to_Cyberia_2003.pdf], ''Miami Art Exchange,'' September 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2002, Motherboard, a tech-art collective, held a glitch symposium in [[Oslo]], Norway, to "bring together international artists, academics and other Glitch practitioners for a short space of time to share their work and ideas with the public and with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Motherboard. (2002) http://www.liveart.org/motherboard/&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29 thru October 3, 2010, [[Chicago]] played host to the first GLI.TC/H, a five-day conference in Chicago organized by Nick Briz, Evan Meaney, [[Rosa Menkman]] and Jon Satrom that included workshops, lectures, performances, installations and screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = McCormack| first = Tom| title = Code Eroded: At GLI.TC/H| work = Rhizome| accessdate = 2016-08-25| date = 2010-10-13| url = http://rhizome.org/editorial/2010/oct/13/code-eroded-at-glitch/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, the second GLI.TC/H event traveled from [[Chicago]] to [[Amsterdam]] and lastly to [[Birmingham]], UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/chicagos-glitch-fest-disrupts-the-traditional-gallery-space The Creators Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229055113/http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/chicagos-glitch-fest-disrupts-the-traditional-gallery-space |date=February 29, 2012 }}. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It included workshops, screenings, lectures, performance, panel discussions and a gallery show over the course of seven days at the three cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Rubin| first = Josh| title = GLI.TC/H: A Chicago convention explores artistic failures of the digital world| work = Cool Hunting| accessdate = 2016-08-26| date = 2011-11-04| url = http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/glitch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glitch Art.jpg|thumbnail|Example of glitch art, by [[Rosa Menkman]]]]

What is called "glitch art" typically means visual glitches, either in a still or moving image. It is made by either "capturing" an image of a glitch as it randomly happens, or more often by artists/designers manipulating their digital files, software or hardware to produce these "errors." Artists have posted a variety of tutorials online explaining how to make glitch art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danieltemkin.com/Tutorials Daniel Temkin, "Glitch Tutorials," DanielTemkin.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://phillipstearns.wordpress.com/glitch-art-resources/ Phillip Stearns, "Glitch Art Resources," phillipstearns.wordpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many approaches to making these glitches happen on demand, ranging from physical changes to the hardware to direct alternations of the digital files themselves. Artist [[Michael Betancourt]] identified five areas of manipulation that are used to create "glitchart."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Betancourt]], "Glitch Art in Theory and Practice," Cinegraphic.net May 20, 2016 [http://www.cinegraphic.net/article.php?story=20160520143014412]&lt;/ref&gt; Betancourt notes that "glitch art" is defined by a broad range of technical approaches that can be identified with changes made to the digital file, its generative display, or the technologies used to show it (such as a video screen). He includes within this range changes made to analog technologies such as television (in video art) or the physical film strip in motion pictures:

===Data manipulation===
[[File:My first datamosh.webm|thumb|right|200px|An example of datamoshing]]
Data manipulation  (aka ''[[databending]]'') changes the information inside the digital file to create glitches. Databending involves editing and changing the file data. There are a variety of tutorials explaining how to make these changes using programs such as HexFiend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Betancourt]], "An Easy 7-Step Protocol for Databending," ''Signal Culture Cookbook,'' 2014 [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/Cookbook_Databending.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Woodall explains in his tutorial
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like all files, image files (.jpg .bmp .gif etc) are all made up of text. Unlike some other files, like .svg (vectors) or .html (web pages), when an image is opened in a text editor all that comes up is gobbldygook!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fizzpop.org.uk/an-introduction-to-databending/ Adam Woodall, "An introduction to databending ," FizzPop, May 15, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Related processes such as '''datamoshing''' changes the data in a video or picture file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Datamoshing Technique for Video Art Production|journal=芸術科学会論文誌 - The Journal of The Society for Art and Science|volume=13|url=http://www.art-science.org/journal/v13n3/v13n3pp154/artsci-v13n3pp154.pdf|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flossmanuals"/&gt;  Datamoshing with software such as [[Avidemux]] is a common method for creating glitch art by manipulating different frame types in compressed digital video: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Datamoshing involves the removal of an encoded video’s I-frames (intra-coded picture, also known as key frames—a frame that does not require any information regarding another frame to be decoded), leaving only the P- (predicted picture) or B- (bi-predictive picture) frames. P-frames contain information predicting the changes in the image between the current frame and the previous one, and B-frames contain information predicting the image differences between the previous, current and subsequent frames. Because P- and B-frames use data from previous and forward frames, they are more compressed than I-Frames."&lt;ref&gt;Zinman, Gregory (2015). ‘Getting Messy: Chance and Glitch in Contemporary Video Art,’ in Abstract Video: The Moving Image in Contemporary Art, edited by Gabrielle Jennings. Oakland: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This process of direct manipulation of the digital data is not restricted to files that only appear on digital screens. "3D model glitching" refers to the purposeful corruption of the code in [[List of 3D animation software|3D animation program]]s resulting in distorted and abstract images of 3D [[virtual world]]s, [[3D modeling|models]] and even [[3D printing|3D printed objects]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turk|first1=Victoria|title=3D-Printed Mistakes Are Inspiring a New Kind of Glitch Art|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/3d-printed-mistakes-are-inspiring-a-new-kind-of-glitch-art|publisher=Vice Motherboard|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misalignment===
Misalignment glitches are produced by opening a digital file of one type with a program designed for a different type of file,&lt;ref name="flossmanuals"&gt;{{cite web|title=Encoding Explained|url=https://flossmanuals.net/a-look-at-open-video/encoding-explained/|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as opening a video file as a sound file, or using the wrong codec to decompress a file.  Tools commonly used to create glitches of this type include [[Audacity (audio editor)|Audacity]] and [[WordPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=databending and glitch art primer, part 1: the wordpad effect|url=http://blog.animalswithinanimals.com/2008/08/databending-and-glitch-art-primer-part.html|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist Jamie Boulton explains the process and the glitches it produces, noting that these glitches depend on how Audacity handles files, even when they are not audio-encoded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The easiest way to manipulate a file in Audacity is to select a section of the file and apply one of the built in sound effects to it. Now I’m no computing whizz kid but the way I see it when you apply a sound effect to a sound file, the program takes that file and alters the file data in the manner which it’s been told will achieve that effect. So, for example, if you were to apply an echo effect then it would repeat parts of the file, diminishing the repetition after each iteration. The wonderful thing is that it will do this regardless of what the file actually is. Audacity doesn’t know or care whether the file is a sound or not, it will alter it in the manner instructed.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Boulton, "Databending using Audacity Effects," Question Something, July 26, 2012 [https://questionsomething.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/databending-using-audacity-effects/]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hardware failure===
Hardware failure happens by altering the physical wiring or other internal connections of the machine itself, such as a short-circuit, in a process called "[[circuit bending]]" causes the machine to create glitches that produce new sounds and visuals.&lt;ref name=wired1&gt;{{cite web|title=Glitch art created by 'databending'|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/glitch-art-databending|work=Wired|first=Duncan |last= Geere |accessdate=19 July 2016|date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by damaging internal pieces of something like a [[VHS]] player, one can achieve different colorful visual images. Video artist [[Tom DeFanti]] explained the role of hardware failure in a voice-over for Jamie Fenton's early glitch video ''Digital TV Dinner'' that used the [[Bally Astrocade|Bally video game console]] system:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This piece represents the absolute cheapest one can go in home computer art. This involves taking a $300 video game system, pounding it with your fist so the cartridge pops out while its trying to write the menu.  The music here is done by Dick Ainsworth using the same system, but pounding it with your fingers instead of your fist.&lt;ref name=betancourt/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Physically beating the case of the game system would cause the game cartridge to pop out, interrupting the computer's operation. The glitches that resulted from this failure were a result of how the machine was set-up:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There was ROM memory in the cartridge and ROM memory built into the console. Popping out the cartridge while executing code in the console ROM created garbage references in the stack frames and invalid pointers, which caused the strange patterns to be drawn. [...] The Bally Astrocade was unique among cartridge games in that it was designed to allow users to change game cartridges with power-on. When pressing the reset button, it was possible to remove the cartridge from the system and induce various memory dump pattern sequences. Digital TV Dinner is a collection of these curious states of silicon epilepsy set to music composed and generated upon this same platform.&lt;ref name=betancourt/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Misregistration===
Misregistration is produced by the physical noise of historically analog media such as motion picture film. It includes dirt, scratches, smudges and markings that can distort physical media also impact the playback of digital recordings on media such as CDs and DVDs, as electronic music composer [[Kim Cascone]] explained in 2002:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There are many types of digital audio ‘failure.' Sometimes, it results in horrible noise, while other times it can produce wondrous tapestries of sound. (To more adventurous ears, these are quite often the same.) When the German sound experimenters known as Oval started creating music in the early 1990s by painting small images on the underside of CDs to make them skip, they were using an aspect of ‘failure' in their work that revealed a subtextual layer embedded in the compact disc.

Oval's investigation of ‘failure' is not new. Much work had previously been done in this area such as the optical soundtrack work of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Oskar Fischinger, as well as the vinyl record manipulations of John Cage and Christian Marclay, to name a few. What is new is that ideas now travel at the speed of light and can spawn entire musical genres in a relatively short period of time."&lt;ref name=Cascone1&gt;{{cite web|title=THE AESTHETICS OF FAILURE 'Post-Digital' Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/journals/COMJ/CMJ24_4Cascone.pdf|work=''Computer Music Journal,'' 24:4 Winter 2002 (MIT Press)|first=Kim |last=Cascone | author-link = Kim_Cascone |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Distortion===
Distortion was one of the earliest types of glitch art to be produced, such as in the work of video artist [[Nam June Paik]], who created video distortions by placing powerful magnets in close proximity to the television screen, resulting in the appearance of abstract patterns.&lt;ref name=Keys1&gt;{{cite web|title=Error Message|url=http://www.richardbkeys.net/error-message/|first=Richard B. |last=Keys |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paik's addition of physical interference to a TV set created new kinds of imagery that changed how the broadcast image was displayed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The magnetic field interferes with the television’s electronic signals, distorting the broadcast image into an abstract form that changes when the magnet is moved.&lt;ref&gt;"Nam June Paik: TV Magnet," Whitney Museum of American Art, web description for accession number 86.60a-b [http://collection.whitney.org/object/6139]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By recording the resulting distortions with a camera, they can then be shown without the need for the magnet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1970">'''Infiltration Art''' is a branch of [[Intervention art|Intervention Art]] in which artists collaborate with institutions, communities, politicians, religions, museums and pop-culture figures outside of the traditional art world. Unlike other forms of intervention art, Infiltration Art seeks to create symbiotic relationships with the host institutions.

Artists whose work incorporates elements of infiltration include [[Banksy]], Christian Cummings, [[Nikki S. Lee]], [[Taryn Simon]], [[Jeffrey Vallance]], [[David Hildebrand Wilson]], [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], the Nationwide Museum Mascot Project (NWMMP).

'''Installation art''' is an artistic genre of [[three-dimensional]] works that often are [[site-specific art|site-specific]] and designed to transform the perception of a space. Generally, the term is applied to interior spaces, whereas exterior interventions are often called [[public art]], [[land art]] or [[intervention art]]; however, the boundaries between these terms overlap.

==History==
[[File:Art exhibit at ALMA.jpg|thumb|A golf ball of enormous proportions alongside the antennas at an altitude of 5000 meters above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artistic Apparition at ALMA|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15048/|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Installation art can be either temporary or permanent. Installation artworks have been constructed in exhibition spaces such as museums and galleries, as well as public and private spaces. The genre incorporates a broad range of everyday and natural materials, which are often chosen for their "evocative" qualities, as well as [[new media]] such as [[video]], [[sound]], [[performance]], [[immersive virtual reality]] and the [[internet]]. Many installations are [[Site-Specific Art|site-specific]] in that they are designed to exist only in the space for which they were created, appealing to qualities evident in a three-dimensional immersive medium. Artistic collectives such as the [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab|Exhibition Lab]] at New York's [[American Museum of Natural History]] created environments to showcase the natural world in as realistic a medium as possible. Likewise, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] employed a similar philosophy when designing the multiple immersive spaces for [[Disneyland]] in 1955. Since its acceptance as a separate discipline, a number of institutions focusing on Installation art were created. These included the [[Mattress Factory]], Pittsburgh, the Museum of Installation in London, and the [[Fairy Doors of Ann Arbor, MI]], among others.

Installation art came to prominence in the 1970s but its roots can be identified in earlier artists such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] and his use of the [[readymade]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]]' ''Merz'' art objects, rather than more traditional [[craft]] based [[sculpture]]. The "intention" of the artist is paramount in much later installation art whose roots lie in the [[conceptual art]] of the 1960s. This again is a departure from traditional sculpture which places its focus on [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]]. Early non-Western installation art includes events staged by the [[Gutai group]] in Japan starting in 1954, which influenced American installation pioneers like [[Allan Kaprow]].
[[Wolf Vostell]] shows his installation ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'' in 1963&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage/ Wolf Vostell, ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'', 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Smolin Gallery]] in New York.

==Installation==
[[File:Petzel shapes.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Allan McCollum]].''The Shapes Project'', 2005/06]]
''Installation'' as nomenclature for a specific form of art came into use fairly recently; its first use as documented by the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1969. It was coined in this context, in reference to a form of art that had arguably existed since prehistory but was not regarded as a discrete category until the mid-twentieth century. [[Allan Kaprow]] used the term "Environment" in 1958 (Kaprow 6) to describe his transformed indoor spaces; this later joined such terms as "project art" and "temporary art."

Essentially, installation/environmental art takes into account a broader sensory experience, rather than floating framed points of focus on a "neutral" wall or displaying isolated objects (literally) on a pedestal. This may leave [[space]] and [[time]] as its only dimensional constants, implying dissolution of the line between "art" and "life"; Kaprow noted that "if we bypass 'art' and take nature itself as a model or point of departure, we may be able to devise a different kind of art... out of the sensory stuff of ordinary life".

==Gesamtkunstwerk==
The conscious act of artistically addressing all the senses with regard to a total experience made a resounding debut in 1849 when [[Richard Wagner]] conceived of a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', or an operatic work for the stage that drew inspiration from ancient [[Greek theater]] in its inclusion of all the major art forms: [[painting]], [[writing]], [[music]], etc. (Britannica). In devising operatic works to commandeer the audience's senses, Wagner left nothing unobserved: [[architecture]], ambience, and even the [[audience]] itself were considered and manipulated in order to achieve a state of total artistic immersion. In the book "Themes in Contemporary Art", it is suggested that "installations in the 1980s and 1990s were increasingly characterized by networks of operations involving the interaction among complex architectural settings, environmental sites and extensive use of everyday objects in ordinary contexts. With the advent of video in 1965, a concurrent strand of installation evolved through the use of new and ever-changing technologies, and what had been simple video installations expanded to include complex interactive, multimedia and virtual reality environments".

==Art and Objecthood==
[[File:Franzoesischer Dom - Festival of Lights 2011.jpg|thumb|''Guardians of Time'', [[Manfred Kielnhofer]], [[Festival of Lights (Berlin)]] French Cathedral, Berlin, Velotaxi 2011]]
In "Art and Objecthood", [[Michael Fried]] derisively labels art that acknowledges the viewer as "theatrical" (Fried 45). There is a strong parallel between installation and theater: both play to a viewer who is expected to be at once immersed in the [[perception|sensory]]/[[narrative]] experience that surrounds him and maintain a degree of self-identity as a viewer. The traditional theater-goer does not forget that he has come in from outside to sit and take in a created experience; a trademark of installation art has been the curious and eager viewer, still aware that he is in an exhibition setting and tentatively exploring the novel universe of the installation.

The artist and critic [[Ilya Kabakov]] mentions this essential phenomenon in the introduction to his lectures "On the "Total" Installation": "[One] is simultaneously both a 'victim' and a viewer, who on the one hand surveys and evaluates the installation, and on the other, follows those associations, recollections which arise in him[;] he is overcome by the intense atmosphere of the total illusion". Here installation art bestows an unprecedented importance on the observer's inclusion in that which he observes. The expectations and social habits that the viewer takes with him into the space of the installation will remain with him as he enters, to be either applied or negated once he has taken in the new environment. What is common to nearly all installation art is a consideration of the experience in toto and the problems it may present, namely the constant conflict between disinterested criticism and sympathetic involvement. [[Television]] and [[video]] offer somewhat immersive experiences, but their unrelenting control over the [[rhythm]] of passing time and the arrangement of images precludes an intimately personal viewing experience. Ultimately, the only things a viewer can be assured of when experiencing the work are his own thoughts and preconceptions and the basic rules of space and time. All else may be molded by the artist's hands.

The central importance of the [[Subjective experience|subjective]] point of view when experiencing installation art, points toward a disregard for traditional [[Platonism|Platonic]] image theory. In effect, the entire installation adopts the character of the [[simulacrum]] or flawed [[statue]]: it neglects any ideal form in favor of optimizing its direct appearance to the observer. Installation art operates fully within the realm of sensory perception, in a sense "installing" the viewer into an artificial system with an appeal to his subjective perception as its ultimate goal.

==Interactive installations==

[[Image:Maurizio bolognini genoa.JPG|210px|thumb|An urban interactive art installation by [[Maurizio Bolognini]] (Genoa, 2005), which everybody can modify by using a cell phone.]]
An [[Interactive Art|interactive installation]] frequently involves the audience acting on the work of art or the piece responding to users' activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Younis|first1=Lauren|title=Hearts and Scissors Exhibit to Open|url=http://bl-ids-website.ads.iu.edu/news/story.aspx?id=66728|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=March 5, 2009|quote="Installation art can facilitate a direct, immediate interaction with the viewer," [Cindy] Hinant said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several kinds of interactive installations that artists produce, these include [[Internet art|web]]-based installations (e.g., [[Telegarden]]), [[Art gallery|gallery]]-based installations, [[Digital art|digital]]-based installations, [[Electronics|electronic]]-based installations, [[IPhone art|mobile]]-based installations, etc. Interactive installations appeared mostly at end of the 1980s (''Legible City'' by [[Jeffrey Shaw]], ''La plume'' by [[Edmond Couchot]], Michel Bret...)  and became a genre during the 1990s, when artists became particularly interested in using the participation of the audiences to activate and reveal the meaning of the installation.

==Immersive virtual reality==

With the improvement of [[technology]] over the years, artists are more able to explore outside of the boundaries that were never able to be explored by artists in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Media (arts)|media]] used are more experimental and bold; they are also usually cross media and may involve sensors, which plays on the reaction to the audiences' movement when looking at the installations. By using virtual reality as a medium, [[immersive virtual reality]] art is probably the most deeply interactive form of art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing the spectator to "visit" the representation, the artist creates "situations to live" vs "spectacle to watch".&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Benayoun]], ''Maurice Benayoun Open Art'', Nouvelles éditions Scala, 2011, French version, {{ISBN|978-2-35988-046-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7944">In art, '''Institutional Critique''' is the systematic inquiry into the workings of art institutions, such as galleries and museums, and is most associated with the work of artists like [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Andrea Fraser]], [[John Knight (artist)]], [[Adrian Piper]], [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], and [[Hans Haacke]] and the scholarship of [[Alexander Alberro]], [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]], [[Birgit Pelzer]], and [[Anne Rorimer]].&lt;ref&gt;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/institutional-critique&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moca.org/exhibition/1965-1975-reconsidering-the-object-of-art&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional Critique takes the form of temporary or nontransferable approaches to painting and sculpture, architectural alterations and interventions, and performative gestures and language intended to disrupt the otherwise transparent operations of galleries and museums and the professionals who administer them. Examples would be [[Neile Toroni]] making imprints of a No. 50 brush at 30cm intervals directly onto gallery walls as opposed to applying the same mark to paper or canvas;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renaissancesociety.org/exhibitions/366/niele-toroni/&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Burden's ''Exposing the Foundation of the Museum'' (1986), in which he made an excavation in a gallery of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, to expose the literal concrete foundation of the building;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moca.org/collection/work/exposing-the-foundation-of-the-museum&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Andrea Fraser]] inhabiting the persona of an archetypical museum docent in the form of a live performance or video document.&lt;ref&gt;https://thewadsworth.org/threehistoriesfraser/&lt;/ref&gt; Assumptions about the aesthetic autonomy of painting and sculpture, the neutral context of the [[white cube]], and the objective delivery of information are explored as subjects of art, mapped out as discursive formations, and (re)framed within the context of the museum itself. As such, Institutional Critique seeks to make visible the social, political, economic, and historical underpinnings of art. Institutional Critique questions the false distinction between taste and disinterested aesthetic judgement, revealing that taste is an institutionally cultivated sensibility that differs depending on the intersection of any one person's class, ethnic, sexual, or gender subject positions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrp-ringier.com/pages/index.php?id_r=4&amp;id_t=&amp;id_p=7&amp;id_b=573&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

Institutional Critique is a practice that emerged from the developments of [[Minimalism]] and its concerns with the phenomenology of the viewer; formalist art criticism and art history (e.g. [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried (art critic)|Michael Fried]]); [[conceptual art]] and its concerns with language, processes, and administrative society; and the critique of authorship that begins with [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Michel Foucault]] in the late 1960s and continues with the advent of [[appropriation art]] in the 1970s and its upending of long-held notions of authorship, originality, artistic production, popular culture, and identity.  Institutional critique is often site-specific and is contemporaneous with the advent of artists who eschewed gallery and museum contexts altogether to build monumental earthworks in the landscape, notably [[Michael Heizer]], [[Nancy Holt]], [[Walter de Maria]], and [[Robert Smithson]]. Institutional critique is also associated with the development of post-structuralist philosophy, [[critical theory]], [[literary theory]], [[feminism]], gender studies, and [[critical race theory]].

== Artists ==

Artists associated with Institutional Critique since the 1960s include [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], [[John Knight (artist)]], [[Christopher D'Arcangelo]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], [[Adrian Piper]], and [[Martha Rosler]]. Artists active since the 1980s include [[Louise Lawler]], [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], [[Renée Green]], [[Group Material]], [[Andrea Fraser]], [[Fred Forest]], [[Christian Philipp Müller]], [[Aaron Flint Jamison]], and [[Mark Dion]]. 

In the early 1990s, influenced in large part by Daniel Buren, [[Jacques Tati]], [[Roland Barthes]], and the participatory sculptures of [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], a loose affiliation of artists including [[Liam Gillick]], [[Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], and [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]] engaged the institution of art in a convivial manner. These artists, gathered under the rubric of [[Relational Aesthetics]] by critic [[Nicholas Bourriaud]], saw galleries and museums as sites of social interaction and the spontaneous creation of works of art characterized by their contingent temporality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayrevue.com/en/traffic-espaces-temps-de-lechange/&lt;/ref&gt; The collegial atmosphere of these open-ended situations was quite distinct from the more confrontational strategies of Buren, Haacke, [[Jenny Holzer]], and [[Barbara Kruger]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marginalutility.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Claire-Bishop_Antagonism-and-Relational-Aesthetics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sachabaumann.com/shes-krafty-diary/2004/2/12/traffic-control-joe-scanlan-on-social-space-and-relational-a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Brian Goeltzenleuchter]], [[Matthieu Laurette]], [[Tameka Norris]], [[Tino Sehgal]], [[Carey Young]], and others have taken a critical eye to the art museum and its role as a public and private institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thingsthatfall.com/fair-use.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/maurizio-cattelan-america&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

One of the criticisms of Institutional Critique is that it requires from its audience a familiarity with its esoteric concerns. As with much contemporary music and dance,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/28/alex-ross-modern-classical-music&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.um.es/vmca/proceedings/docs/35.Inma-Alvarez.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Institutional Critique of art is a practice that only specialists in the field—artists, theorists, historians, and critics—are privy to. Due to its sophisticated understanding of modern art and society—and as part of a privileged discourse not unlike other specialized forms of knowledge—art as Institutional Critique can often leave [[layman]] viewers alienated and/or marginalized.

Another criticism of the concept is that it can be a misnomer. Artist [[Andrea Fraser]] (in Artforum) and critic Michael Kimmelman (in The New York Times) have argued, for example, that institutional critique artists work within—and benefit from—the very same institutions they ostensibly critique.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marginalutility.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Andrea-Fraser_From-the-Critique-of-Institutions-to-an-Institution-of-Critique.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/25/arts/design/tall-french-visitor-takes-up-residence-in-the-guggenheim.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khurja pottery''' is traditional Indian pottery work manufactured in [[Khurja]] of the [[Bulandshahr district|Bulandshahr]] district in [[Uttar Pradesh]] state, [[India]]. Khurja pottery has been protected under the [[Geographical indication]] (GI) of the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) agreement. It is listed at item 178 as "Khurja Pottery" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf |title=State Wise Registration Details Of G.I Applications |accessdate=4 February 2016 |publisher=Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201065403/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf |archivedate= 1 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Origin of Khurja’s pottery work has been said with at least two different stories. In one legend, Afghan King [[Timur|Taimur Lung]] accompanied [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] and [[Syrian]] potters during his campaign in the Khurja region over 500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/GI-certificate-to-preserve-uniqueness-of-Khurja-pottery/articleshow/47498632.cms | title=GI certificate to preserve uniqueness of Khurja pottery | publisher=The Times of India | date=1 June 2015 | accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another legend, potters had been moved to the region during [[Mughal Empire]] while another version says there we no long historical events in accordance with pottery tradition in Khurja.

However, the author of "Pottery-making Cultures and Indian Civilization" mentioned that "Khurja in Bulandshaher is one of the oldest centers for glazed pottery in India". Further mentioned, "These potters often call themselves as Multani Kumhars suggesting that their origin was [[Multan]]”.&lt;ref name="PolicyResearch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/PDF/Outputs/R74134.pdf | title=Mechanisms to Improve Energy Efficiency in Small Industries | publisher=Policy Research International | accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day pottery manufacture flourished in the 1940s, and the Uttar Pradesh government set up a pottery factory in 1942. Later, the factory was closed in 1946–47 due to lack of quality. In 1952, the factory was changed as Pottery Development Centre. From 1942 until now, some adoption, transformation, initiative were taken by various actors for the betterment of pottery manufacture that resulted an importance role of Khurja pottery in national level as well as export to foreign countries.&lt;ref name="PolicyResearch" /&gt;

== Production ==
There are about 15,000 people as official employees while about 25,000 unofficial employees who work in 500-odd units and nearly 400 factories. They produce several kinds of items such as crockery wares, art wares, electrical goods, sanitary wares, tiles, household items, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghumakkar.com/khurja-the-ceramics-city/ | title=ROAD TRIP TO KHURJA – THE CERAMICS CITY | accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khurja pottery has market in India and foreign countries. There are nearly 23 export oriented units. Reports say that production has received around 2,500 million Indian Rupees worth of item in 1999–2000 including 148.2 million Indian Rupees worth of export.&lt;ref name="PolicyResearch" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40700">The [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] (RSC) owns a number of significant artworks in its venue at [[Burlington House]] in London. The collection is composed of busts, paintings and other artefacts that were mainly acquired between the mid-19th and early 21st Centuries (the Chemical Society was founded in 1841 and merged with others to become the RSC in 1980). Most of the acquisitions were donations from past members and staff, although a few were purchased directly by the Society.

The marble bust representing the German chemist [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] is located on the ground floor. It was introduced to the Chemical Society in 1876 by Mr James Duncan:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anniversary Meeting|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society|date=1876|volume=29|pages=629–630|doi=10.1039/js8762900617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In recording the gratitude of the Society to those Gentlemen, the name of another Fellow, Mr. James Duncan, must be included among the recipients of our thanks, for his gift of a very interesting and valuable bust of one of our most highly-esteemed Fellows and Past Presidents, Professor Hofmann, the presentation of which, so soon after the Society had the pleasure of welcoming Dr. Hofmann as Faraday Lecturer, has been peculiarly appropriate. It is to be hoped that this handsome gift of Mr. Duncan’s and the excellent photograph of the late Dr. Anderson, presented by his widow, will not long remain the only monumental records of this kind possessed by the Society, of eminent workers in chemical science, past and living.}}

The inscription at the back {{quote|Joh. Pfuhl fec. Berlin 1875}} certifies that this artwork was created by the German sculptor [[Johannes Pfuhl]] in Berlin in 1875.

Justus von Liebig's pupil and William Perkin's mentor, von Hofmann widely contributed to the development of the organic chemistry. He was a cofounder of the [[German Chemical Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=August Wlhelm von Hofmann|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/August-Wilhelm-von-Hofmann|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; and President of the Chemical Society between 1861 and 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proceedings at the Meetings of the Chemical Society|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society of London|date=1862|volume=14|page=353|doi=10.1039/qj8621400347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the main hall, this artefact was created in the 18th Century. Made of gunmetal raised on a cross-banded walnut and oak base (32&amp;nbsp;cm × 44&amp;nbsp;cm. × 25.5&amp;nbsp;cm), it bears a presentation plaque with the following inscription:

{{quote|This [[pump|airpump]] was made for [[Joseph Priestley|Dr Priestley]] by Mr Harrison the employer of Sir [[Josiah Mason]] when a young man. Presented by Josiah Martin Smith ESQ.}}

Samuel Harrison (1759–1833) was a split ring maker with a workshop in Lancaster Street, Birmingham.

==''Hope: The Chemist''==
This painting (oil on canvas, 127&amp;nbsp;cm × 158&amp;nbsp;cm), located in the waiting room of Burlington House, was bought from the Albemarle Gallery by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2008. It is part of [[Stuart Luke Gatherer]]'s ''Sins and Virtues'' collection, which illustrates the seven sins and seven virtues using modern-day professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stuart Luke Gatherer|url=http://artistaday.com/?p=14945|website=Artistaday}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is based on an earlier classic, ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' (1768) by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], which was in turn inspired by Robert Boyle's experiment on the properties of air in the mid-17th Century:&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt;{{rp|32}} a bird is deprived of air before a diversified audience and the different reactions of the spectators prove that scientific curiosity overcomes the concern for the living creature.

==Robert Boyle portrait==
[[File:Robert Boyle portrait shifted.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Boyle portrait – Burlington House]]

Another painting in the Council Room is the half-length portrait of Robert Boyle (oil on canvas 92&amp;nbsp;cm × 78.5&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name=Gorringes /&gt; The ''[[Journal and Proceedings of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland]]'' said about the work:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Hon. Robert Boyle|journal=Journal and Proceedings of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland|date=1938|volume=62|issue=part I|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The portrait of the Honourable Robert Boyle, in the Library of the Institute, is attributed to [[Jonathan Richardson]], who left many portraits unsigned; this has been pronounced by several authorities as undoubtedly his work. The portrait bears the dates of Boyle’s birth and death (1626–1691) and was probably a posthumous portrait. Richardson was born in 1665; however, names and dates were often added to portraits long after they had been painted. The portrait resembles the engraving of a bust by Faber and bears a close likeness to Boyle’s sister, the Countess of Ranelagh, at whose house in London he lived and worked for many years. It has been objected that few of the nobility and gentlemen of the time of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I|James I]] were painted otherwise than in court dress. Portraits showing gentlemen in dressing gowns and velvet caps appeared more frequently about 1720, when Boyle had been dead nearly 30 years; but it may be suggested that Richardson preferred to represent him as a philosopher in his study. Towards the end of his life, Boyle lived very quietly in the country and did not frequent the court. The picture was purchased at a sale at [[Loudoun Castle]], Galston, Ayrshire, and acquired for the Institute, by private subscription, in 1931.}}

'''Mail art''' (also known as '''postal art''' and '''correspondence art''') is a populist artistic movement centered on sending small scale works through the [[mail|postal service]].  It initially developed out of what eventually became [[Ray Johnson]]'s New York Correspondence School in the 1950s and the [[Fluxus]] movement in the 1960s, though it has since developed into a global movement that continues to the present.

==Characteristics==

Media commonly used in mail art include postcards, paper, a collage of found or recycled images and objects, rubber stamps, artist-created stamps (called [[artistamps]]), and paint, but can also include music, sound art, poetry, or anything that can be put in an envelope and sent via post.  Mail art is considered art once it is dispatched.  Mail artists regularly call for thematic or topical mail art for use in (often [[unjuried]]) exhibition.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref name=UB&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://digital.lib.buffalo.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/LIB-PC001|work=Digital Collections, UB Libraries|publisher=University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mail artists appreciate interconnection with other artists.  The artform promotes an egalitarian way of creating that frequently circumvents official art distribution and approval systems such as the art market, museums, and galleries.  Mail artists rely on their alternative "outsider" network as the primary way of sharing their work, rather than being dependent on the ability to locate and secure exhibition space.&lt;ref name=Oberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art @ Oberlin|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|work=Oberlin College Art Library|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403130316/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|archivedate=3 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KostelanetzBrittain2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Kostelanetz|author2=H.

==History==

[[File:RayJohnson invite1970.jpg|right|thumb|Ray Johnson's invitation to the first mail art show, 1970]]
Artist Edward M. Plunkett has argued that communication-as-art-form is an ancient tradition; he posits (tongue in cheek) that mail art began when Cleopatra had herself delivered to Julius Caesar in a rolled-up carpet.&lt;ref name=Plunkett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Edward M.|title=The New York Correspondence School|journal=Art Journal|year=1977|issue=Spring|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Plunkett.html|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ray Johnson, the New York Correspondance School, and Fluxus===
The American artist [[Ray Johnson]] is considered to be the first mail artist.&lt;ref name=MOCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=22|work=Collection: MOCA's First Thirty Years|publisher=MOCA: The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillpot&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillpot|first=Clive|title=Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology|year=1995|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Canada|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Phillpot.html|editor=Chuck Welch|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson's experiments with art in the mail began in 1943, while the posting of instructions and soliciting of activity from his recipients began in the mid-1950s with the mailing of his "moticos", and thus provided mail art with a blueprint for the free exchange of art via post.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Vincitorio, "Informalista o videoartista? Le tendenze artistiche dagli anni '40 ad oggi", L'Espresso n.44, 7 November 1982{{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "mail art" was coined in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; In 1962, Plunkett coined the term "New York Correspondence School" to refer to Johnson's activities; Johnson adopted this moniker but sometimes intentionally misspelled it as "correspondance."&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; The deliberate misspelling was characteristic of the playful spirit of the Correspondance School and its actions.&lt;ref name=Danto&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danto|first=Arthur C.|journal=The Nation|date=March 29, 1999|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/correspondance-school-art#|title=Correspondance School Art|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Correspondance School members are fairly obscure, and the letters they sent, often featuring simple drawings or stickers, often instructed the recipient to perform some fairly simple action. Johnson's work consists primarily of letters, often with the addition of doodles and rubber stamped messages, which he mailed to friends and acquaintances. The Correspondance School was a network of individuals who were artists by virtue of their willingness to play along and appreciate Johnson's sense of humor.  One example of the activities of the Correspondance School consisted in calling meetings of fan clubs, such as one devoted to the actress [[Anna May Wong]].  Many of Johnson's missives to his network featured a hand drawn version of what became a personal logo or alter-ego, a bunny head.&lt;ref name=Danto /&gt;

In a 1968 interview, Johnson explained that he found mailed correspondence interesting because of the limits it puts on the usual back and forth interaction and negotiation that comprises communication between individuals.  Correspondence is  "a way to convey a message or a kind of idea to someone which is not verbal; it is not a confrontation of two people. It's an object which is opened in privacy, probably, and the message is looked at&amp;nbsp;... You look at the object and, depending on your degree of interest, it very directly gets across to you what is there&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=AAAOH&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral history interview with Ray Johnson, 1968 Apr. 17|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-ray-johnson-13236|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Johnson and Marcia Tucker organized The New York Correspondence School Exhibition at the [[Whitney Museum]] in New York, which was the first significant public exhibition of the mail art genre.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;

On April 5, 1973, Johnson declared the "death" of the New York Correspondance School in an unpublished letter to the Obituary Department of ''The New York Times'' and in copies that he circulated to his network.   However, he continued to practice mail art even after this.&lt;ref name=AAALippardLetter&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Johnson mail art to Lucy R. Lippard, 1965 June 29|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/ray-johnson-mail-art-to-lucy-r-lippard-13544|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RJEstate-bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Johnson Biography|url=http://www.rayjohnsonestate.com/biography/|publisher=Ray Johnson Estate|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much of Johnson's work was initially given away, this hasn't prevented it from attaining a market value. [[Andy Warhol]] is quoted as saying he would pay ten dollars for anything by Johnson."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Home, ''The Assault On Culture'', Aporia Press &amp; Unpopular Books, London 1988 {{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1973 diagram showing the development and scope of [[Fluxus]], [[George Maciunas]] included mail art among the activities pursued by the Fluxus artist [[Robert Filliou]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Jon (1988). ''Fluxus Codex'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, pp 329–333. {{ISBN|978-0-8109-0920-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filliou coined the term the "Eternal Network" that has become synonymous with mail art.&lt;ref name=Bloch&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=Mark|title=Amazing Letters: The Life and Art of David Zack|url=http://www.panmodern.com/zack-article.html|editor=Istvan Kantor|accessdate=11 April 2013|chapter=An Authentik and Historikal Discourse On the Phenomenon of David Zack, Mail Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Fluxus artists have been involved since the early 1960s in the creation of artist's postage stamps (Robert Watts, Stamp Dispenser, 1963), postcards (Ben Vautier, The Postman's Choice, 1965: a postcard with a different address on each side) and other works connected to the postal medium.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} "Indeed, the mail art network counts many Fluxus members among its earliest participants.  While Johnson did not consider himself directly as a member of the Fluxus school, his interests and attitudes were consistent with those of a number of Fluxus artists.&lt;ref name=Danto /&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAOH /&gt;

===1970s and 1980s===
In the 1970s, the practice of mail art grew considerably, providing a cheap and flexible channel of expression for cultural outsiders.  It was particularly widespread where state censorship prevented a free circulation of alternative ideas, as in certain countries behind the Iron Curtain or in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=East/West: Mail Art &amp; Censorship|journal=PostHype|year=1985|volume=4|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of a sizable mail art community, with friendships born out of personal correspondence and, increasingly, mutual visits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Ginny|title=The Mail Art Community in Europe|journal=Umbrella Magazine|year=1981|volume=5|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; led in the 1980s to the organization of several festivals, meetings and conventions where networkers could meet, socialize, perform, exhibit and plan further collaborations.  Among these events were the Inter Dada Festivals organized in California in the early 1980s&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Janice|title=A gleefully rebellious festival of dada|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__IZN7YDU3d4/S_aip9CJ4WI/AAAAAAAAAmU/gS467sN7lZQ/s1600/reibunedada.jpg|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=August 26, 1984|location=Art: The Tribune Calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decentralized Mail Art Congress of 1986.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans-Reudi Fricker|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|work=Mail Art @ Oberlin|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903031741/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|archivedate=3 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 curator Ronny Cohen organized an exhibition for the [[Franklin Furnace]], New York, called "Mail Art Then and Now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art From 1984 Franklin Furnace Exhibition|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/research/projects/flow/mailart/mailartf.html|publisher=Franklin Furnace|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was to have an historical aspect as well as showing new mail art, and to mediate the two aspects Cohen edited the material sent to Franklin Furnace, breaking an unwritten but commonly accepted custom that all works submitted must be shown. The intent to edit, interpreted as censorship, resulted in a two-part panel discussion sponsored by Artists Talk on Art (organized by mail artist Carlo Pittore and moderated by art critic [[Robert C. Morgan]]) in February of that year, where Cohen and the mail artists were to debate the issues.

The night preceding the second panel on February 24, [[Carlo Pittore]], John P. Jacob, Chuck Welch a.k.a. CrackerJack Kid, David Cole and John Held, Jr. crafted a statement asking Dr. Cohen to step down as the panel moderator. Welch delivered the statement whereby Dr. Cohen was asked to remain on the panel but forfeit her right to serve as moderator. Instead of remaining, Cohen chose to leave the event. After some give and take with both panelists and audience, Dr. Cohen left, saying, "Have fun boys." Her entourage walked out with her during the ensuing melee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International MailArt--Part II: The New Cultural Strategy|last=Heisler|first=Faith|year=1984|issue=4|volume=9|page=18|journal=Women Artists News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The excluded works were ultimately added to the exhibition by the staff of the Franklin Furnace, but the events surrounding it and the panels revealed ideological rifts within the mail art community. Simultaneously fanning the flames and documenting the extent to which it was already dominated by a small, mostly male, coterie of artists, the discussions were transcribed and published by panelist [[John P. Jacob]] in his short-lived mail art [[zine]] [[PostHype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=Mailart: A Partial Anatomy|journal=PostHype|year=1984|volume=3|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to panelist [[Mark Bloch]], [[Ray Johnson]] (who was not a panelist) commented on the reverse-censorship and sexism of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Bloch|title=Ray Johnson's letter to me after the event, questioning the issue of sexism.|url=http://www.panmodern.com/ray-atoa-letter.jpg|publisher=panmodern.com|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of mail art meetings and congresses during the late 80s, and the articulation of various "isms" proclaimed by their founders as movements within mail art, were in part a response to fractures made visible by the events surrounding the Franklin Furnace exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=The Coffee Table Book of Mail Art: The Intimate Letters of J.P. Jacob, 1981 - 1987|year=1987|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York|url=http://arcade.nyarc.org:80/record=b569546~S8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if "tourism" was proposed satirically as a new movement by H.R. Fricker, a Swiss mail artist who was one of the organizers of the 1986 Mail Art Congress, nevertheless mail art in its pure form would continue to function without the personal meeting between so-called networkers.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin /&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Fricker and Bloch, in a bilingual "Open Letter To Everybody in the Network" &lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Mark and Fricker, Hans Ruedi."Phantastische Gebete Revisited" in Panmag International Magazine 6, ISSN 0738-4777, February 1984. pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; stated, "1) An important function of he exhibitions and other group projects in the network is: to open channels to other human beings. 2) After your exhibition is shown and the documentation sent, or after you have received such a documentation with a list of addresses, ''use the channels''! 3) Create person-to-person correspondence... 4) You have your own unique energy which you can give to others through your work: visual audio, verbal, etc.  5) This energy is best used when it is exchanged for energy from another person with the same intentions. 6) the power of the network is in the quality of the direct correspondence, not the quantity." The manifesto concludes, "We have learned this from our own mistakes." &lt;ref&gt;Röder, Kornelia "H. R. Fricker, Mail Art and Social Networks," HR Fricker: Conquer the Living Rooms of the World, Kunstmuseum Thurgau, Warth, Switzerland: Edition Fink, 2014, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s and the impact of the Internet era===
[[File:Paulo bruscky and david horvitz.JPG|thumb|American mail-artist [[David Horvitz]] (active since the 2000s) meets Brazilian mail artist Paulo Bruscky (active since the 1970s) in Berlin, Germany in November 2015.]]

In 1994, Dutch mail artist [[Ruud Janssen]] began a series of [[mail-interviews]] which became an influential contribution in the field of mail art.&lt;ref&gt;
Ruud Janssen, ''Mail-Interviews'', Tilburg 1994–2001
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, mail art's peak in terms of global postal activities had been reached, and mail artists, aware of increasing postal rates, were beginning the gradual migration of collective art projects towards the web and new, cheaper forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Bleus]] (Ed.), ''Re: The E-Mail-Art &amp; Internet-Art Manifesto'', in: ''E-Pêle-Mêle: Electronic Mail-Art Netzine'', Vol.III, n° 1, T.A.C.-42.292, Hasselt, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet facilitated faster dissemination of mail art calls (invitations) and precipitated the involvement of a large number of newcomers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Mail art blogs and websites became ever more frequently used to display contributions and online documentation,{{original research inline|date=January 2013}} even if many{{who|date=January 2013}} mail artists still preferred the surprise of a catalogue found in their mailbox.{{original research inline|date=January 2013}}

==Philosophy and norms of the mail artist network==
In spite of the many links and similarities between historical avant-garde, alternative art practices ([[visual poetry]], [[Xerox art|copy art]], [[artist's book]]s) and mail art, one aspect that distinguishes the creative postal network from other artistic movements, schools or groups (including Fluxus) is the way it disregards and circumvents for the commercial art market.&lt;ref name=Spark&gt;{{cite web|title=About John Held Jr. in the Spark episode "The Fine Art of Collecting"|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/spark/profile.jsp?essid=4489|work=Spark|publisher=KQED|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any person with access to a mailbox can participate in the postal network and exchange free artworks, and each mail artist is free to decide how and when to answer (or not answer) a piece of incoming mail. Participants are invited by network members to take part in collective projects or unjuried exhibitions in which entries are not selected or judged.  While contributions may be solicited around a particular theme, work to a required size, or sent in by a deadline, mail art generally operates within a spirit of "anything goes."&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt;

The mail art philosophy of openness and inclusion is exemplified by the "rules" included in invitations (calls) to postal projects: a mail art show has no jury, no entry fee, there is no censorship, and all works are exhibited.&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt; The original contributions are not to be returned and remain the property of the organizers, but a catalogue or documentation is sent free to all the participants in exchange for their works. Although these rules are sometimes stretched, they have generally held up for four decades, with only minor dissimilarities and adjustments, like the occasional requests to avoid works of explicit sexual nature, calls for projects with specific participants, or the recent trend to display digital documentation on blogs and websites instead of personally sending printed paper to contributors.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:BananaPost'89 AnnaBanana.jpg|right|thumb|BananaPost '89 artistamps by Anna Banana, 1989]]
Mail art has been exhibited in alternative spaces such as private apartments, municipal buildings, and shop windows, as well as in galleries and museums worldwide.&lt;ref name=Oberlin /&gt;   Mail art shows, periodicals, and projects represent the "public" side of postal networking, a practice that has at its core the direct and private interaction between the individual participants. Mail artists value the process of exchanging ideas and the sense of belonging to a global community that is able to maintain a peaceful collaboration beyond differences of language, religion and ideology; this is one aspect that differentiates the mail art network from the world of commercial picture postcards and of simply "mailed art."&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology"&gt;Welch, C. (1995). ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/231651233 Eternal network: A mail art anthology]''. Calgary, Alta: Univ. of Calgary Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mail artist may have hundreds of correspondents from many different countries, or build a smaller core circle of favorite contacts. Mail art is widely practiced in Europe, North and South America, Russia, Australia and Japan, with smaller numbers of participants also in Africa, and China.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  In addition to being kept by the recipient, mail art archives have attracted the interest of libraries, archives, museums, and private collectors.&lt;ref name=Spark /&gt;  Or, the works may be 'worked into' and recycled back to the sender or to another networker.

Ray Johnson suggested (with a pun) that "mail art has no history, only a present", and mail artists have followed his playful attitude in creating their own mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43915838|title=Ray Johnson : correspondences|last=M.|first=De Salvo, Donna|last2=Catherine.|first2=Gudis,|date=1999|publisher=Wexner Center for the Arts|year=|isbn=2080136631|location=|pages=81|oclc=43915838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parody art movements like [[neoism]] and plagiarism have challenged notions of originality, as have the shared pseudonymous names [[Monty Cantsin]] and [[Karen Eliot]], which were proposed for serial use by anyone.&lt;ref name="Carr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

Various essays, graduate theses, guides and anthologies of mail art writings have appeared in print and on the Internet, often written by veteran networkers.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;
A sub-group of envelope art has its genesis in the Grateful Dead Ticket Service. Looking to help their fans avoid  the high fees that are generated by national ticket services the Grateful Dead started their own service, commonly referred to as mail order. At some point fans started decorating their envelopes with art. Some for art's sake, others to grab the attention of the people that dole out tickets in hope of better seats.http://www.gdtstoo.com/

==Media and artistic practices in the creation of mail artworks==
{{see also|Postage stamp}}
Because the democratic ethos of mail art is one of inclusion, both in terms of participants ('anyone who can afford the postage') and in the scope of art forms, a broad range of media are employed in creation of mail artworks. Certain materials and techniques are commonly used and frequently favored by mail artists due to their availability, convenience, and ability to produce copies.

===Rubberstamps and artistamps===
[[File:Rubberstamps Klafki Pawson(1980s).jpg|right|thumb|Mail art rubber stamps by Jo Klafki (left) and Mark Pawson (right), 1980s]]
Mail art has adopted and appropriated several of graphic forms already associated with the postal system. The rubber stamp officially used for franking mail, already utilized by [[Dada]] and Fluxus artists, has been embraced by mail artists who, in addition to reusing ready-made rubber stamps, have them professionally made to their own designs. They also carve into erasers with linocut tools to create handmade ones. These unofficial rubber stamps, whether disseminating mail artists' messages or simply announcing the identity of the sender, help to transform regular postcards into artworks and make envelopes an important part of the mail art experience.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;

[[File:CarvedEraser ArtNahpro(c.1990).jpg|right|thumb|Carved eraser print by Paul Jackson, aka Art Nahpro, c. 1990]]
Mail art has also appropriated the postage stamp as a format for individual expression. Inspired by the example of Cinderella stamps and Fluxus faux-stamps, the [[artistamp]] has spawned a vibrant sub-network of artists dedicated to creating and exchanging their own stamps and stamp sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171811/http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |archivedate=2015-05-26 |df= }} Belgian Postal Service, Guy Bleus &amp; Jean Spiroux, ''Journée du Timbre: Mail-Art'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Jerry Dreva]] of the conceptual art group Les Petits Bonbons created a set of stamps and sent them to David Bowie who then used them as the inspiration for the cover of the single "Ashes to Ashes" released in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Roger|title=Scary Monsters|url=http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/scarymonsters.html|website=Bowie Golden Years}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistamps and rubber stamps, have become important staples of mail artworks, particularly in the enhancement of postcards and envelopes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Frank, Peter, E.F. Higgins III, Rudolf Ungváry. "[http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/PFranke.html Postal Modernism: Artists' Stamps and Stamp Images]." ''World Art Post'', Artpool Archive, Museum of Fine Arts Budapest, April 1982 (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–4)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important anthology of rubberstamp art was published by the artist Hervé Fischer in his book ''Art and Marginal Communication'', Balland, Paris, 1974 - in French, English and German, to note also the catalog of the exhibition "Timbres d'artistes", Published of Musée de la Poste, Paris, 1993, organized by the french artist Jean-Noël Laszlo - in French, English.

===Envelopes===
Some mail artists lavish more attention on the envelopes than the contents within. Painted envelopes are one-of-a-kind artworks with the handwritten address becoming part of the work. Stitching, embossing and an array of drawing materials can all be found on postcards, envelopes and on the contents inside.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

===Printing and copying===
Printing is suited to mail artists who distribute their work widely. Various printmaking techniques, in addition to rubber stamping, are used to create multiples. Copy art (xerography, photocopy) is a common practice, with both mono and color copying being extensively used within the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Ubiquitous 'add &amp; pass' sheets that are designed to be circulated through the network with each artist adding and copying, chain-letter fashion, have also received some unfavorable criticism.{{according to whom|date=January 2013}} However, Xerography has been a key technology in the creation of many short-run periodicals and [[zines]] about mail art, and for the printed documentation that has been the traditional project culmination sent to participants. Inkjet and laserprint computer printouts are also used, both to disseminate artwork and for reproducing zines and documentation, and PDF copies of paperless periodicals and unprinted documentation are circulated by email. Photography is widely used as an art form, to provide images for artistamps and rubber stamps, and within printed and digital magazines and documentation,&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt; while some projects have focused on the intersection of mail art with the medium itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=[[The International Portfolio of Artists Photography]]|year=1984|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lettering and language===
Lettering, whether handwritten or printed, is integral to mail art. The written word is used as a literary art form, as well as for personal letters and notes sent with artwork and recordings of the spoken word, both of poetry and prose, are also a part of the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt; Although English has been the de facto language, because of the movement's inception in America, an increasing number of mail artists, and mail artist groups on the Internet, now communicate in Breton, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Russian.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Other media===
In addition to appropriating the postage stamp model, mail artists have assimilated other design formats for printed artworks. Artists' books, decobooks and [[friendship book]]s, banknotes, stickers, tickets, artist trading cards (ATCs), badges, food packaging, diagrams and maps have all been used.

[[File:Kairan MAZine(2007).jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''Kairan'' mail art zine, edited by Gianni Simone, aka Johnnyboy, 2007]]
Mail artists routinely mix media; [[collage]] and [[photomontage]] are popular, affording some mail art the stylistic qualities of [[pop art]] or Dada. Mail artists often use collage techniques to produce original postcards, envelopes and work that may be transformed using copy art techniques or computer software, then photocopied or printed out in limited editions.

[[Printed matter]] and [[ephemera]] are often circulated among mail artists, and after artistic treatment, these common items enter into the mail art network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Small assemblages, sculptural forms or found objects of irregular shapes and sizes are parceled up or sent unwrapped to deliberately tease and test the efficiency of the postal service. Mailable fake fur ("Hairmail") and [[Astroturf]] postcards were circulated in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news |

Having borrowed the notion of [[intermedia]] from Fluxus, mail artists are often active simultaneously in several different fields of expression. Music and [[sound art]] have long been celebrated aspects of mail art, at first using cassette tape, then on CD and as sound files sent via the Internet.&lt;ref name="CoxWarner2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Cox|author2=Daniel Warner|title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgDgCOSHPysC&amp;pg=PA60|date=1 September 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-1615-5|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Performance art]] has also been a prominent facet, particularly since the advent of mail art meetings and congresses. Performances recorded on film or video are communicated via DVD and movie files over the internet. Video is also increasingly being employed to document mail art shows of all kinds.&lt;ref name=mailartforum&gt;{{cite web|title=The Techniques|url=http://www.mail-art.de/frame.php?dir=about:about_techniques&amp;doc=start.htm|work=Mail-Art:The Forum|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Correspondence art is an elusive art form, far more variegated by its very nature than, say, painting. Where a painting always involves paint and a support surface, correspondence art can appear as any one of dozens of media transmitted through the mail. While the vast majority of correspondence art or mail art activities take place in the mail, today's new forms of electronic communication blur the edges of that forum. In the 1960s, when correspondence art first began to blossom, most artists found the postal service to be the most readily available - and least expensive - medium of exchange. Today's micro-computers with modern facilities offer anyone computing and communicating power that two decades ago were available only to the largest institutions and corporations, and only a few decades previous weren't available to anyone at any price." - [[Ken Friedman]]&lt;ref name=FriedmanFlue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Ken|title=Mail art history: the Fluxus factor|journal=FLUE - Special Issue: Mail Art|year=1984|volume=4|issue=3–4|editor1-first=Martha|editor1-last=Wilson|publisher=Franklin Furnace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Cultural exchange is a radical act. It can create paradigms for the reverential sharing and preservation of the earth's water, soil, forests, plants and animals. The ethereal networker aesthetic calls for guiding that dream through action. Cooperation and participation, and the celebration of art as a birthing of life, vision, and spirit are first steps. The artists who meet each other in the Eternal Network have taken these steps. Their shared enterprise is a contribution to our common future." - [[Chuck Welch]]&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The purpose of mail art, an activity shared by many artists throughout the world, is to establish an aesthetical communication between artists and common people in every corner of the globe, to divulge their work outside the structures of the art market and outside the traditional venues and institutions: a free communication in which words and signs, texts and colours act like instruments for a direct and immediate interaction." - Loredana Parmesani&lt;ref&gt;Loredana Parmesani, text under the entry "Poesia visiva", in ''L'arte del secolo - Movimenti, teorie, scuole e tendenze 1900–2000'', Giò Marconi - Skira, Milan 1997 {{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Meditative poetry''' combines the religious practice of [[meditation]] with [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. It occurs in many cultures, especially in Asian, European and Hindu cultures. Especially [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] writers have developed extensive theories and phase models for meditation (Bevis 1988;73-88).

In [[Christianity]], meditation became a major [[Catholic devotions|devotional]] practice during the [[Middle Ages]], closely associated with the life in [[monasteries]]. Definitions vary, but there were various attempts to distinguish meditation from [[contemplation]]. While meditation focuses the mind on a text, preferably from the [[Bible]], contemplation will take a concrete object, such as a candle, to concentrate the thoughts of the mind. Both, contemplation and meditation had the same end, to seek unity with God.

During the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Jesuits like [[Ignatius of Loyola]] formalized the process of meditation, as a channeling of memory, understanding and will. His method of meditation fell into three main parts: A) prayer and composition of place; B) the examination of points ([[analysis]]); the colloquies (the dialogue with God as a climax) (Martz 1962, 27-32). [[Jesuits]] brought this practice to England (Daly 1978: 72). [[Calvinist]] and other Protestants adapted meditation to Bible studies.

[[Puritan]] meditation emphasized self-examination, applying Bible verses to contemporary, everyday life. In 1628, [[Thomas Taylor (priest, 1576–1633)|Thomas Taylor]] wrote a Puritan handbook ''Meditation from the Creatures'', recommending to include images from the sensible world (metaphorical of God's glory). In colonial [[New England]], [[Thomas Hooker]] defined meditation in ''The Souls Preparation for Christ'' (1632) as follows: "It is a settled exercise for two ends: first to make a further inquiry of the truth: and secondly, to make the heart affected therewith."

In 1648, the ''Shorter Catechism of the Westminster Assembly'' made meditation a duty for Puritans, and in 1649/50 [[Richard Baxter]]'s ''The Saints' Everlasting Rest'' became the standard Puritan text, at its core prescribing meditation. Like Taylor and Hooker, Baxter admitted the use of the senses, that is, he included contemplation with meditation, based on figural correspondences with the Bible. By including contemplation with meditation, the Puritans laid the foundation for a rich tradition of verse meditation in the USA from its colonial beginnings to the twenty-first century (Daly 1978, 74-76, 79-81; Martz 1962).

Soon Puritan ministers like [[Edward Taylor]] began to write meditations in verse, based on lines from the Bible and on sense perceptions, both [[allegorical]] of the greater glory of God. [[Anne Bradstreet]] provided the first published meditations purely based on the senses, celebrating nature's beauties as the creation of God. Using the [[analogy]] of Nature as God's second book, poetic meditations gradually secularized, replacing the early allegoric technique with a more [[symbol]]ic reading of nature and affirming the self-reliant individual (Pearce 1961, 42-57). 

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay ''Nature'' (1836) freed the meditation from its theological underpinnings and its reliance on the Bible. He encouraged poets to view nature as a storehouse of symbols that they could use simply relying on their [[imagination]]. [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Emily Dickinson]] took meditation into this direction and paved the way for Modernist and Postmodernist practices in poetry (Lawson 1994).

The method of the three main steps (composition of place, examination of points, colloquies) had survived into the twentieth century in many poems, as had the devotional practice of verse meditation. Leading modernist poets like [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wallace Stevens]] began to fragmentarize the process, blending thoughts and sense perceptions in a sort of spiritual diary (Parini 1993,12). Postmodernist poets like [[John Ashbery]] deconstruct the contemplative aspect, the [[reference]] of the poem to an object outside itself, dissolving [[narrative]] or [[Episode|episodic]] structures of the spiritual diary in an ironic and open association (Bevis 1988:280-90), and thereby turning the poem itself into the object the reader can use for contemplation or meditation. 

Meditative poetry has often been correlated to [[Relaxation Through Poetry]], which is simply using poetry to relax or relieve stress whenever someone is in need. It can also be seen in group visualization sessions where a speaker tries to get the audience to forget all about their stress by the use of calm and relaxing poetry.

'''Mexican muralism''' was the promotion of [[mural]] painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post [[Mexican Revolution]] government. It was headed by “the big three” painters, [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in [[Mexico]] and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the [[United States]] where it served as inspiration for the [[Chicano art movement]].

==Antecedents==
[[File:Bonampak mural. Room 1. Musicians and dancers.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Mural from [[Bonampak]].]]

[[Mexico]] has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the [[Olmec]] civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine.&lt;ref name="chicano"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=The Chicano Mural movement of the Southwest: Populist public art and Chicano political activism |author= John Eugene Kenny |year=2006 |publisher= University of New Orleans |oclc=3253092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was [[Juan Cordero]] in the mid 19th century. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the [[Santa Teresa la Antigua|Santa Teresa Church]] and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of [[Gabino Barreda]] at the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]] (since disappeared).&lt;ref name="plasmo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Plasmó Juan Cordero primer mural en México con temas filosóficos |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=May 27, 2008&lt;!--|918-917-9042--&gt;  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Juan Cordero plastered the first mural with philosophical themes in Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:José Guadalupe Posada, Calavera oaxaqueña, broadsheet, 1903.jpg|thumb|1903 broadsheet by [[José Guadalupe Posada]].]]

The latter 19th century was dominated politically by the [[Porfirio Díaz]] regime. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and sending promising artists abroad to study. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with the aim of making [[Mexico]] like [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; [[Dr. Atl|Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl]], is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralists with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sbcounty.gov/museum/media/press-kit/contretas/contreras-media-kit-mural-tradition.pdf |title= The art of Ramón Contreras and the Mexican Muralists movement |publisher= San Bernardino County Museum  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art.  Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism.&lt;ref name="inehrm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |title=El muralismo y la Revolución Mexicana |author=) Luz Elena Mainero del Castillo |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Históricos de las Revoluciones de México |location=Mexico |year=2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Muralism asn the Mexican Revolution |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514210135/http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253341 |title= Populist art and the Mexican mural renaissance |work= Hispanic Heritage in the Americas -Latin American art |publisher= Britannica  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using “Atlcolor” a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the [[Mexican Revolution]] .&lt;ref name="dratl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title=Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art  |last1=Burton |first1=Tony |date=March 14, 2008 |issn=1028-9089 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

The [[Mexican Revolution]] itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to [[Porfirio Díaz]] policies. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included [[Antonio Curo]], [[Alfonso Reyes]] and [[José Vasconcelos]]. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1064-mexican-muralists-the-big-three-orozco-rivera-siqueiros |title= Mexican muralists: the big three - Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros.  |first=Rita |last=Pomade |date= May 5, 2007  |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas gained power as a result of the [[Mexican Revolution]], which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassinations, including that of [[Francisco I. Madero]] who initiated the struggle. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the [[Álvaro Obregón]] faction, which became the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] (PRI).&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico’s next generation of artists and muralists.&lt;ref name="dratl"/&gt;

In 1921, after the end of the military phase of the Revolution, José Vasconcelos was appointed to head the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]]. At the time, most of the Mexican population was illiterate and the government needed a way to promote the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. It was Vasconcelos’s idea have a government-backed mural program for this purpose.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Similar to mural use in the pre Hispanic period and during the colonial period, the purpose of these murals were not simply aesthetic, but social, to promote certain ideals.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; These ideals or principles were to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the identity of [[Mexico]] as a mestizo nation, with the indigenous promoted as well as the Spanish.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;  The government began to hire the country’s best artists to paint murals, calling some of them home from Europe including [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; These initial muralists included Dr. Atl, [[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], [[Federico Cantú]] and others but the main three would be [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. His time as secretary was short but it set how muralism would develop. His image was painted on a tempera mural in 1921 by [[Roberto Montenegro]], but this was short lived. His successor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública ordered it painted out.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The muralists differed in style and temperament, but all believed that art was for the education and betterment of the people. This was behind their acceptance of these commissions as well as their creation of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; 
[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|Mural in the Palacio de Bellas Artes by [[Rufino Tamayo]].]]

The first government sponsored mural project was on the three levels of interior walls of the old Jesuit institution [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]], at that time used for the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]].&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; However, most of the murals in the Escuela National Preparatoria were done by José Clemente Orozco with themes of a mestizo Mexico, the ideas of renovation and the tragedies of the Revolution;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]] painted ["dancers of Chalma"] "Los danzantes de Chalma", no earlier than 1922. Opposite that mural, [[Jean Charlot]] painted ''La conquista de Tenochtitlán'' (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot—invited by Leal.&lt;ref name="folgarait"&gt; {{cite book |title= Mural painting and Social Revolution in Mexico 1920-1940  |last= Folgariat |first= Leonard |year=1998 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn=0-521-58147-8 |pages=42-46 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

===After the mural project at the National Preparatory High School===
This project at the institution was followed by projects at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]], the interior walls of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], the [[Chapingo Autonomous University|Escuela Nacional de Chapingo]] the Escuela Nacional de Medicina and the [[Secretariat of Public Education Main Headquarters|Secretaria de Educación Pública building]] among many others.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;
[[File:DeembarcoCanalSICDF.JPG|thumb|[[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], Mural at [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]]]]
The movement was strongest from the 1920s to the 1950s, which corresponded to the country’s transformation from a mostly rural and mostly illiterate society to an industrialized one. While today they are part of Mexico’s identity, at the time they were controversial, especially those with socialist messages plastered on centuries-old colonial buildings.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; One of the basic underpinnings of the nascence of a post revolutionary Mexican art was that it should be public, available to the citizenry and above all not the province of a few wealthy collectors.  The great societal upheaval made the concept possible as well as a lack of relatively wealthy middle class to support the arts.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; On this, the painters and the government agreed. One other point of agreement was that artists should have complete freedom of expression. This would lead to another element added to the murals over their development. In addition to the original ideas of a reconstructed Mexico and the elevation of Mexico’s indigenous and rural identity, many of the muralists, including the three main painters, also included elements of [[Marxism]], especially the struggle of the working class against oppression.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The inception and early years of Mexico's muralist movement are often considered the most ideologically pure and untainted by contradictions between socialist ideals and government manipulation. This initial phase is referred to as the "heroic" phase while the period after 1930 is the "statist" phase with the transition to the latter phase caused by José Vasconcelos's resignation in 1924.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=Mary|title=Muralism and The People: Culture, Popular Citizenship, and Government in Post-Revolutionary Mexico|journal=The Communication Review|year=2002|volume=5|pages=7–38|doi=10.1080/10714420212350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Mary Coffey describes those who "acknowledge a change but refrain from judgment about its consequences" as taking the soft line and those who see all murals after 1930 as "propaganda for a corrupt state" as taking a hard line.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;  Another stance is that the evolution of Mexican muralism as having an uncomplicated relationship with the government and as an accurate reflection of avant-garde and proletariat sentiments. However, hard liners see the movement as complicit in the corrupt government's power consolidation under the guise of a socialist regime.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;

Art historian Leonard Folgarait has a slightly different view. He marks 1940 as the end of the post-revolutionary period in Mexico as well as the renaissance era of the muralist movement.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Folgarait|title=Mural Painting and Social Revolution in Mexico, 1920-1940: Art of the New Order|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the Lázaro Cárdenas administration (1934 – 1940) and the beginning of the Manuel Avila Camacho (1940 – 1946) administration saw the rise of an ultraconservative Mexico.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt;  The country’s policy was aimed at maintaining and strengthening a capitalist society.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt; Mural artists like the Big Three spent the post-revolutionary period developing their work based on the promises of a better future, and with the advent of conservatism they lost their subject and their voice.

The Mexican government began to distance itself from mural projects and mural production became relatively privatized. This privatization was a result of patronage from the growing national bourgeoisie. Murals were increasingly contracted for theaters, banks, and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of “Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (y Escultura) (Mexican School of Painting and Sculpture), coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or separate.&lt;ref name="anos30"&gt;{{cite news |title= Testigo de los anos 30 |author=James Oles |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=January 12, 2000 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Witness to the 1930s }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minima"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/artmex/tema3.html |title=Escuela Mexicana de Pintura y Escultura |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican School of Painting and Sculpting |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthetics “positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere.” &lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as:
1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public “event”)&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural image&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
Most painters in this school worked in [[Mexico City]] or other cities in [[Mexico]], working almost uninterrupted on projects and/or as teachers, generally with support of the government. Most were concerned with the history and identity of [[Mexico]] and politically active. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe and/or in the Academy of San Carlos.&lt;ref name="minima"/&gt;  
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 5 057.jpg|thumb|180px|Mural by [[Alfredo Zalce]] at the state government palace in [[Morelia]].]]
A large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the [[Mexican Revolution]], mestizo identity and [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural history.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades. The goal was more to glorify it and its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The other political orientation was that of [[Marxism]], especially class struggle. This was strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all avowed communists.  The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Much of the mural production glorified the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture, considering it an important factor in the creation of modern Mexico. This was added with the idea of reexamining the country’s history from a different perspective. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The murals took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The mural painters of [[Mexico]] freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group. However, the work of each was distinctive as the government did not set style and artists can generally be deduced without looking at signatures.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the [[fresco]], painting on freshly plastered walls and [[encaustic painting|encaustic or hot wax painting]] .&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros who worked with [[pyroxlene]], a commercial enamel and [[Duco]] (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos, old machinery and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

==Los Tres Grandes==
[[File:RiveraMuralNationalPalace.jpg|thumb|Mural in the main stairwell of the National Palace by Diego Rivera]]
By far, the three most influential muralists from the 20th century are [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]], called “los tres grandes” (the three great ones).&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; All believed that art was the highest form of human expression and a key force in social revolution.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; Their work defined the movement taking over from Vasconcelos. It created a mythology around the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the Mexican people which is still influential to this day, as well as promote [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideals. At the time the works were painted, they also served as a form of catharsis over what the country had endured during the war.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; However, the three were different in their artistic expression. Rivera’s works were utopian and idealist, Orozco’s were critical and pessimistic and the most radical were those of Siqueiros, heavily focused on a scientific future.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; The differences among the three have much to do with how each experienced the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Rivera was in Europe the entire time and did not fight. He never depicted the horrors of the war but what he perceived to be the social benefits from it. The other two did and both did express the horrors of war in their work.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; There was resentment to Rivera by the other two because of it, especially from Siqueiros.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;
[[File:La abolición de la esclavitud de Orozco.JPG|thumb|left|[[Miguel Hidalgo]] abolishing slavery by José Clemente Orozco]]
Of the three, Rivera was the most traditional in terms of painting styles, drawing heavily from European modernism. In his narrative mural images, Rivera incorporated elements of cubism&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"/&gt; His themes were Mexican, often scenes of everyday life and images of ancient Mexico. He originally painted this in bright colors in the European style but modified it to more earthy tones to imitate indigenous murals. His greatest contribution is the promotion of Mexico’s indigenous past into how many people both inside and outside of the country view it.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

Orozco also began with a European style of expression. However his art developed into an angry denunciation of oppression especially by those he considered to be an evil and brutal rules class.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; His work was somber and dire, with emphasis on human suffering and fear of the technology of the future.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; His work shows an "expressionist use of color, slashing lines, and parodic distortions of the human figure." &lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other muralists, Orozco condemned the Spanish as destroyers of indigenous culture, but he did have kinder depictions such as that of a Franciscan friar tending to an emaciated indigenous period.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Unlike other artists, Orozco never glorified the [[Mexican Revolution]], having fought in it, but rather depicted the horrors of this war. It caused many of his murals to be heavily criticized and even defaced.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;
[[File:PolyforumSiqueiros05.jpg|thumb|View of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros in Mexico City]]
Siqueiros was the youngest and most radical of the three. He joined the [[Venustiano Carranza]] army when he was eighteen and experienced the Revolution from the front lines.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Although all three muralists were communists, Siqueiros was the most dedicated, as evidenced by his portrayals of the proletarian masses. His work is also characterized with rapid, sweeping, bold lines and the use of modern enamels, machinery and other elements related to technology. His style showed a "futurist blurring of form and technique." His fascination with technology as it relates to art was exemplified when he emphasized the mass communications visual technology of photograph and motion picture in his eventual movement toward neorealism.&lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"/&gt; His radical politics made him unwelcome in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], so he did much of his work in [[South America]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, his masterpiece is considered to be the [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], located in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;

The Big Three struggled to express their leftist leanings after the initial years painting murals under government supervision. These struggles with the post-revolution government lead the muralists to create a union of artists and produce a radical manifesto. [[José Vasconcelos]], the Secretary of Public Education under President [[Álvaro Obregón]] (1920–24) contracted Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco to pursue painting with the moral and financial support of the new post-revolutionary government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=William|title=The Dilemmas of a Communist Artist: Diego Rivera in Moscow, 1927-1928|journal=Mexican Studies|year=1987|volume=3|issue=1|pages=49–69|jstor=4617031|doi=10.2307/4617031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasconcelos, while seeking to promote nationalism and “raza cosmica,” seemed to contradict this sentiment as he guided the muralists to create works in a classic, European style. The murals became a target of Vasconcelos’s criticism when the Big Three departed from classical proportion and figure. Siqueiros was dissatisfied with the incongruity between the murals and the revolutionary concerns of the muralists, and he advocated discussion among the artists of their future works.

In 1922 the muralists founded the Union of Revolutionary Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors of Mexico. The Union then released a manifesto listing education, art of public utility, and beauty for all as the social goals of their future artistic endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same “mestizo” message. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crosscultural"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubbard |first=Kathy |date=September 2010 |title= A CROSS-CULTURAL COLLABORATION: Using Visual Culture for the Creation of a Socially Relevant Mural in Mexico |journal=Art Education |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=68–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipal market]] of [[Teotitlán del Valle]], a small town in the state of [[Oaxaca]]. High school and college students from [[State of Georgia|Georgia]], [[United States]], collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of [[Zapotec language]] and customs.&lt;ref name="crosscultural"/&gt;

Mexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after [[World War I]] with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas. Notable muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include [[Carlos Mérida]] of [[Guatemala]], [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] of [[Ecuador]] and [[Candido Portinari]] of [[Brazil]] .&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 1 051.jpg|thumb|View of the mural in the Palacio de Gobierno]]
Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]], staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;  Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Siqueiros did not fare as well. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to [[Los Angeles]]. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The only one of the three to survive, [[América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos|''América Tropical'']] (full name: ''América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos'', or ''Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism''&lt;ref&gt;Del Barco, Mandalit.

Retrieved June 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of mural as political message was transplanted to the United States, especially in the former Mexican territory of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. It served as inspiration to the later [[Chicano]] muralism but the political messages are different.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Revolutionary Nicaragua developed a tradition of muralism during the [[Sandinista]] period.&lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, ''The Murals of Revolutionary Nicaragua, 1979-1992''.

'''Mimesis''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|m|ə|-|,_|m|aɪ|-|,_|-|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|μίμησις}} ''mīmēsis'', from μιμεῖσθαι ''mīmeisthai'', "to imitate", from [[Wikt:μῖμος|μῖμος]] ''mimos'', "imitator, actor") is a [[Literary criticism|critical]] and philosophical term that carries a wide range of meanings, which include [[imitation]], [[representation (arts)|representation]], [[mimicry]], ''imitatio'', receptivity, nonsensuous similarity, the act of resembling, the act of expression, and the [[impression management|presentation of the self]].&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer and Wulf (1992, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]], mimesis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, [[truth]], and the good. [[Plato]] contrasted mimesis, or [[imitation]], with [[diegesis]], or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of mimesis eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society, and its use has changed and been reinterpreted many times since.

One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis, understood as a form of [[realism (literature)|realism]] in literature, is [[Erich Auerbach]]'s ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the ''Bible''. From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study. In [[art history]], "mimesis", "realism" and "naturalism" are used, often interchangeably, as terms for the accurate, even "illusionistic", [[Realism (arts)#Illusionistic realism|representation of the visual appearance of things]].

Mimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Philip Sidney]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Gabriel Tarde]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Erich Auerbach]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[René Girard]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Merlin Donald]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
&lt;!--Irrelevant paragraph: During the nineteenth century, the racial politics of imitation towards African Americans influenced the term mimesis and its evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Kirt|title=The Racial Politics of Imitation in the Nineteenth Century|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=2003|doi=10.1080/00335630308178}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Classical definitions==

===Plato===
Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw in mimesis the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[nature]], including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (Books&amp;nbsp;II, III, and X). In ''Ion'', he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing "art" or "knowledge" – ''[[techne]]'' – of the subject (532c), the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato's [[Theory of forms|account of the Forms]]). As Plato has it, truth is only the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth (540c). He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth (535b).

In Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''The Republic'', Plato describes [[Socrates]]' dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing this in Book&amp;nbsp;X, Plato told of Socrates' metaphor of the three beds: one bed exists as an idea made by God (the [[Platonic ideal|Platonic ideal, or form]]); one is made by the [[carpenter]], in imitation of God's idea; one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 596–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

So the artist's bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter's (the craftsman's) art,&lt;ref name=Republic&gt;{{cite book | last = Plato | title = Book X | work = The Republic | url =  http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, nonetheless the imitators will still not attain the truth (of God's creation).&lt;ref name=Republic /&gt;

The poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.

===Aristotle===
Similar to Plato's writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection, and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of [[four causes]] in nature. The first, the [[formal cause]], is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]''.

Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. ''Poetics'' is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling an urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.

Aristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to [[catharsis]]. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through "simulated representation", mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may [[empathy|empathise]] with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment in order to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.

In short, catharsis can only be achieved if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.

Aristotle thought of drama as being "an imitation of an action" and of [[tragedy]] as "falling from a higher to a lower [[Estates of the realm|estate]]" and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more ''tragic'' circumstances than before. He posited the [[fictional character|characters]] in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.

Michael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:
{{cquote|At first glance, mimesis seems to be a stylizing of reality in which the ordinary features of our world are brought into focus by a certain exaggeration, the relationship of the imitation to the object it imitates being something like the relationship of dancing to walking. Imitation always involves selecting something from the continuum of experience, thus giving boundaries to what really has no beginning or end. ''Mimêsis'' involves a framing of reality that announces that what is contained within the frame is not simply real. Thus the more "real" the imitation the more fraudulent it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1993, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Contrast to diegesis====
It was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted mimesis with [[diegesis]] (Greek διήγησις). Mimesis ''shows'', rather than ''tells'', by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the ''telling'' of the [[narrative|story]] by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters' minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the "invisible narrator" or even the "all-knowing narrator" who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book&amp;nbsp;III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;373 BCE), [[Plato]] examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration." (Plato, Republic, Book&amp;nbsp;III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary 'elsewhere' set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as 'hypothetically actual' constructs, since they are 'seen' in progress 'here and now' without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''mimesis'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or ''manner'' (section&amp;nbsp;I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section&amp;nbsp;III).

Though they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato's and Aristotle's formulations.

In [[ludology]], mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay "Crimes Against Mimesis".&lt;ref name=crimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |title=Crimes Against Mimesis |accessdate=2006-12-17 |last=Giner-Sorolla |first=Roger |date=April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081931/http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |archivedate=19 June 2005}} This is a reformatted version of a set of articles originally posted to Usenet:

===Dionysian ''imitatio''===
{{main article|Dionysian imitatio}}
'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the 1st century BCE, which conceived it as technique of [[rhetoric]]: emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''mimesis'' formulated by [[Aristotle]]'s in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==Samuel Taylor Coleridge==
Mimesis, or imitation, as he referred to it, was a crucial concept for [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s theory of the [[imagination]]. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and [[Philip Sidney]], adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His middling{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:
{{quote|[T]he composition of a poem is among the imitative arts; and that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the SAME throughout the radically DIFFERENT, or the different throughout a base radically the same.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, S.T. (1983) ''Biographia Literaria.'' v.1 eds. James Engell and W. Jackson Bate. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|0-691-09874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to [[William Wordsworth]]'s notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.

==Luce Irigaray==
The Belgian feminist [[Luce Irigaray]] used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves so as to show up these stereotypes and undermine them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/irigaray.htm#SH4a].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Taussig==
{{Further|Cultural appropriation|Appropriation (sociology)}}
In ''Mimesis and Alterity'' (1993), the [[anthropologist]] [[Michael Taussig]] examines the way that people from one culture adopt another's nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of [[alterity]]). He describes how a legendary tribe, the "white Indians", or [[Kuna (people)|Cuna]], have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).

Taussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Cuna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this [[reductionism]] is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his ''Mimesis and Alterity'' to see values in the [[anthropologist]]s' perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, 1993:47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==René Girard==
In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|René Girard]] posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world," but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Girard|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1987|pages=7, 26, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christopher Walken - 1984.jpg|thumb|Actor [[Christopher Walken]] performing a monologue in the 1984 stage play ''[[Hurlyburly]]'']]
In [[theatre]], a '''monologue''' (from {{lang-el|μονόλογος}}, from μόνος ''mónos'', "alone, solitary" and λόγος ''lógos'', "speech") is a speech presented by a single [[character (arts)|character]], most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the [[audience]]. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media ([[Play (theatre)|play]]s, [[film]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|title=The Greatest Movie Speeches/Monologues of all time!|author=|date=|website=IMDb|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401000758/http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|archivedate=1 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |title=Dramatic Monologue: An Introduction |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807215608/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |archivedate=7 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophes]], and [[asides|asides]]. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.

==Similar literary devices==
Monologues are similar to [[Poetry|poems]], epiphanies, and others, in that, they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |title=Soliloquy – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706041614/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |archivedate=6 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |title=The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare |publisher=Pleasanton.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902062728/http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |archivedate=2 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a [[dialogue]] interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==History==
In ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuritz|first=Paul|title=The Making of Theatre History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cS6JV4Z27DoC|accessdate=27 May 2014|year=1988|isbn=978-0-13-547861-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.

Ancient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=1 |date=January 1939 |pages=1–23|jstor=264065}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue.&lt;ref name="jstor1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=April 1939 |pages=116–126|jstor=264823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other monologue types included "entrance monologues"&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt; and exit monologues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exit Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology|volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 1942 |pages=1–21 |jstor=264367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt;

From Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geis|first=Deborah R.|title=Postmodern theatric(k)s: monologue in contemporary American drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiJaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=December 1993|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0-472-10467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Interior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |title=monologue (drama and literature) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812133304/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |title=Monologue Information |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028033907/http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditions==
Actors in theatre, and sometimes in film and television, may be asked to deliver monologues in auditions. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audition Monologues|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|website=Ace Your Audition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714084548/http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|archivedate=14 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces are usually limited to two minutes or less and are often paired with a contrasting monologue: comic and dramatic; classical and contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyactor.com/contemporary-monologues/|title=Monologues from Movies &amp; Plays|last=|first=|date=October 4, 2018|website=Daily Actor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often depends on the play or role. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors.

The '''National Prize for Plastic Arts''' ({{lang-es|'''Premio Nacional de Artes Plásticas'''}}) was created in [[Chile]] in 1992 under Law 19169 as one of the replacements of the [[National Prize of Art of Chile|National Prize of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30536&amp;idVersion=1992-09-26 |title=Ley 19169: Establece normas sobre otorgamiento de Premios Nacionales |trans-title=Law 19169: Establishes Rules on Granting National Prizes |publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Chile)|Ministry of Education]] |language=Spanish |date=26 September 1992 |access-date=8 December 2017 |via=Library of the National Congress of Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is granted "to the person who has distinguished himself by his achievements in the respective area of the arts" (Article 8 of the aforementioned law). It is part of the [[National Prize of Chile]].

The prize, which is awarded every two years, consists of a diploma, the sum of 6,576,457 [[Chilean peso|pesos]] ({{US$|{{To USD|6576457|CHL|round=yes}}}}) which is adjusted every year, according to the previous year's [[consumer price index]], and a pension of 20 {{ill|Monthly tax unit|es|Unidad tributaria mensual|lt=monthly tax units}} (approximately US$1,600).

'''Neosymbolism''' is a movement current in the [[visual arts]] genre.  Active in the movement are artists in the United States, Denmark, the [[Czech Republic]], and Canada.

== Philosophy ==
The core philosophy of Neosymbolism, like that of its predecessor [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], is the idea of "correspondences", the "emblematic order" of a world in which technology and the industrial reality have not yet drowned the forces of mysticism and belief. In a world where visual images exist to generate sales and revenue, Neosymbolist imagery attempts to preserve the relationship between image and the human soul. The imagery is necessarily representational rather than abstract. It borders on the narrative, but stops short of the commercial trap of illustration to convey an idea for profit. Artists like [[Norman Rockwell]] could qualify as Neosymbolist painters in that they adopt a social and cultural undercurrent and then convey it in terms of the cultural cliche—the image as representative of core aspects of the culture. The same is not true, however, of the generally accepted idea of commercial illustration which attempts more to influence cultural, political, and economic ideology than it tries to communicate an existential reality.

Neosymbolism is fairly well-hidden within the culture, with few references and almost no broad-based visibility. In 1988, Nick A_Demos published a book in two editions. This was  the first visible sign of an idea underlying a Neosymbolist philosophy. A_Demos then developed this first book of Neosymbolism into paintings. He was also the first to use the word "Neosymbolism", thus coining it.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There has also been a separate group using the Neosymbolism name for the creation of an international collective representing a number of artists who share the goals of preserving the visual art of Symbolism (the foundation of the ideas associated with the term Neosymbolism) in its original and essential sense. This preservation, as opposed to the "non-sense" of various philosophies that have evolved since the late nineteenth century and have deviated from the core Symbolist philosophy.
  
The Neosymbolist movement was born spontaneously in numerous locations across the globe. Many groups use the word but also do not want to be limited to only this discipline. A group of Danish Neosymbolists defined their movement thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arrkunst.webbyen.dk/vishjemmeside_privat.asp?mode=top_frame&amp;id=614394&amp;side=&amp;webside=4222305 |title=webbyen.dk |date=2011-07-19 |access-date=2017-02-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132848/http://www.arrkunst.webbyen.dk/vishjemmeside_privat.asp?mode=top_frame&amp;id=614394&amp;side=&amp;webside=4222305 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
* Using Iconic language in their expressions
* Reproducing the inner experience of the outer world  
* Examining the human experience and circumstance in today’s changing world
* Examining the underlying meaning of life
* Using media in conscious and innovative ways

The founder of the Canadian Neosymbolists, meanwhile, describes the foundations of their movement in ''Brief Summary of the Foundations of Canadian Neosymbolism,''{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} written by their founder, Gary F. Manzo.

* Using Symbolic language in our expressions, often derived from Dream Sequences and Archetypal Imagery as described by Carl Jung, and others involved with Mysticism, Alchemy, Depth Psychology and Philosophy. 
* Depicting the inner experience of the outer world, in relationship to Self-Actualization and Depth Psychology and related fields of study. 
* Examining the human experience and circumstance in today’s changing world, with the idea that mankind must “make friends with his animal nature” in order to achieve Wholeness of SELF in a contemporary world. 
* Examining the underlying meaning of life, both from an historical perspective and its relevancy to the new age of Technology as well as New Age Psychology. 
* Using mediums and techniques, in conscious, experimental and innovative ways, utilizing both traditional methods and contemporary cutting-edge techniques and technologies.

Another international Neosymbolist collective that began exhibiting as a group in 2001 has a simpler definition:
 
- The "exploration of the emotional, political, and spiritual themes of the rapidly changing culture of the late 20th and early 21st (century) through the use of symbols both personal and universal."{{cite quote|date=April 2015}}
  
This perspective of the Neosymbolist movement can be seen as a reaction against abstraction, an attempt to weave artists’ intellectual and spiritual experiences into the fabric of their work. Furthermore, the Neosymbolists’ palette is not limited to the use of words and ancient symbols of ideas, even as these remain powerful tools of expression.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9309">'''Nuclear art''' was an artistic tendency developed  by some artists and painters, after the bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].

==Conception and origins==
In the days, weeks and years following the atomic bombing of Japan, trained and untrained artists who survived the bombings began documenting their experiences in artworks.&lt;ref name="MIT Ground Zero"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. occupation authorities controlled the release of photographs and film footage of these events, while photographers and artists on the ground continued to produce visual representations of the effects of nuclear warfare. Photographer [[Yōsuke Yamahata]] began taking photographs of Nagasaki on August 10, 1945 (the day after the bombing), however his photographs were not released to the public until 1952 when the magazine ''[[Asahi Gurafu]]'' published them.&lt;ref name="Unforgettable Fire" &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical nuclear art in Italy===
In 1948, the artistic movement of [[Eaismo]], published a manifesto illustrating some aspects of the [[atomic age]] and, at the same time, criticizing the industrial use of [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a movement of poetry and painting, founded by the Italian artist [[Voltolino Fontani]], aiming to balance the role of men in a society upset by  the danger  of [[nuclear radiation]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web
  |first=Maria  |last=Grandinetti
  |title=Punti programmatici del Movimento Eaista
  |journal= Arte Contemporanea  |location=[[Rome|Roma]]
  |year=1949 
  |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/maria-grandinetti_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ 
  |accessdate=1 April 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic group was strengthened by the poet [[Marcello Landi]] and by the literary critic Guido Favati. In 1948 Voltolino Fontani depicted the disintegration and fragmentation of an [[atom]] on canvas, by creating the artwork: ''Dinamica di assestamento e mancata stasi''.

In 1951 the painters [[Enrico Baj]] and Sergio Dangelo created the {{illm|Arte nucleare movement|it}},  criticizing and putting the repetitiveness of painting (as an artistic and commercial phenomenon) in discussion.&lt;ref &gt;Luciano Caramel, Arte in Italia, 1945-1960, Vita e Pensiero, [[Milano]] 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
Plenty of Italian artists, in [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and foreigners like [[Yves Klein]], [[Asger Jorn]], [[Arman]], [[Antonio Saura]] joined the movement. The main representative of the arte nucleare movement was [[Piero Manzoni]], who in this context, for the first time in his life, put  his talent in evidence.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.pieromanzoni.org/biografia_1933-57.htm, ''link read in April 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Eaismo, recommending artists to pursue painting values (and poetry),&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt; the arte nucleare movement tried to promote a new form of art in which painting was marginalized.&lt;ref &gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/contemporarea/AAI/ant38, Arman, Baj, Bemporad, Bertini, Colonne, Chapmans, Colucci, Dangelo, De Miceli, D'Haese, Hoeboer, Hundertwasser, Klein, Koenig, Manzoni, Nando, Noiret, A. e G. Pomodoro, Restany, Saura, Sordini, Vandercam ,Verga, Manifesto contro lo stile, Milano, 1959, link read in April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical nuclear art in Spain=== 
In the meantime, Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalì]] published the [[Mystical manifesto]] (1951), putting catholic mysticism and nuclear themes together.
In this period Dalì created artworks like [[Idillio atomico]] (1945) and [[Leda Atomica]] (1949).

===Historical nuclear art in France===

In 1949  the French artist [[Bernard Lorjou]] started to paint his monumental artwork “l’age atomique”  (The atomic age). The painting was concluded after one year and is now located in the [[Centre Pompidou]].

===Historical nuclear art in the United States===

The painter and photographer [[Eugene Von Bruenchenhein]] painted the artwork “Atomic age” in 1955,&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.ktfineart.com/past/?object_id=86&amp;show=project_images&amp;heading_id=&amp;project_id=90&amp;detail_id=602, link read in 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and other apocalyptical and post apocalyptical paintings up to 1965.

The British sculptor, [[Henry Moore]], created a bronze public sculpture, entitled, [[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)]] (1967) that depicted both the fatality of nuclear weapons as well as celebrated the invention of nuclear energy for use as electrical power. The sculpture is located on the grounds of the University of Chicago, where the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was produced at the [[Chicago Pile-1]], under the oversight of the Manhattan Project and Enrico Fermi. The sculpture is in the form of a hybrid [[mushroom cloud]] and human skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Contemporary approaches to nuclear art==

===Japan===
After the March 2011 accident that caused three nuclear reactors to melt down at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan, there have been numerous responses by contemporary Japanese artists, including Shigenobu Yoshida, [[Tatsuo Miyajima]], [[Shimpei Takeda]], [[Fuyuki Yamakawa]], Iri and Toshi Maruki, and Hiroshima bomb survivor, Tadasi Tonoshiki.&lt;ref name="WEAD Atomic Legacy Art"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">The best-known '''pleorama''' was a 19th-century moving [[Panoramic painting|panorama]] entertainment where the viewers sat in a rocking boat while panoramic views on painted canvas rolled past. The word has sometimes been used for other entertainments or innovations.

Architect [[Carl Ferdinand Langhans]] introduced a pleorama in [[Breslau]] in 1831 with scenes of the [[Bay of Naples]] on both sides of 24 "voyagers" sitting in a wooden boat floating in a pool of water. The illusion was enhanced by light and sound effects: the boatman singing, [[Vesuvius]] erupting. Writer/artist [[August Kopisch]] was involved in designing the hour-long show.

Carl Wilhelm Gropius, who had a [[diorama]] exhibit in [[Berlin]], took over management of this pleorama in 1832, and there was also a pleorama of a journey along the river [[Rhine]]. 

The Swiss writer Bernard Comment, among others, has pointed out the similarities between Langhans' pleorama and the ambitious [[mareorama]] at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exhibition]].

A similar idea was used for a [[London]] ''padorama'' in 1834. Spectators were seated in [[railway]] carriages to watch a moving panorama of scenes visible from the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

In 1850s [[Finland]] the name ''pleorama'' was given to shows which presented historic scenes and panoramic views using glass, but posters for these do not mention anything resembling Langhans' boat concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibbild.abo.fi/nojen/ Posters in Swedish for pleoramas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''pleorama'' was coined from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] elements. Like other 19th century novelties ending in ''-orama'' - [[diorama]] and [[cyclorama]], for instance - the second half of the word has the sense of 'something seen'. The ''pleo-'' part here is understood to come from a Greek word meaning 'float' which applies to Langhans' boat in water idea. ''Pleorama'' is also the 21st century name of an innovative "floating house".

'''Poetics''' is the theory of literary forms and literary [[discourse]]. It may refer specifically to the theory of [[poetry]], although some speakers use the term so broadly as to denote the concept of "theory" itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Genette]] (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CWjjasIjWiYC&amp;pg=PA14 ''Essays In Aesthetics, Volume 4''], p.14: {{quotation|My program then was named "Theory of Literary Forms" — a title that I supposed to be less ambiguous for minds a little distant from this specialty, if it is one, than its (for me) synonym Poetics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "poetics" comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ποιητικός ''poietikos'' "pertaining to poetry," literally "creative, productive," from ποιητός ''poietos'' "made," verbal adjective of ποιεῖν ''poiein'' "to make."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=poetic "poetic"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar T.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;F. Brogan identifies&lt;ref name="Brogan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brogan | first = T. | title = The New Princeton Handbook of Poetic Terms | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-691-03672-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; three major movements in Western poetics over the past 3,000 years, beginning with the [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]], [[Metaphysical objectivism|objectivist]] [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian tradition]] (see ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''). During the [[romanticism|romantic era]], poetics tended toward [[expressionism]] and emphasized the perceiving [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]. The 20th century witnessed a return to the Aristotelian paradigm, followed by trends toward metacriticality, or the establishment of a theory of poetics.

Eastern poetics developed primarily with reference to the [[lyric poetry|lyric]], as opposed to the [[mimesis|mimetic]].&lt;ref name="Brogan" /&gt;

==In literary criticism==

Poetics is distinguished from [[hermeneutics]] by its focus not on the meaning of a text, but rather its understanding of how a text's different elements come together and produce certain effects on the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Culler |first1=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Culler |year=1997 |title=Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction}}:&lt;/ref&gt; Most literary criticism combines poetics and hermeneutics in a single analysis; however, one or the other may predominate given the text and the aims of the one doing the reading.

'''Stendhal syndrome''', '''Stendhal's syndrome''', '''hyperkulturemia''', or '''Florence syndrome''' is a [[psychosomatic]] disorder that causes [[Tachycardia|rapid heartbeat]], dizziness, [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]], confusion and even [[hallucination]]s when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance, particularly viewing [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bcr.06.2008.0317| title = Stendhal syndrome: A case of cultural overload| journal = Case Reports| volume = 2009| pages = bcr0620080317| year = 2009| last1 = Nicholson | first1 = T.

==History==
[[File:Stendhal.jpg|thumb|upright|Stendhal syndrome was named after Marie-Henri Beyle (1783–1842), better known by his penname [[Stendhal]].]]
The illness is named after the 19th-century French author [[Stendhal]] (pseudonym of Marie-Henri Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to [[Florence]] in his book ''Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio''.

When he visited the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]], where [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] are buried, he was overcome with emotion. He wrote:{{quote|I was in a sort of ecstasy, from the idea of being in Florence, close to the great men whose tombs I had seen. Absorbed in the contemplation of sublime beauty ... I reached the point where one encounters celestial sensations ... Everything spoke so vividly to my soul. Ah, if I could only forget. I had palpitations of the heart, what in Berlin they call 'nerves'. Life was drained from me. I walked with the fear of falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OxyNfsmXfYEC&amp;pg=PA196 | title=Interfaces of Performance | editor-first1=Maria |editor-last1= Chatzichristodoulou | editor-first2=Janis |editor-last2= Jefferies |editor-first3=Rachel |editor-last3= Zerihan | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year= 2009 |page= 196 |isbn= 9781409486145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He had been shown the frescoes in the church including those by [[Giotto]], and modern writers frequently attribute his emotions mistakenly to the latter rather than powerful historical associations of the tombs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Although psychiatrists have long debated whether it really exists, its effects on some sufferers are serious enough for them to require treatment in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/world/florence-s-art-makes-some-go-to-pieces.html |title=Florence's Art Makes Some Go to Pieces |location=Italy; Florence (Italy) |work=The New York Times |date=15 May 1989 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff at Florence's Santa Maria Nuova hospital are accustomed to dealing with tourists suffering from dizzy spells and disorientation after admiring the statue of David, the masterpieces of the Uffizi Gallery and other treasures of the Tuscan city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/7914746/Scientists-investigate-Stendhal-Syndrome-fainting-caused-by-great-art.html |title=Scientists investigate Stendhal Syndrome – fainting caused by great art |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there are many descriptions of people becoming dizzy and fainting while taking in Florentine art, especially at the aforementioned [[Uffizi]] in Florence, dating from the early 19th century on, the syndrome was only named in 1979, when it was described by Italian psychiatrist [[Graziella Magherini]], who observed and described more than 100 similar cases among tourists and visitors in Florence. There is no scientific evidence to define the Stendhal syndrome as a specific psychiatric disorder; on the other hand there is evidence that the same cerebral areas involved in emotional reactions are activated during the exposure to artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last1=Innocenti |first1=Claudia |last2=Fioravanti |first2=Giulia |last3=Spiti |first3=Raffaello |last4=Faravelli |first4=Carlo |title=La sindrome di Stendhal fra psicoanalisi e neuroscienze |journal=Rivista di Psichiatria |date=1 March 2014 |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=61–66  |doi=10.1708/1461.16139|pmid=24770571 |issn=2038-2502  |trans-title=[The Stendhal syndrome between psychoanalysis and neuroscience]. |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable art may also be understood as art that is produced with consideration for the wider impact of the work and its reception in relationship to its environments (social, economic, biophysical, historical and cultural).

== History ==
According to the contemporary art historians and curators [[Maja and Reuben Fowkes]], the origins of sustainable art can be traced to the [[conceptual art]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, with its stress on dematerialisation and questioning of the functioning of the art system.&lt;ref&gt;‘Planetary Forecast: The Roots of Sustainability in the Radical Art of the 1970s’ Third Text 100 Special Issue vol 23 issue 5 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They also connect the rise of the concept of sustainability to the ending of the Cold War in 1989 and the emergence of a new awareness of the global character of ecological and social problems.&lt;ref&gt;'The Ecology of Post-Socialism and the Implications of Sustainability for Contemporary Art' in ''Art and Theory After Socialism'' edited Malcolm Miles (Plymouth Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable art adopts, according to these authors, a critical position towards some key practitioners in the [[land art]] movement of the 1960s, who showed little concern for the environmental consequences of e.g. treating the landscape like a giant canvas with a bulldozer for a brush.&lt;ref&gt;“Art and Ecology – Economy Special Issue” (2006). Praesens: central European contemporary art review. 1. ISSN 1588-5534.&lt;/ref&gt; They have questioned the polemical division between 'autonomous' and 'instrumental' art originating with modernism, arguing that it is 'autonomy that gives art, as well as artists as social actors, the potential to be free and able to offer alternatives to dominant ideological paradigms.'&lt;ref&gt;Maja and Reuben Fowkes, 'Sensuous Resistance:the legacy of modernism for sustainable art' Dokumenta 12 magazine project (July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005 there is a Sustainable Arts Biennale running at Ihlienworth near Hamburg, Germany, curated by the German conceptional artist and curator Samuel J. Fleiner.
There are a range of interpretations over the relations between art and sustainability, besides the term 'sustainable art' promoted by Maja and Reuben Fowkes: Other authors prefer the broader notions of 'sustainability arts' or 'art and sustainability' (e.g. Kagan and Kirchberg).&lt;ref&gt;Eds Sacha Kagan and Volker Kirchberg (2008). "Sustainability: a new frontier for the arts and cultures". Frankfurt am Main: VAS. {{ISBN|978-3-88864-440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others explicitly rejected the use of the term 'sustainable art', referring instead to 'artistic work that inspires us to think about sustainability" (Margot Käßmann).&lt;ref&gt;Margot Käßmann. "The Spirit of Sustainability." Berlin: Rat für Nachhaltige Entwicklung.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional discussion of the relationship of contemporary art to notions of sustainability blossomed across Europe in the early years 2000, with e.g. the conference of the German Society for Political Culture (Instituts für Kulturpolitik der Kulturpolitischen Gesellschaft e.V.), in January 2002 at the Art Academy of Berlin, and the 'Tutzinger Manifest'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kupoge.de/ifk/tutzinger-manifest/kun.htm Kultur - Kunst - Nachhaltigkeit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; An International Symposium on Sustainability and Contemporary Art took place at [[Central European University]], in Budapest (Hungary) in March 2006. This was the first in a series of international symposia organised by [[Maja and Reuben Fowkes]] bringing together contemporary artists, philosophers, environmental sciences and acvitists to explore common ground around issues such as 'Exit or Activism' (2008), 'Hard Realities and the New Materiality' (2009) and 'Art, Post-Fordism and Eco-Critique' (2010).[https://web.archive.org/web/20100115070048/http://www.translocal.org/sustainability/index.htm]. In March–April 2007 at the [[Lüneburg University|Leuphana University Lüneburg]], the Arts Research Network of the European Sociological Association focused its attention on the recent movements and approaches to 'arts and sustainability' at its biennial conference.&lt;ref&gt;Volker Kirchberg, Sacha Kagan and Christoph Behnke (2007). "Final Report: ESA Research Network for the Sociology of the Arts". Lüneburg: Leuphana Universität Lüneburg. {{ISBN|978-3935786485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kultur - Kunst - Nachhaltigkeit".

Exhibitions devoted explicitly to "sustainable art" include e.g. ‘Beyond Green: Towards a Sustainable Art’ at the Smart Museum in Chicago in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Beyond Green: Toward a Sustainable Art exhibition catalogue (2005). Chicago: Smart Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; For an analysis of the conflictual politics of sustainability and the ambiguity of the term sustainability (which oscillates between "ecological sustainability" and "economic sustainable development," see TJ Demos, “The Politics of Sustainability: Art and Ecology” (2009).&lt;ref&gt;TJ Demos, “The Politics of Sustainability: Art and Ecology,” in ''Radical Nature: Art and Architecture for a Changing Planet, 1969–2009'', ed. Francesco Manacorda and Ariella Yedgar (London: Barbican Art Gallery, 2009), pp. 17-30.&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent account of the multi-faceted role of contemporary art in highlighting environmental issues, expressing criticism towards unsustainable factors in society, and offering imaginative solutions for the achievement of sustainability, see Maja and Reuben Fowkes's essay on 'Art and Sustainability' in Enough for All Forever (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Maja and Reuben Fowkes, 'Art and Sustainability,' in ''Enough for All Forever: A Handbook for Learning about Sustainability'', eds Joy Morray, et al.

'''The Law of Conservation of Misery''' is a [[folk wisdom]] that states that the total amount of [[wikt:misery|misery]] in a system is constant.

This implies that when you try to decrease the misery in one aspect of a system, you will increase the misery in some of the other aspects. In other words, for each problem you solve, at least one new problem is created, or as many new problems that together equal the trouble caused by the original problem. This law has particular significance in the realm of fantasy football, where one person's misery appears to correlate inversely with another person's happiness.  &lt;ref&gt;Dealing with Dilemmas, [[Frank Buytendijk]], 2010, Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0470630310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertzfeld|first=Andy|title=Revolution in the valley|year=2005|publisher=O'Reilly|location=Sebastapol, Calif.|isbn=0-596-00719-1|pages=88|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Michael Harnett Still life Violin and Music.jpg|thumb|''Still life Violin and Music'' by [[William Michael Harnett]] ]]

'''''Trompe-l'œil''''' ([[French language|French]] for "deceive the eye", pronounced {{IPA-fr|tʁɔ̃p lœj|}}) is an art technique that uses realistic imagery to create the [[optical illusion]] that the depicted objects exist in three dimensions. [[Forced perspective]] is a comparable illusion in architecture.

==History in painting==
[[File:Pompejanischer Maler um 70 001.jpg|thumb|Still life, Pompeii, c. AD 70]]
[[File:Colyer, Edwaert - Still Life - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Trompe-l'œil painting by [[Evert Collier]]]]
[[File:Escaping criticism-by pere borrel del caso.png|thumb|''Escaping Criticism'' by [[Pere Borrell del Caso]], 1874]]

Though the phrase, which can also be spelled without the [[hyphen]] and [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] in English as '''trompe l'oeil''',&lt;ref&gt;For example by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041108051506/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2002/slideshow/slide-176-1.shtm National Gallery of Art, Washington]&lt;/ref&gt; originates in the [[Baroque]] period, when it refers to perspectival illusionism, trompe-l'œil dates much further back. It was (and is) often employed in [[mural]]s. Instances from Greek and Roman times are known, for instance in [[Pompeii]]. A typical trompe-l'œil mural might depict a window, door, or hallway, intended to suggest a larger room.

A version of an oft-told [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story concerns a contest between two renowned painters. [[Zeuxis]] (born around 464 BC) produced a still life painting so convincing that birds flew down to peck at the painted grapes. A rival, [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]], asked Zeuxis to judge one of his paintings that was behind a pair of tattered curtains in his study. Parrhasius asked Zeuxis to pull back the curtains, but when Zeuxis tried, he could not, as the curtains were included in Parrhasius's painting—making Parrhasius the winner.

==Perspective==
With widespread fascination with [[perspective (graphical)|perspective drawing]] in the [[Renaissance]], Italian painters of the late [[Quattrocento]] such as [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1431–1506) and [[Melozzo da Forlì]] (1438–1494), began painting [[illusionistic ceiling painting]]s, generally in [[fresco]], that employed perspective and techniques such as [[Perspective (graphical)#Foreshortening|foreshortening]] to create the impression of greater space for the viewer below. This type of trompe l'œil illusionism as specifically applied to ceiling paintings is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Di sotto in sù|di sotto in sù]]'', meaning "from below, upward" in Italian. The elements above the viewer are rendered as if viewed from true vanishing point perspective. Well-known examples are the [[Camera degli Sposi]] in [[Mantua]] and [[Antonio da Correggio]]'s (1489–1534) ''Assumption of the Virgin'' in the Duomo of [[Parma]]. Similarly, [[Vittorio Carpaccio]] (1460–1525) and [[Jacopo de' Barbari]] (c. 1440 – before 1516) added small trompe-l'œil features to their paintings, playfully exploring the boundary between image and reality. For example, a [[fly]] might appear to be sitting on the painting's frame, or a curtain might appear to partly conceal the painting, a piece of paper might appear to be attached to a board, or a person might appear to be climbing out of the painting altogether—all in reference to [[Zeuxis|the contest of Zeuxis and Parrhasius]]. In a 1964 seminar, the psychoanalyst and theorist [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) observed that the myth of the two painters reveals an interesting aspect of human cognition. While animals are attracted to superficial appearances, humans are enticed by the idea of things that are hidden.

==Quadratura==
Perspective theories in the 17th century allowed a more fully integrated approach to architectural illusion, which when used by painters to "open up" the space of a wall or ceiling is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Quadratura|quadratura]]''. Examples include [[Pietro da Cortona]]'s ''Allegory of Divine Providence'' in the [[Palazzo Barberini]] and [[Andrea Pozzo]]'s ''Apotheosis of St Ignatius'' [4] on the ceiling of the Roman church of [http://www.wga.hu/html/p/pozzo/apotheos.html Sant'Ignazio].
[[File:Fresco with Trompe l'oeuil - Andrea Pozzo -Jesuit Church Vienna.jpg|thumb|Fresco with ''trompe l'œil'' dome painted on low vaulting, [[Jesuitenkirche, Vienna|Jesuit Church]], [[Vienna]], by [[Andrea Pozzo]], 1703]]
{{Italic title}}
The [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] style interiors of [[Jesuit]] churches in the 16th and 17th century often included such trompe-l'œil ceiling paintings, which optically "open" the ceiling or dome to the heavens with a depiction of Jesus', [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s, or a saint's ascension or assumption. An example of a perfect architectural trompe-l'œil is the illusionistic dome in the Jesuit church, Vienna, by [[Andrea Pozzo]], which is only slightly curved but gives the impression of true architecture.

Trompe-l'œil paintings became very popular in Flemish and later in Dutch painting in the 17th century arising from the development of still life painting.  The Flemish painter [[Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts|Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts]] created a chantourné painting showing an easel holding a painting.  Chantourné literally means 'cutout' and refers to a trompe l'œil representation designed to stand away from a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/arrowintheeye/illusion3.html 'Illusion, Delusion, Collusion, and Perceptual Paradox', in: Michael Kubovy and Christopher Tyler, Psychology of Perspective and Renaissance Art]&lt;/ref&gt;   The Dutch painter [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] was a master of the trompe-l'œil and theorized on the role of art as the lifelike imitation of nature in his 1678 book, the ''Introduction to the Academy of Painting, or the Visible World'' (''Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst: anders de zichtbaere werelt'', Rotterdam, 1678).&lt;ref&gt;Susan Merriam, 'Seventeenth-century Flemish Garland Paintings: Still Life, Vision, and the Devotional Image', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8iL0uoNEJXUC&amp;dq=%22illusionism+in+Dutch+and+Flemish+Art%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thijs Weststeijn, 'The Visible World: Samuel Van Hoogstraten's Art Theory and the Legitimation of Painting in the Dutch Golden Age'], Amsterdam University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A fanciful form of architectural trompe-l'œil, '''quodlibet''', features realistically rendered paintings of such items as paper knives, playing cards, ribbons, and scissors, apparently accidentally left lying around.&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |type=Paperback |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8 |pages=880 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe-l'œil can also be found painted on tables and other items of furniture, on which, for example, a deck of playing cards might appear to be sitting on the table. A particularly impressive example can be seen at [[Chatsworth House]] in [[Derbyshire]], where one of the internal doors appears to have a violin and bow suspended from it, in a trompe l'œil painted around 1723 by [[Jan van der Vaardt]].&lt;ref name=JvanderVaardtViolin&gt;{{cite web |last=van der Vaardt |first=Jan |title=Violin and bow hanging from door |url=http://art.chatsworth.org/image/455206/jan-van-der-vaart-violin-and-bow-hanging-on-a-door |work=Devonshire Collection |publisher=Bridgeman Art Library |accessdate=15 April 2012 |location=Chatsworth House UK |format=Painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example can be found in the Painted Hall at the [[Old Royal Naval College]], Greenwich, London. This Wren building was painted by [[James Thornhill|Sir James Thornhill]], the first British born painter to be knighted and is a classic example of the baroque style popular in the early 18th century.  The American 19th-century still-life painter [[William Harnett]] specialized in trompe-l'œil. In the 20th century, from the 1960s on, the American [[Richard Haas]] and many others painted large trompe-l'œil murals on the sides of city buildings, and from beginning of the 1980s when German Artist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] began to combine classical fresco art with contemporary content trompe-l'œil became increasingly popular for interior murals. The Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalí]] utilized the technique for a number of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|af-jY2dC5XYC|Dali and Postmodernism|page=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other art forms==
Trompe-l'œil, in the form of "[[forced perspective]]", has long been used in stage-theater [[set design]], so as to create the illusion of a much deeper space than the actual stage. A famous early example is the [[Teatro Olimpico]] in [[Vicenza]], with [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]]'s seven forced-perspective "streets" (1585), which appear to recede into the distance.

Trompe-l'œil is employed in [[Donald O'Connor]]'s famous "Running up the wall" scene in the film ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1954). During the finale of his "Make 'em Laugh" number he first runs up a real wall. Then he runs towards what appears to be a hallway, but when he runs up this as well we realize that it is a large trompe-l'œil mural. More recently, [[Roy Andersson]] has made use of similar techniques in his feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fourthreefilm.com/2015/06/a-pigeon-sat-on-a-branch-reflecting-on-existence-an-interview-with-cinematographer-istvan-borbas/|title=A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence – An Interview with Cinematographer István Borbás|author=Bateman, Conor|publisher=4:3|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matte painting]] is a variant of trompe-l'œil, and is used in film production with elements of a scene are painted on glass panels mounted in front of the camera. 

Fictional trompe-l'œil appears in many [[Looney Tunes]], such as the [[Road Runner cartoon]]s, where, for example, Wile E. Coyote paints a tunnel on a rock wall, and the Road Runner then races through the fake tunnel. This is usually followed by the coyote's foolishly trying to run through the tunnel after the road runner, only to smash into the hard rock-face. This [[Visual gag|sight gag]] was employed in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.

In [[Chicago]]'s [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]], [[Richard Haas]] used a 16-story 1929 apartment hotel converted into a 1981 apartment building for trompe-l'œil murals in homage to [[Chicago school architecture]]. One of the building's sides features the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], intended as a reflection of the actual building two miles south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/288.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=The City as Artifact |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3766.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=Mural, ''Homage to the Chicago School'', by Richard Haas, 1980 |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of France's most illusive trompe-l'œil artists is [[Jean Claude Adenin]], who has created installations for various wealthy clients.

Several contemporary artists use chalk on pavement or sidewalk to create trompe-l'œil works, a technique called [[street painting]] or "pavement art." These creations last only until washed away, and therefore must be photographed to be preserved. Practitioners of this form include [[Julian Beever]], [[Edgar Mueller]], [[Leon Keer]] and [[Kurt Wenner]].

The Palazzo Salis of [[Tirano]], [[Italy]] has over centuries and throughout the palace used trompe l'œil in place of more expensive real masonry, doors, staircases, balconies and draperies to create an illusion of sumptuousness and opulence.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, J. (2015) [http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil Tirano's Palace of Trompe L'Oeil: A Photographic Exhibition by John Paull] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208185147/http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil |date=2015-12-08 }} SlideShare.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe l'œil, in the form of "illusion painting", is also used in contemporary interior design, where illusionary wall paintings experienced a Renaissance since around 1980. Significant artists in this field are the German muralist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], who invented, in the 1990s, a new method of producing illusion paintings, [[frescography]], and the English artist [[Graham Rust]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3845">The '''two headed alligator''' is a [[Fearsome critters|folkloric animal]] of the [[United States|American]] state of [[Florida]]. Its history is focused mainly within the neighborhood of [[Seminole Heights]] in the city of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], where it appears on the official seal. It is also the subject of art murals, statues, flags, tee-shirts and other ephemera related to the neighborhood.

== Origins ==
[[File:Advertisement for North Tampa Pan-Am Garage Seminole Heights history Florida Ave.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for North Tampa Pan-Am Garage Seminole Heights history Florida Ave]]
The earliest recorded reference to the two headed alligator was in 1911 when real estate developer, T. Roy Young and his Seminole Development Company purchased 40 acres of land and developed Seminole Heights, Tampa's first suburb. In the promotion of the real estate venture, Young adopted an image of a two headed alligator as part of a neighborhood seal.

A folktale entitled, ''Bite or Smite'', was recorded by R. Perez and A.L. Lopez in 1930 during their research on local superstitions for the [[Federal Writers' Project|Federal Writers’ Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration|Work Projects Administration]] for the State of Florida. Like many folktales from the region, its characters consist of an anthropomorphic rabbit, alligator and turtle. In the story, the rabbit ignores the warning of the turtle and is eaten by the alligator, who had been concealing a second head. Since it is difficult to date the creation of folklore, it is unclear whether Bite or Smite was the inspiration for, or inspired by, the Seminole Heights seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patch.com/florida/seminoleheights/two-headed-alligator-statue-turning-heads-seminole-heights|title=Two-Headed Alligator (Statue) Turning Heads in Seminole Heights|newspaper=Seminole Heights, FL Patch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bite or Smite Florida Folklore History Seminole Heights.jpg|thumb|Folktale ''Bite or Smite'' recorded by R. Perez and A.L. Lopez in 1930]]

== 2014 Sighting ==
In 2014, a man claiming to be a "local naturalist" sent an image of a two-headed alligator he spotted at a Seminole Heights park to the local newspaper, [[Tampa Bay Times]], who ran the image on the cover of the follow day's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2014/07/01/Two-headed-alligator-spotted-in-Florida/5141404226010/|title=Two-headed alligator spotted in Florida?|newspaper=UPI|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story became an international headline, scientists started to question the authenticity of the creature. The story was later discovered to be a hoax.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/its-a-total-crock/2186639|title= That photo of a two-headed Seminole Heights alligator? It's a total crock!}}&lt;/ref&gt;A local restaurant, [[Ella's Folkart Cafe]], displays a taxidermied two headed alligator that it claims was caught by local trappers soon after the news story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/46112|title=Tampa, FL - Famous Two-Headed Alligator|website=RoadsideAmerica.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statue ==
In 2016 a Seminole Heights community art fund, [[Urban Art Attack]], funded the building of a 6-foot two headed alligator statue in front of Southern Brewing and Winemaking at 4500 Nebraska Ave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patch.com/florida/seminoleheights/two-headed-alligator-statue-turning-heads-seminole-heights|title=Two-Headed Alligator (Statue) Turning Heads in Seminole Heights|newspaper=Seminole Heights, FL Patch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[novel]], [[theatrical]] [[Play (theatre)|script]], [[screenplay]], [[sketch story|sketch stories]], and [[poetry]], a '''vignette''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-vignette.ogg|v|ɪ|n|ˈ|j|ɛ|t}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t}}) is a short impressionistic scene that focuses on one moment or character and gives a trenchant impression about that character, an idea, setting, and/or object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca/2010/02/top-10-interwoven-vignettes.html|title=100 Movies, 100 Theaters: Top 10 Interwoven Vignettes|website=100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a short, descriptive passage, more about evoking meaning through imagery than about plot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/house-on-mango-street/writing-style.html|title=The House on Mango Street Writing Style|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vignette|title=vignette Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[blog]] or [[web series]] can also provide a form of vignette or be presented as a series of vignettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/vignette-in-literature.html | title=Vignette in Literature | publisher=[[Blogspot]] |work=[writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/ Writing in Wonderland] | date=26 April 2011 | accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the critically acclaimed web series ''[[High Maintenance (TV series)|High Maintenance]]'', which presents a different set of characters in each episode, focusing intensely on their specific traits, ideas, and worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/04/10/high-maintenance|title=High Maintenance|website=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/11/12/high-maintenance-vimeo/23089/|title=Five must-reads celebrating the return of series ‘High Maintenance’|last=Baca|first=Ricardo|last2=Staff|first2=The Cannabist|website=The Cannabist|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/11/363288754/despite-the-dope-high-maintenance-is-about-more-than-potheads|title=Despite The Dope, 'High Maintenance' Is About More Than Potheads|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/11/11/vimeo-original-programming-high-maintenance/#4008c623f269|title=Vimeo Takes A Bet On 'High Maintenance' As Its First Original Series|last=Huet|first=Ellen|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignettes are more commonly used and have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a [[scene (drama)|scene]] as shown in [[postmodern theater]], [[Postmodernist film|film]] and [[Modern Television|television]], where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development. It is also a part of something bigger than itself: for example, a vignette about a house belonging to a collection of vignettes or a whole story, such as ''[[The House On Mango Street]]'', by [[Sandra Cisneros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/House-Mango-Street-Sandra-Cisneros/dp/0679734775|title=The House on Mango Street|last=Cisneros|first=Sandra|date=1991-04-03|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780679734772|edition=Reissue|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The word ''[[wikt:vignette|vignette]]'' means "little vine" in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vignette|title=Definition of VIGNETTE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of the literary form comes from the drawings of little vines that nineteenth-century printers used to decorate the title pages and beginnings of chapters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3771">The '''Village of the Arts''' is located in [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], [[Florida]]. The Village covers {{convert|36|acre|m2}} and contains over 200 homes, [[art gallery|art galleries]], restaurants, workshops and studios. Area residents live alongside the artists. Many galleries/studios in this area are also homes, making this restored section of [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]] unique with its many [[artist in residence|artists-in-residence]].
{{TOC right}}

==Village area==
The Village of the Arts is a residential and business community contained between 14th Street West, Route 41/9th Street West and 16th Avenue West in Bradenton, Florida, approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} south of Tampa and 14 miles north of Sarasota. This area of Bradenton originally consisted of 1920's style architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villageofthearts.com/about.php|title=About Village of the Arts|work=VillageOfTheArts.com|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From May 31, 1937 until  the site was home to the [[Bradenton General Hospital]].

Some of the buildings used for galleries and homes are as old as 100 years.&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesaundersblog.com/revitalized-bradenton-brims-with-artistic-flair|title=Revitalized Bradenton Brims with Artistic Flair|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live-work space==
The Village is a diverse collection of artists, galleries and fine food. Artisians from the Village of the Arts received regulatory relief from the city of [[Bradenton]] allowing [[artist-in-residence]]s to live and work out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://villageofthearts.com/UserFiles/File/Village%20History%20and%20Info(1).pdf|title=Village of the Arts History and Info|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, the houses in this area of [[Bradenton]] were considered dilapidated and an eyesore. Most have been restored, painted in colorful [[hue]]s and [[pastels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AtlK1ddfPk|title=House Tour in the Village|work=YouTube|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and converted into workshops, studios, medical facilities, family activities, galleries and cafes.

==Artistic Media==
Village Artists practice their craft in the following areas:

[[Goldsmith]]ing, [[Silversmith]]ing, [[stained glass]], [[altered books]], [[copper]]-pigment work, [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[collage]], [[oil-painting]], [[quilting]], [[acrylic paint]]ing, [[fiber art]], [[mixed media]], [[encaustic painting]], fashion and custom clothing, [[antiques]] and their restoration, [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], book-selling, [[basket-weaving]], [[re-cycled]] and up-cycled art, botanical objects, [[mosaic]], [[clay]], [[pottery]], [[music]] instruction and performance, [[art]] instruction, [[watercolors]], [[dichroic glass]], [[woodcarving]], jewelery, cut and polished stone work, [[Metalworking|metal working]] and many more.

Many artisans accept [[Commission (art)|commissions]], i.e., work as ordered and designed by a patron/customer. Patrons are then able to become involved in the production of a piece that meets the needs of a specific space in their home or office.

The '''Warlis''' or ''Varli''s are an [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[tribe]] or [[Adivasi]]s, living in mountainous as well as coastal areas of [[Maharashtra]]-[[Gujarat]] border and surrounding areas. They have their own [[animistic]] beliefs, life, customs and traditions, as a result of [[acculturation]] they have adopted many [[Hindu belief]]s. The Warlis speak an unwritten Varli language which belong to the southern zone of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]].

[[File:Warli painting in Warli.JPG|thumb|right|300 px|A painting on a wall of a Warli house, depicting a ''Devchauk'' at the centre and two ''Lagnachauk''s on both the sides]]

==Demographics==
Warlis are found in [[Jawhar]], Mokhada, [[Dahanu]] and [[Talasari]] talukas of the northern [[Thane district]], parts of [[Nashik district|Nashik]] and [[Dhule district|Dhule]] districts of [[Maharashtra]], [[Valsad]], [[Dang District, India|Dangs]], [[Navsari]] and [[Surat]] districts  of [[Gujarat]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_gujarat.pdf Census of India 2001, The Scheduled Tribes of Gujarat]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[union territory|union territories]] of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]] and [[Daman and Diu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_dnh.pdf Census of India 2001, The Scheduled Tribes of Dadra and Nagar Haveli]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Warli speak in [[Varli language]],  classified as [[Marathi–Konkani languages|Konkani]], with some degree
of influence from [[Gujrati language|Gujarati]].

Warli language is classified under Marathi by Grierson (Grierson's Linguistic Survey of India) as well as A.M. Ghatage (Warli of Thana, vol.VII of A Survey of Marathi dialects)

==Warli painting==
{{Main article|Warli painting}}
[[File:Painted prayers, Warli paintings, at Sanskriti Kendra, Anandagram, New Delhi.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Warli paintings, at [[Sanskriti Kendra Museum]], Anandagram, New Delhi.]] 
In the book ''The Painted World of the Warlis'' [[Yashodhara Dalmia]] claimed that the Warlis carry on a tradition stretching back to 2500 or 3000 BCE. Their mural paintings are similar to those done between 500 and 10,000 BCE in the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], in [[Madhya Pradesh]].

Everything about Warli is earthy and soothing. It takes you back to the painting’s provenance where you could almost smell the wet soil, feel the touch of the calloused hand that painted the background and admire meticulous brush stroke of the rural artist who created the master piece. Warli paintings succeed in adding elegance to a rural hut or a five star hotel lobby with the same charm.

No wonder, designers were so enthralled by this art form, that they decided to create an entire line of dresses based on Warli paintings. Designers have used very traditional patterns, rich and folksy colours to recreate the magic of Warli  paintings in her dresses.

Their extremely rudimentary wall paintings use a very basic graphic vocabulary: a circle, a triangle and a square.Their paintings were monosyllabic. The circle and triangle come from their observation of nature, the circle representing the sun and the moon, the triangle derived from mountains and pointed trees. Only the square seems to obey a different logic and seems to be a human invention, indicating a sacred enclosure or a piece of land. So the central motive in each ritual painting is the square, known as the "chauk" or "chaukat", mostly of two types: ''Devchauk'' and ''Lagnachauk''. Inside a ''Devchauk'', we find [[Palaghata]], the mother goddess, symbolizing fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tribhuwan |first1=Robin D.|last2=Finkenauer|first2=Maike|title=Threads Together: A Comparative Study of Tribal and Pre-historic Rock Paintings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBXdIQVeIS0C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Dev+Chowk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9f3CTKHMAou4vgO_ncDOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Dev%20Chowk&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|location=Delhi|isbn=81-7141-644-6|pages=13-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, male gods are unusual among the Warli and are frequently related to spirits which have taken human shape. The central motive in these ritual paintings is surrounded by scenes portraying hunting, fishing and farming, festivals and dances, trees and animals. Human and animal bodies are represented by two triangles joined at the tip; the upper triangle depicts the trunk and the lower triangle the pelvis. Their precarious equilibrium symbolizes the balance of the universe, and of the couple, and has the practical and amusing advantage of animating the bodies.

The pared down pictorial language is matched by a rudimentary technique. The ritual paintings are usually done inside the huts. The walls are made of a mixture of branches, earth and cow dung, making a [[Red Ochre]] background for the wall paintings. The Warli use only white for their paintings. Their white pigment is a mixture of rice paste and water with gum as a binding. They use a bamboo stick chewed at the end to make it as supple as a paintbrush. The wall paintings are done only for special occasions such as weddings or harvests. The lack of regular artistic activity explains the very crude style of their paintings, which were the preserve of the womenfolk until the late 1970s. But in the 1970s this ritual art took a radical turn, when [[Jivya Soma Mashe]] and his son [[Balu Mashe]] started to paint, not for any special ritual, but because of his artistic pursuits. Warli painting also featured in Coca-Cola's 'Come home on Diwali' ad campaign in 2010 was a tribute to the spirit of India’s youth and a recognition of the distinct lifestyle of the Warli tribe of Western India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/press-releases/coca-cola-india-celebrates-ancient-warli-folk-art-form-launches-110101200123_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribal Cultural Intellectual Property==
[[Warli Painting]] is cultural intellectual property of the tribal community. Today, there is an urgent need for preserving this traditional knowledge in tribal communities across the globe. Understanding the need for intellectual property rights, tribal non-profit Organisation "Adivasi Yuva Seva Sangh" initiated efforts to start a registration process in 2011. Now, Warli Painting is registered with a [[Geographical Indication]] under the intellectual property rights act. With the use of technology and the concept of social entrepreneurship, Tribals established the Warli Art Foundation, a non-profit company dedicated to Warli art and related activities.

'''Wistman's Wood''' is one of only three remote high-altitude oakwoods on [[Dartmoor]], [[Devon]], [[England]]. (The other two are Black Tor Beare on the [[West Okement]] at SX565892 and Piles Copse on the [[River Erme]] at SX644620.)

==Geography==
It lies at an altitude of 380–410 metres in the valley of the [[West Dart]] River near [[Two Bridges, Devon|Two Bridges]], &lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/654b7294-0f84-11e5-b968-00144feabdc0.html |title=Twisted oaks and tales on the trail of Devon's pygmy forest |last=Wilson |first=Matthew |newspaper=Financial Times |date=19 June 2015 |accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at grid reference SX612774.

The source of the [[Devonport Leat]], at a weir on the West Dart River, is just north of the wood.

==Preservation status==
This is one of the highest oakwoods in Britain and, as an outstanding example of native upland oak woodland, was selected as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="sssi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1001201|title=Natural England - SSSIs : SSSI information|publisher=www.english-nature.org.uk|accessdate=2008-10-13}} Choose "View citation" to access the citation (pdf file).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[A Nature Conservation Review|NCR site]] and forms part of the Wistman’s Wood [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|National Nature Reserve]]. The wood was also one of the primary reasons for selection of the Dartmoor [[Special Area of Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dartmoor SAC web page http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/ProtectedSites/SACselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0012929&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The wood is split into three main blocks (North, Middle and South Groves or Woods), which in total cover about 3.5 ha (9 acres).&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; These occupy sheltered, south-west facing slopes, where a bank of large granite boulders ("clitter") is exposed, and pockets of acid, free-draining, brown earth soils have accumulated. It is owned by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; and has been managed since 1961 under a nature reserve agreement with the [[Nature Conservancy Council]], [[English Nature]] and [[Natural England]]. There is no active management, but many people visit the site on foot (mostly accessing the southern end of South Wood), and cattle and sheep have free access where the terrain permits, outside of a small fenced exclosure in South Wood.

===Flora===
The vegetation conforms mostly to W17a ''Quercus petraea-Betula pubescens-Dicranum majus'' woodland, ''Isothecium myosuroides-Diplophyllum albicans'' sub-community in the [[British National Vegetation Classification]]. The trees are mainly [[pedunculate oak]], with occasional [[Sorbus aucuparia|rowan]], and a very few [[Ilex aquifolium|holly]], [[Crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[Corylus avellana|hazel]], and [[Salix aurita|eared-willow]]. Tree branches are characteristically festooned with a variety of [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] mosses and lichens and, sometimes, by grazing-sensitive species such as [[Vaccinium myrtillus|bilberry]] and [[Polypodium vulgare|polypody]]. On the ground, boulders are usually covered by lichens and mossy patches – frequent species include ''Dicranum scoparium'', ''Hypotrachyna laevigata'', ''Rhytidiadelphus loreus'' and ''Sphaerophorus globosus'' – and, where soil has accumulated, patches of acid grassland grow with [[Galium saxatile|heath bedstraw]], [[Potentilla erecta|tormentil]] and [[Rumex acetosa|sorrel]]. In places protected from livestock, grazing-sensitive plants such as [[Oxalis acetosella|wood sorrel]], [[Vaccinium myrtillus|bilberry]], [[Luzula sylvatica|wood rush]] and [[Rubus fruticosus|bramble]] occur. A fringe of [[Pteridium aquilinum|bracken]] surrounds much of the wood, demarcating the extent of brown earth soils.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; The wood supports approximately 120 species of lichen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hoare |first1=Ben |title=Wild Month |work=BBC Wildlife |date=November 2018 |pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
The wood is home to a large population of [[Vipera berus|adders]].&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

==History==
Wistman's Wood has been mentioned in writing for hundreds of years. It is likely a left-over from the ancient forest that covered much of Dartmoor c. 7000 BC, before [[Mesolithic]] hunter/gatherers cleared it around 5000 BC.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; Photographic and other records show that Wistman's Wood has changed considerably since the mid-19th century; at the same time climatic conditions have also generally become warmer.&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;Proctor, M.C.F., Spooner, G.M. and Spooner, M. 1980. Changes in Wistman’s Wood, Devon: photographic and other evidence. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 112, Pages 43-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mountford"&gt;Mountford, E,P., Backmeroff, C.E. and Peterken, G.F. 2001. Long-term patterns of growth, mortality, regeneration and natural disturbance in Wistman’s Wood, a high altitude oakwood on Dartmoor. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 133, Pages 231-262.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only have the older oak trees grown from a stunted/semi-prostrate to a more ascending form, but a new generation of mostly straight-grown and single-stemmed oaks has developed. The oldest oaks appear to be 400–500 years old, and originated within a degenerating oakwood that survived in scrub form during two centuries of cold climate.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; In c. 1620 these old trees were described as "no taller than a man may touch to top with his head". Tree height increased somewhat by the mid-19th century, and during the 20th century approximately doubled (in 1997 the maximum and average height of trees was around 12 m and 7 m respectively).&lt;ref name="Mountford"/&gt; In addition, a wave of marginal new oaks arose after c. 1900, roughly doubling the area of wood. Part of the evidence for these changes comes from a permanent vegetation plot located in the southern end of South Wood. This is the oldest known of its kind in British woodland, with a small part having been recorded by Hansford Worth in 1921.&lt;ref name="Christy"&gt;Christy, M. and Worth, R.H. 1922. The ancient dwarfed oak woods of Dartmoor. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 54, Pages 291-342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Buller Stone'', a boulder to the east of the wood, commemorates an attempt in 1866 to date the trees, when Wentworth Buller (with permission from the Duchy) felled an oak. It was estimated to be 168 years old.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

==Myths, art and literature==
The wood has been the inspiration for numerous artists, poets, photographers and appears in hundreds of nineteenth century accounts. One tradition holds that it was planted by [[Isabella de Forz, Countess of Devon|Isabella de Fortibus]] (1237-93).&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; 

The wood is described in detail and discussed as a point of great interest in ''The Tree'', a 1978 essay on naturalism by English novelist [[John Fowles]].

The name of Wistman's Wood may derive from the dialect word 'wisht' meaning 'eerie/uncanny',&lt;ref name="Westwood2"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A Guide to Legendary Britain.'' Pub.

An '''écorché''' ({{IPA-fr|ekɔʁʃe}}) is a figure drawn, painted, or sculpted showing the muscles of the body without skin, normally as a [[figure study]] for another work or as an exercise for a student artist. The [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]]-era [[Renaissance architecture|architect]], theorist and all-around [[Renaissance man]], [[Leon Battista Alberti]], recommended that when painters intend to depict a [[Nude (art)|nude]], they should first arrange the muscles and bones, then depict the overlying skin.&lt;ref name="artlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/E.html Écorché] defined at ArtLex.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the first well known [[Study (art)|studies]] of this kind were performed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who dissected [[cadavers]] and created detailed drawings of them. However, there are some accounts of this same practice taking place as far back as [[ancient Greece]], though the specifics are not known.

==Etymology==
The term ''écorché'', meaning literally "[[Flaying|flayed]]", came into usage via the French Academies (such as the [[École des Beaux Arts]]) in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="artlex" /&gt;

==History==
Although there are some accounts of practices similar to ''écorché'' as far back as [[ancient Greece]], the degree of similarity is unclear.{{cn|date=December 2017}} The term as used today can be applied with the greatest confidence to the [[Renaissance period]] onwards.

===Renaissance===
During the Renaissance in Italy, around the 1450 to 1600, the rebirth of classical Greek and Roman characteristics in art led to the studies of the human anatomy. The practice of dissecting the human body was banned for many centuries due to the belief that body and soul were inseparable. It wasn’t until the election of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] that the practice of dissection was once again allowed for observation.&lt;ref name="lemire m"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemire|first=M|title=Representation of the human body: the colored wax anatomic models of the 18th and 19th centuries in the revival of medical instruction|journal=Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy|date=1 December 1992|volume=14|issue=4|pages=283–291|doi=10.1007/BF01794751|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01794751?LI=true|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginn|first=Sheryl R.|author2=Lorusso, Lorenzo|title=Brain, Mind, and Body: Interactions with Art in Renaissance Italy|journal=Journal of the History of the Neurosciences|date=16 July 2008 |volume=17|issue=3|pages=295–313|doi=10.1080/09647040701575900|pmid=18629698|url=http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/0964704x/v17i0003/295_bmabiwairi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many painters and artists documented and even performed the dissections themselves by taking careful observations of the human body. Among them were [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Andreas Vesalius]], two of the most influential artists in [[anatomical illustrations]].&lt;ref name=specbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Martin Kemp, Marina|title=Spectacular bodies : the art and science of the human body from Leonardo to now|year=2001|publisher=[[Hayward Gallery]]|location=London|isbn=0520227921|pages=22–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo da Vinci, in particular, was very detailed in his studies that he was known as the “artist-anatomist” for the creation of a new science and the creative depiction to [[anatomy]].  Leonardo’s anatomical studies contributed to artistic exploration of the movement of the muscles, joints and bones. His goal was to analyze and understand the instruments behind the postures and gestures in the human body.&lt;ref name=leo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keele|first=Kenneth D.|title=Leonardo Da Vinci's Influence on Renaissance Anatomy|journal=Medical History|date=October 1964|volume=8|issue=4|pages=360–370|doi=10.1017/s0025727300029835|pmid=14230140|pmc=1033412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th – 19th centuries===
The study of anatomical figures became popular among the medical academies across Europe around the 17th and 18th century, especially when there was a lack of bodies available for dissections.&lt;ref name=specbook /&gt;  Medical students relied on these figures because they provided a good representation of what the anatomical model looks like. The ''écorché'' (flayed) figures were made to look like the skin was removed from the body, exposing the muscles and vessels of the model. Some figures were created to strip away the layers of muscles and reveal the skeleton of the model. Many of the life-size scale écorché figures were reproduced in a smaller scale out of bronze that could be easily distributed.&lt;ref name=healthcare&gt;{{cite journal|last=Owen|first=Harry|title=Early Use of Simulation in Medical Education|journal=[[Society for Simulation in Healthcare|Simulation in Healthcare: the Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare]]|date=1 April 2012|volume=7|issue=2|pages=102–116|doi=10.1097/SIH.0b013e3182415a91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Écorché'' figures were commonly made out of many different materials: bronze, ivory, plaster, wax, or wood. By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, wax was the most popular use of material in creating écorché statues. The production of colored wax anatomies allowed for a variety of hues and tone that makes the models appear realistic.&lt;ref name=anatomy&gt;{{cite journal|last=DARLINGTON|first=ANNE|title=The Teaching of Anatomy and the Royal Academy of Arts 1768-1782|journal=Journal of Art &amp; Design Education|date=1 December 1986|volume=5|issue=3|pages=263–271|doi=10.1111/j.1476-8070.1986.tb00207.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
The ''écorché'' form of study still continues at traditional schools throughout the world including the [[New York Academy of Art]], the [[Art Students League of New York]], the [[Grand Central Academy of Art]] in New York City, the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in Philadelphia, and the [[Academy of Art University|Academy of Art University in San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.academyart.edu/content/dam/assets/pdf/arc/handouts/FA-FASCU-JEM.pdf |title = Academy of Art University On Campus Labs |date = |accessdate = 23 November 2016 |website = academyart.edu |publisher = [[Academy of Art University]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
