{{cosmology}}
In modern [[physical cosmology]], the '''cosmological principle''' is the notion that the spatial distribution of matter in the universe is [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] and [[Isotropy|isotropic]] when viewed on a large enough scale, since the forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe, and should, therefore, produce no observable irregularities in the large-scale structuring over the course of evolution of the matter field that was initially laid down by the [[Big Bang]].

==Definition==
Astronomer William Keel explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'Viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for all observers.' This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the same physical laws apply throughout. In essence, this in a sense says that the universe is knowable and is playing fair with scientists.&lt;ref name=Keel&gt;{{cite book |title=The Road to Galaxy Formation (2nd ed.) |author=William C. Keel |isbn=978-3-540-72534-3 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer-Praxis}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cosmological principle depends on a definition of "observer," and contains an implicit qualification and two testable consequences.

"Observers" means any observer at any location in the universe, not simply any human observer at any location on Earth: as Andrew Liddle puts it, "the cosmological principle [means that] the universe looks the same whoever and wherever you are."&lt;ref name=Liddle&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.) |author=Andrew Liddle |isbn=978-0-470-84835-7 |year=2003 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualification is that variation in physical structures can be overlooked, provided this does not imperil the uniformity of conclusions drawn from observation: the Sun is different from the Earth, our galaxy is different from a black hole, some galaxies advance toward rather than recede from us, and the universe has a "foamy" texture of galaxy clusters and voids, but none of these different structures appears to violate the basic laws of physics.

The two testable structural consequences of the cosmological principle are [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]]. Homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe ("the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample"). Isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe ("the same physical laws apply throughout" {{dubious|Homogeneity vs isotropy|date=September 2016}}). The principles are distinct but closely related, because a universe that appears isotropic from any two (for a spherical geometry, three) locations must also be homogeneous.

== Origin ==
The cosmological principle is first clearly asserted in the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) of Isaac Newton.{{dubious|it is debatable that Newton stated the cosmological principle in the form we intend at this day and age.|date=May 2018}} In contrast to earlier classical or medieval cosmologies, in which Earth rested at the center of universe, Newton conceptualized the Earth as a sphere in orbital motion around the Sun within an empty space that extended uniformly in all directions to immeasurably large distances. He then showed, through a series of mathematical proofs on detailed observational data of the motions of planets and comets, that their motions could be explained by a single principle of "[[universal gravitation]]" that applied as well to the orbits of the Galilean moons around Jupiter, the Moon around the Earth, the Earth around the Sun, and to falling bodies on Earth. That is, he asserted the equivalent material nature of all bodies within the Solar System, the identical nature of the Sun and distant stars and thus the uniform extension of the physical laws of motion to a great distance beyond the observational location of Earth itself.

== Implications ==
Observations show that more distant galaxies are closer together and have lower content of chemical elements heavier than lithium.&lt;ref name="CMB_Timeline300"&gt;[[:Image:CMB Timeline75.jpg]] - NASA (public domain image)&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the cosmological principle, this suggests that heavier elements were not created in the Big Bang but were produced by [[nucleosynthesis]] in giant stars and expelled across a series of supernovae explosions and new star formation from the supernovae remnants, which means heavier elements would accumulate over time. Another observation is that the furthest galaxies (earlier time) are often more fragmentary, interacting and unusually shaped than local galaxies (recent time), suggesting evolution in galaxy structure as well.

A related implication of the cosmological principle is that the largest discrete structures in the universe are in [[mechanical equilibrium]]. Homogeneity and isotropy of matter at the largest scales would suggest that the largest discrete structures are parts of a single indiscrete form, like the crumbs which make up the interior of a cake. At extreme cosmological distances, the property of mechanical equilibrium in surfaces lateral to the line of sight can be empirically tested; however, under the assumption of the cosmological principle, it cannot be detected parallel to the line of sight (see [[timeline of the formation of the Universe|timeline of the universe]]).

Cosmologists agree that in accordance with observations of distant galaxies, a universe must be non-static if it follows the cosmological principle. In 1923, [[Alexander Friedmann]] set out a variant of [[Einstein]]'s equations of [[general relativity]] that describe the dynamics of a homogeneous isotropic universe.&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Welt als Raum und Zeit (The World as Space and Time) |publisher=Ostwalds Klassiker der exakten Wissenschaften |author=[[Alexander Friedmann]] |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/248202523&amp;referer=brief_results  |isbn=3-8171-3287-5  |year=1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abramovitch&gt;{{cite book |page=219 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DPC4a0CSq4C&amp;pg=PA219 |isbn=0-521-38470-2 |year=1993 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |title=Alexander A. Friedmann: The Man who Made the Universe Expand |author1=Ėduard Abramovich Tropp |author2=Viktor Ya. Frenkel |author3=Artur Davidovich Chernin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently, [[Georges Lemaître]] derived in 1927 the equations of an expanding universe from the General Relativity equations.&lt;ref name=Lemaitre1927&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Lemaître | first=Georges | author-link=Georges Lemaître | title=Un univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extra-galactiques | year=1927 | journal=Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles | volume=A47 | issue=5 | bibcode=1927ASSB...47...49L | pages=49–56 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }} ''translated by [[A. S. Eddington]]'': {{Cite journal | last=Lemaître | first=Georges | author-link=Georges Lemaître | title=Expansion of the universe, A homogeneous universe of constant mass and increasing radius accounting for the radial velocity of extra-galactic nebulæ | year=1931 | journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume=91 | bibcode=1931MNRAS..91..483L | pages=483–490 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | doi=10.1093/mnras/91.5.483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a non-static universe is also implied, independent of observations of distant galaxies, as the result of applying the cosmological principle to [[general relativity]].

== Criticism ==
[[Karl Popper]] criticized the cosmological principle on the grounds that it makes "our ''lack'' of knowledge a principle of ''knowing something''". He summarized his position as:
:the “cosmological principles” were, I fear, dogmas that should not have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Helge Kragh: [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9062/1/Popper_%26_cosmology_PhilSci.pdf “The most philosophically of all the sciences”: Karl Popper and physical cosmology] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observations ==
Although the universe is inhomogeneous at smaller scales, it ''is'' statistically homogeneous on scales larger than 250 million light years. The [[cosmic microwave background]] is isotropic, that is to say that its intensity is about the same whichever direction we look at.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/universe-homogeneous-300-million-light-years/24149/]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent findings have called this view into question. Data from the [[Planck Mission]] shows hemispheric bias in 2 respects: one with respect to average temperature (i.e. temperature fluctuations), the second with respect to larger variations in the degree of perturbations (i.e. densities). Therefore, the [[European Space Agency]] (the governing body of the Planck Mission) has concluded that these anisotropies are, in fact, statistically significant and can no longer be ignored.&lt;ref name="Planck"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sci.esa.int/planck/51551-simple-but-challenging-the-universe-according-to-planck/ | title=Simple but challenging: the Universe according to Planck | work=[[ESA Science &amp; Technology]] | origyear=March 21, 2013 |date= October 5, 2016 | accessdate=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inconsistencies===
The ''cosmological principle'' implies that at a sufficiently large scale, the universe is [[homogeneous]]. This means that different places will appear similar to one another, so sufficiently large structures cannot exist{{clarify|what is actually meant by existence of a structure here?|date=April 2017}}. Yadav and his colleagues have suggested a maximum scale of 260[[Parsec#Megaparsecs and gigaparsecs|/h Mpc]] for structures within the universe according to this{{which|date=April 2017}} [[heuristic]]. Other authors have suggested values as low as 60/h Mpc.&lt;ref name=Yadav&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yadav|first=Jaswant |author2=J. S. Bagla |author3=Nishikanta Khandai|title=Fractal dimension as a measure of the scale of homogeneity|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=25 February 2010|volume=405|issue=3|pages=2009–2015|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16612.x |arxiv = 1001.0617 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2009Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yadav's calculation suggests that the maximum size of a structure can be about 370&amp;nbsp;Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clowers |first=Roger G. |year=2013 |title=A structure in the early universe at z ~ 1.3 that exceeds the homogeneity scale of the R-W concordance cosmology |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=429 |issue=4 |pages=2910–2916|arxiv=1211.6256 |bibcode=2013MNRAS.429.2910C |doi= 10.1093/mnras/sts497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of observations conflict with predictions of maximal structure sizes:

*The [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], discovered in 1991, has a length of 580 Mpc, and is marginally larger than the consistent scale.
*The [[Sloan Great Wall]], discovered in 2003, has a length of 423 Mpc,&lt;ref name=apj624_2_463&gt;{{Cite journal | display-authors=1 | last1=Gott | first1=J. Richard, III | last2=Jurić | first2=Mario | last3=Schlegel| first3=David | last4=Hoyle | first4=Fiona | last5=Vogeley | first5=Michael | last6=Tegmark | first6=Max | last7=Bahcall | first7=Neta |last8=Brinkmann | first8=Jon | title=A Map of the Universe | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=624 | issue=2 | pages=463–484 |date=May 2005 | doi=10.1086/428890 | bibcode=2005ApJ...624..463G |arxiv = astro-ph/0310571}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is only just consistent with the cosmological principle.
*[[U1.11]], a [[large quasar group]] discovered in 2011, has a length of 780 Mpc, and is two times larger than the upper limit of the homogeneity scale.
*The [[Huge-LQG]], discovered in 2012, is three times longer than, and twice as wide as is predicted possible according to these current models, and so challenges our understanding of the universe on large scales.
*In November 2013, a new structure 10 billion light years away measuring 2000-3000 Mpc (more than seven times that of the SGW) has been discovered, the [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]], putting further doubt on the validity of the cosmological principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1311.1104|last1= Horvath|first1= I.|title= The largest structure of the Universe, defined by Gamma-Ray Bursts|last2=  Hakkila|first2= J.|last3=  Bagoly|first3= Z.|class= astro-ph.CO|year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, however, studies of the expansion of the Universe that have used data taken by the ''[[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]'' mission show it to be highly [[isotropy|isotropical]], reinforcing the cosmological principle&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07178 How isotropic is the Universe?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfect cosmological principle==
The '''perfect cosmological principle''' is an extension of the cosmological principle, and states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in space ''and'' time. In this view the universe looks the same everywhere (on the large scale), the same as it always has and always will. The perfect cosmological principle underpins [[Steady State theory]] and emerges{{clarify|underpins emerging? does this mean underpins the emergence of something (unstated) from chaotic inflation theory?|date=April 2017}} from [[chaotic inflation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Aguirre, Anthony|author2=Gratton, Steven|last-author-amp=yes|title=Inflation without a beginning: A null boundary proposal|journal= Phys.

[[Image:Alembert.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean d'Alembert]] (1717—1783)]]
'''D'Alembert's principle''', also known as the '''Lagrange–d'Alembert principle''', is a statement of the fundamental [[classical physics|classical]] laws of motion. It is named after its discoverer, the [[France|French]] [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].  It is the dynamic analogue to the ''principle of [[virtual work]] for applied forces'' in a static system and in fact is  more general than [[Hamilton's principle]], avoiding restriction to [[holonomic system]]s.&lt;ref name=Lanczos&gt;{{cite book |last=Lanczos |first=Cornelius |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |edition=4th |year=1970 |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22d%27Alembert%27s+principle%22 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; A holonomic constraint depends only on the coordinates and time. It does not depend on the velocities. If the negative terms in accelerations are recognized as ''[[inertial force]]s'', the statement of d'Alembert's principle becomes ''The total virtual work of the impressed forces plus the inertial forces vanishes for reversible displacements''.&lt;ref name=Lanczos2&gt;{{cite book |title=p. 90 |author=Cornelius Lanczos   |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |year=1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22d%27Alembert%27s+principle%22#PPA90,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principle does not apply for irreversible displacements, such as sliding [[friction]], and more general specification of the irreversibility is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Udwadia | first1 = F. E. | last2 = Kalaba | first2 = R. E. | title = On the Foundations of Analytical Dynamics | journal = Intl. Journ. Nonlinear Mechanics | volume = 37 | issue = 6 | pages = 1079–1090 | date = 2002 | url = http://ae-www.usc.edu/bio/udwadia/papers/On_foundation_of_analytical_dynamics.pdf | doi = 10.1016/S0020-7462(01)00033-6 | bibcode = 2002IJNLM..37.1079U | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100613031338/http://ae-www.usc.edu/bio/udwadia/papers/On_foundation_of_analytical_dynamics.pdf | archivedate = 2010-06-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle states that the sum of the differences between the [[force]]s acting on a system of mass particles and the time [[derivative]]s of the [[momentum|momenta]] of the system itself projected onto any [[virtual displacement]] consistent with the constraints of the system is zero. Thus, in symbols d'Alembert's principle is written as following,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i )\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where :

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; || is an integer used to indicate (via subscript) a variable corresponding to a particular particle in the system,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the total applied force (excluding constraint forces) on the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt; m_i \scriptstyle&lt;/math&gt; || is the mass of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the acceleration of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;m_i \mathbf a_i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; || together as product represents the time derivative of the momentum of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle if the masses do not change with time, and
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf r_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the virtual displacement of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle, consistent with the constraints.
|}

This above equation is often called d'Alembert's principle, but it was first written in this variational form by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1956), ''Mechanics:  Lectures on Theoretical Physics'', Vol 1, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  D'Alembert's contribution was to demonstrate that in the totality of a dynamic system the forces of constraint vanish.  That is to say that the [[generalized forces]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf Q}_{j}&lt;/math&gt; need not include constraint forces.  It is equivalent to the somewhat more cumbersome [[Gauss's principle of least constraint]].

==General case with changing masses==
The general statement of d'Alembert's principle mentions "the time [[derivative]]s of the [[momentum|momenta]] of the system". The momentum of the ''i''-th mass is the product of its mass and velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_i = m_i \mathbf v_i&lt;/math&gt;

and its time derivative is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{p}_i} = \dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i + m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In many applications, the masses are constant and this equation reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{p}_i} = m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i = m_i \mathbf{a}_i&lt;/math&gt;,

which appears in the formula given above. However, some applications involve changing masses (for example, chains being rolled up or being unrolled) and in those cases both terms &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i&lt;/math&gt; have to remain present, giving

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i - \dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i)\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation for special cases==
To date, nobody has shown that D'Alembert's principle is equivalent to [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's Second Law]]. D'Alembert's principle is a more general case .  And it is true only for some very special cases e.g. rigid body constraints.  However, an approximate solution to this problem does exist.&lt;ref name="Rebhan2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rebhan |first=Eckhard |title=Mechanik |series=Theoretische Physik |year=2006 |publisher=Spektrum Akademischer Verlag |location=Heidelberg, Germany  |isbn=978-3-8274-1716-9 |chapter=Exkurs 5.1: Ableitung des d'Alembert Prinzips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider Newton's law for a system of particles, i. The total force on each particle is&lt;ref name="Torby1984"&gt;{{cite book |last=Torby |first=Bruce |title=Advanced Dynamics for Engineers |series=HRW Series in Mechanical Engineering |year=1984 |publisher=CBS College Publishing |location=United States of America  |isbn=0-03-063366-4 |chapter=Energy Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} = m_i \mathbf {a}_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)}&lt;/math&gt; || are the total forces acting on the system's particles,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;m_i \mathbf {a}_i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; || are the inertial forces that result from the total forces.
|}

Moving the inertial forces to the left gives an expression that can be considered to represent quasi-static equilibrium, but which is really just a small algebraic manipulation of Newton's law:&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} - m_i \mathbf {a}_i = \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Considering the [[virtual work]], &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt;, done by the total and inertial forces together through an arbitrary virtual displacement, &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf r_i&lt;/math&gt;, of the system leads to a zero identity, since the forces involved sum to zero for each particle.&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} \mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i - \sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The original vector equation could be recovered by recognizing that the work expression must hold for arbitrary displacements. Separating the total forces into applied forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_i&lt;/math&gt;, and constraint forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf C_i&lt;/math&gt;, yields&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} \mathbf {F}_{i} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i + \sum_{i} \mathbf {C}_{i} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i - \sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If arbitrary virtual displacements are assumed to be in directions that are orthogonal to the constraint forces (which is not usually the case, so this derivation works only for special cases), the constraint forces do no work. Such displacements are said to be ''consistent'' with the constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|title = Teaching Students Work and Virtual Work Method in Statics:A Guiding Strategy with Illustrative Examples|first = Ing-Chang|last = Jong|conference = 2005 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference &amp; Exposition|year = 2005|url = http://search.asee.org/search/fetch?url=file%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2FE%3A%2Fsearch%2Fconference%2F29%2FAC%25202005Paper1212.pdf&amp;index=conference_papers&amp;space=129746797203605791716676178&amp;type=application%2Fpdf&amp;charset=|accessdate = June 24, 2014|section = Improving Mechanics of Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the formulation of ''d'Alembert's principle'', which states that the difference of applied forces and inertial forces for a dynamic system does no virtual work:.&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i )\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

There is also a corresponding principle for static systems called the [[virtual work#Principle of virtual work for applied forces|principle of virtual work for applied forces]].

==D'Alembert's principle of inertial forces==
D'Alembert showed that one can transform an accelerating rigid body into an equivalent static system by adding the so-called "[[inertial force]]"  and "[[inertial torque]]" or moment. The inertial force must act through the center of mass and the inertial torque can act anywhere. The system can then be analyzed exactly as a static system subjected to this "inertial force and moment" and the external forces. The advantage is that, in the equivalent static system one can take moments about any point (not just the center of mass). This often leads to simpler calculations because any force (in turn) can be eliminated from the moment equations by choosing the appropriate point about which to apply the moment equation (sum of moments = zero). Even in the course of Fundamentals of Dynamics and Kinematics of machines, this principle helps in analyzing the forces that act on a link of a mechanism when it is in motion. In textbooks of engineering dynamics this is sometimes referred to as ''d'Alembert's principle''.

===Example for 1D motion of a rigid body===
[[File:Dalembert example.JPG|thumb|280x280px|Free body diagram of a wire pulling on a mass with weight W, showing the d’Alembert inertia “force” ma.
]]
To illustrate the concept of ''d'Alembert's principle'', let's use a simple model with a weight''' '''&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, suspended from a wire. The weight is subjected to a gravitational force, &lt;math&gt;W=mg&lt;/math&gt;, and a tension force &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;''' '''in the wire. The mass accelerates upward with an acceleration &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's Second Law]] becomes &lt;math&gt;T-W=ma&lt;/math&gt;''''' '''''or &lt;math&gt;T=W+ma&lt;/math&gt;. As an observer with feet planted firmly on the ground, we see that the force &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; accelerates the weight, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, but, if we are moving with the wire we don’t see the acceleration, we feel it. The tension in the wire seems to counteract an acceleration “force” &lt;math&gt;ma&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(W/g)a&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:Rigid Body in Free Fall with Angular Velocity.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Free body diagram depicting an inertia moment and an inertia force on a rigid body in free fall with an angular velocity.]]

===Example for plane 2D motion of a rigid body===
For a planar rigid body, moving in the plane of the body (the ''x''–''y'' plane), and subjected to forces and torques causing rotation only in this plane, the inertial force is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_i = - m\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_c&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of the centre of mass of the body, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the body. The inertial torque (or moment) is

:&lt;math&gt;T_i = -I\ddot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body. If, in addition to the external forces and torques acting on the body, the inertia force acting through the center of mass is added and the inertial torque is added (acting around the centre of mass is as good as anywhere) the system is equivalent to one in static equilibrium. Thus the equations of static equilibrium

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum F_x &amp;= 0,
  \\
  \sum F_y &amp;= 0,
  \\
  \sum T &amp;= 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

hold. The important thing is that &lt;math&gt;\sum T&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of torques (or moments, including the inertial moment and the moment of the inertial force) taken about ''any'' point. The direct application of Newton's laws requires that the angular acceleration equation be applied ''only'' about the center of mass.

===Dynamic equilibrium===
D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work states that a system of rigid bodies is in dynamic equilibrium when the virtual work of the sum of the applied forces and the inertial forces is zero for any virtual displacement of the system.  Thus, dynamic equilibrium of a system of n rigid bodies with m generalized coordinates requires that is to be
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = (Q_1 + Q^*_1)\delta q_1 + \ldots + (Q_m + Q^*_m)\delta q_m = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
for any set of virtual displacements δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.  This condition yields m equations,
:&lt;math&gt; Q_j + Q^*_j = 0, \quad j=1, \ldots, m,&lt;/math&gt;
which can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_j} -\frac{\partial T}{\partial q_j} = Q_j, \quad j=1,\ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt;
The result is a set of m equations of motion that define the dynamics of the rigid body system.

'''Distinction''', the fundamental philosophical [[abstraction]], involves the recognition of difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sokolowski|first=Robert|date=1998-01-01|title=The Method of Philosophy: Making Distinctions|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SOKTMO|journal=Review of Metaphysics|volume=51|issue=3|pages=515–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical philosophy, there were various ways in which things could be distinguished. The merely logical or virtual distinction, such as the difference between concavity and convexity, involves the mental apprehension of two definitions, but which cannot be realized outside the mind, as any concave line would be a convex line considered from another perspective. A real distinction involves a level of [[Ontology|ontological]] separation, as when squirrels are distinguished from llamas (for no squirrel is a llama, and no llama is a squirrel).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmhCGt9hKC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=copleston+history+of+philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKq8HBtozTAhUIRCYKHecUDC8Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=formal%20distinction&amp;f=false|title=History of Philosophy Volume 2: Medieval Philosophy|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|date=2003-06-12|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780826468963|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A real distinction is thus different than a merely conceptual one, in that in a real distinction, one of the terms can be realized in reality without the other being realized.

Later developments include [[Duns Scotus|Duns Scotus's]] [[formal distinction]], which developed in part out of the recognition in previous authors that there need to be an intermediary between logical and real distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wengert|first=R. G.|last2=Institute|first2=The Hegeler|date=1965-11-01|title=The Development of the Doctrine of the Formal Distinction in the Lectura Prima of John Duns Scotus|url=https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=monist&amp;id=monist_1965_0049_0004_0571_0587&amp;onlyautologin=true|journal=Monist|volume=49|issue=4|pages=571–587|doi=10.5840/monist196549435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some relevant distinctions to the history of Western philosophy include:
* [[Contingency (philosophy)|Necessity and Contingency]]
* [[Inductive reasoning|Inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|Deductive]]

== Distinctions in Contemporary Thought ==

=== [[Analytic–synthetic distinction]] ===
While the there are anticipation of this distinction prior to Kant in the British [[Empiricism|Empiricists]] (and even further in [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thought), it was Kant who introduced the terminology. The distinction concerns the relation of a subject to its predicate: analytic claims are those in which the subject contains the predicate, as in "All bodies are extended." Synthetic claims bring two concepts together, as in "All events are caused." The distinction was recently called into question by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], in his paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]."

=== [[A priori and a posteriori|''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'']] ===
The origins of the distinction are less clear, and it concerns the origins of [[knowledge]]. ''A posteriori'' knowledge arises from, or is caused by, experience. ''A priori'' knowledge may come temporally after experience, but its certainty is not derivable from the experience itself. [[Saul Kripke]] was the first major think to propose that there are analytic ''a posteriori'' knowledge claims.

== Notable Distinctions in Historical Authors ==

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] makes the distinction between [[Potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Cohen|first=S. Marc|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actuality is a realization of the way a thing could be, while potency refers simply to the way a thing could be. There are two levels to each: matter itself can be anything, and becomes something actually by [[Four causes|causes]], making it something which then has the ability to be in a certain way, and that ability can then be realized. The matter of an ax can be an ax, then is made into an ax. The ax thereby is able to cut, and reaches a new form of actuality in actually cutting.

=== Aquinas ===
The major distinction [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] makes is that of [[essence]] and [[existence]]. It is a distinction already in [[Avicenna]], but Aquinas maps the distinction onto the actuality/potentiality distinction of Aristotle, such that the essence of a thing is in potency to the existence of a thing, which is that thing's actuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aq-meta/#H2|title=Aquinas: Metaphysics {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the distinction between appearance and thing-in-itself is foundational to his entire philosophical project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colin|first=Marshall,|title=Kant’s One Self and the Appearance/Thing-in-itself Distinction|url=https://www.academia.edu/2573493/Kants_one_self_and_the_appearance_thing-in-itself_distinction|journal=Kant-Studien|language=en|volume=104|issn=0022-8877}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction separates the way a thing appears to us on the one hand, and the way a thing really is.

--&gt;{{General relativity sidebar |fundamentals}}

In the [[theory]] of [[general relativity]], the '''equivalence principle''' is the equivalence of [[Gravitational mass|gravitational]] and [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]], and [[Albert Einstein's]] observation that the gravitational "force" as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the ''[[fictitious force|pseudo-force]]'' experienced by an observer in a non-[[inertial frame of reference|inertial]] (accelerated) [[frame of reference]].

== Einstein's statement of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass ==
{{Quotation|
A little reflection will show that the law of the equality of the inertial and gravitational mass is equivalent to the assertion that the acceleration imparted to a body by a gravitational field is independent of the nature of the body. For Newton's equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out in full, it is:
:(Inertial mass) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Acceleration) &lt;math&gt; = &lt;/math&gt; (Intensity of the gravitational field) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Gravitational mass).
It is only when there is numerical equality between the inertial and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of the nature of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert, ''How I Constructed the Theory of Relativity'', translated by Masahiro Morikawa from the text recorded in Japanese by Jun Ishiwara, Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPPS) Bulletin, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 17–19, April 2005. Einstein recalls events of 1907 in a talk in Japan on 14 December 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=The Meaning of Relativity|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134449798|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== Development of gravitation theory ==
[[File:Apollo 15 feather and hammer drop.ogv|right|thumb|During the [[Apollo 15]] mission in 1971, astronaut [[David Scott]] showed that Galileo was right: acceleration is the same for all bodies subject to gravity on the Moon, even for a hammer and a feather.]]Something like the equivalence principle emerged in the early 17th century, when [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] expressed [[experiment]]ally that the [[acceleration]] of a [[test mass]] due to [[gravitation]] is independent of the amount of [[mass]] being accelerated.

Kepler, using Galileo's discoveries, showed knowledge of the equivalence principle by accurately describing what would occur if the moon were stopped in its orbit and dropped towards Earth. This can be deduced without knowing if or in what manner gravity decreases with distance, but requires assuming the equivalency between gravity and inertia.

{{quote|If two stones were placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the sphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two magnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, each approaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of the other. If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by their animal force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would there meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same density.|Kepler, "Astronomia Nova", 1609&lt;ref&gt;http://quotes.yourdictionary.com/orbits/quote/71225/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The 1/54 ratio is [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s estimate of the Moon–Earth mass ratio, based on their diameters. The accuracy of his statement can be deduced by using [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s inertia law F=ma and Galileo's gravitational observation that distance &lt;math&gt;D = (1/2)at^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Setting these accelerations equal for a mass is the equivalence principle. Noting the time to collision for each mass is the same gives Kepler's statement that D&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;=M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;, without knowing the time to collision or how or if the acceleration force from gravity is a function of distance.

Newton's [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational theory]] simplified and formalized [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s and Kepler's ideas by recognizing Kepler's "animal force or some other equivalent" beyond gravity and inertia were not needed, deducing from Kepler's planetary laws how gravity reduces with distance.

The equivalence principle was properly introduced by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1907, when he observed that the acceleration of bodies towards the center of the Earth at a rate of 1''[[g-force|''g'']]'' (''g'' = 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being a standard reference of gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface) is equivalent to the acceleration of an inertially moving body that would be observed on a rocket in free space being accelerated at a rate of 1''g''. Einstein stated it thus:

{{quote|we [...] assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and a corresponding [[accelerated reference frame|acceleration of the reference system]].|Einstein, 1907}}

That is, being on the surface of the Earth is equivalent to being inside a spaceship (far from any sources of gravity) that is being accelerated by its engines. The direction or vector of acceleration equivalence on the surface of the earth is "up" or directly opposite the center of the planet while the vector of acceleration in a spaceship is directly opposite from the mass ejected by its thrusters. From this principle, Einstein deduced that [[free-fall]] is [[inertial frame|inertial motion]]. Objects in free-fall do not experience being accelerated downward (e.g. toward the earth or other massive body) but rather weightlessness and no acceleration. In an [[inertial frame of reference]] bodies (and photons, or light) obey [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|Newton's first law]], moving at constant velocity in straight lines. Analogously, in a curved [[spacetime]] the [[world line]] of an inertial particle or pulse of light is ''as straight as possible'' (in space ''and'' time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/EGR.pdf |page=32 |title=General Relativity in a Nutshell |first=Alan |last=Macdonald |date=September 15, 2012 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 |publisher=[[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a world line is called a [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]] and from the point of view of the inertial frame is a straight line. This is why an [[accelerometer]] in free-fall doesn't register any acceleration; there isn't any.

As an example: an inertial body moving along a geodesic through space can be trapped into an orbit around a large gravitational mass without ever experiencing acceleration. This is possible because spacetime is radically curved in close vicinity to a large gravitational mass. In such a situation the [[geodesic]] lines bend inward around the center of the mass and a free-floating (weightless) inertial body will simply follow those curved geodesics into an elliptical orbit. An accelerometer on-board would never record any acceleration.

By contrast, in [[Newtonian mechanics]], [[gravity]] is assumed to be a [[force]]. This force draws objects having mass towards the center of any massive body. At the Earth's surface, the force of gravity is counteracted by the mechanical (physical) resistance of the Earth's surface. So in Newtonian physics, a person at rest on the surface of a (non-rotating) massive object is in an inertial frame of reference. These considerations suggest the following corollary to the equivalence principle, which Einstein formulated precisely in 1911:

{{quote|Whenever an observer detects the local presence of a force that acts on all objects in direct proportion to the inertial mass of each object, that observer is in an accelerated frame of reference.}}

Einstein also referred to two reference frames, K and K'. K is a uniform gravitational field, whereas K' has no gravitational field but is [[uniform acceleration|uniformly accelerated]] such that objects in the two frames experience identical forces:

{{quote|We arrive at a very satisfactory interpretation of this law of experience, if we assume that the systems K and K' are physically exactly equivalent, that is, if we assume that we may just as well regard the system K as being in a space free from gravitational fields, if we then regard K as uniformly accelerated. This assumption of exact physical equivalence makes it impossible for us to speak of the absolute acceleration of the system of reference, just as the usual theory of relativity forbids us to talk of the absolute velocity of a system; and it makes the equal falling of all bodies in a gravitational field seem a matter of course.|Einstein, 1911}}

This observation was the start of a process that culminated in [[general relativity]]. Einstein suggested that it should be elevated to the status of a general principle, which he called the "principle of equivalence" when constructing his theory of relativity:

{{quote|As long as we restrict ourselves to purely mechanical processes in the realm where Newton's mechanics holds sway, we are certain of the equivalence of the systems K and K'. But this view of ours will not have any deeper significance unless the systems K and K' are equivalent with respect to all physical processes, that is, unless the laws of nature with respect to K are in entire agreement with those with respect to K'. By assuming this to be so, we arrive at a principle which, if it is really true, has great heuristic importance. For by theoretical consideration of processes which take place relatively to a system of reference with uniform acceleration, we obtain information as to the career of processes in a homogeneous gravitational field.|Einstein, 1911}}

Einstein combined ([[postulate]]d) the equivalence principle with [[special relativity]] to predict that clocks run at different rates in a [[gravitational potential]], and light rays [[bending of starlight|bend]] in a gravitational field, even before he developed the concept of curved spacetime.

So the original equivalence principle, as described by Einstein, concluded that free-fall and inertial motion were physically equivalent. This form of the equivalence principle can be stated as follows. An observer in a windowless room cannot distinguish between being on the surface of the Earth, and being in a spaceship in deep space accelerating at 1g. This is not strictly true, because massive bodies give rise to [[tidal force|tidal effects]] (caused by variations in the strength and direction of the gravitational field) which are absent from an accelerating spaceship in deep space. The room, therefore, should be small enough that tidal effects can be neglected.

Although the equivalence principle guided the development of [[general relativity]], it is not a founding principle of relativity but rather a simple consequence of the ''geometrical'' nature of the theory. In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]]s of spacetime, and what we perceive as the force of [[gravity]] is instead a result of our being unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the mechanical resistance of matter prevents us from doing so.

Since Einstein developed general relativity, there was a need to develop a framework to test the theory against other possible theories of gravity compatible with [[special relativity]]. This was developed by [[Robert H. Dicke|Robert Dicke]] as part of his program to test general relativity. Two new principles were suggested, the so-called Einstein equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle, each of which assumes the weak equivalence principle as a starting point. They only differ in whether or not they apply to gravitational experiments.

Another clarification needed is that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means there is a constant force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.

==Modern usage==
Three forms of the equivalence principle are in current use: weak (Galilean), Einsteinian, and strong.

===The weak equivalence principle===
&lt;!-- Universality of free fall and weak equivalence principle redirect to this subsection.  Please do not change its title without making sure the redirects work properly. --&gt;
The '''weak equivalence principle''', also known as the '''universality of free fall''' or the '''Galilean equivalence principle''' can be stated in many ways.  The strong EP includes (astronomic) bodies with gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Todd A.; Schlamminger, Stephan; Gundlach, Jens H.; Adelberger, Eric G.; "Torsion-balance tests of the weak equivalence principle", ''Classical and Quantum Gravity'' 29, 184002 (2012); https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2442&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., 1.74 solar-mass pulsar PSR J1903+0327, 15.3% of whose separated mass is absent as gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Champion, David J.; Ransom, Scott M.; Lazarus, Patrick; Camilo, Fernando; et al.; ''Science'' 320(5881), 1309 (2008), https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2396&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2018}}).  The weak EP assumes falling bodies are bound by non-gravitational forces only. Either way:

:The trajectory of a point mass in a gravitational field depends only on its initial position and velocity, and is independent of its composition and ''structure''.

:All test particles at the alike spacetime point, in a given gravitational field, will undergo the same acceleration, independent of their properties, including their rest mass.&lt;ref name="Wesson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Five-dimensional Physics |first=Paul S. |last=Wesson |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSv8ksxHR0oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Five+intitle:Dimensional+intitle:Physics |isbn=978-981-256-661-4 |publisher=World Scientific |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:All local centers of mass free-fall (in vacuum) along identical (parallel-displaced, same speed) minimum action trajectories independent of all observable properties.

:The vacuum world-line of a body immersed in a gravitational field is independent of all observable properties.

:The local effects of motion in a curved spacetime (gravitation) are indistinguishable from those of an accelerated observer in flat spacetime, without exception.

:Mass (measured with a balance) and weight (measured with a scale) are locally in identical ratio for all bodies (the opening page to Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', 1687).

'''Locality''' eliminates measurable tidal forces originating from a radial divergent gravitational field (e.g., the Earth) upon finite sized physical bodies.  The "falling" equivalence principle embraces Galileo's, Newton's, and Einstein's conceptualization.  The equivalence principle does not deny the existence of measurable effects caused by a ''rotating'' gravitating mass ([[frame dragging]]), or bear on the measurements of [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|light deflection and gravitational time delay]] made by non-local observers.

==== Active, passive, and inertial masses ====

By definition of active and passive gravitational mass, the force on &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; due to the gravitational field of &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise the force on a second object of arbitrary mass&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to the gravitational field of mass&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_2 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition of inertial mass:

::&lt;math&gt;F = m^\mathrm{inert} a&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; are the same distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; then, by the weak equivalence principle, they fall at the same rate (i.e. their accelerations are the same)

::&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{F_1}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = a_2 = \frac{F_2}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to inertial mass for all objects.

Furthermore, by [[Newton's third law of motion]]:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
must be equal and opposite to

::&lt;math&gt;F_0 = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}  M_0^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}}{M_0^\mathrm{pass}} = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}}{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to active gravitational mass for all objects.

The dimensionless Eötvös-parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of the ratios of gravitational and inertial masses divided by their average for the two sets of test masses "A" and "B."

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)=2\frac{ \left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A-\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B }{\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A+\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- I have created [[User talk:Lemmiwinks2#Redundant edits (active, passive, and inertial masses)|a list of known places where the above material appears]]. --&gt;

====Tests of the weak equivalence principle====

Tests of the weak equivalence principle are those that verify the equivalence of gravitational mass and inertial mass. An obvious test is dropping different objects, ideally in a vacuum environment, e.g., inside the [[Fallturm Bremen]] drop tower.

With the first successful production of antimatter, in particular anti-hydrogen, a new approach to test the weak equivalence principle has been proposed. Experiments to compare the gravitational behavior of matter and antimatter are currently being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing the Weak Equivalence Principle with an antimatter beam at CERN|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|date=2015|volume=631|issue=1|page=012047|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/631/i=1/a=012047|bibcode = 2015JPhCS.631a2047K |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/631/1/012047 |last1=Kimura|first1=M.|last2=Aghion|first2=S.|last3=Amsler|first3=C.|last4=Ariga|first4=A.|last5=Ariga|first5=T.|last6=Belov|first6=A.|last7=Bonomi|first7=G.|last8=Bräunig|first8=P.|last9=Bremer|first9=J.|last10=Brusa|first10=R.

Proposals that may lead to a [[quantum gravity|quantum theory of gravity]] such as [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]] predict violations of the weak equivalence principle because they contain many light [[scalar field]]s with long [[Compton wavelength]]s, which should generate [[fifth force]]s and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these equivalence principle violations could be in the 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; range.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009" /&gt; Currently envisioned tests of the weak equivalence principle are approaching a degree of sensitivity such that ''non-discovery'' of a violation would be just as profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of equivalence principle violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major guidepost towards unification.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Overduin | first1 = James | last2 = Everitt | first2 = Francis | last3 = Mester | first3 = John | last4 = Worden | first4 = Paul | title = The Science Case for STEP | doi = 10.1016/j.asr.2009.02.012 | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1532–1537 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0902.2247 |bibcode = 2009AdSpR..43.1532O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Einstein equivalence principle===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gravitational field]] --&gt;
What is now called the "Einstein equivalence principle" states that the weak equivalence principle holds, and that:&lt;ref name="Lāmmerzahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haugen |first=Mark P. |first2=Claus |last2=Lämmerzahl |title=Principles of Equivalence: Their Role in Gravitation Physics and Experiments that Test Them |journal=Gyros |volume=562 |pages=195–212 |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-540-41236-6 |arxiv=gr-qc/0103067|bibcode=2001LNP...562..195H |doi=10.1007/3-540-40988-2_10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
Here "local" has a very special meaning: not only must the experiment not look outside the laboratory, but it must also be small compared to variations in the gravitational field, [[tidal forces]], so that the entire laboratory is freely falling. It also implies the absence of interactions with "external" fields ''other than the gravitational field''.{{Citation needed|reason = Definition of "local" in this context. In particular its relation to external fields as stated is dubious. If there are external fields than the equivalence principle doesn't trigger due to the "in a freely falling"-part in the statement. If *no external fields* would be part of the definition of "local", then "free falling" would be redundant.|date=August 2011}}

The [[principle of relativity]] implies that the outcome of local experiments must be independent of the velocity of the apparatus, so the most important consequence of this principle is the Copernican idea that [[dimensionless]] physical values such as the [[fine-structure constant]] and [[electron]]-to-[[proton]] mass ratio must not depend on where in space or time we measure them.  Many physicists believe that any [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] theory that satisfies the weak equivalence principle also satisfies the Einstein equivalence principle.

''[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture'' suggests that the weak equivalence principle implies the Einstein equivalence principle, but it has not been proven. Nonetheless, the two principles are tested with very different kinds of experiments. The Einstein equivalence principle has been criticized as imprecise, because there is no universally accepted way to distinguish gravitational from non-gravitational experiments (see for instance Hadley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Hadley |doi=10.1007/BF02764119 |journal=Foundations of Physics Letters |volume=10 |issue=1 |title=The Logic of Quantum Mechanics Derived from Classical General Relativity |pages=43–60 |year=1997 |arxiv=quant-ph/9706018|bibcode = 1997FoPhL..10...43H |citeseerx=10.1.1.252.6335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Durand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Durand | first1 = Stéphane | year = 2002| title = An amusing analogy: modelling quantum-type behaviours with wormhole-based time travel | url = http://stacks.iop.org/ob/4/S351 | journal = Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = S351–S357| doi = 10.1088/1464-4266/4/4/319 | bibcode = 2002JOptB...4S.351D }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle====
In addition to the tests of the weak equivalence principle, the Einstein equivalence principle can be tested by searching for variation of [[dimensionless]] [[fundamental physical constants|constants and mass ratios]]. The present best limits on the variation of the fundamental constants have mainly been set by studying the naturally occurring [[Oklo]] [[natural nuclear fission reactor]], where nuclear reactions similar to ones we observe today have been shown to have occurred underground approximately two billion years ago. These reactions are extremely sensitive to the values of the fundamental constants.

There have been a number of controversial attempts to constrain the variation of the [[strong interaction]] constant. There have been several suggestions that "constants" do vary on cosmological scales. The best known is the reported detection of variation (at the 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; level) of the fine-structure constant from measurements of distant [[quasar]]s, see Webb et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Michael T. |last2=Murphy |first3=Victor V. |last3=Flambaum |first4=Vladimir A. |last4=Dzuba |first5=John D. |last5=Barrow |first6=Chris W. |last6=Churchill |first7=Jason X. |last7=Prochaska |first8=Arthur M. |last8=Wolfe |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.091301 |journal=Physical Review Letters |title=Further Evidence for Cosmological Evolution of the Fine Structure Constant |volume=87 |issue=9 |year=2001 |arxiv=astro-ph/0012539 |pmid=11531558 |bibcode=2001PhRvL..87i1301W |pages=091301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers{{who|date=November 2018}} dispute these findings. Other tests of the Einstein equivalence principle are [[gravitational redshift]] experiments, such as the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]] which test the position independence of experiments.

===The strong equivalence principle===
The strong equivalence principle suggests the laws of gravitation are independent of velocity and location. In particular,
:''The gravitational motion of a small test body depends only on its initial position in spacetime and velocity, and not on its constitution.''
and
: ''The outcome of any local experiment (gravitational or not) in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
The first part is a version of the weak equivalence principle that applies to objects that exert a gravitational force on themselves, such as stars, planets, black holes or [[Cavendish experiment]]s. The second part is the Einstein equivalence principle (with the same definition of "local"), restated to allow gravitational experiments and self-gravitating bodies. The freely-falling object or laboratory, however, must still be small, so that tidal forces may be neglected (hence "local experiment").

This is the only form of the equivalence principle that applies to self-gravitating objects (such as stars), which have substantial internal gravitational interactions. It requires that the [[gravitational constant]] be the same everywhere in the universe and is incompatible with a [[fifth force]]. It is much more restrictive than the Einstein equivalence principle.

The strong equivalence principle suggests that gravity is entirely geometrical by nature (that is, the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] alone determines the effect of gravity) and does not have any extra fields associated with it. If an observer measures a patch of space to be flat, then the strong equivalence principle suggests that it is absolutely equivalent to any other patch of flat space elsewhere in the universe. Einstein's theory of general relativity (including the [[cosmological constant]]) is thought to be the only theory of gravity that satisfies the strong equivalence principle. A number of alternative theories, such as [[Brans–Dicke theory]], satisfy only the Einstein equivalence principle.

====Tests of the strong equivalence principle====
The strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for a variation of Newton's gravitational constant ''G'' over the life of the universe, or equivalently, variation in the masses of the fundamental particles. A number of independent constraints, from orbits in the solar system and studies of [[big bang nucleosynthesis]] have shown that ''G'' cannot have varied by more than 10%.

Thus, the strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for [[fifth force]]s (deviations from the gravitational force-law predicted by general relativity). These experiments typically look for failures of the [[inverse-square law]] (specifically [[Yukawa potential|Yukawa forces]] or failures of [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]]) behavior of gravity in the laboratory. The most accurate tests over short distances have been performed by the Eöt–Wash group. A future satellite experiment, SEE (Satellite Energy Exchange), will search for fifth forces in space and should be able to further constrain violations of the strong equivalence principle. Other limits, looking for much longer-range forces, have been placed by searching for the [[Nordtvedt effect]], a "polarization" of solar system orbits that would be caused by gravitational self-energy accelerating at a different rate from normal matter. This effect has been sensitively tested by the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]]. Other tests include studying the deflection of radiation from [[astronomical radio source|distant radio sources]] by the sun, which can be accurately measured by [[very long baseline interferometry]]. Another sensitive test comes from measurements of the frequency shift of signals to and from the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft. Together, these measurements have put tight limits on [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and other alternative theories of gravity.

In 2014, astronomers discovered a stellar triple system including a millisecond [[pulsar]] [[PSR J0337+1715]] and two [[white dwarf]]s orbiting it. The system provided them a chance to test the strong equivalence principle in a strong gravitational field with high accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12917.html#ref7 |title=A millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system |first1=Scott M. |last1=Ransom |display-authors=etal |journal=Nature |year=2014 |accessdate=8 January 2014 |doi=10.1038/nature12917 |arxiv = 1401.0535 |bibcode = 2014Natur.505..520R |volume=505 |issue=7484 |pages=520–524 |pmid=24390352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Universality of free fall from the orbital motion of a pulsar in a stellar triple system|author=Anne M.

==Challenges==
One challenge to the equivalence principle is the [[Brans–Dicke theory]]. [[Self-creation cosmology]] is a modification of the Brans–Dicke theory. The [[Fredkin Finite Nature Hypothesis]] is an even more radical challenge to the equivalence principle and has even fewer supporters.

In August 2010, researchers from the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology, and Cambridge University published a paper titled "Evidence for spatial variation of the [[fine structure constant]]", whose tentative conclusion is that, "qualitatively, [the] results suggest a violation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle, and could infer a very large or infinite universe, within which our 'local' [[Hubble volume]] represents a tiny fraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1008.3907 |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Julian A. |last2=King |first3=Michael T. |last3=Murphy |first4=Victor V. |last4=Flambaum |first5=Robert F. |last5=Carswell |first6=Matthew B. |last6=Bainbridge |title=Evidence for spatial variation of the fine structure constant |year=2010 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.191101 |pmid=22181590 |volume=107 |issue=19 |pages=191101 |journal=Physical Review Letters |bibcode=2011PhRvL.107s1101W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Einstein's Mistakes'', pages 226–227, Hans C. Ohanian describes several situations which falsify Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Inertial accelerative effects are analogous to, but not equivalent to, gravitational effects.  Ohanian cites Ehrenfest for this same opinion.

==Explanations==
Dutch physicist and [[string theory|string theorist]] [[Erik Verlinde]] has generated a self-contained, logical derivation of the equivalence principle based on the starting assumption of a [[holographic universe]].  Given this situation, gravity would not be a true [[fundamental force]] as is currently thought but instead an "[[emergent property]]" related to [[entropy]].  Verlinde's [[entropic gravity]] theory apparently leads naturally to the correct observed strength of [[dark energy]]; previous failures to explain its incredibly small magnitude have been called by such people as cosmologist [[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]] (who is credited as having coined the term "dark energy") as "the greatest embarrassment in the history of theoretical physics".&lt;ref name=Wright2001&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Karen |title=Very Dark Energy |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/mar/featdark#.USwYk6XmjoI |publisher=Discover Magazine |accessdate=26 February 2013 |date=1 March 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it should be noted that these ideas are far from settled and still very controversial.

In [[optics]], '''Fermat's principle''' or the '''principle of least time''', named after French mathematician [[Pierre de Fermat]], is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.  This principle is sometimes taken as the definition of a ray of light.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schuster]], ''An Introduction to the Theory of Optics'', London: Edward Arnold, 1904 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03146755&amp;id=X0AcBd-bcCwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=fermat%27s-principle online].&lt;/ref&gt; However, this version of the principle is not general; a more modern statement of the principle is that rays of light traverse the path of stationary optical length with respect to variations of the path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths, arbitrarily nearby on either side, along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse.

Fermat's principle can be used to describe the properties of light rays [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] off mirrors, [[refraction|refracted]] through different media, or undergoing [[total internal reflection]]. It follows mathematically from [[Huygens' principle]] (at the limit of small [[wavelength]]). Fermat's text ''Analyse des réfractions'' exploits the technique of [[adequality]] to derive [[Snell's law]] of [[refraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of reflection]].

Fermat's principle has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] and it is the basis of [[Hamiltonian optics]].

==Modern version==
The time T a point of the electromagnetic wave needs to cover a path between the points '''A''' and '''B''' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T=\int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \frac{c}{v} \frac{ds}{dt}\, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, ''ds'' an infinitesimal displacement along the ray, ''v'' = ''ds''/''dt'' the speed of light in a medium and ''n'' = ''c''/''v'' the [[refractive index]] of that medium, &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the starting time (the wave front is in '''A'''), &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is the arrival time at '''B'''. The optical path length of a ray from a point '''A''' to a point '''B''' is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

and it is related to the travel time by ''S'' = ''cT''. The optical path length is a purely geometrical quantity since time is not considered in its calculation. An [[extremum]] in the light travel time between two points '''A''' and '''B''' is equivalent to an extremum of the optical path length between those two points. The historical form proposed by Fermat is incomplete. A complete modern statement of the variational Fermat principle is that {{quote|the optical length of the path followed by light between two fixed points, '''A''' and '''B''', is an extremum. The optical length is defined as the physical length multiplied by the refractive index of the material."&lt;ref&gt;R. Marques, F. Martin, and M. Sorolla. Metamaterials with Negative Parameters. Wiley, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the context of [[calculus of variations]] this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n \, ds =0 &lt;/math&gt;

In general, the refractive index is a [[scalar field]] of position in space, that is, &lt;math&gt;n=n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[euclidean space]]. Assuming now that light has a component that travels along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis, the path of a light ray may be parametrized as &lt;math&gt;s=\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;nds=n \frac{\sqrt{dx_1^2+dx_2^2+dx_3^2}}{dx_3}dx_3=n \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2} \ dx_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_k=dx_k/dx_3&lt;/math&gt;. The principle of Fermat can now be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right) \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2}\, dx_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} L\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_1\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)\, dx_3=0&lt;/math&gt;

which has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] but in which ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; takes the role of time in [[classical mechanics]]. Function &lt;math&gt;L\left(x_1,x_2,\dot{x}_1,\dot{x}_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the optical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] from which the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian (as in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]) formulations of geometrical optics may be derived.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==

Classically, Fermat's principle can be considered as a mathematical consequence of [[Huygens' principle]]. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extremal (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or physical optics. The various optical paths AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. But if there is a shortest route AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the optical path varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will have optical paths differing from AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Lipson, Stephen G. Lipson, Henry Lipson, ''Optical Physics 4th Edition'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-49345-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermat's principle is the main principle of [[quantum electrodynamics]] which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths at the point of observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard has to find the fastest way to traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nautil.us/blog/to-save-drowning-people-ask-yourself-what-would-light-do | title=To Save Drowning People, Ask Yourself "What Would Light Do?" | author=Aatish Bhatia | date=24 March 2014 | publisher=Nautilus | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants choose to follow the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-ants-fermat-principle.html | title=Ants follow Fermat's principle of least time | author=Lisa Zyga | date=1 April 2013 | publisher=Phys.org | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[classic mechanics]] of [[wave]]s, Fermat's principle follows from the [[extremum principle of mechanics]] (see [[variational principle]]).

==History==
[[Euclid]], c. 320 BCE in his [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics%201/EuclidCatoptrics.1.html Catoptrics] (on [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.19/Catoptrics.19.html mirrors], including [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.30/Catoptrics.30.html spherical mirrors]) and Optics, laid the foundations for reflection, which was repeated by [[Ptolemy]], and then in his more detailed books that have surfaced, [[Hero of Alexandria]] (Heron) (c. 60) described the principle of reflection, which stated that a ray of light that goes from point A to point B, suffering any number of reflections on flat mirrors in the same medium, has a smaller path length than any nearby path.&lt;ref&gt;History of Geometric Optics/Richard Fitzpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), expanded the principle to both reflection and refraction, and expressed an early version of the principle of least time. His experiments were based on earlier works on refraction carried out by the Greek scientist [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlos Mihas (2005). [http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf Use of History in Developing ideas of refraction, lenses and rainbow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032208/http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, Demokritus University, Thrace, Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pierre de Fermat2.png|thumb|140px|Pierre de Fermat]]
The generalized principle of least time in its modern form was stated by Fermat in a letter dated January 1, 1662, to [[Cureau de la Chambre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Sean Mahoney]], ''The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat, 1601-1665'', 2nd edition (Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; It was met with objections by [[Claude Clerselier]] in May 1662, an expert in optics and leading spokesman for the Cartesians at the time. Amongst his objections, Clerselier states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... The principle which you take as the basis for your proof, namely that Nature always acts by using the simplest and shortest paths, is merely a moral, and not a physical one.  It is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in Nature.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The original French, from Mahoney, is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Le principe que vous prenez pour fondement de votre démonstration, à savoir que la nature agit toujours par les voies les plus courtes et les plus simples, n’est qu’un principe moral et non point physique, qui n’est point et qui ne peut être la cause d’aucun effet de la nature.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Fermat's principle does not hold standing alone, we now know it can be derived from earlier principles such as [[Huygens' principle]].

Historically, Fermat's principle has served as a guiding principle in the formulation of physical laws with the use of variational calculus (see [[Principle of least action]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="155769">A '''fuzzy concept''' is a [[concept]] of which the boundaries of application can vary considerably according to context or conditions, instead of being fixed once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the concept is [[Vagueness|vague]] in some way, lacking a fixed, precise meaning, without however being unclear or meaningless altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009; Delia Graff &amp; Timothy Williamson (eds.), ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a definite meaning, which can be made more precise only through further elaboration and specification - including a closer definition of the context in which the concept is used. The study of the characteristics of fuzzy concepts and fuzzy language is called ''fuzzy semantics''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Williamson]], ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 124f; [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Quantitative fuzzy semantics". ''Information Sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 2, April 1971, pp. 159-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse of a "fuzzy concept" is a "crisp concept" (i.e. a precise concept). 

A fuzzy concept is understood by scientists as a concept which is "to an extent applicable" in a situation. That means the concept has ''gradations'' of significance or ''unsharp'' (variable) boundaries of application. A fuzzy statement is a statement which is true "to some extent", and that extent can often be represented by a scaled value. The best known example of a fuzzy concept around the world is an amber [[traffic light]], and indeed fuzzy concepts are widely used in traffic control systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sandeep Mehan &amp; Vandana Sharma, "Development of traffic light control system based on fuzzy logic".  ''ACAI '11 Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2011'', pp. 162–165.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used these days in a more general, popular sense - in contrast to its technical meaning - to refer to a concept which is "rather vague" for any kind of reason.

In the past, the very idea of reasoning with fuzzy concepts faced considerable resistance from academic elites. They did not want to endorse the use of imprecise concepts in research or argumentation. Yet although people might not be aware of it, the use of fuzzy concepts has risen gigantically in all walks of life from the 1970s onward. That is mainly due to advances in electronic engineering, fuzzy mathematics and digital computer programming. The new technology allows very complex inferences about "variations on a theme" to be anticipated and fixed in a program.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], ''Fuzzy Thinking: The New Science of Fuzzy Logic.'' New York: Hyperion, 1993; [[Bart Kosko]], ''Heaven in a chip: fuzzy visions of society and science in the digital age''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 1999; Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994.

Klir]], ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new [[neuro-fuzzy]] computational methods make it possible, to identify, to measure and respond to fine gradations of significance, with great precision.&lt;ref&gt;A useful overview is provided in: Enrique Ruspini et al. ''Handbook of fuzzy computation''. Bristol &amp; Philadelphia: Institute of Physics Publishing, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It means that practically useful concepts can be coded and applied to all kinds of tasks, even if, ordinarily, these concepts are never precisely defined. Nowadays engineers, statisticians and programmers often represent fuzzy concepts mathematically, using fuzzy logic, fuzzy values, fuzzy variables and fuzzy sets.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Behlohlavek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.), ''Concepts and fuzzy logic''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Problems of vagueness and fuzziness have probably always existed in human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising et al., ''On fuzziness: homage to Lotfi A. Zadeh'', Vol. 2. Heidelberg: Springer, 2013, p. 656; Ellen Christiaanse, "1.5 million years of information systems; from hunters-gatherers to the domestication of the networked computer". In: David Avison et al., ''The past and future of information systems: 1976-2006 and beyond''. New York: IFIP/Springer, 2006, pp. 165-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary between different things can appear blurry. Sometimes people have to think, when they are not in the best frame of mind to do it, or, they have to talk about something out there, which just isn't sharply defined. Across time, however, philosophers and scientists began to reflect about those kinds of problems, in much more systematic ways.

===Sorites paradox===
The ancient [[Sorites paradox]] first raised the logical problem of how we could exactly define the threshold at which a change in quantitative gradation turns into a qualitative or categorical difference.&lt;ref&gt;Rosanna Keefe &amp; Peter Smith, ''Vagueness: a reader.'' Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; With some physical processes this threshold is relatively easy to identify. For example, water turns into steam at 100&amp;nbsp;°C or 212&amp;nbsp;°F (the boiling point depends partly on atmospheric pressure, which decreases at higher altitudes). 

With many other processes and gradations, however, the point of change is much more difficult to locate, and remains somewhat vague. Thus, the boundaries between qualitatively different things may be ''unsharp'': we know that there are boundaries, but we cannot define them exactly. 

According to the modern idea of the [[continuum fallacy]], the fact that a statement is to an extent vague, does not automatically mean that it is invalid. The problem then becomes one of how we could ascertain the kind of validity that the statement does have.

===Loki's wager===
The Nordic myth of [[Loki's wager]] suggested that concepts that lack precise meanings or precise boundaries of application cannot be usefully discussed at all.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Pigliucci &amp; Maarten Boudry (eds.), ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem''. University of Chicago Press, 2013, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 20th century idea of "fuzzy concepts" proposes that "somewhat vague terms" can be operated with, since we can explicate and define the variability of their application, by assigning numbers to gradations of applicability. This idea sounds simple enough, but it had large implications.

===Precursors===
The intellectual origins of the species of fuzzy concepts as a logical category have been traced back to a diversity of famous and less well-known thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-Valued Logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; including (among many others) [[Eubulides]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;Angelica Nuzzo, "Vagueness and Meaning Variance in Hegel’s Logic". In: Angelica Nuzzo, ''Hegel and the analytical tradition''. New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, pp. 61-82.

''International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology'', Vol. 1, No. 3, August 2010.[http://ijimt.org/papers/58-M450.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Across at least two and a half millennia, all of them had something to say about graded concepts with unsharp boundaries. This suggests at least that the awareness of the existence of concepts with "fuzzy" characteristics, in one form or another, has a very long history in human thought. Quite a few logicians and philosophers have also tried to ''analyze'' the characteristics of fuzzy concepts as a recognized species, sometimes with the aid of some kind of [[many-valued logic]] or [[substructural logic]].

An early attempt in the post-WW2 era to create a theory of sets where set membership is a matter of degree was made by Abraham Kaplan and Hermann Schott in 1951. They intended to apply the idea to empirical research. Kaplan and Schott measured the degree of membership of empirical classes using real numbers between 0 and 1, and they defined corresponding notions of intersection, union, complementation and subset.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Kaplan and Hermann F. Schott, "A calculus for empirical classes", ''Methodos'', Vol. 3, 1951, pp. 165–188.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time, their idea "fell on stony ground".&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] published a treatise on many-valued logics in 1952, anticipating "many-valued sets".&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] and Atwell R. Turquette, ''Many-valued logics''. Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company, 1952, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Another treatise was published in 1963 by Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev and others&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev, David Dinsmore Comey and Guido Küng, ''Philosophical problems of many-valued logic''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the American philosopher [[William Alston]] introduced the term "degree vagueness" to describe vagueness in an idea that results from the absence of a definite cut-off point along an implied scale (in contrast to "combinatory vagueness" caused by a term that has a number of logically independent conditions of application).&lt;ref&gt;William P. Alston, ''Philosophy of Language''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1964, p. 87; William P. Alston, “Vagueness,” in Paul Edwards (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 8. New York: Macmillan, first edition 1967, pp. 218–221; William P. Alston, ''A Realist Conception of Truth''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996 p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German mathematician Dieter Klaua [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Klaua] published a German-language paper on fuzzy sets in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Klaua. "Über einen Ansatz zur mehrwertigen Mengenlehre". ''Monatsberichte der Deutschen Akademie der Wissenschaften'' (Berlin), Vol. 7, pp. 859–867, 1965.

Vol. 161 Issue 18, September 2010, pp. 2369–2379.&lt;/ref&gt; but he used a different terminology (he referred to "many-valued sets", not "fuzzy sets").&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Gottwald, "Shaping the logic of fuzzy set theory". In: Cintula, Petr et al. (eds.), ''Witnessed years. Essays in honour of Petr Hájek''. London: College Publications, 2009, pp. 193–208. [http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~logik/gottwald/Hajek09.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two popular introductions to many-valued logic in the late 1960s were by Robert J. Ackermann and [[Nicholas Rescher]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Robert John Ackermann, ''An introduction to many-valued logics''. London, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1967; Nicholas Rescher, ''Many-Valued Logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Rescher’s book includes a bibliography on fuzzy theory up to 1965, which was extended by Robert Wolf for 1966-1974.&lt;ref&gt; Robert G. Wolf, “A survey of many-valued logic (1966–1974)”, in: J. Michael Dunn and George Epstein (eds.), ''Modern Uses of Multiple-Valued Logic''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1977, 167–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Haack provides references to significant works after 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergmann provides a more recent (2008) introduction to fuzzy reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Merrie  Bergmann, ''An  Introduction  to  Many-Valued  and  Fuzzy  Logic: Semantics, Algebras, and Derivation Systems''.

===Lotfi Zadeh===
Usually the Iranian-born American computer scientist [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] (1921-2017) is credited with inventing the specific idea of a "fuzzy concept" in his seminal 1965 paper on fuzzy sets, because he gave a formal mathematical presentation of the phenomenon that was widely accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Fuzzy sets". In: ''Information and Control'', Vol. 8, June 1965, pp. 338–353.{{cite web|url=http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127005930/http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-27 |df= See also A. Dumitras, &amp; G. Moschytz, "Understanding Fuzzy Logic: An Interview with Lotfi Zadeh". ''IEEE signal processing magazine'', May 2007, pp. 102-105.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Zadeh who played a decisive role in developing the field of fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets and fuzzy systems, with a large number of scholarly papers.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben &amp; George J. Klir, ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017. Lotfi A Zadeh with George J. Klir and Bo Yua, ''Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Logic, and Fuzzy Systems: Selected Papers''. Singapore and River Edge (N.J.): World Scientific Publishing Company, 1996. This last title includes a bibliography of Zadeh's writings up to 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most philosophical theories of vagueness, Zadeh's engineering approach had the advantage that it could be directly applied to computer programming.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising, "Cybernetics, system(s) theory, information theory and Fuzzy Sets and Systems in the 1950s and 1960s". ''Information Sciences'' No. 180, 2010, pp. 4459-4476.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zadeh's seminal 1965 paper is acknowledged to be one of the most-cited scholarly articles in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013 [http://isdlab.ie.ntnu.edu.tw/ntust/ifsa/files/newsletter/Vol10/IFSAnewsletterV10N1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was placed 46th in the list of the world's 100 most-cited research papers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Van Noorden, Brendan Maher &amp; Regina Nuzzo, "The top 100 papers". ''Nature'', 29 October 2014.[https://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1960s, many scholars have contributed to elaborating the theory of reasoning with graded concepts, and the research field continues to expand.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben &amp; George J. Klir, ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ordinary scholarly definition of a concept as "fuzzy" has been in use from the 1970s onward.

===Criteria===
Radim Bělohlávek explains:

{{Quotation|"There exists strong evidence, established in the 1970s in the psychology of concepts... that human concepts have a graded structure in that whether or not a concept applies to a given object is a matter of degree, rather than a yes-or-no question, and that people are capable of working with the degrees in a consistent way. This finding is intuitively quite appealing, because people say "this product is more or less good" or "to a certain degree, he is a good athlete", implying the graded structure of concepts. In his classic paper, Zadeh called the concepts with a graded structure ''fuzzy concepts'' and argued that these concepts are a rule rather than an exception when it comes to how people communicate knowledge. Moreover, he argued that to model such concepts mathematically is important for the tasks of control, decision making, pattern recognition, and the like. Zadeh proposed the notion of a ''[[fuzzy set]]'' that gave birth to the field of ''[[fuzzy logic]]''..."&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice? II", in: Sergei O. Kuznetsov et al. (eds.), ''Rough sets, fuzzy sets, data mining and granular computing.'' Berlin: Springer Verlag, 2011, pp. 19–20.[http://belohlavek.inf.upol.cz/publications/BeVy_Wifcl.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Hence, a concept is generally regarded as "fuzzy" in a logical sense if:
*defining characteristics of the concept apply to it "to a certain degree or extent" (or, more unusually, "with a certain magnitude of likelihood").&lt;ref&gt;The vast majority of scientific or scholarly users of the idea of fuzzy concepts refer to scaled (graded)  characteristics, and not to the variations in the ''likelihoods'' of their applicability.&lt;/ref&gt;
*or, the boundaries of applicability (the truth-value) of a concept can vary in degrees, according to different conditions. 
*or, the fuzzy concept itself straightforwardly consists of a [[fuzzy set]], or a combination of such sets.

The fact that a concept is fuzzy does not prevent its use in logical reasoning; it merely affects the type of reasoning which can be applied (see [[fuzzy logic]]). If the concept has gradations of meaningful significance, it is necessary to specify and formalize what those gradations are, if they can make an important difference. Not all fuzzy concepts have the same logical structure, but they can often be formally described or reconstructed using fuzzy logic or other [[substructural logic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaos Galatos, Peter Jipsen, Tomasz Kowalski &amp; Hiroakira Ono, ''Residuated lattices: an algebraic glimpse at [[substructural logics]].'' Elsevier Science, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this approach is, that numerical notation enables a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth-values between complete truth and complete falsehood, and thus it enables - in theory, at least - the greatest precision in stating the degree of applicability of a logical rule.

===Probability===
[[Petr Hájek]], writing about the foundations of fuzzy logic, sharply distinguished between "fuzziness" and "uncertainty":

{{Quotation|"The sentence "The patient is young" is true to some degree – the lower the age of the patient (measured e.g. in years), the more the sentence is true. Truth of a fuzzy proposition is a matter of degree. I recommend to everybody interested in fuzzy logic that they sharply distinguish fuzziness from uncertainty as a degree of belief (e.g. probability). Compare the last proposition with the proposition "The patient will survive next week". This may well be considered as a crisp proposition which is either (absolutely) true or (absolutely) false; but we do not know which is the case. We may have some probability (chance, degree of belief) that the sentence is true; but probability is not a degree of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], ''Metamathematics of fuzzy logic''. Dordrecht: Springer, 1998, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[metrology]] (the science of measurement), it is acknowledged that for any measure we care to make, there exists an [[Measurement uncertainty|amount of uncertainty]] about its accuracy, but this degree of uncertainty is conventionally expressed with a magnitude of likelihood, and not as a degree of truth. In 1975, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] introduced a distinction between "Type 1 fuzzy sets" without uncertainty and "[[Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems|Type 2 fuzzy sets]]" with uncertainty, which has been widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and Its Application to Approximate Reasoning–1", ''Information Sciences'', Vol. 8, pp. 199–249, 1975. Jerry M. Mendel and Robert I. Bob John, "Type-2 Fuzzy Sets Made Simple." ''IEEE transactions on fuzzy systems'', Vol. 10, No. 2, April 2002, pp. 117-127. Jerry M. Mendel, "Advances in type-2 fuzzy sets and systems". In: ''Information Sciences'' 177, 2007, pp. 84–110.[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.466.477&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, in the former case, each fuzzy number is linked to a non-fuzzy (natural) number, while in the latter case, each fuzzy number is linked to another fuzzy number.

==Applications==
===Philosophy===
In philosophical [[logic]] and linguistics, fuzzy concepts are often regarded as vague concepts which in their application, or formally speaking, are neither completely true nor completely false, or which are partly true and partly false; they are ideas which require further elaboration, specification or qualification to understand their applicability (the conditions under which they truly make sense).&lt;ref&gt;[[Delia Graff Fara]], "Shifting Sands: An Interest Relative Theory of Vagueness". ''Philosophical Topics'', Vol. 28 No. 1, 2000, pp. 45-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The "fuzzy area" can also refer simply to a ''residual'' number of cases which cannot be allocated to a known and identifiable group, class or set if strict criteria are used.

===Sciences===
In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], a fuzzy variable (such as "the temperature", "hot" or "cold") is a value which could lie in a probable [[Range (mathematics)|range]] defined by some quantitative limits or [[parameters]], and which can be usefully described with imprecise categories (such as "high", "medium" or "low") using some kind of [[Level of measurement|scale]] or conceptual hierarchy.

===Fuzzy logic===
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}
In mathematics and [[computer science]], the gradations of applicable meaning of a fuzzy concept are described in terms of ''quantitative'' relationships defined by logical operators. Such an approach is sometimes called "degree-theoretic semantics" by logicians and philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook, ''A dictionary of philosophical logic''. Edinburgh University Press, 2009, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; but the more usual term is [[fuzzy logic]] or [[many-valued logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-valued logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of fuzzy logic is, that it "breaks with the traditional principle that [[formal system|formalisation]] should correct and avoid, but not compromise with, vagueness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea of fuzzy logic is that a real number is assigned to each statement written in a language, within a range from 0 to 1, where 1 means that the statement is completely true, and 0 means that the statement is completely false, while values less than 1 but greater than 0 represent that the statements are "partly true", to a given, quantifiable extent. [[Susan Haack]] comments:

{{Quotation|"Whereas in classical set theory an object either is or is not a member of a given set, in fuzzy set theory membership is a matter of degree; the degree of membership of an object in a fuzzy set is represented by some real number between 0 and 1, with 0 denoting ''no'' membership and 1 ''full'' membership."&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

"Truth" in this mathematical context usually means simply that "something is the case", or that "something is applicable". This makes it possible to analyze a distribution of statements for their truth-content, identify data patterns, make inferences and predictions, and model how processes operate. 

[[Petr Hájek]] claimed that "fuzzy logic is not just some "applied logic", but may bring "new light to classical logical problems", and therefore might be well classified as a distinct branch of "philosophical logic" similar to e.g. [[Modal logic|modal logics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], "Ten questions and one problem on fuzzy logic". ''Annals of Pure and Applied Logic'', Vol. 96, Issues 1-3, March 1999, 157-165, at p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machinery &amp; analytics===

Fuzzy logic offers computationally-oriented systems of concepts and methods, to formalize types of reasoning which are ordinarily approximate only, and not exact. In principle, this allows us to give a definite, precise answer to the question, "To what extent is something the case?", or, "To what extent is something applicable?". Via a series of switches, this kind of reasoning can be built into electronic devices. That was already happening before fuzzy logic was invented, but using fuzzy logic in modelling has become an important aid in design, which creates many new technical possibilities.

Fuzzy reasoning (i.e., reasoning with graded concepts) turns out to have many practical uses.&lt;ref&gt;Kazuo Tanaka, ''An Introduction to Fuzzy Logic for Practical Applications''.

Humberto Bustince et al. (eds.), ''Fuzzy Sets and Their Extensions: Representation, Aggregation and Models. Intelligent Systems from Decision Making to Data Mining, Web Intelligence and Computer Vision.''  Berlin: Springer, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is nowadays widely used in:

It looks like fuzzy logic will eventually be applied in almost every aspect of life, even if people are not aware of it, and in that sense fuzzy logic is an astonishingly successful invention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goldengooseaward.org/awardees/fuzzy-logic "2017 Golden Goose Awardee: Fuzzy Logic, Clear Impact"]&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific and engineering literature on the subject is constantly increasing.

===Community===
Originally lot of research on fuzzy logic was done by Japanese pioneers inventing new machinery, electronic equipment and appliances (see also [[Fuzzy control system]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michio Sugeno (ed.), ''Industrial applications of fuzzy control''. Amsterdam: North Holland, 1992; Andrew Pollack, "Technology; Fuzzy Logic For Computers". ''New York Times'', 11 October 1984; Andrew Pollack, "Fuzzy Computer Theory: How to Mimic the Mind?" ''New York Times'', 2 April 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea became so popular in Japan, that the English word entered Japanese language (ファジィ概念). "Fuzzy theory" (ファジー理論) is a recognized field in Japanese scientific research.

Since that time, the movement has spread worldwide; nearly every country nowadays has its own fuzzy systems association, although some are larger and more developed than others. In some cases, the local body is a branch of an international one. In other cases, the fuzzy systems program falls under [[artificial intelligence]] or [[soft computing]].

===Achievements===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] estimated around 2014 that there were more than 50,000 fuzzy logic–related, patented inventions. He listed 28 journals at that time dealing with fuzzy reasoning, and 21 journal titles on [[soft computing]]. His searches found close to 100,000 publications with the word "fuzzy" in their titles, but perhaps there are even 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Factual Information about the Impact of Fuzzy Logic". Berkeley Initiative in Soft Computing, at Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department, University of Berkeley, California, circa 2014.[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~zadeh/stimfl.html] For more details about the global fuzzy logic community, see [http://users.abo.fi/rfuller/fuzs.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, [[Google Scholar]] found 2,870,000 titles which included the word "fuzzy". When he died on 11 September 2017 at age 96, Professor Zadeh had received more than 50 engineering and academic awards, in recognition of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Cade Metz, "Lotfi Zadeh, Father of Mathematical ‘Fuzzy Logic,’ Dies at 96." ''New York Times'', 11 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lattices and big data sets==
The technique of fuzzy concept lattices is increasingly used in programming for the formatting, relating and analysis of fuzzy data sets.

===Concept formalization===
According to the computer scientist Andrei Popescu at [[Middlesex University London]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Popescu, "A general approach to fuzzy concepts". ''Mathematical Logic Quarterly'' Vol. 50, No. 3, 2005, pp. 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept can be operationally defined to consist of: 
*an ''intent'', which is a description or specification stated in a language, 
*an ''extent'', which is the collection of all the objects to which the description refers, 
*a ''context'', which is stated by: (i) the universe of all possible objects, (ii) the universe of all possible attributes of objects, and (iii) the logical definition of the relation whereby an object possesses an attribute. 

Once the context is defined, we can specify relationships of sets of objects with sets of attributes which they do, or do not share.

===Fuzzy concept lattice===
Whether an object belongs to a concept, and whether an object does, or does not have an attribute, can often be a matter of degree. Thus, for example, "many attributes are fuzzy rather than crisp".&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek and Vilem Vychodil, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice?" Department of Computer Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, 2005.[http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-162/paper2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome this issue, a numerical value is assigned to each attribute along a scale, and the results are placed in a table which links each assigned object-value within the given range to a numerical value denoting a given degree of applicability.

This is the basic idea of a "fuzzy concept lattice", which can also be graphed; different fuzzy concept lattices can be connected to each other as well (for example, in "[[fuzzy clustering|fuzzy conceptual clustering]]" techniques used to group data, originally invented by [http://dblp2.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/r/Ruspini:Enrique_H= Enrique H. Ruspini]). Fuzzy concept lattices are a useful programming tool for the exploratory analysis of [[big data]], for example in cases where sets of linked behavioural responses are broadly similar, but can nevertheless vary in important ways, within certain limits. It can help to find out what the structure and dimensions are, of a behaviour that occurs with an important but limited amount of variation in a large population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compasss.org/index.htm See further the COMPASSS site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big data===
Coding with fuzzy lattices can be useful, for instance, in the [[psephological]] analysis of [[big data]] about voter behaviour, where researchers want to explore the characteristics and associations involved in "somewhat vague" opinions; gradations in voter attitudes; and variability in voter behaviour (or personal characteristics) within a set of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kreiss, ''Prototype Politics: Technology-Intensive Campaigning and the Data of Democracy''.

Very large quantities of data can now be explored using computers with fuzzy logic programming&lt;ref&gt;For example, Kyle C. Longest and Stephen Vaisey, "Fuzzy: A program for Performing Qualitative Comparative Analyses (QCA) in Stata." ''Stata Journal'', Vol. 8 No. 1, 2008: pp. 79–104. Gregory Viot, "Fuzzy logic in C". ''Dr Dobb's journal'', 1 February 1993.[http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/fuzzy-logic-in-c/184408940]&lt;/ref&gt; and open-source architectures such as [[Apache Hadoop]], [[Apache Spark]], and [[MongoDB]]. One author claimed in 2016 that it is now possible to obtain, link and analyze "400 data points" for each voter in a population, using [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] systems (a "data point" is a number linked to one or more categories, which represents a characteristic).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Preimesberger, "Big-Data Analytics Plays Big Role in 2016 Election Campaigns". ''eWeek'', 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[NBC News]] reported in 2016 that the Anglo-American firm [[Cambridge Analytica]] which profiled voters for [[Donald Trump]] ([[Steve Bannon]] was a board member)&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth P. Vogel, "The heiress quietly shaping Trump’s operation." ''Politico.com'', 21 November 2016.[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/rebekah-mercer-donald-trump-231693]&lt;/ref&gt; did not have 400, but 4,000 data points for each of 230 million US adults.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Brannely, "Trump Campaign Pays Millions to Overseas Big Data Firm." NBC News, 4 November 2016.[http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/trump-campaign-pays-millions-overseas-big-data-firm-n677321]&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge Analytica's own website claimed that "up to 5,000 data points" were collected for each of 220 million Americans, a data set of more than 1 trillion bits of formatted data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Cambridge Analytica]] website |url=https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216023554/https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2016-02-16 |title=Cambridge Analytica – About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' later claimed that Cambridge Analytica in fact had, according to its own company information, "up to 7,000 data points" on 240 million American voters.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cadwalladr, "UK regulator orders Cambridge Analytica to release data on US voter". ''The Guardian'', 5 May 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/05/cambridge-analytica-uk-regulator-release-data-us-voter-david-carroll]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] Professor [[Latanya Sweeney]] calculated, that if a U.S. company knows just your [[date of birth]], your [[ZIP code]] and [[sex]], the company has an 87% chance to identify you by name – simply by using linked data sets from various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Tanner, "Nine Things You Don't Know About The Gathering Of Your Personal Data." ''Forbes Magazine'', 4 November 2014.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamtanner/2014/11/04/nine-things-you-dont-know-about-the-gathering-of-your-personal-data/#3faf581675b7]&lt;/ref&gt; With 4,000–7,000 data points instead of three, a very comprehensive personal profile becomes possible for almost every voter, and many behavioural patterns can be inferred by linking together different data sets. It also becomes possible to identify and measure gradations in personal characteristics which, in aggregate, have very large effects.

===Human judgement===
Some researchers argue that this kind of big data analysis has severe limitations, and that the analytical results can only be regarded as indicative, and not as definitive.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Lohr and Natasha Singernov, "How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election." ''[[New York Times]]'', 10 November 2016 [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/the-data-said-clinton-would-win-why-you-shouldnt-have-believed-it.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by [[Kellyanne Conway]], [[Donald Trump]]’s campaign advisor and counselor, who emphasized the importance of human judgement and common sense in drawing conclusions from fuzzy data.&lt;ref&gt;"How Trump won the presidency". Interview of Gerald F. Seib with [[Kellyanne Conway]], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (WSJ CEO Council full interview video), 14 November 2016.[https://www.wsj.com/video/how-trump-won-the-presidency/969FC367-31B3-436F-8388-6C9CE7546AC7.html] See also: Jonathan Vanian, "How Bad Polling Data Fooled Everyone Except Donald Trump".

====Propaganda machine====
In a video interview published by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in March 2018, whistleblower [[Christopher Wylie]] called [[Cambridge Analytica]] a "full-service propaganda machine" rather than a bona fide data science company. Its own site revealed with "case studies" that it has been active in political campaigns in numerous different countries, influencing attitudes and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Jina Moore, "Cambridge Analytica Had a Role in Kenya Election, Too". ''New York Times'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/africa/kenya-cambridge-analytica-election.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Wylie explained, that "we spent a million dollars harvesting tens of millions of [[Facebook]] profiles, and those profiles were used as the basis of the algorithms that became the foundation of Cambridge Analytica itself. The company itself was founded on using Facebook data".&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cadwalladr &amp; Emma Graham-Harrison, "Pressure mounts on Cambridge Analytica and Facebook over data scandal." ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 March 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/18/cambridge-analytica-and-facebook-accused-of-misleading-mps-over-data-breach]&lt;/ref&gt; 
====Audit====
On 19 March 2018, [[Facebook]] announced it had hired the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to conduct a "comprehensive audit" of Cambridge Analytica, while Facebook shares plummeted 7 percent overnight (erasing roughly $40 billion in market capitalization).&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Shieber, "Facebook hired a forensics firm to investigate [[Cambridge Analytica]] as stock falls 7%." ''TC Techcrunch.com'', 19 March 2018.[https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/facebook-hired-a-forensics-firm-to-investigate-cambridge-analytica-as-stock-falls-7/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge Analytica]] had not just used the profiles of [[Facebook]] users to compile data sets. According to [[Christopher Wylie]]'s testimony, the company also harvested the data of each user's network of friends, leveraging the original data set. It then converted, combined and migrated its results into ''new'' data sets, which can in principle survive in some format, even if the original data sources are destroyed. It created and applied algorithms using data to which - critics argue - it could not have been entitled. This was denied by [[Cambridge Analytica]], which stated on its website that it legitimately "uses data to change audience behavior" among customers and voters (who ''choose'' to view and provide information). If advertisers can do that, why not a data company? Where should the line be drawn? Legally, it remained a "fuzzy" area.
====Legal issue====
The tricky legal issue then became, what kind of data [[Cambridge Analytica]] (or any similar company) is actually allowed to have and keep.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Phade, "Who Should Profit From Selling Your Personal Data?". ''Futures Platform'', 27 March 2018.[https://www.futuresplatform.com/blog/your-data-and-profit-data-scraping]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] itself became the subject of another [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] inquiry, to establish whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree governing its handing of user data (data which was allegedly transferred to Cambridge Analytica without Facebook's and user's knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;David McLaughlin, Ben Brody, and Billy House, "FTC Probing Facebook for Use of Personal Data, Source Says." ''Bloomberg'', 20 March 2018; Tony Romm and Craig Timberg, "FTC opens investigation into Facebook after Cambridge Analytica scrapes millions of users’ personal information." ''Washington Post'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/20/ftc-opens-investigation-into-facebook-after-cambridge-analytica-scrapes-millions-of-users-personal-information/]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' journalist Jessi Hempel commented in a CBNC panel discussion that "Now there is this fuzziness from the top of the company [i.e. Facebook] that I have never seen in the fifteen years that I have covered it."&lt;ref&gt;Sara Salinas, "Facebook hires firm to conduct a 'comprehensive audit' of Cambridge Analytica". ''CNBC news'', 19 March 2018 and squawkbox panel video [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/facebook-to-conduct-a-comprehensive-audit-of-cambridge-analytica.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data privacy====
Interrogating Facebook's CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] before the U.S. [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]] in April 2018, New Mexico Congressman Rep. [[Ben Ray Luján]] put it to him that the Facebook corporation might well have "29,000 data points" on each Facebook user. Zuckerberg claimed that he "did not really know". Lujan's figure was based on [[ProPublica]] research, which in fact suggested that Facebook may even have 52,000 data points for many Facebook users.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Carbone, "Facebook might have 29,000 data points on you, but Mark Zuckerberg doesn't really know." ''Fox News'', 11 April 2018.[http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/04/11/facebook-might-have-29000-data-points-on-but-mark-zuckerberg-doesnt-really-know.html] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA1S5A4Yuxc] Julia Angwin, Surya Mattu and Terry Parris Jr., "Facebook Doesn’t Tell Users Everything It Really Knows About Them." ''ProPublica'', 27 December 2016.[https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-doesnt-tell-users-everything-it-really-knows-about-them]&lt;/ref&gt; When Zuckerberg replied to his critics, he stated that because the revolutionary technology of Facebook (with 2.2 billion users worldwide) had ventured into previously unknown territory, it was unavoidable that mistakes would be made, despite the best of intentions. He justified himself saying that:

{{Quotation|"For the first ten or twelve years of the company, I viewed our responsibility primarily as building tools, that if we could put those tools in people's hands, then that would empower people to do good things. What we have learnt now... is that we need to take a more proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerberg's Senate hearings highlights video, 10 April 2018.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgI_KAkSyCw]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 2018, [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] barred access from [[Crimson Hexagon]], a company that advises corporations and governments using one trillion scraped social media posts, which it mined and processed with artificial intelligence and image analysis.&lt;ref&gt; Olivia Solon and Julia Carrie Wong, "Facebook suspends another analytics firm amid questions over surveillance." ''The Guardian'', 20 July 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/20/facebook-crimson-hexagon-analytics-data-surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrity====
It remained "fuzzy" what was more important to Zuckerberg: making money from user's information, or real corporate integrity in the use of personal information. Zuckerberg implied, that he believed that, on balance, Facebook had done ''more good than harm'', and that, if he had believed that wasn't the case, he would never have persevered with the business. Thus, "the good" was itself a fuzzy concept, because it was a matter of degree ("more good than bad"). He had to sell stuff, to keep the business growing. If people did not like Facebook, then they simply should not join it, or opt out, they have the choice.

After the ''[[New York Times]]'' broke the news on 17 March 2018, that copies of the Facebook data set scraped by Cambridge Analytica could still be downloaded from the Internet, Facebook was severely criticized by government representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Rosenberg, Nicholas Confessore and Carole Cadwalladr, "How [[Donald Trump|Trump]] Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions". ''[[New York Times]]'', 17 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned, Zuckerberg admitted that "In general we collect data on people who are not signed up for Facebook for security purposes" with the aim "to help prevent malicious actors from collecting public information from Facebook users, such as names". &lt;ref&gt;Sarah Frier and Todd Shields, "Zuckerberg Says Facebook Collects Internet Data on Non-Users", ''Bloomberg'', 11 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2018, it was reported that the [[Cambridge Analytica]] company was shutting down and was starting bankruptcy proceedings, after losing clients and facing escalating legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Ballhaus and Jenny Gross, "Cambridge Analytica Closing Operations Following Facebook Data Controversy". ''Wall Street Journal'', 2 May 2018; Munsif Vengattil, "Cambridge Analytica and parent SCL Elections shutting down." ''Reuters'', 2 May 2018.[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-faceboook-privacy/cambridge-analytica-and-parent-scl-elections-shutting-down-idUSKBN1I32L7]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[reputational risk|reputational damage]] which the company had suffered or caused, had become too great.

===Speed===
A traditional objection to big data is, that it cannot cope with rapid change: events move faster that the statistics can keep up with. Yet the technology now exists for corporations like [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] to pump cloud-based data streams from app-users straight into big data analytics programmes, in real time.&lt;ref&gt;Tableau.com, ''Big data: the top 8 trends for 2016''.&lt;/ref&gt; Provided that the right kinds of analytical concepts are used, it is now technically possible to draw definite and important conclusions about gradations of human and natural behaviour using very large fuzzy data sets – and increasingly it can be done very fast. Obviously this achievement has become highly topical in military technology, but military uses can also have spin-offs for medical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Hagan, "From military to medical and commercial applications of neural networks and fuzzy logic: a modern "swords-into-plowshares" play." ''Proceedings of IEEE WESCON '93'' conference, San Francisco, 28-30 Sept. 1993. Republished in ''EEE Xplore'', 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
There have been many academic controversies about the meaning, relevance and utility of fuzzy concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, George J. Klir, Harold W. Lewis III, Eileen C. Way, "Concepts and fuzzy sets: Misunderstandings, misconceptions, and oversights". ''International Journal of Approximate Reasoning'', Vol. 51, July 2009), pp. 23–34.[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0888613X09001327/1-s2.0-S0888613X09001327-main.pdf?_tid=7f4bada4-37bd-11e7-9bfe-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1494667448_9f6a0acd8f43577a7af214d56512b12a] Angel Garrido &amp; Piedad Yuste, "controversies about the introduction of non-classical logics". ''Brain'', Vol. 5, No. 1-4, 2014.[http://www.edusoft.ro/brain/index.php/brain/article/view/457]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fuzzy" label===
[[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] himself confessed that:

{{Quotation|"I knew that just by choosing the label ''fuzzy'' I was going to find myself in the midst of a controversy... If it weren't called ''fuzzy logic'', there probably wouldn't be articles on it on the front page of the ''New York Times''. So let us say it has a certain publicity value. Of course, many people don't like that publicity value, and when they see it in the ''New York Times'', it doesn't sit well with them."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

However, the impact of the invention of fuzzy reasoning went far beyond names and labels. When Zadeh gave his acceptance speech in Japan for the 1989 Honda Foundation prize, which he received for inventing fuzzy theory, he stated that "The concept of a fuzzy set has had an upsetting effect on the established order."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 50. The Honda Foundation judged that Zadeh had taken an "active role in making the future of information society a more humane civilization", with a broad range of contributions in applied logic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Do they exist===

Some philosophers and scientists have claimed that in reality "fuzzy" concepts do not exist.

====Frege====
According to ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' by the logician [[Gottlob Frege]],

{{Quotation|"A definition of a concept... must be complete; it must unambiguously determine, as regards any object, whether or not it falls under the concept... the concept must have a sharp boundary... a concept that is not sharply defined is wrongly termed a concept. Such quasi-conceptual constructions cannot be recognized as concepts by logic. The [[Law of excluded middle|law of the excluded middle]] is really just another form of the requirement that the concept should have a sharp boundary."&lt;ref&gt;P. Geach and M. Black (eds.), ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege'', 3rd edition. Blackwell, 1980, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Kálmán====
Similarly, [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] stated in 1972 that "there is no such thing as a fuzzy concept... We do talk about fuzzy things but they are not scientific concepts".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Is there a need for fuzzy logic?", ''Information Sciences'', No. 178, 2008, p. 2753.&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggestion is that a concept, to qualify as a concept, must always be clear ''and'' precise, without any fuzziness. A vague notion would be at best a prologue to formulating a concept.&lt;ref&gt;For the debate between Zadeh and Kálmán, see: Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105. See also: Yücel Yüksel, "On Zadeh’s 'The Birth and Evolution of Fuzzy Logic'". In: Eyke Hüllermeier, Rudolf Kruse &amp; Frank Hoffmann (eds.), ''Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems. Applications''. Proceedings of the 13th International Conference, IPMU 2010, Dortmund, Germany, June 28–July 2, 2010 (Communications in Computer and Information Science, vol 81), Part II. Berlin: Springer, 2010,  pp 350-355. &lt;/ref&gt;

====DIN and ISO standards====
There is no general agreement among philosophers and scientists about how the notion of a "[[concept]]" (and in particular, a scientific concept), should be defined.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang G. Stock, "Concepts and Semantic Relations in Information Science". In: ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' Vol. 61 No. 10, October 2010, pp. 1951–1969.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220433962_Concepts_and_Semantic_Relations_in_Information_Science]; Eric Margolis &amp; Stephen Laurence, "Concepts". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2011.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/#ProThe]&lt;/ref&gt; A concept could be defined as a mental representation, as a cognitive capacity, as an abstract object, etc. Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin stated that “there will likely be no crucial experiments or analyses that will establish one view of concepts as correct and rule out all others irrevocably.”&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin, ''Categories and concepts''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, scientists also quite often do use imprecise analogies in their models to help understanding an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Zeidler, ''Models and Metaphors as Research Tools in Science''. Zurich: Lit Verlag, 2013; L. Magnani, N. J. Nersessian &amp; P. Thagard (eds.), Model-based reasoning in scientific discovery. New York : Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 1999; Jonathan Lawry, ''Modelling and reasoning with vague concepts''. New York: Springer, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept can be clear enough, ''but not'' (or not sufficiently) precise.

Rather uniquely, terminology scientists at the German national standards institute (''Deutsches Institut für Normung'') provided an official standard definition of what a concept is (under the terminology standards DIN 2330 of 1957, completely revised in 1974 and last revised in 2013; and DIN 2342 of 1986, last revised in 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Go to [https://standards.globalspec.com/ Standards Library] for info.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official German definition, a concept is a unit of thought which is created through abstraction for a set of objects, and which identifies shared (or related) characteristics of those objects.

The subsequent ISO definition is very similar. Under the ISO 1087 terminology standard of the [[International Standards Organization]] (first published in October 2000, and reviewed in 2005), a concept is defined as a unit of thought or an idea constituted through abstraction on the basis of properties common to a set of objects.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [https://www.iso.org/standard/20057.html] [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:1087:-1:ed-1:v1:en] [http://wiki.julien-roche.fr/tiki-index.php?page=concept+3.2.1+version2+%28en%29&amp;structure=vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is acknowledged that although a concept usually has one definition or one meaning, it may have multiple designations, terms of expression, symbolizations or representations. Thus, for example, the same concept can have different names in different languages. Both verbs and nouns can express concepts. A concept can also be thought of as "a way of looking at the world".

===Corruption===
Reasoning with fuzzy concepts is often viewed as a kind of "logical corruption" or scientific perversion because, it is claimed, fuzzy reasoning rarely reaches a definite "yes" or a definite "no". A clear, precise and logically rigorous conceptualization is no longer a necessary prerequisite, for carrying out a procedure, a project, or an inquiry, since "somewhat vague ideas" can always be accommodated, formalized and programmed with the aid of fuzzy expressions. The purist idea is, that either a rule applies, or it does not apply. When a rule is said to apply only "to some extent", then in truth the rule does ''not'' apply. Thus, a compromise with vagueness or indefiniteness is, on this view, effectively a compromise with error - an error of conceptualization, an error in the inferential system, or an error in physically carrying out a task.
====Kahan====
The computer scientist [[William Kahan]] argued in 1975 that "the danger of fuzzy theory is that it will encourage the sort of imprecise thinking that has brought us so much trouble."&lt;ref&gt;Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105, at p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; He said subsequently,

{{Quotation|"With traditional logic there is no guaranteed way to find that something is contradictory, but once it is found, you'd be obliged to do something. But with fuzzy sets, the existence of contradictory sets can't cause things to malfunction. Contradictory information doesn't lead to a clash. You just keep computing. (...) Life affords many instances of getting the right answer for the wrong reasons... It is in the nature of logic to confirm or deny. The fuzzy calculus blurs that. (...) Logic isn't following the rules of Aristotle blindly. It takes the kind of pain known to the runner. He knows he is doing something. When you are thinking about something hard, you'll feel a similar sort of pain. Fuzzy logic is marvellous. It insulates you from pain. It's the [[cocaine]] of science."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
According to Kahan, statements of a degree of probability are usually verifiable. There are standard tests one can do. By contrast, there is no conclusive procedure which can decide the validity of assigning particular fuzzy truth values to a data set in the first instance. It is just assumed that a model or program will work, "if" particular fuzzy values are accepted and used, perhaps based on some statistical comparisons or try-outs.

====Bad design====
In programming, a problem can usually be solved in several different ways, not just one way, but an important issue is, which solution works best in the short term, and in the long term. Kahan implies, that fuzzy solutions may create more problems in the long term, than they solve in the short term. For example, if one starts off designing a procedure, not with well thought-out, precise concepts, but rather by using fuzzy or approximate expressions which conveniently patch up (or compensate for) badly formulated ideas, the ultimate result could be a complicated, malformed mess, that does not achieve the intended goal.

Had the reasoning and conceptualization been much sharper at the start, then the design of the procedure might have been much simpler, more efficient and effective - and fuzzy expressions or approximations would not be necessary, or required much less. Thus, by ''allowing'' the use of fuzzy or approximate expressions, one might actually foreclose more rigorous thinking about design, and one might build something that ultimately does not meet expectations. 

If (say) an entity X turns out to belong for 65% to category Y, and for 35% to category Z, how should X be allocated? One could plausibly decide to allocate X to Y, making a rule that, if an entity belongs for 65% or more to Y, it is to be treated as an instance of category Y, and never as an instance of category Z. One could, however, alternatively decide to change the definitions of the categorization system, to ensure that all entities such as X fall 100% in one category only. 

This kind of argument claims, that boundary problems can be resolved (or vastly reduced) simply by using better categorization or conceptualization methods. If we treat X "as if" it belongs 100% to Y, while in truth it only belongs 65% to Y, then arguably we are really misrepresenting things. If we keep doing that with a lot of related variables, we can greatly distort the true situation, and make it look like something that it isn't.

In a "fuzzy permissive" environment, it might become far too easy, to formalize and use a concept which is itself badly defined, and which could have been defined much better. In that environment, there is always a quantitative way out, for concepts that do not quite fit, or which don't quite do the job for which they are intended. The cumulative adverse effect of the discrepancies might, in the end, be much larger than ever anticipated.

====Counter-argument====
A typical reply to Kahan's objections is, that fuzzy reasoning never "rules out" ordinary binary logic, but instead ''presupposes'' ordinary true-or-false logic. [[Lotfi Zadeh]] stated that "fuzzy logic is not fuzzy. In large measure, fuzzy logic is precise."&lt;ref&gt;A. Dumitras, &amp; G. Moschytz, "Understanding Fuzzy Logic: An Interview with Lotfi Zadeh". ''IEEE signal processing magazine'', May 2007, pp. 102-105, at p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a precise logic of imprecision. Fuzzy logic is not a replacement of, or substitute for ordinary logic, but an enhancement of it, with many practical uses. Fuzzy thinking does oblige action, but primarily in response to a change in quantitative gradation, not in response to a contradiction.

One could say, for example, that ultimately one is ''either'' "alive" ''or'' "dead", which is perfectly true. Meantime though one is "living", which is also a significant truth - yet "living" is a fuzzy concept. It is true that fuzzy logic by itself usually cannot eliminate inadequate conceptualization or bad design. Yet it can at least make explicit, what exactly the variations are in the applicability of a concept which has unsharp boundaries.

If one always had perfectly crisp concepts available, perhaps no fuzzy expressions would be necessary. In reality though, one often does not have all the crisp concepts to start off with. One might not have them yet for a long time, or ever - or, several successive "fuzzy" approximations might be needed, to get there. 

At a deeper level, a "fuzzy permissive" environment may be desirable, precisely because it permits things to be actioned, that would never have been achieved, if there had been crystal clarity about all the consequences from the start, or if people insisted on absolute precision prior to doing anything. Scientists often try things out on the basis of "hunches", and processes like [[serendipity]] can play a role. 

Learning something new, or trying to create something new, is rarely a completely formal-logical or linear process, there are not only "knowns" and "unknowns" involved, but also "''partly'' known" phenomena, i.e. things which are known or unknown "to some degree". Even if, ideally, we would prefer to eliminate fuzzy ideas, we might need them initially to get there, further down the track. Any method of reasoning is a tool. If its application has bad results, it is not the tool itself that is to blame, but its inappropriate use. It would be better to educate people in the best ''use'' of the tool, if necessary with appropriate authorization, than to ''ban'' the tool pre-emptively, on the ground that it "could" or "might" be abused. Exceptions to this rule would include things like computer viruses and illegal weapons that can only cause great harm if they are used. There is no evidence though that fuzzy concepts as a species are intrinsically harmful, even if some bad concepts can cause harm if used in inappropriate contexts.

===Reducibility===

[[Susan Haack]] once claimed that a many-valued logic requires neither intermediate terms between true and false, nor a rejection of bivalence.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, Philosophy of Logics. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Her suggestion was, that the intermediate terms (i.e. the gradations of truth) can always be restated as conditional if-then statements, and by implication, that fuzzy logic is fully reducible to binary true-or-false logic. 

This interpretation is disputed, but even if it was correct, assigning a number to the applicability of a statement is often enormously more efficient than a long string of if-then statements that would have the same intended meaning. That point is obviously of great importance to computer programmers, educators and administrators seeking to code a process, activity, message or operation as simply as possible, according to logically consistent rules.

===Quantification===
It may be wonderful to have access to an unlimited number of distinctions to define what one means, but not all scholars would agree that any concept is equal to, or reducible to, a mathematical [[Set theory|set]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Epstein, "Memory and concepts in reactive learning". ''Proceedings of the Canadian Workshop on Machine Learning 1992''[http://www.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/~epstein/papers/CSCSI92.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Some phenomena are difficult or impossible to quantify and count, in particular if they lack discrete boundaries (for example, clouds).

====Formalization====
Qualities may not be fully reducible to quantities&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mumford, "Quantities and Qualities", University of Nottingham blog post, September 30, 2012.[https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/artsmatters/2012/09/30/quantities-and-qualities/]&lt;/ref&gt; – if there are no qualities, it may become impossible to say what the numbers are numbers of, or what they refer to, except that they refer to other numbers or numerical expressions such as algebraic equations. A measure requires a counting unit defined by a category, but the definition of that category is essentially qualitative; a language which is used to communicate data is difficult to operate, without any qualitative distinctions and categories. We may, for example, transmit a text in binary code, but the binary code does not tell us directly what the text intends.

In creating a [[formal system|formalization]] or [[formal specification]] of a concept, for example for the purpose of measurement, administrative procedure or programming, part of the meaning of the concept may be changed or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Wachter, "How Measurement Fails Doctors and Teachers". ''New York Times'', 16 January 2016.[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/how-measurement-fails-doctors-and-teachers.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if we deliberately program an event according to a concept, it might kill off the spontaneity, spirit, authenticity and motivational pattern which is ordinarily associated with that type of event.

[[Quantification (science)|Quantification]] is not an unproblematic process.&lt;ref&gt;“A well-known quotation usually attributed to Einstein is “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.” I’d amend it to a less eloquent, more prosaic statement: unless we know how things are counted, we don’t know if it’s wise to count on the numbers. The problem isn’t with statistical tests themselves but with what we do before and after we run them. First, we count if we can, but counting depends a great deal on previous assumptions about categorization. (...) Second, after we’ve gathered some numbers relating to a phenomenon, we must reasonably aggregate them into some sort of recommendation or ranking. This is not easy. By appropriate choices of criteria, measurement protocols and weights, almost any desired outcome can be reached." - John Allen Paulos, "Metric Mania", in ''New York Times'', 10 May 2010.[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/magazine/16FOB-WWLN-t.html] Whether Einstein really did originate the quotation which Paulos mentions, is in dispute. The quote is also credited to William Bruce Cameron, ''Informal Sociology, a casual introduction to sociological thinking''. New York: Random House, 1963, p. 13.[http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/]&lt;/ref&gt; To quantify a phenomenon, we may have to introduce special assumptions and definitions which disregard part of the phenomenon in its totality. 
*The economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] concluded that formalization "runs the risk of leaving behind the subjectmatter we are interested in" and "also runs the risk of increasing rather than decreasing the muddle."&lt;ref&gt;J. Coates, "Keynes, vague concepts and fuzzy logic." In: G.C. Harcourt &amp; P.A. Riach (ed.), ''A second edition of the General Theory'', Volume 2.

*[[Michael Polanyi]] stated that "the process of formalizing all knowledge to the exclusion of any [[Tacit knowledge|tacit knowing]] is self-defeating", since to mathematize a concept we need to be able to identify it in the first instance without mathematization.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Polanyi, ''The tacit dimension'' [1966]. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measurement====
Programmers, statisticians or logicians are concerned in their work with the main operational or technical significance of a concept which is specifiable in objective, quantifiable terms. They are not primarily concerned with all kinds of imaginative frameworks associated with the concept, or with those aspects of the concept which seem to have no particular functional purpose – however entertaining they might be. However, some of the qualitative characteristics of the concept may not be quantifiable or measurable at all, at least not directly. The temptation exists to ignore them, or try to infer them from data results.

If, for example, we want to count the number of trees in a forest area with any precision, we have to define what counts as one tree, and perhaps distinguish them from saplings, split trees, dead trees, fallen trees etc. Soon enough it becomes apparent that the quantification of trees involves a degree of abstraction – we decide to disregard some timber, dead or alive, from the population of trees, in order to count those trees that conform to our chosen concept of a tree. We operate in fact with an abstract concept of what a tree is, which diverges to some extent from the true diversity of trees there are. 

Even so, there may be some trees, of which it is not very clear, whether they should be counted as a tree, or not; a certain amount of "fuzziness" in the concept of a tree may therefore remain. The implication is, that the seemingly "exact" number offered for the total quantity of trees in the forest may be much less exact than one might think - it is probably more an estimate or indication of magnitude, rather than an exact description.&lt;ref&gt;What statisticians then often try to do, is to create a model which can predict the magnitude of the difference between the true (accurate and exact) number and the computed number obtained, in this case the true number of trees. Such a model however still relies on imperfect or fallible definitions. Even if fuzzy values are used instead, it is likely that a definite and exact number can never be reached. At most one can say that the number is correct, if the definitions are accepted.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet - and this is the point - the imprecise measure can be very useful and sufficient for all intended purposes.

It is tempting to think, that if something can be measured, it must exist, and that if we cannot measure it, it does not exist. Neither might be true. Researchers try to measure such things as intelligence or gross domestic product, without much scientific agreement about what these things actually are, how they exist, and what the correct measures might be.

When one wants to count and quantify distinct objects using numbers, one needs to be able to distinguish between those separate objects, but if this is difficult or impossible, then, although this may not invalidate a quantitative procedure as such, quantification is not really possible in practice; at best, we may be able to assume or infer indirectly a certain distribution of quantities that must be there. In this sense, scientists often use [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy variables]] to substitute as measures for variables which are known (or thought) to be there, but which themselves cannot be observed or measured directly.

===Vague or fuzzy===
The exact relationship between vagueness and fuzziness is disputed.

====Philosophy====
Philosophers often regard fuzziness as a particular kind of vagueness,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic - beyond the formalism.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider that "no specific assignment of semantic values to vague predicates, not even a fuzzy one, can fully satisfy our conception of what the extensions of vague predicates are like".&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Vagueness and Second-Level Indeterminacy", in: Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying recent literature on how to characterize vagueness, Matti Eklund states that appeal to lack of sharp boundaries, borderline cases and “sorites-susceptible" predicates are the three informal characterizations of vagueness which are most common in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Characterizing Vagueness". ''Philosophy Compass'', 2, 2007, pp. 896-909.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zadeh's argument====
However, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] claimed that "vagueness connotes insufficient [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]], whereas fuzziness connotes unsharpness of [[Class (set theory)|class boundaries]]". Thus, he argued, a sentence like "I will be back in a few minutes" is fuzzy ''but not'' vague, whereas a sentence such as "I will be back sometime", is fuzzy ''and'' vague. His suggestion was that fuzziness and vagueness are logically quite different qualities, rather than fuzziness being a type or subcategory of vagueness. Zadeh claimed that "inappropriate use of the term 'vague' is still a common practice in the literature of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===

In the scholarly inquiry about [[ethics]] and [[meta-ethics]], vague or fuzzy concepts and borderline cases are standard topics of controversy. Central to ethics are theories of "value", what is "good" or "bad" for people and why that is, and the idea of "rule following" as a condition for moral integrity, consistency and non-arbitrary behaviour. 

Yet, if human valuations or moral rules are only vague or fuzzy, then they may not be able to orient or guide behaviour. It may become impossible to operationalize rules. Evaluations may not permit definite moral judgements, in that case. Hence, clarifying fuzzy moral notions is usually considered to be critical for the ethical endeavour as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dougherty, "Vague value", in: ''Philosophy and phenomenological research'', Vol. 89, No. 2, September 2014, pp. 352–372 [https://philpapers.org/archive/DOUVV.pdf]; Tom Dougherty, "Vagueness and Indeterminacy in Ethics". In: Tristram McPherson &amp; David Plunkett, ''The Routledge Handbook of Metaethics''. Oxford: Routledge, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excessive precision====
Nevertheless, [[Scott Soames]] has made the case that vagueness or fuzziness can be ''valuable'' to rule-makers, because "their use of it is valuable to the people to whom rules are addressed".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be more practical and effective to allow for some leeway (and personal responsibility) in the interpretation of how a rule should be applied - bearing in mind the overall purpose which the rule intends to achieve. 

If a rule or procedure is stipulated too exactly, it can sometimes have a result which is contrary to the aim which it was intended to help achieve. For example, "The [[Children and Young Persons Act 2008|Children and Young Persons Act]] could have specified a precise age below which a child may not be left unsupervised. But doing so would have incurred quite substantial forms of arbitrariness (for various reasons, and particularly because of the different capacities of children of the same age)".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rule conflict====
A related sort of problem is, that if the application of a legal concept is pursued too exactly and rigorously, it may have consequences that cause a serious conflict with ''another'' legal concept. This is not necessarily a matter of bad law-making. When a law is made, it may not be possible to anticipate all the cases and events to which it will apply later (even if 95% of possible cases are predictable). The longer a law is in force, the more likely it is, that people will run into problems with it, that were not foreseen when the law was made. 

So, the further implications of one rule may conflict with another rule. "Common sense" might not be able to resolve things. In that scenario, too much precision can get in the way of justice. Very likely a special court ruling wil have to set a norm. The general problem for jurists is, whether "the arbitrariness resulting from precision is worse than the arbitrariness resulting from the application of a vague standard".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===
The definitional disputes about fuzziness remain unresolved so far, mainly because, as anthropologists and psychologists have documented, different languages (or symbol systems) that have been created by people to signal meanings suggest different [[ontology|ontologies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995. [[Gregory Bateson]], ''Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology''. Chicago: University Of Chicago Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply: it is not merely that describing "what is there" involves symbolic representations of some kind. How distinctions are drawn, influences perceptions of "what is there", and vice versa, perceptions of "what is there" influence how distinctions are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Vassos Argyrou, "Anthropology of Magic". In: James D. Wright (ed.), ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioural Sciences''. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2015, 2nd edition, Vol. 14, p. 438. Dominic Hyde, ''Vagueness, Logic and Ontology''. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Ltd, 2008. See also [[object-oriented ontology]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important reason why, as [[Alfred Korzybski]] noted, people frequently confuse the symbolic representation of reality, conveyed by languages and signs, with reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzziness implies, that there exists a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth values between complete truth and complete falsehood. If that is the case, it creates the foundational issue of what, in the case, can justify or prove the existence of the categorical absolutes which are assumed by logical or quantitative inference. If there is an infinite number of shades of grey, how do we know what is totally black and white, and how could we identify that?
====Tegmark====
To illustrate the ontological issues, cosmologist [[Max Tegmark]] argues boldly that the universe consists of math: "If you accept the idea that both space itself, and all the stuff in space, have no properties at all except mathematical properties," then the idea that everything is mathematical "starts to sound a little bit less insane."&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Lewis, "What's the Universe Made Of? Math, Says Scientist." ''Live Science'', 30 January 2014.[http://www.livescience.com/42839-the-universe-is-math.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tegmark moves from the ''[[Epistemology|epistemic]]'' claim that mathematics is the only known symbol system which can in principle express absolutely everything, to the ''[[Methodology|methodological]]'' claim that everything is reducible to mathematical relationships, and then to the ''[[Ontology|ontological]]'' claim, that ultimately everything that exists is mathematical (the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]]). The argument is then reversed, so that ''because'' everything is mathematical in reality, mathematics is ''necessarily'' the ultimate universal symbol system.

The main criticisms of Tegmark's approach are that (1) the steps in this argument do not necessarily follow, (2) no conclusive proof or test is possible for the claim that such an exhaustive mathematical expression or reduction is feasible, and (3) it may be that a complete reduction to mathematics cannot be accomplished, without at least partly altering, negating or deleting a non-mathematical significance of phenomena, experienced perhaps as [[qualia]].&lt;ref&gt;See also Raphael van Riel &amp; Robert Van Gulick, "Scientific reduction". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2014.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reduction/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zalta====
In his [[meta-mathematics|meta-mathematical]] [[metaphysics]], [[Edward N. Zalta]] has claimed that for every set of properties of a concrete object, there ''always'' exists ''exactly'' one abstract object that encodes ''exactly'' that set of properties and no others - a foundational assumption or [[axiom]] for his [[ontology]] of abstract objects&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward N. Zalta]], ''Abstract Objects. An introduction to axiomatic metaphysics''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; By implication, for every fuzzy object there exists always at least one [[defuzzification|defuzzified]] concept which encodes it exactly. It is a modern interpretation of [[Plato]]'s [[Platonic epistemology|metaphysics of knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman Gulley, ''Plato's theory of knowledge''[1962]. Milton Park: Routledge, 2013, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; which expresses confidence in the ability of science to conceptualize the world exactly.

====Platonism====
The Platonic-style interpretation was critiqued by [[Hartry H. Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hartry H. Field]], ''Science without numbers. A defense of nominalism.'' Second edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Balaguer argues that we do not really know whether mind-independent abstract objects exist or not; so far, we cannot prove whether [[Platonic realism]] is definitely true or false.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Balaguer, ''Platonism and Anti-Platonism in Mathematics''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Defending a cognitive realism, [[Scott Soames]] argues that the reason why this unsolvable conundrum has persisted, is because the ultimate constitution of the meaning of concepts and propositions was misconceived.

Traditionally, it was thought that concepts can be truly representational, because ultimately they are related to intrinsically representational Platonic complexes of [[Problem of universals|universals]] and [[particular]]s. However, once concepts and propositions are regarded as cognitive-event types, it is possible to claim that they are able to be representational, because they are constitutively related to intrinsically representational cognitive acts in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the platonic epistemology required by the classic Frege-Russell account... the epistemology of naturalized propositions sees acquaintance with, and knowledge of, propositions as rooted in acquaintance with, and knowledge of, acts and events that make up one's cognitive life" - Scott Soames, ''What is meaning?''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; As another philosopher put it, 
{{Quotation|"The question of how we can know the world around us is not entirely unlike the question of how it is that the food our environment provides happens to agree with our stomachs. Either can become a mystery if we forget that minds, like stomachs, originated in and have been conditioned by a pre-existent natural order."&lt;ref&gt;William Ashley, ''Marxism and moral concepts''. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964, pp. 4-5. Similarly, [[Paul Lafargue]] had written in his essay "The Origin of Abstract Ideas" (1900) that "The brain has the property of thinking as the stomach has that of digesting. It cannot think but by the aid of ideas, which it fabricates with the materials furnished it by the natural environment and the social or artificial environment in which man evolves." [https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1898/xx/abstract.htm]
&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Along these lines, it could be argued that reality, and the human cognition of reality, will inevitably contain some fuzzy characteristics, which can be represented only by concepts which are themselves fuzzy to some or other extent.

==Social science and the media==
The idea of fuzzy concepts has also been applied in the philosophical, sociological and linguistic analysis of human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;John Coates, ''The claims of common sense; Moore, Wittgenstein, Keynes and the social sciences''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology and linguistics===
In a 1973 paper, [[George Lakoff]] analyzed hedges in the interpretation of the meaning of categories.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Lakoff]], "Hedges: A Study in Meaning Criteria and the Logic of Fuzzy Concepts." ''Journal of Philosophical Logic'', Vol. 2, 1973, pp. 458–508.[http://georgelakoff.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/hedges-a-study-in-meaning-criteria-and-the-logic-of-fuzzy-concepts-journal-of-philosophical-logic-2-lakoff-19731.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Ragin]] and others have applied the idea to sociological analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Ragin]], ''Redesigning Social Inquiry: Fuzzy Sets and Beyond''. University of Chicago Press, 2008. Shaomin Li, "Measuring the fuzziness of human thoughts: An application of fuzzy sets to sociological research".

Applications and Methodological Challenges”, November 22–23, 2013, Goethe University Frankfurt.[https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/conpar/download/stoibercaselitzheinelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], [[Taiwan]], [[Iran]], [[Malaysia]], the [[European Union]] and [[Croatia]], economists have used fuzzy concepts to model and measure the underground economy of their country.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Draeseke &amp; David E.A. Giles, "A fuzzy logic approach to modelling the New Zealand underground economy." ''Mathematics and Computers in Simulation'', Vol. 59, No. 1, 2002, pp. 115–123.

In: ''Journal of Information and organizational Sciences'', Vol. 49, No. 1, 2016, pp.83-104.&lt;/ref&gt; Kofi Kissi Dompere applied methods of fuzzy decision, approximate reasoning, negotiation games and fuzzy mathematics to analyze the role of money, information and resources in a "political economy of rent-seeking", viewed as a game played between powerful corporations and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Kissi Dompere, ''Fuzziness, democracy, control and collective decision choice system: a theory on political economy of rent-seeking and profit-harvesting''. Heidelberg: Springer, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A concept may be deliberately created by sociologists as an [[ideal type]] to understand something imaginatively, without any strong claim that it is a "true and complete description" or a "true and complete reflection" of whatever is being conceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Shils &amp; Henry A. Finch (eds.), ''Max Weber on the methodology of the social sciences''. Glencoe, Ill.: The Free Press, 1949, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a more general sociological or journalistic sense, a "fuzzy concept" has come to mean a concept which is meaningful but inexact, implying that it does not exhaustively or completely define the meaning of the phenomenon to which it refers – often because it is too abstract. In this context, it is said that fuzzy concepts "lack clarity and are difficult to test or operationalize".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Markusen, "Fuzzy Concepts, Scanty Evidence, Policy Distance: The Case for Rigour and Policy Relevance in Critical Regional Studies." In: ''Regional Studies'', Volume 37, Issue 6-7, 2003, pp. 701–717.&lt;/ref&gt; To specify the relevant meaning more precisely, additional distinctions, conditions and/or qualifiers would be required.

A few examples can illustrate this kind of usage:
*a handbook of sociology states that "The theory of interaction rituals contains some gaps that need to be filled and some fuzzy concepts that need to be differentiated."&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Rössel and [[Randall Collins]], "Conflict theory and interaction rituals. The microfoundations of conflict theory." In: [[Jonathan H. Turner]] (ed.), ''Handbook of Sociological Theory''. New York: Springer, 2001, p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is, that if finer distinctions are introduced, then the fuzziness or vagueness would be eliminated. 
*a book on youth culture describes [[ethnicity]] as "a fuzzy concept that overlaps at times with concepts of race, minority, nationality and tribe".&lt;ref&gt;Carol Jenkins, "Ethnicity, culture, drugs and sex". In: Peter Aggleton, Andrew Ball and Purnima Mane (eds.), "Sex, Drugs and Young People: International Perspectives." London: Routledge, 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, part of the fuzziness consists in the inability to distinguish precisely between a concept and a different, but closely related concept.
*a book on sociological theory argues that the [[Critical Theory]] of domination faces the problem that "reality itself has become a rather meaningless, fuzzy concept."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Chaplin, ''Sociology and visual representation''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion here is, that the variations in how theoretical concepts are applied have become so large, that the concepts could mean all kinds of things, and therefore are crucially vague (with the implication, that they are not useful any longer for that very reason).
*A history book states: "[[Sodomy]] was a vague and fuzzy concept in [[medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]], and was often associated with a variety of supposedly related moral and criminal offenses, including [[heresy]], [[witchcraft]], [[sedition]], and [[treason]]. St [[Thomas Acquinas]]... categorized sodomy with an assortment of sexual behaviours "from which generation [i.e. procreation] cannot follow".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lynch (ed.), ''Christopher Marlowe: Edward II, with related texts''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2015, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, because a concept is defined by what it excludes, it remains somewhat vague what items of activity it would specifically ''include''.

===Mass media===
The main reason why the term "fuzzy concept" is now often used in describing human behaviour, is that human interaction has many characteristics which are difficult to quantify and measure precisely (although we know that they have magnitudes and proportions), among other things because they are interactive and reflexive (the observers and the observed mutually influence the meaning of events).&lt;ref&gt;[[Loïc Wacquant]], "The fuzzy logic of practical sense." in: [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Loïc Wacquant]], ''An invitation to reflexive sociology''. London: Polity Press, 1992, chapter I section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Those human characteristics can be usefully expressed only in an ''approximate'' way (see [[reflexivity (social theory)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ph. Manning "Fuzzy Description: Discovery and Invention in Sociology". In: ''History of the Human Sciences'', Vol. 7, No. 1, 1994, pp. 117–23.[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&amp;context=clsoc_crim_facpub]&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper stories frequently contain fuzzy concepts, which are readily understood and used, even although they are far from exact. Thus, many of the meanings which people ordinarily use to negotiate their way through life in reality turn out to be "fuzzy concepts". While people often do need to be exact about some things (e.g. money or time), many areas of their lives involve expressions which are far from exact.

Sometimes the term is also used in a [[pejorative]] sense. For example, a [[New York Times]] journalist wrote that [[Prince Sihanouk]] "seems unable to differentiate between friends and enemies, a disturbing trait since it suggests that he stands for nothing beyond the fuzzy concept of peace and prosperity in Cambodia".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Shenon, "Their prince is back: Cambodians are baffled." ''New York Times'', 6 June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied social science===
The use of fuzzy logic in the social sciences and humanities has remained limited until recently. [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] said in a 1994 interview that:

{{Quotation|"I expected people in the social sciences – economics, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, politics, sociology, religion and numerous other areas to pick up on it. It's been somewhat of a mystery to me why even to this day, so few social scientists have discovered how useful it could be."&lt;ref&gt;Betty Blair, "Interview with Lotfi Zadeh, Creator of Fuzzy Logic". ''Azerbaijan International'', Winter 1994, pp. 46–47.[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_fuzzylogic.html]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Two decades later, after a digital [[information explosion]] due to the growing use of the internet and mobile phones worldwide,  fuzzy concepts and fuzzy logic are being widely applied in [[big data]] analysis of social, commercial and psychological phenomena. Many [[sociometry|sociometric]] and [[psychometrics|psychometric]] indicators are based partly on fuzzy concepts and fuzzy variables.

[[Jaakko Hintikka]] once claimed that "the logic of natural language we are in effect already using can serve as a "fuzzy logic" better than its trade name variant without any additional assumptions or constructions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Johan van Benthem]] et al. (eds.), ''The age of alternative logics. Assessing philosophy of logic and mathematics today''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2006, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; That might help to explain why fuzzy logic has not been used much to formalize concepts in the "soft" social sciences. 

[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] rejected such an interpretation, on the ground that in many human endeavours as well as technologies it is highly important to define more exactly "to what extent" something is applicable or true, when it is known that its applicability can vary to some important extent among large populations. Reasoning which accepts and uses fuzzy concepts can be shown to be perfectly valid with the aid of fuzzy logic, because the degrees of applicability of a concept can be more precisely and efficiently defined with the aid of numerical notation.

Another possible explanation for the traditional lack of use of fuzzy logic by social scientists is simply that, beyond basic statistical analysis (using programs such as [[SPSS]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]) the mathematical knowledge of social scientists is often rather limited; they may not know how to formalize and code a fuzzy concept using the conventions of fuzzy logic. The standard software packages used provide only a limited capacity to analyze fuzzy data sets, if at all, and considerable skills are required. 

Yet Jaakko Hintikka may be correct, in the sense that it can be much more efficient to use natural language to denote a complex idea, than to formalize it in logical terms. The quest for formalization might introduce much more complexity, which is not wanted, and which detracts from communicating the relevant issue. Some concepts used in social science may be impossible to formalize exactly, even though they are quite useful and people understand their appropriate application quite well.

==Uncertainty==

Fuzzy concepts can generate [[uncertainty]] because they are imprecise (especially if they refer to a process in motion, or a process of transformation where something is "in the process of turning into something else"). In that case, they do not provide a clear orientation for action or decision-making ("what does X really mean, intend or imply?"); reducing fuzziness, perhaps by applying fuzzy logic,&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Kissi Dompere, ''Fuzziness and approximate reasoning; epistemics on uncertainty, expectation and risk in rational behaviour''. Berlin: Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; might generate more certainty.

===Relevance===
However, this is not necessarily always so.&lt;ref&gt;Masao Mukaidono, ''Fuzzy logic for beginners''. Singapore: World Scientific Publishing, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept, even although it is not fuzzy at all, and even though it is very exact, could equally well fail to capture the meaning of something adequately. That is, a concept can be very precise and exact, but not – or insufficiently – ''applicable'' or ''relevant'' in the situation to which it refers. In this sense, a definition can be "very precise", but "miss the point" altogether.

===Security===
A fuzzy concept may indeed provide ''more'' security, because it provides a meaning for something when an exact concept is unavailable – which is better than not being able to denote it at all. A concept such as [[God]], although not easily definable, for instance can provide security to the believer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Armstrong]], ''The Case for God''. New York: Anchor, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observer effect===
In physics, the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] and [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bohm]], ''Wholeness and the implicate order.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul ARK paperback edition, 1983, p. 86f.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that there is a physical limit to the amount of precision that is knowable, with regard to the movements of subatomic particles and waves. That is, features of physical reality exist, where we can know that they vary in magnitude, but of which we can never know or predict exactly how big or small the variations are. This insight suggests that, in some areas of our experience of the physical world, fuzziness is inevitable and can never be totally removed. Since the [[Universe|physical universe]] itself is incredibly large and diverse, it is not easy to imagine it, grasp it or describe it without using fuzzy concepts.

==Language==
Ordinary language, which uses symbolic conventions and associations which are often not logical, inherently contains many fuzzy concepts – "knowing what you mean" in this case depends partly on knowing the context (or being familiar with the way in which a term is normally used, or what it is associated with). 

This can be easily verified for instance by consulting a [[dictionary]], a [[thesaurus]] or an [[encyclopedia]] which show the multiple meanings of words, or by observing the behaviours involved in ordinary relationships which rely on mutually understood meanings (see also [[Imprecise language]]). [[Bertrand Russell]] regarded ordinary language (in contrast to logic) as intrinsically vague.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell. "Vagueness". In: ''Australasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy'', Vol. 1, pp. 84–92, 1923. Reprinted in: ''Bertrand Russell Papers'', Vol. 9, pp. 147–54. Nadine Faulkner, "Russell and vagueness." ''Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'', Summer 2003, pp. 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicature===
To communicate, receive or convey a [[message]], an individual somehow has to bridge his own intended meaning and the meanings which are understood by others, i.e., the message has to be conveyed in a way that it will be socially understood, preferably in the intended manner. Thus, people might state: "you have to say it in a way that I understand". Even if the message is clear and precise, it may nevertheless not be received in the way it was intended.

Bridging meanings may be done instinctively, habitually or unconsciously, but it usually involves a choice of terms, assumptions or [[symbols]] whose meanings are not completely fixed, but which depend among other things on how the receivers of the message respond to it, or the [[context (language use)|context]]. In this sense, meaning is often "negotiated" or "interactive" (or, more cynically, manipulated). This gives rise to many fuzzy concepts.

The semantic challenge of conveying meanings to an audience was explored in detail, and analyzed logically, by the British philosopher [[Paul Grice]] - using, among other things, the concept of [[implicature]].&lt;ref&gt;A critique of Grice is provided by Wayne A. Davis, ''Implicature: intention, convention, and principle in the failure of Gricean theory.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. An example of a specific application of Gricean theory is: Penelope Brown &amp; Stephen C. Levinson, ''Politeness: some universals in language use''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicature refers to what is ''suggested'' by a message to the recipient, without being either explicitly expressed or logically entailed by its content. The suggestion could be very clear to the recipient (perhaps a sort of code), but it could also be vague or fuzzy.

===Paradoxes===
Even using ordinary [[set theory]] and [[Principle of bivalence|binary logic]] to reason something out, logicians have discovered that it is possible to generate statements which are logically speaking not completely true or imply a [[paradox]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes &amp; George Brecht, ''Vicious Circles and Infinity. An anthology of Paradoxes.'' Penguin Books, 1978. Nicholas Rescher, ''Epistemological Studies''. Frankfurt: Ontos Verlag, 2009, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; even although in other respects they conform to logical rules (see [[Russell's paradox]]). [[David Hilbert]] concluded that the existence of such logical paradoxes tells us "that we must develop a meta-mathematical analysis of the notions of proof and of the axiomatic method; their importance is methodological as well as epistemological".
&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Cantini, "Paradoxes and Contemporary Logic", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 30 April 2012.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradoxes-contemporary-logic/#RusCon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Various different aspects of human experience commonly generate concepts with fuzzy characteristics.
===Human vs. Computer===
The formation of fuzzy concepts is partly due to the fact that the human brain does not operate like a computer (see also [[Chinese room]]).&lt;ref&gt;See further Radim Bělohlávek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.) ''Concepts and Fuzzy Logic''. MIT Press, 2011. [[John R. Searle]], "Minds, brains and programs". ''The behavioral and brain sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 3, 1980, pp. 417–457. [[Robert Epstein]], "The empty brain", ''Aeon'', 18 May 2016.[https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer]&lt;/ref&gt;
*While ordinary computers use strict binary logic gates, the brain does not;  i.e., it is capable of making all kinds of neural associations according to all kinds of ordering principles (or fairly chaotically) in associative patterns which are not logical but nevertheless meaningful. For example, a work of art can be meaningful without being logical. A pattern can be regular, ordered and/or non-arbitrary, hence meaningful, without it being possible to describe it completely or exhaustively in formal-logical terms.
*Something can be meaningful although we cannot name it, or we might only be able to name it and nothing else.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Collins, ''Tacit &amp; explicit knowledge''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Human brains can also interpret the same phenomenon in several different but interacting frames of reference, at the same time, or in quick succession, without there necessarily being an explicit logical connection between the frames (see also [[framing effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]], "The framing of decisions and psychology of choice". ''Science'', Vol. 211, No. 4481, January 1981, pp. 453-458.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[fuzzy-trace theory]], partly inspired by [[Gestalt psychology]], human intuition is a non-arbitrary, reasonable and rational process of cognition; it literally "makes sense" (see also: [[Problem of multiple generality]]).&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Brainerd and V. F. Reyna, “Gist is the grist: fuzzy-trace theory and the new intuitionism”. ''Developmental Review'', Vol. 10, No. 1, March 1990, pp. 3-47, at p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
In part, fuzzy concepts arise also because [[learning]] or the growth of [[understanding]] involves a transition from a vague awareness, which cannot orient behaviour greatly, to clearer insight, which can orient behaviour. At the first encounter with an idea, the sense of the idea may be rather hazy. When more experience with the idea has occurred, a clearer and more precise grasp of the idea results, as well as a better understanding of how and when to use the idea (or not). 

In his study of [[implicit learning]], [[Arthur S. Reber]] affirms that there does not exist a very sharp boundary between the conscious and the unconscious, and "there are always going to be lots of fuzzy borderline cases of material that is marginally conscious and lots of elusive instances of functions and processes that seem to slip in and out of personal awareness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur S. Reber]], ''Implicit learning and tacit knowledge. An essay on the cognitive unconscious''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, an inevitable component of fuzziness exists and persists in human consciousness, because of continual variation of gradations in awareness, along a continuum from the [[conscious]], the [[preconscious]], and the [[subconscious]] to the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]]. The hypnotherapist [[Milton H. Erickson]] noted likewise that the conscious mind and the unconscious normally interact.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H. Erickson, Volume II: human behavior &amp; psychotherapy.'' New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits===
Some psychologists and logicians argue that fuzzy concepts are a necessary consequence of the reality that any kind of distinction we might like to draw has ''limits of application''. At a certain level of generality, a distinction works fine. But if we pursued its application in a very exact and [[rigorous]] manner, or overextend its application, it appears that the distinction simply does not apply in some areas or contexts, or that we cannot fully specify how it should be drawn. An [[analogy]] might be, that zooming a [[telescope]], [[camera]], or [[microscope]] in and out, reveals that a pattern which is sharply focused at a certain distance becomes blurry at another distance, or disappears altogether.

===Complexity===
Faced with any large, complex and continually changing phenomenon, any short statement made about that phenomenon is likely to be "fuzzy", i.e., it is meaningful, but – strictly speaking – incorrect and imprecise.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cornelius Benjamin, "Science and vagueness". In: ''Philosophy of science'', Vol. 6 No. 4, 1939, pp. 422-431.&lt;/ref&gt; It will not really do full justice to the reality of what is happening with the phenomenon. A correct, precise statement would require a lot of elaborations and qualifiers. Nevertheless, the "fuzzy" description turns out to be a useful shorthand that saves a lot of time in communicating what is going on ("you know what I mean").

===Cognition===
In [[psychophysics]], it was discovered that the perceptual distinctions we draw in the mind are often more definite than they are in the real world. Thus, the brain actually tends to "sharpen up" or "enhance" our perceptions of differences in the external world. 
*Between black and white, we are able to detect only a limited number of shades of gray, or colour gradations (there are "[[Absolute threshold|detection thresholds]]").&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Knoblauch, "Color Vision", in: ''Steven's handbook of experimental psychology, Vol 1: sensation and perception'' (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Motion blur]] refers to the loss of detail when a person looks at a fast-moving object, or is moving fast while the eyes are focused on something stationary. In a movie reel, the human eye can detect a sequence of up to 10 or 12 still images per second. At around 18 to 26 frames per second, the brain will "see" the sequence of individual images as a moving scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tarantola, "Why Frame Rate Matters". Gizmodo.com, 14 January 2015.[https://gizmodo.com/why-frame-rate-matters-1675153198]&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are more gradations and transitions in reality, than our conceptual or perceptual distinctions can capture, then it could be argued that how those distinctions will actually apply, must ''necessarily'' become vaguer at some point.

===Novelty===
In interacting with the external world, the human mind may often encounter new, or partly ''new phenomena or relationships'' which cannot (yet) be sharply defined given the background knowledge available, and by known distinctions, associations or generalizations.

{{Quotation|"Crisis management plans cannot be put 'on the fly' after the crisis occurs. At the outset, information is often [[vague]], even contradictory. Events move so quickly that decision makers experience a sense of loss of control. Often denial sets in, and managers unintentionally cut off information flow about the situation" - [[L. Paul Bremer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Paul Bremer]], "Corporate governance and crisis management", in: ''Directors &amp; Boards'', Winter 2002&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Chaos===
It also can be argued that fuzzy concepts are generated by a certain sort of [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] or way of working which evades definite distinctions, makes them impossible or inoperable, or which is in some way chaotic. To obtain concepts which are not fuzzy, it must be possible to [[Test method|test]] out their application in some way. But in the absence of any relevant clear distinctions, lacking an orderly environment, or when everything is "in a state of [[flux]]" or in transition, it may not be possible to do so, so that the amount of fuzziness increases.

==Everyday occurrence==

Fuzzy concepts often play a role in the creative process of forming new concepts to understand something. In the most primitive sense, this can be observed in infants who, through practical experience, learn to identify, distinguish and generalise the correct application of a concept, and relate it to other concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Piaget]] &amp; [[Bärbel Inhelder]], ''The Growth of Logical Thinking from Childhood to Adolescence''. New York: Basic Books, 1958; Philip J. Kelman &amp; Martha E. Arterberry, ''The cradle of knowledge: development of perception in infancy''. Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, fuzzy concepts may also occur in scientific, journalistic, programming and philosophical activity, when a thinker is in the process of clarifying and defining a newly emerging concept which is based on distinctions which, for one reason or another, cannot (yet) be more exactly specified or validated. Fuzzy concepts are often used to denote [[Complexity|complex]] phenomena, or to describe something which is developing and changing, which might involve shedding some old meanings and acquiring new ones.

===Areas===
*In [[meteorology]], where changes and effects of complex interactions in the atmosphere are studied, the weather reports often use fuzzy expressions indicating a broad trend, likelihood or level. The main reason is that the forecast can rarely be totally exact for any given location.
*In [[biology]], protein complexes with multiple structural forms are called [[fuzzy complex]]es. The different conformations can result in different, even opposite functions. The conformational ensemble is modulated by the environmental conditions. Post-translational modifications or alternative splicing can also impact the ensemble and thereby the affinity or specificity of interactions. [[Genetic fuzzy systems]] use [[algorithms]] or [[genetic programming]] which simulate natural evolutionary processes, in order to understand their structures and parameters.
*In [[medical diagnosis]], the assessment of what the symptoms of a patient are often cannot be very exactly specified, since there are many possible qualitative and quantitative gradations in severity, incidence or frequency that could occur.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising, "On the absence of strict boundaries — Vagueness, haziness, and fuzziness in philosophy, science, and medicine". ''Applied Soft Computing'', Vol 8, 2008, pp. 1232–1242, at p. 1235.&lt;/ref&gt; Different symptoms may also overlap to some extent. These gradations can be difficult to measure, it may cost a lot of time and money, and so the medical professionals might use approximate "fuzzy" categories in their judgement of a medical condition or a patient's condition. Although it may not be exact, the diagnosis is often useful enough for treatment purposes. Fuzzy logic is increasingly employed in diagnostic and medical equipment capable of measuring gradations of a condition.&lt;ref&gt;Kazem Sadegh-Zadeh "The Fuzzy Revolution: Goodbye to the Aristotelian Weltanschauung". In: ''Artificial Intelligence in Medicine'', 21, 2001, pp. 18–19.[http://www.iiia.csic.es/~puyol/SEIAD2001/publicacions/sadegh.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[information services]] fuzzy concepts are frequently encountered because a customer or client asks a question about something which could be interpreted in different ways, or, a document is transmitted of a type or meaning which cannot be easily allocated to a known type or category, or to a known procedure. It might take considerable inquiry to "place" the information, or establish in what framework it should be understood.
*In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] which aims to study the structure of subjective experience without preconceptions,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Priest, Theories of the mind. London: Penguin Books, 1991, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; an important insight is that how someone experiences something can be influenced ''both'' by the influence of the thing being experienced itself, but ''also'' by how the person responds to it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammond, Jane Howarth and Russell Keat, ''Understanding Phenomenology''. Oxford: Blackwell, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the actual experience the person has, is shaped by an "interactive object-subject relationship". To describe this experience, fuzzy categories are often necessary, since it is often impossible to predict or describe with great exactitude what the interaction will be, and how it is experienced.
*In [[translation]] work, fuzzy concepts are analyzed for the purpose of good translation. A concept in one language may not have quite the same meaning or significance in another language, or it may not be feasible to translate it literally, or at all.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Griebel, "Fuzzy concepts in translators’ minds". In: Valérie Dullion, ''Between specialised texts and institutional contexts – competence and choice in legal translation''. Amsterdam:  John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2017. (Special issue of ''Translation and Translanguaging in Multilingual Contexts'', Vol. 3, No. 1, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have concepts which do not exist in another language, raising the problem of how one would most easily render their meaning. In [[computer-assisted translation]], a technique called [[Fuzzy matching (computer-assisted translation)|fuzzy matching]] is used to find the most likely translation of a piece of text, using previous translated texts as a basis.
*In [[hypnotherapy]], fuzzy language is deliberately used for the purpose of trance induction. Hypnotic suggestions are often couched in a somewhat vague, general or ambiguous language requiring interpretation by the subject. The intention is to distract and shift the conscious awareness of the subject away from external reality to her own internal state. In response to the somewhat confusing signals she gets, the awareness of the subject spontaneously tends to withdraw inward, in search of understanding or escape.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H.  Erickson, Volume I: hypnosis and hypnotherapy''. New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, p. 106. Joseph O'Connor &amp; John Seymour (ed.), ''Introducing neuro-linguistic programming''. London: Thorsons, 1995, p. 116f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[business]] and [[economics]], it was discovered that "we are guided less by a correct exact knowledge of our self-interest than by a socially learned, evolved, intuitive grasp derived from mental shortcuts ([[Framing effect (psychology)|frames]], reference points, envy, addiction, temptation, fairness)".&lt;ref&gt;Francese Trillas, "Fuzzy logic and modern economics." In:  Rudolf Seising, Enric Trillas &amp; [[Janusz Kacprzyk]] (eds.), ''Towards the future of fuzzy logic''. Basel: Springer International Publishing, 2015, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, economic preferences are often ''fuzzy'' preferences, a highly important point for suppliers of products and services. Fuzzy set empirical methodologies are increasingly used by economic analysts to analyze the extent to which members of a population belong to a specific market category, because that can make a big difference to business results.
*In [[sexology]],  sex and gender are conceptualized by gender pluralists as a spectrum or continuum, or a set of scaled characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Surya Monro, ‘’Bisexuality’’. Houndmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the idea that people are either heterosexual [[men]], heterosexual [[women]], [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]] or [[transsexual]] is far too simplistic; [[gender identity]] is a matter of degree, a graded concept, which for that very reason is a ''fuzzy'' concept with unsharp boundaries. For example, somebody who is "mainly" heterosexual, may occasionally have had non-heterosexual contacts, without this warranting a definite "bisexual" label. A great variety of sexual orientations are possible and can co-exist. In the course of history, typical male or female gender roles and gender characteristics can also gradually change, so that the extent to which they express "masculine" or "feminine" traits is, at any time, a matter of degree, i.e. fuzzy. 
*In [[politics]], it can be highly important and problematic how exactly a conceptual distinction is drawn, or indeed whether a distinction is drawn at all; distinctions used in administration may be deliberately sharpened, or kept fuzzy, due to some political motive or [[Political power|power]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], "Yes, Candidates, There Is a Fuzzy Math". ''New York Times'', 7 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians may be deliberately vague about some things, and very clear and explicit about others; if there is information that proves their case, they become very precise, but if the information doesn't prove their case, they become vague or say nothing. 
*In [[statistical]] research, it is an aim to measure the magnitudes of phenomena. For this purpose, phenomena have to be grouped and categorized, so that distinct and discrete counting units can be defined. It must be possible to allocate all observations to mutually exclusive categories, so that they are properly quantifiable. Survey observations do not spontaneously transform themselves into countable data; they have to be identified, categorized and classified in such a way, that identical observations can be grouped together, and that observations are not counted twice or more.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Gordon &amp; David Bendien, "Standard classifications". ''New Zealand Statistics Review'', September 1993, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; A well-designed questionnaire ensures that the questions are interpreted in the same way by all respondents, and that the respondents are really able to answer them within the formats provided. Again, for this purpose, it is a requirement that the concepts being used are exactly and comprehensibly defined for all concerned, and not fuzzy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Bauer et al., "Vague concepts in survey questions. A general problem illustrated with the left-right scale." SSRN Electronic Journal, April 2014.[http://pablobarbera.com/static/vague-concepts.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; There could be a margin of measurement error, but the amount of error must be kept within tolerable limits, and preferably its magnitude should be known.
*In [[theology]] an attempt is made to define more precisely the meaning of [[spirtuality|spiritual]] concepts, which refer to how human beings construct the meaning of human existence, and, often, the relationship people have with a [[supernatural]] world. Many spiritual concepts and beliefs are fuzzy, to the extent that, although abstract, they often have a highly personalized meaning, or involve personal interpretation of a type that is not easy to define in a cut-and-dried way. A similar situation occurs in [[psychotherapy]]. The Dutch theologian Kees de Groot has explored the imprecise notion that [[psychotherapy]] is like an "implicit [[religion]]", defined as a "fuzzy concept" (it all depends on what one means by "psychotherapy" and "religion").&lt;ref&gt;C.N. de Groot, "Sociology of religion looks at psychotherapy." ''Recherches sociologiques'' (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium), Vol. 29, No. 2, 1998, pp. 3–17 at p. 4.[http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=76988]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher of spirituality [[Ken Wilber]] argued that "nothing is 100% right or wrong", things merely "vary in their degree of incompleteness and dysfunction"; no one and nothing is 100% good or evil, each just varies "in their degree of ignorance and disconnection". This insight suggests, that ''all'' human valuations can be considered as graded concepts, where each qualitative judgement has at least implicitly a sense of quantitative proportion attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Manson, "The rise and fall of Ken Wilber", markmanson.net, 4 June 2012.[https://markmanson.net/ken-wilber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[legal system]], it is essential that rules are interpreted and applied in a standard way, so that the same sorts of cases and the same sorts of circumstances are treated equally. Otherwise one would be accused of arbitrariness,&lt;ref&gt;That is, in applying rules, the rules are not consistently followed, and the pattern of their application therefore does not follow rules.&lt;/ref&gt; which would not serve the interests of justice. Consequently, lawmakers aim to devise definitions and categories which are sufficiently precise, so that they are not open to different interpretations. For this purpose, it is critically important to remove fuzziness, and differences of interpretation are typically resolved through a court ruling based on evidence. Alternatively, some other procedure is devised which permits the correct distinction to be discovered and made.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see e.g. Ralf Posche, "Ambiguity And Vagueness In Legal Interpretation", in: Lawrence M. Solan &amp; Peter M. Tiersma (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law''. Oxford University Press, 2012, pp. 128-144.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Business administration|administration]], [[Archive|archiving]] and [[accounting]], fuzziness problems in interpretation and boundary problems can arise, because it is not clear to what category exactly a case, item, document, transaction or piece of data belongs. In principle, each case, event or item must be allocated to the correct category in a procedure, but it may be, that it is difficult to make the appropriate or relevant distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;David Henry, "Fuzzy Numbers', ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', 3 October 2004.[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-10-03/fuzzy-numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalities===
It could be argued that many concepts used fairly universally in daily life (e.g. "love", "God", "health",  "social", "tolerance" etc.) are ''inherently or intrinsically'' fuzzy concepts, to the extent that their meaning can never be completely and exactly specified with logical operators or objective terms, and can have multiple interpretations, which are at least in part purely subjective. Yet despite this limitation, such concepts are not meaningless. People keep using the concepts, even if they are difficult to define precisely.

===Multiple meanings===
It may also be possible to specify one personal meaning for the concept, without however placing restrictions on a different use of the concept in other contexts (as when, for example, one says "this is what I mean by X" in contrast to other possible meanings). In ordinary speech, concepts may sometimes also be uttered purely randomly; for example a child may repeat the same idea in completely unrelated contexts, or an [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] term may be uttered arbitrarily. A feeling or sense is conveyed, without it being fully clear what it is about.

[[Happiness#definitions|Happiness]] may be an example of a word with variable meanings depending on context.

===Ambiguities===
Fuzzy concepts can be used deliberately to create [[ambiguity]] and [[vagueness]], as an evasive tactic, or to bridge what would otherwise be immediately recognized as a [[contradiction]] of terms. They might be used to indicate that there is definitely a connection between two things, without giving a complete specification of what the connection is, for some or other reason. This could be due to a failure or refusal to be more precise. But it could also could be a prologue to a more exact formulation of a concept, or to a better understanding of it.

==Efficiency==

Fuzzy concepts can be used as a practical method to describe something of which a complete description would be an unmanageably large undertaking, or very time-consuming; thus, a simplified indication of what is at issue is regarded as sufficient, although it is not exact.

===Popper===
There is also such a thing as an "economy of distinctions", meaning that it is not helpful or efficient to use more detailed definitions than are really necessary for a given purpose. In this sense, [[Karl Popper]] rejected [[pedant]]ry and commented that:

{{Quotation| "...it is always undesirable to make an effort to increase precision for its own sake — especially linguistic precision — since this usually leads to loss of clarity, and to a waste of time and effort on preliminaries which often turn out to be useless, because they are bypassed by the real advance of the subject: one should never try to be more precise than the problem situation demands. I might perhaps state my position as follows. Every increase in clarity is of intellectual value in itself; an increase in precision or exactness has only a pragmatic value as a means to some definite end..."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Unended quest: an intellectual autobiography''. London: Routledge, 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The provision of "too many details" could be disorienting and confusing, instead of being enlightening, while a fuzzy term might be sufficient to provide an orientation. The reason for using fuzzy concepts can therefore be purely pragmatic, if it is not feasible or desirable (for practical purposes) to provide "all the details" about the meaning of a shared symbol or sign. Thus people might say "I realize this is not exact, but you know what I mean" – they assume practically that stating all the details is not required for the purpose of the communication.

===Fuzzy logic gambit===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] picked up this point, and drew attention to a "major misunderstanding" about applying fuzzy logic. It is true that the basic aim of fuzzy logic is to make what is imprecise more precise. Yet in many cases, fuzzy logic is used paradoxically to "imprecisiate what is precise", meaning that there is a deliberate tolerance for imprecision for the sake of simplicity of procedure and economy of expression. 

In such uses, there is a tolerance for imprecision, because making ideas more precise would be unnecessary and costly, while "imprecisiation reduces cost and enhances tractability" (tractability means "being easy to manage or operationalize"). Zadeh calls this approach the "Fuzzy Logic Gambit" (a gambit means giving up something now, to achieve a better position later).

In the Fuzzy Logic Gambit, "what is sacrificed is precision in [quantitative] value, but not precision in meaning", and more concretely, "imprecisiation in value is followed by precisiation in meaning". Zadeh cited as example [[Fuzzy control system|Takeshi Yamakawa]]'s programming for an [[inverted pendulum]], where differential equations are replaced by fuzzy if-then rules in which words are used in place of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013. Takeshi Yamakawa "Stabilization of an Inverted Pendulum by a High-speed Fuzzy Logic Controller Hardware System". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Vol.32, pp. 161–180, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuzzy vs. Boolean===
Common use of this sort of approach, particularly in programming, has led some logicians to regard fuzzy logic merely as an extension of [[Boolean logic]] (a [[two-valued logic]] or binary logic is simply replaced with a [[many-valued logic]]). 

However, Boolean concepts have a logical structure which differs from fuzzy concepts. An important feature in Boolean logic is, that an element of a set can also belong to any number of other sets; even so, the element ''either'' does, ''or'' does not belong to a set (or sets). By contrast, whether an element belongs to a fuzzy set is a matter of degree, and not always a definite yes-or-no question.

All the same, the Greek mathematician Costas Drossos suggests in various papers that, using a "non-standard" mathematical approach, we could also construct fuzzy sets with Boolean characteristics and Boolean sets with fuzzy characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. C. A. Drossos, "Foundations of fuzzy sets: A nonstandard approach". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Volume 37, Issue 3, 28 September 1990, pp. 287-307.&lt;/ref&gt; This would imply, that in practice the boundary between fuzzy sets and Boolean sets is itself fuzzy, rather than absolute. For a simplified example, we might be able to state, that a concept ''X'' is definitely applicable to a finite set of phenomena, and definitely not applicable to all other phenomena. Yet, within the finite set of relevant items, ''X'' might be ''fully'' applicable to one subset of the included phenomena, while it is applicable only “to some varying extent or degree” to another subset of phenomena which are also included in the set.

==Clarifying methods==
In [[mathematical logic]], [[computer programming]], [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]] fuzzy concepts can be analyzed and defined more accurately or comprehensively, by describing or modelling the concepts using the terms of [[fuzzy logic]] or other [[substructural logic]]s. More generally, clarification techniques can be used such as:

*1. Contextualizing the concept by defining the setting or situation in which the concept is used, or how it is used appropriately  ([[Context (language use)|context]]).
*2. Identifying the [[intention]], [[purpose]], aim or goal associated with the concept ([[teleology]] and [[design]]).
*3. Comparing and contrasting the concept with related ideas in the present or the past ([[comparative]] and [[comparative research]]).
*4. Creating a [[Conceptual model|model]], likeness, [[analogy]], [[metaphor]], [[prototype]] or [[narrative]] which shows what the concept is about or how it is applied ([[isomorphism]] or [[simulation]]).
*5. ''Probing the [[Presupposition|assumptions]]'' on which a concept is based, or which are associated with its use ([[critical thought]], [[tacit assumption]]).
*6. ''[[Map (mathematics)|Map]]ping or [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]ing'' the applications of the concept using some basic [[parameters]], or using some diagrams or flow charts to understand the relationships between elements involved ([[Visualization (graphics)|visualization]] and [[concept map]]).&lt;ref&gt;Guy W. Mineau et al. (eds.), ''Conceptual graphs for knowledge representation''. Berlin: Springer, 1993. Tru Hoang Cao, ''Conceptual graphs and fuzzy logic''. Berlin: Springer, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*7. Examining ‘’how likely’’ it is that the concept applies, statistically or intuitively ([[probability theory]]).
*8. Specifying relevant ''conditions'' to which the concept applies, as a procedure ([[computer programming]], [[formal concept analysis]]).
*9. [[Abstract and concrete|Concretizing]] the concept – finding specific examples, illustrations, details or cases to which it applies ([[Exemplification theory|exemplar]], [[exemplification]]).
*10. ''Reducing or restating'' fuzzy concepts in terms which are simpler or similar, and which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy ([[Computer algebra#Simplification|simplification]], [[dimensionality reduction]], [[plain language]], [[KISS principle]] or [[concision]]).
*11. Trying out a concept, by using it in interactions, practical work or in communication, and assessing the feedback to understand how the boundaries and distinctions of the concept are being drawn ([[trial and error]] or [[pilot experiment]]). 
*12. Engaging in a structured [[dialogue]] or repeated [[discussion]], to exchange ideas about how to get specific about what it means and how to clear it up ([[Scrum (software development)|scrum method]]).
*13. Allocating different applications of the concept to different but related ''sets'' ([[Boolean logic]]).
*14. Identifying ''operational rules'' defining the use of the concept, which can be stated in a language and which cover all or most cases ([[material conditional]]).
*15. [[Categorization|Classifying, categorizing, grouping]], or inventorizing all or most cases or uses to which the concept applies ([[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], [[cluster analysis]] and [[typology (statistics)|typology]]).
[[File:Operationalization of Free and Fair Judiciary.png|thumb|400px|An [[operationalization]] diagram, one method of clarifing fuzzy concepts.]]
*16. Applying a ''[[meta-language]]'' which includes fuzzy concepts in a more inclusive categorical system which is not fuzzy ([[meta]]).
*17. Creating a ''[[Measurement|measure]] or [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]]'' of the degree to which the concept applies ([[metrology]]).
*18. Examining the ''distribution patterns'' or distributional frequency of (possibly different) uses of the concept ([[statistics]]).
*19. Specifying a series of [[logical operators]] or inferential system which captures all or most cases to which the concept applies ([[algorithm]]).
*20. ''Relating'' the fuzzy concept to other concepts which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy, or simply by ''replacing'' the fuzzy concept altogether with another, alternative concept which is not fuzzy yet "works the same way" ([[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]])
*21. Engaging in [[meditation]], or taking the proverbial "run around the block" to clarify the mind, and thus improve precision of thought about the definitional issue ([[self-care]]).

In this way, we can obtain a more exact understanding of the meaning and use of a fuzzy concept, and possibly decrease the amount of fuzziness. It may not be possible to specify all the possible meanings or applications of a concept completely and exhaustively, but if it is possible to capture the majority of them, statistically or otherwise, this may be useful enough for practical purposes.

==Defuzzification==
{{main|Defuzzification}}
A process of [[defuzzification]] is said to occur, when fuzzy concepts can be logically described in terms of [[fuzzy set]]s, or the relationships between fuzzy sets, which makes it possible to define variations in the meaning or applicability of concepts as ''quantities''. Effectively, qualitative differences are in that case described more precisely as quantitative variations, or quantitative variability. Assigning a numerical value then denotes the magnitude of variation along a scale from zero to one.

The difficulty that can occur in judging the fuzziness of a concept can be illustrated with the question ''"Is this one of those?"''. If it is not possible to clearly answer this question, that could be because "this" (the object) is itself fuzzy and evades definition, or because "one of those" (the concept of the object) is fuzzy and inadequately defined.

Thus, the source of fuzziness may be in (1) the nature of the reality being dealt with, (2) the concepts used to interpret it, or (3) the way in which the two are being related by a person.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that the personal meanings which people attach to something are quite clear to the persons themselves, but that it is not possible to communicate those meanings to others except as fuzzy concepts.

Sally Fuller and Ramon Aldag argue that group [[decision-making]] models have been operating under too narrow of a focus due to the overemphasis of the [[groupthink]] phenomenon.&lt;ref name="ggps_model"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/2323226/The_GGPS_Model_Broadening_the_perspective_on_group_problem_solving | title=The GGPS Model: Broadening the perspective on group problem solving | work=Groups at work: Theory and research | date=2001 | accessdate=11 December 2014 | last1=Fuller | first1=Sally R. | last2=Aldag | first2=Ramon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="groupthink_janis"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/scie/Career/Wisdom/groupthink1.htm | title=Groupthink | work=Psychology Today | date=November 1971 | accessdate=11 December 2014 | author=Janis, Irving L. | pages=43-46, 74-76 | quote=Groupthink is a psychological terminology used to describe the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive ingroup that it tends to override realistic appraisal of alternative courses of action.

The symptoms of groupthink arise when the members of decision-making groups become motivated to avoid being too harsh in their judgments of their leaders' or their colleagues' ideas.  People would adopt a soft line of criticism and avoid conflict, even in their own thinking.  At meetings, all members are amiable and seek complete concurrence, which is likely to be recognized erroneously as consensus, on every important issue.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="groupthink_victims"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Victims_of_Groupthink.html?id=FB13AAAAMAAJ | title=Victims of Groupthink: A Psychological Study of Foreign-Policy Decisions and Fiascoes | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | accessdate=11 December 2014 | author=Janis, Irving L. | year=1972 | isbn=9780395140024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to them, group decision-making has often been framed in relative isolation, ignoring context and real-world circumstances, which is a likely consequence of testing group decision-making in laboratory studies. They claim that the groupthink model is overly deterministic and an unrealistically restrictive depiction of the group problem-solving process.” &lt;ref name="ggps_model" /&gt; To address these problems, they propose a new model that incorporates elements of group decision-making processes from a broader, more comprehensive perspective, offering a more general and generalizable framework for future research.&lt;ref name="fiasco"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1993-29328-001 | title=Beyond fiasco: a reappraisal of the groupthink phenomenon and a new model of group decision processes | author=Aldag, R.J. | last2=Fuller | first2=S.R. | journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=May 1993  | volume=113 | issue=3 | pages=533-552 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.3.533 | quote=...research does not provide convincing support for the validity of the groupthink phenomenon or for the suggestion that groupthink characteristics lead to negative outcomes. This review, coupled with evidence from other literature suggested by a problem-solving perspective and a direct examination of groupthink implicit assumptions, guided the development of a new, more general model termed the general group problem-solving model. This model incorporates a variety of antecedent conditions, emergent group characteristics, decision process characteristics, and group decision outcomes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model includes elements of [[Irving Janis|Irving Janis's]] original model (1977), but only those that have been consistently supported by the literature.&lt;ref name="decision_making"&gt;{{cite book | title=Decision making: a psychological analysis of conflict, choice, and commitment | publisher=Free Press | author=Janis, Irving L. | year=1977 | isbn=9780029161609 | last2=Mann | first2=Leon}}&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the differences between the two models, we briefly summarize both Janis's model and the '''GGPS-model''' first.

==The original groupthink model==
Janis defines groupthink as “the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive in-group that it tends to over-ride realistic appraisals of alternative courses of action.”&lt;ref name="groupthink_janis" /&gt; In a subsequent article, he elaborates on this by saying: “I use the term "groupthink" as a quick and easy way to refer to a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.  Groupthink refers to a deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment that results from in-group pressures.”&lt;ref name="groupthink_victims" /&gt;
All this suggests that the original groupthink model was proposed for a rather specific situation, and Janis states that we can only call a phenomenon groupthink if all the warning signs are present (see [[Groupthink#Symptoms|groupthink symptoms]]).

[[File:Groupthink schematic.JPG|Groupthink schematic]]{{or|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref name="decision_making" /&gt;

==The GGPS-model==
The GGPS-model (developed by Ramon Aldag and Sally Fuller) broadens the perspectives, incorporating elements of the original groupthink model, in a fashion that creates a more widely applicable schematic.
Two key differences should be noted in comparison to Janis’ model:

# The GGPS model presents elements of the group problem-solving process in a value-neutral manner. The groupthink model is restrictive and deterministic in the sense that numerous elements are phrased to suggest that certain aspects of the process are pathological, such as ”too few alternatives”.  The GGPS model suggests no such assumptions in its terms, and recasts this term as ”number of alternatives”. 
# Fuller and Aldag argue that a comprehensive model has to reflect the political environment of the real world and real workplaces. Thus, the GGPS model considers a larger set of antecedents than the groupthink model, among these are group type, leader power, organizational political norms etc.

===Elements of the GGPS model===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
====Antecedents====

Three sets of [[Antecedent_(logic)|antecedents]] are proposed by GGPS: decision characteristics, group structure and decision-making context.

=====Decision characteristics=====
Elements belonging here are the importance of the decision, time pressure, structure, procedural requirements, and task characteristics.

''Examples'': whether the task is simple or complex will make a substantial difference in required member input, as well as in whether a directive leader is necessary. Group interaction is also altered if, given a task, a single correct answer exists and if it becomes obvious to any of the members, since subsequent group interaction will likely be reduced.

=====Group structure=====
Elements are cohesiveness, members’ homogeneity, insulation of the group, leader impartiality, leader power, history of the group, probability of future interaction, stage of group development and type of group.

''Examples'': whether group members anticipate to work together again in the future can have a major impact on to what degree can political motives influence the process. If it’s unlikely that the group will come together again, political influence can be lessened. Stage of group development is important because members of  mature group with a long history may feel more comfortable challenging each other’s ideas, thus cohesiveness results in quality decision making and positive outcomes.

=====Decision making context=====
Elements are organizational political norms, member political motives, prior discussion of issue, prior goal attainment, goal definition, and degree of stress from external threat.

''Examples'': whether group members identified and pursue a unitary goal or they have multiple, discrepant goals influences the rationality of the decision-making process. Members’ political motives also make a tremendous difference, if individuals have a vested interest in certain outcomes, or there are one or more coalitions present, behavior in the decision making process could be altered.

====Emergent group characteristics====

The model differentiates two categories of emergent group characteristics: group perceptions and processes.

=====Group Perceptions=====
These include members’ perceptions of the group’s vulnerability, the inherent morality of the group, member unanimity, and views of opposing groups.

=====Group Processes=====
These include the group’s response to negative feedback, treatment of dissenters, [[self-censorship]], and use of [[mindguard]]s.

====Decision process characteristics====

Decision process characteristics are grouped in terms of the first three stages of group problem-solving processes: problem identification, alternative generation and evaluation and choice. Implementation and control stages are not included because they follow the actual decision, but some variables preparing for those stages are indeed included (e.g. development of contingency plans and gathering of control-related information).

=====Problem identification=====
Elements of this stage are predecisional information search, survey of objectives, and explicit problem definition.

''Example'': if members of the group fail to explicitly or correctly define the problem, there is a chance that they will solve the wrong problem.

=====Alternative generation=====
Elements are number of alternatives and quality of alternatives.

''Example'': in generating alternatives, it’s important to differentiate quality and quantity of alternative ideas generated. Some group processes, such as brainstorming, are directed towards generating large numbers of ideas, with the assumption that it will lead to a superior alternative. Defective processes, on the other hand, might lead to large numbers of low quality ideas.

=====Evaluation and choice=====
Elements are information processing quality, the source of the initial selection of a preferred alternative, emergence of preferred alternative, group decision rule, timing of convergence, reexamination of preferred and rejected alternatives, source of the final solution, development of contingency plans, and gathering of control-related information.

''Example'': whether the group decides based on a majority rule or a consensus has to be reached, makes a great difference in the process. If a consensus is to be reached, dissent could be discouraged, because dissenters could elongate and jeopardize the process. With a majority rule, dissent is more acceptable.

====Outcomes====

The GGPS model includes an array of decision, political and affective outcomes.

'''''Decision outcomes''''': include acceptance of the decision by those affected by it and/or those who have to implement it, adherence to the decision, implementation success, and decision quality.

''Example'': if the leader of the group is not satisfied with the decision, he/she might unilaterally reverse it.

'''''Political outcomes''''': include future motivation of the leader, future motivation of the group and future use of the group.

''Example'': if the outcome did not satisfy the political agenda of the leader, he/she might use the group less or not at all in the future.

'''''Affective outcomes''''': include satisfaction with the leader, satisfaction with the group process and satisfaction with the decision.

''Example'': whether members are content with the fairness of the group process, whether trust was developed and preserved, or whether commitment to the decision is strong will greatly influence the group’s future functioning.

This results in the placebo suppression of medical symptoms.

==Evolutionary medicine==

Since [[Hippocrates]], it has been recognized that the body has self-healing powers ([[vis medicatrix naturae]]). Modern [[evolutionary medicine]] identifies them with physiologically based self-treatments that provide the body with [[prophylactic]], healing, or restorative capabilities against injuries, infections and physiological disruption.  Examples include:

* [[Immunity (medical)|Immune responses]]
* [[Fever]]
* [[Sickness behavior]]
* [[Nausea]]
* [[Morning sickness]]
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|Hypoferremia]]
* [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]]
* [[pain#Evolutionary and behavioral role|Pain]]

These evolved self-treatments deployed by the body are experienced by humans as unpleasant and unwanted illness [[symptoms]].

==Deployment==

Such self-treatments according to evolutionary medicine are deployed to increase an individual’s  [[biological fitness]].

Two factors affect their deployment.

First, it is usually advantageous to deploy them on a [[precautionary principle|precautionary basis]].&lt;ref  name="Nesse"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03472.x |author=Nesse RM |authorlink=Randolph M. Nesse |title=The smoke detector principle. Natural selection and the regulation of defensive responses |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=935 |issue= |pages=75–85 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11411177 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0077-8923&amp;date=2001&amp;volume=935&amp;spage=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, it will often turn out that they have been deployed apparently unnecessarily, though this has in fact been advantageous since in probabilistic terms they have provided an insurance against a potentially costly outcome. As Nesse notes: "Vomiting, for example, may cost only a few hundred calories and a few minutes, whereas not vomiting may result in a 5% chance of death" page 77.&lt;ref  name="Nesse"/&gt;

Second, self-treatments are costly both in using energy, and also in their risk of damaging the body.

* Immunity – energy for activating lymphocyte and antibody production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lochmiller R, Deerenberg C |title=Trade-offs in evolutionary immunology: just what is the cost of immunity? |journal=Oikos |volume=88 |issue= |pages=87–98 |year=2000 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880110.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Romanyukha06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Romanyukha AA, Rudnev SG, Sidorov IA |title=Energy cost of infection burden: an approach to understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions |journal=J.

* Fever – energy (each 1&amp;nbsp;°C raise in blood temperature increases energy expenditure by  10–15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodriguez DJ, Sandoval W, Clevenger FW |title=Is measured energy expenditure correlated to injury severity score in major trauma patients? |journal=J.

Surg. |volume=161 |issue= 1|pages=140–7 |date=January 1965 |pmid=14252624 |pmc=1408758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 90% of the total cost of fighting [[pneumonia]] goes on increased body temperature.&lt;ref name=Romanyukha06/&gt; There is also the risk of [[hyperpyrexia]].
* Sickness behavior – restricted ability by an animal to forage and defend itself
* Nausea – loss of food nutrients, and potential risk of [[Vomiting#Complications|aspiration]]
* Morning sickness – loss of food nutrients when a mother needs additional, not less, nourishment
* Hypoferremia – impairment in biological processes needing iron resulting in [[iron deficiency anemia]]
* Depression – [[Evolutionary approaches to depression|impaired activity and problem solving]].
* Pain – restricted movement and the [[Chronic pain#Related sequelae|inability to concentrate]]

One factor in deployment is low level physiological control by [[proinflammatory cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]] triggered by bacterial [[lipopolysaccharides]] (LPS).

Another is [[Neural top down control of physiology|higher level control]] in which the brain takes into account what it learns about circumstances and how that makes it well and ill. [[Classical conditioning|Conditioning]] shows the existence of such learnt control: give saccharin paired in a drink with a drug that creates [[immunosuppression]], and later on, giving saccharin alone will produce immunosuppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ader R, Cohen N |title=Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=333–40 |year=1975 |pmid=1162023 |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1162023 |doi=10.1097/00006842-197507000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nlme.1995.1048 |vauthors=Alvarez-Borda B, Ramírez-Amaya V, Pérez-Montfort R, Bermúdez-Rattoni F |title=Enhancement of antibody production by a learning paradigm |journal=Neurobiol Learn Mem |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=103–5 |date=September 1995 |pmid=7582817 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1074742785710489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00031-4 |vauthors=Oberbeck R, Kromm A, Exton MS, Schade U, Schedlowski M |title=Pavlovian conditioning of endotoxin-tolerance in rats |journal=Brain Behav.

==Cost benefit analysis==

=== Economic resource management===
Evolution, according to [[Nicholas Humphrey]], has selected an internal health management system that uses [[cost benefit analysis]] upon whether the deployment of a self-treatment aids [[biological fitness]], and so should be activated. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;a specially designed procedure for “economic resource management” that is, I believe, one of the key features of the “natural health-care service” which has evolved in ourselves and other animals to help us deal throughout our lives with repeated bouts of sickness, injury, and other threats to our well-being.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An analogy is explicitly made with the [[health economics]] consideration used in management decisions involving external medical treatment.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, if you wonder about this choice of managerial terminology for talking about biological healing systems, I should say that it is quite deliberate (and so is the pun on NHS.) With the phrase “natural health-care service” I do intend to evoke, at a biological level, all the economic connotations that are so much a part of modern health-care in society.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===External medications===
External medications will affect the cost benefits advantages of deploying an evolved self-treatment. Some animals use [[Zoopharmacognosy|external ones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engel, Cindy |title=Wild Health : Lessons in Natural Wellness from the Animal Kingdom |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-618-34068-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wildlife|Wild animals]], including [[apes]],  do so in the form of ingested [[geophagy|detoxifying clays]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klein N, Fröhlich F, Krief S |title=Geophagy: soil consumption enhances the bioactivities of plants eaten by chimpanzees |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=325–31 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18188538 |doi=10.1007/s00114-007-0333-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; rough leaves that clear gut parasites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fowler A, Koutsioni Y, Sommer V |title=Leaf-swallowing in Nigerian chimpanzees: evidence for assumed self-medication |journal=Primates |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=73–6 |date=January 2007 |pmid=16897194 |doi=10.1007/s10329-006-0001-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pharmacologically active plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1079/PNS2003257 |author=Huffman MA |title=Animal self-medication and ethno-medicine: exploration and exploitation of the medicinal properties of plants |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=371–81 |date=May 2003 |pmid=14506884 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0031-9384(94)90368-9 |vauthors=Koshimizu K, Ohigashi H, Huffman MA |title=Use of Vernonia amygdalina by wild chimpanzee: possible roles of its bitter and related constituents |journal=Physiol. Behav. |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=1209–16 |date=December 1994 |pmid=7878093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Complementary to this, research finds that animals have the ability to select and prefer substances that aid their recuperation from illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.173.3998.749 |vauthors=Green KF, Garcia J |title=Recuperation from illness: flavor enhancement for rats |journal=Science |volume=173 |issue=3998 |pages=749–51 |date=August 1971 |pmid=5568508 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=5568508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social support===
The welfare of social animals (including humans) depends upon other individuals ([[Tend and befriend|social buffering]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kikusui T, Winslow JT, Mori Y |title=Social buffering: relief from stress and anxiety |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. |volume=361 |issue=1476 |pages=2215–28 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17118934 |pmc=1764848 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1941 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17118934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actuarial assessments of the costs and benefits of deploying a self-treatment therefore will depend upon the presence, or not, of  other individuals. The presence of helpful others will affect, for example, the risk of predators when incapacitated, and—in those case in which animals do this (such as humans)—the provision of food, and care during sickness.

The health management system factors in the presence of such external treatment and social support as one aspect of the circumstances needed to determine whether it is advantageous to deploy or not an evolved self-treatment.

==Placebos==

===False information===
All humans societies use external medications, and some individuals exist that are considered to have special [[healers|healing]] knowledge about illnesses and their treatments. Humans are also usually supportive to those in their group. The availability of these things will affect the cost benefits of the body deploying its own biological ones. This could, in turn, lead to the health management system (given its beliefs (information) about treatments and support) to deploy or not, or doing so differently, the body’s own treatments.

Nicholas Humphrey describes how the health management system explains placebos – an external treatment without direct physiological effects – as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose, for example, a doctor gives someone who is suffering an infection a pill that she rightly believes to contain an antibiotic: because her hopes will be raised she will no doubt make appropriate adjustments to her health-management strategy – lowering her precautionary defences in anticipation of the sickness not lasting long.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The health management system, in other words, when faced with an infection is tricked into making a mistaken cost benefit analysis using false information. The effect of that false information is that the benefits of the self-treatment cease to outweigh its costs. As a result, it is not deployed, and an individual does not experience unwanted medical symptoms.

===Lack of harm===
Failure to deploy an evolved self-treatment need not put an individual at risk since evolution has advantaged their deployment on a precautionary basis.&lt;ref  name="Nesse"/&gt; As Nicholas Humphrey notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt; many of the health-care measures we’ve been discussing are precautionary measures designed to protect from dangers that lie ahead in an uncertain future. Pain is a way of making sure you give your body rest just in case you need it. Rationing the use of the immune system is a way of making sure you have the resources to cope with renewed attacks just in case they happen. Your healing systems are basically tending to be cautious, and sometimes over-cautious, as if working on the principle of better safe than sorry.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, not deploying an evolved self-treatment, and so not having a medical symptom due to placebo false information might be without consequence.

==Central governor==

The health management system’s idea of a top down neural control of the body is also found in the idea that a [[central governor]] regulates [[muscle weakness|muscle fatigue]] to protect the body from the harmful effects (such as [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]] and [[hyperglycemia]]) of over prolonged exercise.

The idea of a fatigue governor was first proposed in 1924 by the 1922 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Archibald Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill AV, Long CN, Lupton H |title=Muscular exercise, lactic acid and the supply and utilisation of oxygen. Parts I–III |journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. |volume=97 |pages=438–75 |year=1924 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/k51611345m783727/fulltext.pdf }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, on the basis of modern research, by  [[Tim Noakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00007256-200333030-00001  |vauthors=St Clair Gibson A, Baden DA, Lambert MI, etal |title=The conscious perception of the sensation of fatigue |journal=Sports Med |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=167–76 |year=2003 |pmid=12656638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Noakes TD, St Clair Gibson A, Lambert EV |title=From catastrophe to complexity: a novel model of integrative central neural regulation of effort and fatigue during exercise in humans: summary and conclusions |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=120–4 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15665213 |pmc=1725112 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2003.010330 |url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15665213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Noakes TD, Peltonen JE, Rusko HK |title=Evidence that a central governor regulates exercise performance during acute hypoxia and hyperoxia |journal=J.

Like with the health management system, the central governor shares the idea that much of what is attributed to low level feedback homeostatic regulation is, in fact, due to [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top down]] control by the brain.  The advantage of this top down management is that the brain can enhance such regulation by allowing it to be modified by information. For example, in endurance running, a [[Cost-benefit analysis|cost benefit]] trade exists off between the advantages of continuing to run, and the risk if this is too prolonged that it might harm the body. Being able to regulate fatigue in terms of information about the benefits and costs of continued exercise would enhance biological fitness.

Low level theories exist that suggest that fatigue is due  mechanical failure of the exercising muscles ("peripheral fatigue").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards RHT |chapter=Biochemical bases for fatigue in exercise performance: catastrophe theory in muscular fatigue |veditors=Knuttgen HG, Vogel JA, Poortmans J |title=Biochemistry of exercise |publisher=Human Kinetics |location=Champaign, IL |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-608-07112-1 |pages=1–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such low level theories do not explain why running muscle fatigue is affected by information relevant to cost benefit trade offs. For example, [[marathon]] runners can carry on running longer if told they are near the finishing line, than far away. The existence of a central governor can explain this effect.

[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Plato]], one of the first philosophers to discuss ideas in detail. Aristotle claims that many of Plato's views were [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] in origin.]]
In [[philosophy]], '''ideas''' are usually taken as [[mental representation]]al images of some [[object (philosophy)|object]]. Ideas can also be [[abstraction|abstract]] [[concept]]s that do not present as mental images.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Audi|editor1-first=Robert|title=Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-40224-7|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[philosophers]] have considered ideas to be a fundamental [[ontological]] [[category of being]]. The capacity to [[creativity|create]] and [[understanding|understand]] the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of [[human|human beings]]. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious [[introspection|reflection]], for example, when we talk about the ''idea'' of a person or a place. A new or original idea can often lead to [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeytimes.com/ideas/312/What_is_an_Idea/ |title=What is an Idea? |year=2011 |work=AeyTimes Idea Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''idea'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]] ''idea'' "form, pattern," from the root of ἰδεῖν ''idein'', "to see." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/idea |title=Definition of ''idea'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innate and adventitious ideas==
{{Main|Innate idea}}
One view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas (called ''innate ideas'') which are so general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our [[perception]] but rather were in some sense always present. These are distinguished from ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas/ adventitious ideas]'' which are images or concepts which are accompanied by the judgment that they are caused or occasioned by an external object.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"/&gt;

Another view holds that we only discover ideas in the same way that we discover the real world, from personal experiences. The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from [[nurture]] (life experiences) is known as ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate"). Most of the confusions in the way ideas arise is at least in part due to the use of the term "idea" to cover both the representation perceptics and the object of conceptual thought. This can be always illustrated in terms of the scientific doctrines of [[innate idea]]s, "[[abstract object|concrete ideas]] versus [[abstraction|abstract ideas]]", as well as "simple ideas versus complex ideas".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-02-894950-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-02-894950-5}} Vol 4: 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Plato===
{{main|Theory of Forms}}
[[Plato]] in [[Ancient Greece]] was one of the earliest philosophers to provide a detailed discussion of ideas and of the thinking process (it must be noted that in Plato's Greek the word ''idea'' carries a rather different sense from our modern English term). Plato argued in dialogues such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Symposium'', ''Republic'', and ''Timaeus'' that there is a realm of ideas or forms (''eidei''), which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas, and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge, for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties, ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are. Consequently, Plato seems to assert forcefully that material things can only be the objects of opinion; real knowledge can only be had of unchanging ideas. Furthermore, ideas for Plato appear to serve as universals; consider the following passage from the ''Republic'':
{{quote|
"We both assert that there are," I said, "and distinguish in speech, many fair things, many good things, and so on for each kind of thing."

"Yes, so we do."

"And we also assert that there is a fair itself, a good itself, and so on for all things that we set down as many. Now, again, we refer to them as one ''idea'' of each as though the ''idea'' were one; and we address it as that which really ''is''."

"That's so."

"And, moreover, we say that the former are seen, but not intellected, while the ''ideas'' are intellected but not seen."|Plato|Bk. VI 507b-c}}

===René Descartes===
[[Descartes]] often wrote of the meaning of ''idea'' as an image or representation, often but not necessarily "in the mind", which was well known in the [[vernacular]]. Despite that Descartes is usually credited with the invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at first followed this vernacular use.&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' he says, "Some of my thoughts are like images of things, and it is to these alone that the name 'idea' properly belongs." He sometimes maintained that ideas were [[innate idea|innate]] &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; and uses of the term ''idea'' diverge from the original primary scholastic use. He provides multiple non-equivalent definitions of the term, uses it to refer to as many as six distinct kinds of entities, and divides ''ideas'' inconsistently into various genetic categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas Descartes's Ideas]&lt;/ref&gt; For him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep consideration of these entities.

===John Locke===
In striking contrast to Plato's use of idea &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 487–503&lt;/ref&gt; is that of [[John Locke]]. In his Introduction to [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], Locke defines ''idea'' as "that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm, notion, species, or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking; and I could not avoid frequently using it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |wslink=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding/Introduction |section=Introduction |first=John |last=Locke |at=§ What Idea stands for.|year=1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he regarded the book necessary to examine our own abilities and see what objects our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. In his philosophy other outstanding figures followed in his footsteps — Hume and Kant in the 18th century, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in the 19th century, and [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Karl Popper]] in the 20th century. Locke always believed in ''good sense'' — not pushing things to extremes and on taking fully into account the plain facts of the matter. He considered his common-sense ideas "good-tempered, moderate, and down-to-earth."

As John Locke studied humans in his work “An Essay Concerning Human Understanding” he continually referenced Descartes for ideas as he asked this fundamental question: “When we are concerned with something about which we have no certain knowledge, what rules or standards should guide how confident we allow ourselves to be that our opinions are right?” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding." (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions.&lt;/ref&gt; A simpler way of putting it is how do humans know ideas, and what are the different types of ideas. An idea to Locke “can simply mean some sort of brute experience.” &lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, John R. Starting with Mill. Continuum, 2010. Starting With. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true &amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344063&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that there are “No innate principles in the mind.”.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he concludes that “our ideas are all experiential in nature.” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; An experience can either be a sensation or a reflection: “consider whether there are any innate ideas in the mind before any are brought in by the impression from sensation or reflection.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, an idea was an  experience in which the human mind apprehended something.

In a Lockean view, there are really two types of ideas: complex and simple. Simple ideas  are the building blocks for much more complex ideas, and “While the mind is wholly passive in the reception of simple ideas, it is very active in the building of complex ideas…” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct= true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex ideas, therefore, can either be modes, substances, or relations. Modes are when ideas are combined in order to convey new information. For instance, David Banach &lt;ref&gt;Banach, David. "Locke on Ideas." Locke on Ideas. St. Anselm College, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; gives the example of beauty as a mode. He says that it is the combination of color and form. Substances, however, is different. Substances are certain objects, that can either be dogs, cats, or tables. And relations represent the relationship between two or more ideas.  In this way, Locke did, in fact, answer his own questions about ideas and humans.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume|Hume]] differs from Locke by limiting ''idea'' to the more or less vague mental reconstructions of perceptions, the perceptual process being described as an "impression." &lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Idea |volume=14 |pages=280–281 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 74–90&lt;/ref&gt; Hume shared with Locke the basic empiricist premise that it is only from life experiences (whether their own or others') that humans' knowledge of the existence of anything outside of themselves can be ultimately derived, that they shall carry on doing what they are prompted to do by their emotional drives of varying kinds. In choosing the means to those ends, they shall follow their accustomed associations of ideas.&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; Hume has contended and defended the notion that "reason alone is merely the 'slave of the passions'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#inmo |title=Hume's Moral Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David: A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects. (1739–40)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Printing4 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|left|thumb|135px|"Modern Book Printing" from the [[Walk of Ideas]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] defines an ''idea'' as opposed to a ''[[Concept#A priori concepts|concept]]''. "Regulative ideas" are ideals that one must tend towards, but by definition may not be completely realized. [[Liberty]], according to Kant, is an idea. The [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of the rational and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] is opposed to the [[determinism]] of the [[empirical]] subject.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 305–324&lt;/ref&gt; Kant felt that it is precisely in knowing its limits that philosophy exists. The business of philosophy he thought was not to give rules, but to analyze the private judgements of good common sense.&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

===Rudolf Steiner===
Whereas Kant declares limits to knowledge ("we can never know the thing in itself"), in his [[epistemological]] work, [[Rudolf Steiner]] sees ''ideas'' as "objects of experience" which the mind apprehends, much as the eye apprehends light. In ''[[Goethean Science]]'' (1883), he declares, "Thinking ... is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colors and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas." He holds this to be the premise upon which [[Goethe]] made his natural-scientific observations.

===Wilhelm Wundt===
[[Wundt]] widens the term from Kant's usage to include ''conscious representation of some object or process of the external world''. In so doing, he includes not only ideas of [[memory]] and [[imagination]], but also [[perceptual]] processes, whereas other [[psychologist]]s confine the term to the first two groups.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; One of Wundt's main concerns was to investigate conscious processes in their own context by [[experiment]] and [[introspection]]. He regarded both of these as ''exact methods'', interrelated in that experimentation created optimal conditions for introspection. Where the experimental method failed, he turned to other ''objectively valuable aids'', specifically to ''those products of cultural communal life which lead one to infer particular mental motives. Outstanding among these are speech, myth, and social custom.'' Wundt designed the basic mental activity [[apperception]] — a unifying function which should be understood as an activity of the will. Many aspects of his empirical physiological psychology are used today. One is his principles of mutually enhanced contrasts and of [[assimilation (philosophy)|assimilation]] and dissimilation (i.e. in color and form perception and his advocacy of ''objective'' methods of expression and of recording results, especially in language. Another is the principle of heterogony of ends — that multiply motivated acts lead to unintended side effects which in turn become motives for new actions.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 8: 349–351&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Sanders Peirce===
[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] published the first full statement of [[pragmatism]] in his important works "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) and "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Sanders Peirce#Pragmatism|Peirce's pragmatism]]&lt;/ref&gt; In "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" he proposed that a ''clear idea'' (in his study he uses [[concept]] and ''idea'' as synonymic) is defined as one, when it is apprehended such as it will be recognized wherever it is met, and no other will be mistaken for it. If it fails of this clearness, it is said to be obscure. He argued that to understand an idea clearly we should ask ourselves what difference its application would make to our evaluation of a proposed solution to the problem at hand. [[Pragmatism]] (a term he appropriated for use in this context), he defended, was a method for ascertaining the meaning of terms (as a theory of meaning). The originality of his ideas is in their rejection of what was accepted as a view and understanding of knowledge by scientists for some 250 years, i.e. that, he pointed, knowledge was an impersonal fact. Peirce contended that we acquire knowledge as ''participants'', not as ''spectators''. He felt "the real", sooner or later, is information acquired through ideas and knowledge with the application of logical reasoning would finally result in. He also published many papers on logic in relation to ''ideas''.

===G. F. Stout and J. M. Baldwin===
[[George Stout|G. F. Stout]] and [[James Mark Baldwin|J. M. Baldwin]], in the ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', define ''idea'' as "the reproduction with a more or less adequate [[image]], of an object not actually present to the senses."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Baldwin/Dictionary Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that an idea and a perception are by various authorities contrasted in various ways. "Difference in degree of intensity", "comparative absence of bodily movement on the part of the subject", "comparative dependence on mental activity", are suggested by psychologists as characteristic of an idea as compared with a [[perception]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

It should be observed that an idea, in the narrower and generally accepted sense of a mental reproduction, is frequently composite. That is, as in the example given above of the idea of a chair, a great many objects, differing materially in detail, all call a single idea. When a man, for example, has obtained an idea of chairs in general by comparison with which he can say "This is a chair, that is a stool", he has what is known as an "abstract idea" distinct from the reproduction in his mind of any particular chair (see [[abstraction]]). Furthermore, a complex idea may not have any corresponding physical object, though its particular constituent elements may severally be the reproductions of actual perceptions. Thus the idea of a [[centaur]] is a complex mental picture composed of the ideas of [[man]] and [[horse]], that of a [[mermaid]] of a [[woman]] and a [[fish]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==In anthropology and the social sciences==
[[Diffusion (anthropology)|Diffusion]] studies explore the spread of ideas from culture to culture. Some anthropological theories hold that all cultures imitate ideas from one or a few original cultures, the Adam of the Bible, or several cultural circles that overlap. Evolutionary diffusion theory holds that cultures are influenced by one another but that similar ideas can be developed in isolation.

In the mid-20th century, social scientists began to study how and why ideas spread from one person or culture to another.  [[Everett Rogers]] pioneered [[diffusion of innovations]] studies, using research to prove factors in adoption and profiles of adopters of ideas. In 1976, in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested applying biological [[evolution]]ary theories to the spread of ideas. He coined the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe an abstract unit of [[Selection (biology)|selection]], equivalent to the [[gene]] in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Semantics==

===Samuel Johnson===
[[James Boswell]] recorded [[Samuel Johnson]]'s opinion about ideas. Johnson claimed that they are [[mental image]]s or internal visual pictures. As such, they have no relation to words or the concepts which are designated by verbal names.

{{Quotation|He was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word ''idea'' in the sense of ''notion'' or ''opinion'' when it is clear that ''idea'' can only signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind. We may have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of a mountain, a tree, a building; but we cannot surely have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of an ''argument'' or ''proposition''. Yet we hear the sages of the law 'delivering their ''ideas'' upon the question under consideration;' and the first speakers in parliament 'entirely coinciding with the ''idea'' which has been ably stated by an honourable member;' — or 'reprobating an ''idea'' unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country.' Johnson called this 'modern cant.'|Boswell's [[Life of Johnson]]|Tuesday, 23 September 1777}}

==Relationship of ideas to modern legal time- and scope-limited monopolies==
{{main|Intellectual property|Idea-expression divide}}

===Relationship between ideas and patents===

====On susceptibility to exclusive property====
{{Quotation|It has been pretended by some, (and in England especially,) that inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs. But while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even a hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance.

By a universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed an exclusive and stable property.

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He, who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at my mine, receives light without darkening me.

Those ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8Article 1, Section 8] (Electronic resources from the University of Chicago Press Books Division)&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Thomas Jefferson]], letter to [[Isaac V. McPherson|Isaac McPherson]], 13 August 1813}}

To protect the cause of invention and innovation, the legal constructions of Copyrights and Patents were established. [[Patent]] law regulates various aspects related to the functional manifestation of inventions based on new ideas or incremental improvements to existing ones. Thus, patents have a direct relationship to ideas.

===Relationship between ideas and copyrights===

[[File:Crystal Clear app ktip.svg|thumb|150px|A picture of a [[Incandescent light bulb|lightbulb]] is often used to represent a person having a ''bright'' ''idea''.]]
In some cases, authors can be granted limited [[legal]] monopolies on the manner in which certain works are expressed. This is known colloquially as [[copyright]], although the term [[intellectual property]] is used mistakenly in place of ''copyright''. Copyright law regulating the aforementioned monopolies generally does not cover the actual ideas. The law does not bestow the legal status of [[property]] upon ideas per se. Instead, laws purport to regulate events related to the usage, copying, production, sale and other forms of exploitation of the fundamental expression of a work, that may or may not carry ideas. Copyright law is fundamentally different from [[patent]] law in this respect: patents do grant monopolies on ideas (more on this below).

A [[copyright]] is meant to regulate some aspects of the usage of expressions of a work, ''not'' an idea. Thus, copyrights have a negative relationship to ideas.

Work means a tangible medium of expression. It may be an original or derivative work of art, be it literary, dramatic, musical recitation, artistic, related to sound recording, etc. In (at least) countries adhering to the Berne Convention, copyright automatically starts covering the work upon the original creation and fixation thereof, without any extra steps. While creation usually involves an idea, the idea in itself does not suffice for the purposes of claiming copyright.&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/02/15/protecting-ideas-can-ideas-be-protected-or-patented/id=48009/ Protecting Ideas: Can Ideas Be Protected or Patented?] – article by [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/author/gene-quinn-2/ Gene Quinn] at [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/ Ipwatchdog], February 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright protection extends to a description, explanation, or illustration of an idea or system, assuming that the requirements of copyright law are met.

===Relationship of ideas to confidentiality agreements===
Confidentiality and [[nondisclosure agreements]] are legal instruments that assist corporations and individuals in keeping ideas from escaping to the general public. Generally, these instruments are covered by contract law.

'''Intuition''' is the ability to acquire knowledge without [[proof (truth)|proof]], [[evidence]], or conscious [[reason]]ing, or without understanding how the knowledge was acquired.&lt;ref name="Webster dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=intuition|url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/intuition |accessdate= 22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different writers give the word "intuition" a great variety of different meanings, ranging from direct access to unconscious knowledge, unconscious cognition, inner sensing, inner insight to unconscious pattern-recognition and the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.&lt;ref name="AurobindoDef"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=479–480|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;Intuition and consciousness – Rosenblatt AD, Thickstun JT. Psychoanal Q. 1994 Oct;63(4):696-714.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''intuition'' comes from the Latin verb ''intueri'' translated as "consider" or from the [[Late Middle Ages|late middle English]] word ''intuit'', "to contemplate".&lt;ref name="Webster dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=intuition|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intuition |access-date= 22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Both [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern]] and [[Western philosophy|Western]] philosophers have studied the concept in great detail. [[Philosophy of mind]] deals with the concept of intuition.

===Eastern philosophy===
In the East intuition is mostly intertwined with [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], and various meanings exist from different religious texts.&lt;ref name="eastern"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leaman |first1=Oliver   |title=Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=FLuEAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2014 |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-415-17357-4 |pages=5–40 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism various attempts have been made to interpret the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and other esoteric texts.

For [[Sri Aurobindo]]  intuition comes under the realms of knowledge by identity, he describes the psychological plane in human (often referred to as mana in [[sanskrit]]) has two arbitrary nature, the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information (mind seeking to become aware of external world). The second nature being the action when it seeks to be aware of itself, resulting in humans being aware of their existence or aware of being angry &amp; aware of other emotions, he terms this second nature is knowledge by identity.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=68|ps=}}
He finds that at present as the result of evolution the mind has accustomed itself to depend upon certain physiological functioning and their reactions as its normal means of entering into relation with outer material world, as a result when we seek to know about external world the dominant habit is through arriving at truth about things via as much as senses convey to us.  However, with  knowledge by identity which we currently only gives the awareness of human beings existence can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|pp=69-71|ps=}}

He finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans ([[Vedic]]) and later was taken over by [[reason]] which currently organises our perception, thoughts and actions resulting in from Vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science. he finds that this process which seems to be a decent, is actual a circle of progress.  As a lower faculty is being pushed to take up as much from a higher way of working.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=75|ps=}} He finds when self-awareness in mind is applied to own-self and the outer (other-Self), results in luminous self-manifest identity, the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=72|ps=}}&lt;ref name="Integral yoga"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=799–800|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}

[[Rajneesh|Osho]] believed consciousness of human beings to be in increasing order from basic animal [[instinct]]s to intelligence and intuition, and humans being constantly living in that conscious state often moving between these states depending on their affinity and he also suggests living in the state of intuition is one of the ultimate aims of humanity.&lt;ref name="osho"&gt;{{cite book |last1= osho |first1=  Bhagwan  |title=Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zyBfk5V5HRkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=osho+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y8maVNOMEInzPJHLgbgN&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=10–20|publisher=osho international foundation |location=New York |isbn= 0-312-27567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advaita]] vedanta (a school of thought) takes intuition to be an experience through which one can come in contact with and experience [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="advaita"&gt;{{cite book |last1= M. Indich |first1=  William   |title=Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7ykZjWOiBMoC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=advaitha+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=49CaVPG_HIHlOJOygfAP&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=advaitha%20on%20intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=8–10|publisher=Motilal banarisdas |location=varanasi |isbn= 81-208-1251-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====
Buddhism finds intuition being a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge and puts the term intuition beyond mental process of conscious [[thinking]], as the conscious intellect cannot necessarily access subconscious information, or render such information into a communicable form.&lt;ref name="Sumedho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhismnow.com/2013/08/07/buddha-by-ajahn-sumedho/|title=Buddha, by  Ajahn Sumedho|work=Buddhism now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zen Buddhism]] various techniques have been developed to help develop ones intuitive capability, such as [[koans]] – the resolving of which leads to states of minor enlightenment ([[satori]]). In parts of Zen Buddhism intuition is deemed a mental state between the Universal mind and one's individual, discriminating mind.&lt;ref name="Bdictionary"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Humphreys |first1= Christmas |title=A Popular Dictionary of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TlWRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT406&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=enmZVNyjLs32O8vlgdAM&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-203-98616-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zen Buddhism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Conners |first1=  Shawn  |title=Zen Buddhism – The Path to Enlightenment |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zVPUsSW-by0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iXeZVLu3LsjDOZjFgfgD&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |page=81|publisher=El paso trust |location=Texas |isbn= 1-934255-97-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
In Islam there are various scholars with varied interpretation of intuition (often termed as hads ([[Arabic]]: حدس), hitting correctly on a mark), sometimes relating the ability of having intuitive knowledge to [[prophet]]hood. 
[[Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Siháb al Din-al Suhrawadi]], in his book ''Philosophy Of Illumination'' (ishraq) finds that intuition is a knowledge acquired through illumination and is mystical in nature and also suggests mystical contemplation ([[mushahada]]) on this to bring about correct judgments.&lt;ref name="Islam1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lawson |first1=  Todd  |title=Reason and Inspiration in Islam: Theology, Philosophy and Mysticism in Muslim Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq9zSbNr8gIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=210–225|publisher=I.B touris co ltd |location=London |isbn=1-85043-470-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ibn Sīnā]] finds the ability of having intuition as a "prophetic capacity" and terms it as a knowledge obtained without intentionally acquiring it. He finds that regular knowledge is based on imitation while intuitive knowledge as based on intellectual certitude.&lt;ref name="Islam2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kalin |first1=  Ibrahim  |title=Knowledge in Later Islamic Philosophy: Mulla Sadra on Existence, Intellect, and Intuition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6EGwDLio0QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=155–160|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophy===
In the West, intuition does not appear as a separate field of study, and early mention and definition can be traced back to [[Plato]]. In his book ''[[Plato Republic|Republic]]'' he tries to define intuition as a fundamental capacity of human [[reason]] to comprehend the true nature of [[reality]].&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite web |title=Plato: Education and the Value of Justice |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2h.htm |accessdate= |last = Kemerling|first = Garth|date = 12 November 2011|website = Philosophy Pages }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the "soul of eternity," and a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge. He provides an example of mathematical truths, and posits that they are not arrived at by reason. He argues that these truths are accessed using a knowledge already present in a dormant form and accessible to our intuitive capacity. This concept by Plato is also sometimes referred to as [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]. The study was later continued by his [[Neo-platonism|followers]].&lt;ref name="Meno"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1= Jacob |title=A Commentary on Plato's Meno|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Commentary_on_Plato_s_Meno.html?id=HXI2lcrSsxIC&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=22 December 2014 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-43959-3 |pages=103–127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[René Descartes|Descartes]] refers to an intuition as a pre-existing knowledge gained through rational reasoning or discovering truth through contemplation. This definition is commonly referred to as [[logical intuition|rational intuition]].&lt;ref name="Descartes"&gt;{{cite book |last1= L. Mursell |first1=James |title=The Philosophical Review  |series=4 |volume=28 |publisher= Duke University Press |location=USA |pages=391–401 |chapter=The Function of Intuition in Descartes' Philosophy of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later philosophers, such as [[David Hume|Hume]], have more ambiguous interpretations of intuition. Hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships (relation of time, place, and causation) while he states that "the resemblance" (recognition of relations) "will strike the eye" (which would not require further examination) but goes on to state, "or rather in mind" – attributing intuition to power of mind, contradicting the theory of [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="hume"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hume|first1=David |title=A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RIusIRd2q8C|accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press  |isbn= 9781775410676|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  A. Johnson|first1= Oliver|title=The Mind of David Hume: A Companion to Book I of A Treatise of Human Nature |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=fMjhcXhrv48C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=david+hume+on+intuition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDorBgwuhQ&amp;sig=4X0cOWxYQunqi8k_8rb5R5W8lbA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ai-ZVJy8HcWHPbeQgYAB&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press |isbn= 0-252-02156-8|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] finds intuition is thought of as basic sensory information provided by the [[cognitive]] faculty of sensibility (equivalent to what might loosely be called [[perception]]). Kant held that our [[mind]] casts all of our external intuitions in the form of [[space]], and all of our internal intuitions ([[memory]], thought) in the form of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url= https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=5144&amp;pageno=35|title= Critique of Pure Reason|publisher= gutenberg.org|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intuitionism]] is a position advanced by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]] in [[philosophy of mathematics]] derived from Kant's claim that all [[mathematics|mathematical knowledge]] is knowledge of the pure forms of the intuition – that is, intuition that is not empirical. [[Intuitionistic logic]] was devised by [[Arend Heyting]] to accommodate this position (and has been adopted by other forms of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] in general). It is characterized by rejecting the [[law of excluded middle]]: as a consequence it does not in general accept rules such as [[double negation elimination]] and the use of [[reductio ad absurdum]] to prove the existence of something.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Intuitions are customarily appealed to independently of any particular theory of how intuitions provide evidence for claims, and there are divergent accounts of what sort of mental state intuitions are, ranging from mere spontaneous judgment to a special presentation of a necessary truth.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lynch "Trusting Intuitions", in P. Greenough and M. Lynch (ed) ''Truth and Realism'', pp. 227-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in recent years a number of philosophers, especially [[George Bealer]] have tried to defend appeals to intuition against [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quinean]] doubts about [[conceptual analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Bealer "Intuition and The Autonomy of Philosophy" in M. Depaul and W. Ramsey (eds) ''Rethinking Intuition: The Psychology of Intuition and Its Role In Philosophical Inquiry'' 1998, pp. 201-239.&lt;/ref&gt; A different challenge to appeals to intuition has recently come from [[experimental philosophy|experimental philosophers]], who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[metaphilosophy|metaphilosophical]] assumption that philosophy depends on intuitions has recently been challenged by some philosophers. [[Timothy Williamson]] has argued that intuition plays no special role in philosophy practice, and that skepticism about intuition cannot be meaningfully separated from a general [[skepticism]] about judgment. On this view, there are no qualitative differences between the methods of philosophy and common sense, the sciences or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Timothy (2008) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=YN2KGBgKwOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false The Philosophy of Philosophy]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

===Freud===
According to Sigmund [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations and rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition, and his findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject.&lt;ref name="Freud"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  Walker Punerr|first1= Helen |title=Sigmund Freud: His Life and Mind |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=386tCTzeb28C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=intuition+sigmund+freud&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1DqgVLCrJcvfPYeWgLAK&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 December 2014  |publisher=Transaction Publishers |pages=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jung===
In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of the [[Human ego|ego]], described in 1916 in ''[[Psychological Types]]'', intuition is an "irrational function", opposed most directly by sensation, and opposed less strongly by the "rational functions" of thinking and feeling. Jung defined intuition as "perception via the unconscious": using sense-perception only as a starting point, to bring forth ideas, images, possibilities, ways out of a blocked situation, by a process that is mostly unconscious.&lt;ref name=ptypes /&gt;

Jung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant, an "intuitive type", acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception. An extraverted intuitive type, "the natural champion of all minorities with a future", orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities, often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit, oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change. An introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious, ever exploring the psychic world of the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], seeking to perceive the meaning of events, but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself. Jung thought that extraverted intuitive types were likely entrepreneurs, speculators, cultural revolutionaries, often undone by a desire to escape every situation before it becomes settled and constraining—even repeatedly leaving lovers for the sake of new romantic possibilities. His introverted intuitive types were likely mystics, prophets, or cranks, struggling with a tension between protecting their visions from influence by others and making their ideas comprehensible and reasonably persuasive to others—a necessity for those visions to bear real fruit.&lt;ref name=ptypes&gt;C.G. Jung. ''Psychological Types''. Bollingen Series XX, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern psychology===
In more-recent psychology, intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and [[decision making]]. For example, the [[recognition primed decision]] (RPD) model explains how people can make relatively fast decisions without having to compare options. [[Gary A. Klein|Gary Klein]] found that under time pressure, high stakes, and changing parameters, experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions. Thus, the RPD model is a blend of intuition and analysis. The intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. The [[analysis]] is the mental simulation, a conscious and deliberate review of the courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Gary. ''Intuition At Work''. Random House, NY, NY. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Instinct]] is often misinterpreted as intuition and its reliability considered to be dependent on past knowledge and occurrences in a specific area. For example, someone who has had more experiences with children will tend to have a better instinct about what they should do in certain situations with them. This is not to say that one with a great amount of experience is always going to have an accurate intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sadler-Smith. Inside Intuition. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuitive abilities were quantitatively tested at Yale University in the 1970s. While studying [[nonverbal communication]], researchers noted that some subjects were able to read nonverbal facial cues before reinforcement occurred.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, J Daood, MC Giannini, R Boniface, PG Rhodes. Intellect versus intuition--dichotomy in the reception of nonverbal communication.Journal of General Psychology. 99:19-24,1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In employing a similar design, they noted that highly intuitive subjects made decisions quickly but could not identify their rationale. Their level of accuracy, however, did not differ from that of non intuitive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, ME Barringer, MC Giannini, RH Loiselle.

Intuition, as a gut feeling based on experience, has been found to be useful for business leaders for making judgement about people, culture and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=gcm_pubs|title=Australian Elite Leaders, Intuition and Effectiveness |publisher=epubs.scu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officers often claim to observe suspects and immediately "know" that they possess a weapon or illicit narcotic substances, which could also be action of [[instinct]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/concept-creep/477939/|title=Why Americans Are So Sensitive to Harm|first=Conor|last=Friedersdorf|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often unable to articulate why they reacted or what prompted them at the time of the event, they sometimes retrospectively can plot their actions based upon what had been clear and present danger signals. Such examples liken intuition to "[[Feeling#Stomach feeling|gut feelings]]" and when viable illustrate [[preconscious]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Pinizzotto, PhD, Edward F. Davis, MA, and Charles E.

[[Image:RudolfvonIhering2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rudolf von Ihering, one of the juris philosophers of the jurisprudence of concepts]]
The '''jurisprudence of concepts''' was the first ''sub-school'' of [[legal positivism]],&lt;ref name="ARCOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcos.org.br/livros/hermeneutica-juridica/capitulo-iii-o-positivismo-normativista/3-a-jurisprudencia-dos-conceitos/|title=A Jurisprudência dos Conceitos|author=Costa, Alexandre Araújo|publisher=Arcos|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdv.br/publicacoes/periodicos/revistadepoimentos/n7/6.pdf|title=A importância da Jurisprudência dos Conceitos para a Metodologia Jurídica|author=Pepino, Elsa Maria Lopes Ferreira; Graviorno, Gracimeri, Vieira Soeiro de Castro; Filgueira, Sofia Varejão|publisher=Revista Depoimentos, da Faculdade de Direito de Vitória|accessdate=17 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119225127/http://www.fdv.br/publicacoes/periodicos/revistadepoimentos/n7/6.pdf|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to which, the written [[law]] must reflect [[concept]]s, when [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;that means that the interpretation of the words stated in the law must be guided by the scientific concepts that these words represent.&lt;/ref&gt; Its main representatives were [[Rudolf von Ihering|Ihering]], [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]] and [[Georg Friedrich Puchta|Puchta]].

This school was, thus, the preceding trigger of the idea that law comes from a dogmatic source, imposition from man over man and not a ''natural'' consequence of other sciences or of metaphysical faith.

Among the main characters of the ''jurisprudence of concepts'' are:
* formalism, search of rights in written law
* systemisation
* search for justifying specific norm with basis from more generic ones.&lt;ref name="RSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seer.ucp.br/seer/index.php/LexHumana/article/download/5/4|title=Evolução Histórica da Teoria Hermenêutica - do Formalismo do Século XVIII ao Pós-Positivismo|author=Rocha, Sérgio André|year=2009|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, according to this school, law should have prevailing sources based upon the legislative process, although needing to be proven by more inclusive ideas of a social sense.

{{Distinguish|Landau principle}}
'''Landauer's principle''' is a [[Principle#Principle as scientific law|physical principle]] pertaining to the lower [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] limit of [[Energy conservation|energy consumption]] of [[computation]]. It holds that "any logically irreversible manipulation of [[Information#As a property in physics|information]], such as the erasure of a [[bit]] or the merging of two [[computation]] paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding [[entropy]] increase in non-information-bearing [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the information-processing apparatus or its environment".&lt;ref name = bennett&gt;{{Citation |arxiv=physics/0210005 |title=Notes on Landauer's principle, Reversible Computation and Maxwell's Demon |authorlink=Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist) |author=Charles H. Bennett |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=501–510 |year=2003 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/bennett03.pdf |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(03)00039-X|bibcode=2003SHPMP..34..501B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of phrasing Landauer's principle is that if an observer loses information about a [[physical system]], the observer loses the ability to extract work from that system.

A so-called logically-reversible computation, in which no information is erased, may in principle be carried out without releasing any heat.  This has led to considerable interest in the study of [[reversible computing]]. Indeed, without reversible computing, increases in the number of computations-per-joule-of-energy-dissipated must come to a halt by about 2050: because the limit implied by Landauer's principle will be reached by then, according to [[Koomey's law]]. 

At 20&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature, or 293.15&amp;nbsp;K), the Landauer limit represents an energy of approximately 0.0172&amp;nbsp;[[electron volt|eV]], or 2.75&amp;nbsp;[[zeptojoule|zJ]]. Theoretically, room{{nbhyph}}temperature computer memory operating at the Landauer limit could be changed at a rate of one billion bits per second with energy being converted to heat in the memory media at the rate of only 2.85 trillionths of a watt (that is, at a rate of only 2.85 pJ/s).  Modern computers use millions of times as much energy per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tikalon.com/blog/blog.php?article=2011/Landauer |title=Tikalon Blog by Dev Gualtieri |publisher=Tikalon.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomweb.com/nanomagnet-memories-approach-low-power-limit/ |title=Nanomagnet memories approach low-power limit &amp;#124; bloomfield knoble |publisher=Bloomweb.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/landauer-limit-demonstrated |title=Landauer Limit Demonstrated - IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Rolf Landauer]] first proposed the principle in 1961 while working at [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="landauer"&gt;{{Citation |author=Rolf Landauer |url=http://worrydream.com/refs/Landauer%20-%20Irreversibility%20and%20Heat%20Generation%20in%20the%20Computing%20Process.pdf |title=Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=183–191 |year=1961 |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1147/rd.53.0183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He rigorously justified and stated important limits to an earlier conjecture by [[John von Neumann]]. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as being simply the Landauer bound or Landauer limit.

In 2011, the principle was generalized to show that while information erasure requires an increase in entropy, that increase could theoretically occur at no energy cost&lt;ref name="vaccaro"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Joan Vaccaro |author2=Stephen Barnett |title=Information Erasure Without an Energy Cost |journal=Proc. R. Soc. A |date=June 8, 2011 |volume=467 |issue=2130 |pages=1770–1778 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0577 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/early/2011/01/07/rspa.2010.0577.full.pdf |arxiv=1004.5330|bibcode = 2011RSPSA.467.1770V }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, the cost can be taken in another [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved quantity]], such as  [[angular momentum]].

In a 2012 article published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], a team of physicists from the [[École normale supérieure de Lyon]], [[University of Augsburg]] and the [[University of Kaiserslautern]] described that for the first time they have measured the tiny amount of heat released when an individual bit of data is erased.&lt;ref name="berut"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Antoine Bérut |author2=Artak Arakelyan |author3=Artyom Petrosyan |author4=Sergio Ciliberto |author5=Raoul Dillenschneider |author6=Eric Lutz |doi=10.1038/nature10872 |title=Experimental verification of Landauer’s principle linking information and thermodynamics |journal=Nature |volume=483 |issue=7388 |pages=187–190 |date=8 March 2012 |url=http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/eggert/papers/raoul.pdf|bibcode = 2012Natur.483..187B |pmid=22398556|arxiv=1503.06537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, physical experiments tested Landauer's principle and confirmed its predictions.&lt;ref name="jun"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Yonggun Jun |author2=Momčilo Gavrilov |author3=John Bechhoefer |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.190601 |title=High-Precision Test of Landauer's Principle in a Feedback Trap |journal=[[Phys.

In 2016, researchers used a laser probe to measure the amount of energy dissipation that resulted when a nanomagnetic bit flipped from off to on. Flipping the bit required 15 millielectron volts (3 [[zeptojoule]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hong|first = Jeongmin|last2 = Lambson|first2 = Brian|last3 = Dhuey|first3 = Scott|last4 = Bokor|first4 = Jeffrey|date = 2016-03-01|title = Experimental test of Landauer’s principle in single-bit operations on nanomagnetic memory bits|url = http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/3/e1501492|journal = Science Advances|language = en|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = e1501492|doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1501492|issn = 2375-2548|pmc = 4795654|bibcode = 2016SciA....2E1492H|pmid=26998519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 article published in [[Nature Physics (journal)|''Nature Physics'']] features a Landauer erasure performed at cryogenic temperatures (T = 1K) on an array of high-spin (S = 10) quantum [[molecular magnets]]. The array is made to act as a spin register where each nanomagnet encodes a single bit of information.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment has laid the foundations for the extension of the validity of the Landauer principle to the quantum realm. Owing to the fast dynamics and low "inertia" of the single spins used in the experiment, the researchers also showed how an erasure operation can be carried out at the lowest possible thermodynamic cost — that imposed by the Landauer principle — and at a high speed.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Rocco Gaudenzi |author2=Enrique Burzuri |author3=Satoru Maegawa |author4=Herre van der Zant |author5=Fernando Luis |doi=10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7 |title=Quantum Landauer erasure with a molecular nanomagnet |journal= Nature Physics |volume=14 |pages= 565–568 |date=19 March 2018 |url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

==Rationale==
Landauer's principle can be understood to be a simple [[logical consequence]] of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]—which states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] cannot decrease—together with the definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]]. For, if the number of possible logical states of a computation were to decrease as the computation proceeded forward (logical irreversibility), this would constitute a forbidden decrease of entropy, unless the number of possible physical states corresponding to each logical state were to simultaneously increase by at least a compensating amount, so that the total number of possible physical states was no smaller than it was originally (i.e. total entropy has not decreased).

Yet, an increase in the number of physical states corresponding to each logical state means that, for an observer who is keeping track of the logical state of the system but not the physical state (for example an "observer" consisting of the computer itself), the number of possible physical states has increased; in other words, entropy has increased from the point of view of this observer.

The maximum entropy of a bounded physical system is finite. (If the [[holographic principle]] is correct, then physical systems with finite [[surface area]] have a finite maximum entropy; but regardless of the truth of the holographic principle, [[quantum field theory]] dictates that the entropy of systems with finite radius and energy is finite due to the [[Bekenstein bound]].) To avoid reaching this maximum over the course of an extended computation, entropy must eventually be expelled to an outside environment.

==Equation==
Landauer's principle asserts that there is a minimum possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information, known as the ''Landauer limit'':

:{{math|''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2,}}
where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (approximately 1.38×10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; J/K), ''T'' is the temperature of the heat sink in [[kelvin]]s, and ln&amp;#8239;2 is the [[natural logarithm]] of 2 (approximately 0.69315).

For an environment at temperature ''T'', energy ''E'' = ''ST'' must be emitted into that environment if the amount of added entropy is ''S''. For a computational operation in which 1 [[bit]] of logical information is lost, the amount of entropy generated is at least ''k'' ln&amp;#8239;2, and so, the energy that must eventually be emitted to the environment is ''E'' ≥ ''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2.

==Challenges==
The principle is widely accepted as [[physical law]], but in recent years it has been challenged for using [[circular reasoning]] and faulty assumptions, notably in Earman and Norton (1998), and subsequently in Shenker (2000)&lt;ref name="shenker"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000115/ Logic and Entropy] Critique by Orly Shenker (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and Norton (2004,&lt;ref name="norton"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001729/ Eaters of the Lotus] Critique by John Norton (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="norton2"&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Waiting_SHPMP.pdf Waiting for Landauer] Response by Norton (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;), and defended by Bennett (2003)&lt;ref name="bennett" /&gt; and Ladyman et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4800">A '''law''' is a [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] principle that describes the fundamental nature of something, the universal properties and the relationships between things, or a description that purports to explain these principles and relationships.

== "Laws of nature " ==

{{See|Physical law}}

For example, "physical laws" such as the "[[gravity|law of gravity]]" or "[[science|scientific laws]]" attempt to describe the fundamental nature of the universe itself. Laws of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] describe the nature of rational thought and inference ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[transcendental idealism]], and differently [[G. Spencer-Brown]]'s work ''[[Laws of Form]]'', was precisely a determination of the ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' laws governing human thought before any interaction whatsoever with experience).

Within most fields of study, and in science in particular, the elevation of some principle of that field to the status of "law" usually takes place after a very long time during which the principle is used and tested and verified; though in some fields of study such laws are simply postulated as a foundation and assumed. Mathematical laws are somewhere in between: they are often arbitrary and unproven in themselves, but they are sometimes judged by how useful they are in making predictions about the real world. However, they ultimately rely on arbitrary [[axioms]].  

== "Laws of fundamentals in mathematics" ==

Some fundamental law of mathematics was introduced by '''Harsha
'''.                                                                 

'''First law of fundamentals:''' If we consider '''k''' as a constant and '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers of which the product of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''' but the product of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt;and  &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt;is not equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k}&lt;/math&gt;.    

'''Complemantry of first law of fundamentals:'''As per first law '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers and '''k''' is any constant the product of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''',then the product of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Second law of fundamentals:'''If we consider '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers and '''k''' be any constant the division of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''' and the division of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k}&lt;/math&gt; but equal    
to '''c'''.

== "Laws" in social sciences ==

Laws of [[economics]] are an attempt in [[modelization]] of economic behavior. [[Marxism]] criticized the [[belief]] in eternal "laws of economics", which it considered a product of the [[ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|dominant ideology]]. It claimed that in fact, those so-called "laws of economics" were only the historical laws of [[capitalism]], that is of a particular historical social formation. With the advent, in the 20th century, of the application of mathematical, statistical, and experimental techniques to economics, economic theory matured into a corpus of knowledge rooted in the scientific method rather than in philosophical argument.

==Miscellaneous==

Finally, the term is sometimes applied to less rigorous ideas that may be interesting observations or relationships, practical or ethical guidelines (also called [[rule of thumb|rules of thumb]]), and even humorous parodies of such laws.

Examples of scientific laws include [[Boyle's law]] of gases, [[conservation law]]s, [[Ohm's law]], and others. Laws of other fields of study include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of [[philosophy]] and [[Say's law]] in [[economics]]. Examples of observed phenomena often described as laws include the [[Titius-Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, [[Thomas Malthus]]'s Principle of Population or [[Malthusian Growth Model]], [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[Unintended consequences|law of unintended consequences]].

Some humorous parodies of such laws include [[adage]]s such as [[Murphy's law]] and its many variants, and [[Godwin's Law]] of [[Internet]] conversations.

This '''list of [[eponym]]ous laws''' provides links to articles on [[Law (principle)|laws]], [[principle]]s, [[adage]]s, and other succinct observations or predictions named after a person. In some cases the person named has coined the law – such as [[Parkinson's law]]. In others, the work or publications of the individual have led to the law being so named – as is the case with [[Moore's law]]. There are also laws ascribed to individuals by others, such as [[Murphy's law]]; or given [[eponym]]ous names despite the absence of the named person.

* [[Sutton's law]]: "Go where the money is." Often cited in medical schools to teach new doctors to spend resources where they are most likely to pay off. The law is named after bank robber [[Willie Sutton]], who when asked why he robbed banks, is claimed to have answered "Because that's where the money is."
* [[Swanson's law]]: solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of solar cell industry manufacturing capacity. The law is named after [[SunPower Corporation]] founder Dr. [[Richard Swanson]].
* [[Szemerényi's law]], in [[Proto-Indo-European phonology]]: word-final clusters of vowels (V), resonants (R) and either */s/ or */h₂/ are simplified by dropping the word-final fricative (*{{PIE|/h₂/}} was phonetically itself probably a back fricative), with [[compensatory lengthening]] of the preceding vowel. Named for Hungarian linguist [[Oswald Szemerényi]].

In [[forensic science]], '''Locard's exchange principle'''  holds that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, and that both can be used as [[forensic evidence]]. Dr. [[Edmond Locard]] (13 December 1877 – 4 May 1966) was a pioneer in forensic science who became known as the [[Sherlock Holmes]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;http://aboutforensics.co.uk/edmond-locard/&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated the basic principle of forensic science as: "Every contact leaves a trace". Paul L. Kirk&lt;ref&gt;''Crime investigation: physical evidence and the police laboratory''. Interscience Publishers, Inc.: New York, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; expressed the principle as follows:

:"Wherever he steps, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves, even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness against him. Not only his fingerprints or his footprints, but his hair, the fibers from his clothes, the glass he breaks, the tool mark he leaves, the paint he scratches, the blood or semen he deposits or collects. All of these and more, bear mute witness against him. This is evidence that does not forget. It is not confused by the excitement of the moment. It is not absent because human witnesses are. It is factual evidence. Physical evidence cannot be wrong, it cannot perjure itself, it cannot be wholly absent. Only human failure to find it, study and understand it, can diminish its value."

Fragmentary or [[trace evidence]] is any type of material left at (or taken from) a crime scene, or the result of contact between two surfaces, such as shoes and the floor covering or soil, or fibers from where someone sat on an upholstered chair.

When a crime is committed, fragmentary (or trace) evidence needs to be collected from the scene. A team of specialized police technicians goes to the scene of the crime and seals it off. They record video and take photographs of the crime scene, victim/s (if there are any) and items of evidence. If necessary, they undertake ballistics examinations. They check for foot, shoe, and tire mark impressions, plus hair as well as examine any vehicles and check for fingerprints - whole or partial.

==Famous cases==

The case studies below show how prevalent Locard's Exchange Principle is in each and every crime. The examples using Locard's Principle show not only how the transfer of trace evidence can tell the tale of what happened, but also how much care is required when collecting and evaluating trace evidence.

===The Weimar children murders===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Karola and Melanie Weimar, aged 5 and 7, lived with their parents, Reinhard and Monika, in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Strate, Gerhard. [http://strate.net/en/publications/weimar_murder_case.html “The Weimar murder case – strength and risk of material evidence,"] Hamburg, 05/01/2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Monika Böttcher|Monika Böttcher.]]&lt;/ref&gt; They were reported missing on 4 August 1986. Their bodies were found on 7 August. They had been murdered.

Monika first said the children had breakfast, then went to a [[playground]]. Three weeks later she said they were already dead when she returned home the previous night: Reinhard was sitting on the edge of Karola's bed, weeping and confused; he then disposed of the bodies.

Both parents were suspected, but Monika was having an [[affair]], and was seen where Melanie's body was later found. She was convicted, but after serving her sentence, was released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrichsen, Gisela. [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/ende-eines-justizdramas-zweifache-kindsmoerderin-monika-boettcher-ist-frei-a-432435.html “End of a judicial drama: twice infanticide Monika Böttcher is free,"] Spiegel online Panorama, August 18, 2006. Retrieved December 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators determined what clothes Monika was wearing on 3 and 4 August, but not Reinhard's clothes, so only [[fibers]] from her clothing were identified on the children's bodies, yet they were also constantly in contact with him.

The [[bedding]] contained 14 fibers from Karola's [[T-shirt]]. Frictionless tests, simulating a dead child, matched that figure better than the friction tests, simulating a live child, so Karola could have lain lifelessly in bed wearing her T-shirt, as stated by her mother.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

35 fibers from Monika's [[blouse]] were found on the back of Melanie's T-shirt, but only one on her [[bed sheet]]. In tests, between 6 and 10 fibers remained on the sheet. These higher numbers were thought{{by whom|date=March 2016}} to disprove Monika's claim that she gave her child a goodbye [[hug]] the previous day. However, there are several likely explanations. For example, the bedding was put in one bag, so fibers from the sheet could have been transferred to the cover and [[pillow]]. Only the central area of the top of the sheet was taped: it might have originally contained more than one blouse fiber, the others could have been transferred to the back or sides while in the bag.

The blouse fibers on Melanie's clothing were distributed evenly, not the clusters expected from carrying the body.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

265 fibers from the family car’s rear seat covers were found on Melanie's [[panties]] and the inside of her trousers, but only a small number of fibers from the front seats was found on the children. This helped disprove the theory that they were killed on the front seats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Melanie's clothes and hair were covered in 375 clinging fruits of [[Galium aparine|goosegrass]]. As some of these itchy things were on the inside of her trousers and on her panties, the trousers must have been put on her after death.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

No [[sand]] was found on the bodies or clothing (including socks and [[sandals]]) of either child, making the morning playground story unlikely.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== The Westerfield-van Dam case ===

[[David Westerfield|Danielle van Dam]], aged 7, lived with her parents and brothers in [[San Diego]], California. She was reported missing on 2 February 2002; her body was discovered on 27 February. Neighbor [[David Westerfield]] was almost immediately suspected, as he had gone [[camping]] in his [[RV]], and he was convicted of her [[kidnapping]] and murder.

Hairs consistent with the van Dams’ dog were found in his RV, also carpet fibers consistent with Danielle's [[bedroom]] carpet. Danielle's nightly [[ritual]] was to [[wrestle]] with the dog after getting into her [[pajamas]].&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prosecution]] argued that those hairs and fibers got onto her pajamas through that contact, and were then carried on the pajamas to first Westerfield's house and then to his RV, when he kidnapped her from her bed. The alternative scenario is that they got onto her daytime clothes, and those of her mother and younger brother, and were carried to his house when they visited him earlier that week selling [[cookies]].&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020808-9999_1n8feldman.html “Lawyer says case against defendant is 'guesswork',"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 8 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He said his laundry was out during that visit, so trace evidence from them could have got on it, and then been transferred to his bedroom and his RV (secondary Locard transfer).&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Steve, and Jeff Dillon. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020807-9999-final.html “Defense rests; each side puts its spin on evidence,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 7 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, his RV was often parked, sometimes unlocked, in the neighborhood streets, so Danielle could have sneaked inside, leaving behind that evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020809-9999_1n9dusek.html “Jury begins deliberations: Prosecutor says victim has pointed to her killer,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 9 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No trace of Westerfield was found in the van Dam house.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Jeff. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020806-9999-final.html “Physical evidence shows Westerfield committed 'evil, evil crime,' prosecutor says,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

14 hairs consistent with Danielle's were found in his environment. All but one were compared on only [[mitochondrial DNA]], so they might have come from her mother or a sibling.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/27/export12906.txt “DNA expert: Hair was Danielle's,"] North County Times, 26 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most (21) of the hairs were in a dryer [[lint (material)|lint]] ball in his [[waste container|trash can]], so they might have got in his laundry before the kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 5 carpet fibers in his RV, but none in his house, suggesting those were deposited by someone going directly from her house to his RV, or they may have come from another house in that development.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020625-9999_1m25hair.html “Criminalist links hairs, carpet fibers to Danielle: Evidence found in defendant's home,”] San Diego Union-Tribune, 25 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No Danielle pajama or bedding fibers were reported in his environment. There was no trace evidence in his [[SUV]] (which casts doubt on the belief that she was transported from his house to his RV in his SUV).&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He vacuumed his RV after the kidnapping, but no trace evidence was in the [[vacuum cleaner]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Harriet. [http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/061902-pm_ctv.html “Experts: Girl's prints found in Westerfield's RV,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204211022/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/061902-pm_ctv.html |date=4 February 2009 }} Court TV, 20 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

One orange fiber with her body was consistent with about 200 in his house and 20 in his SUV (none in his RV), while 21 blue fibers with her body were consistent with 10 in his house and 46 in his RV (none in his SUV). Contrary to media reports, only a few items from her house were tested so that can’t be excluded as the source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/witnesses-sta.html “Witnesses for the Prosecution,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227001224/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/witnesses-sta.html |date=27 December 2008 }} Court TV, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the clothes of Danielle and her family during the cookie sale were not determined and eliminated. There were apparently two different types of the orange fibers, dull and very bright (so the number which matched might have been much less than 200).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/photogallery/evidence28.html “A Single Strand,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406142035/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/photogallery/evidence28.html |date=6 April 2009 }} Court TV, photogallery, evidence28, no date.&lt;/ref&gt; There were red fibers with her [[fingernails]], and many other fibers with her body, which could not be matched to his environment.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Steve, and Jeff Dillon. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020807-9999-final.html “Defense rests; each side puts its spin on evidence,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 7 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The only non-Danielle hair found with her body wasn’t his, nor was any desert sand reported with the body, and no soil or vegetation from the dump site was reported on his shoes, laundry, shovel or RV.

To explain why so much expected evidence was missing, the prosecution argued that he went on a cleaning frenzy, and tossed out evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020809-9999_1n9dusek.html “Jury begins deliberations: Prosecutor says victim has pointed to her killer,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 9 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Logic models''' are hypothesized descriptions of the chain of causes and effects (see [[Causality]]) leading to an outcome of interest (e.g. prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, annual traffic collision, etc). While they can be in a narrative form, logic model usually take form in a graphical depiction of the "if-then" (causal) relationships between the various elements leading to the outcome.

== Uses of the logic model ==

===Program planning===
One of the most important uses of the logic model is for program planning. It is suggested to use the logic model to focus on the intended outcomes of a particular program. The guiding questions change from "what is being done?" to "what needs to be done"? McCawley suggests that by using this new reasoning, a logic model for a program can be built by asking the following questions in sequence:

# What is the current situation that we intend to impact?
# What will it look like when we achieve the desired situation or outcome?
# What behaviors need to change for that outcome to be achieved?
# What knowledge or skills do people need before the behavior will change?
# What activities need to be performed to cause the necessary learning?
# What resources will be required to achieve the desired outcome?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~kgilbert/educ5165-731/Readings/The%20Logic%20Model.pdf|title=The logic model for program planning and evaluation|last=McCawley|first=Paul F. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=University of Idaho Extension|year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By placing the focus on ultimate outcomes or results, planners can ''think backward'' through the logic model to identify how best to achieve the desired results. Here it helps managers to 'plan with the end in mind', rather than just consider inputs (e.g. budgets, employees) or the tasks that must be done.

===Evaluation===
The logic model is often used in [[government]] or not-for-profit organizations, where the mission and vision are not aimed at achieving a financial benefit. Traditionally, government programs were described only in terms of their [[budget]]s.  It is easy to measure the amount of money spent on a program, but this is a poor indicator of outcomes. Likewise it is relatively easy to measure the amount of work done (e.g. number of workers or number of years spent), but the workers may have just been 'spinning their wheels' without getting very far in terms of ultimate results or outcomes.

However, nature of outcomes varies. To measure the progress toward outcomes, some initiatives may require an ad hoc measurement instrument. In addition, in programs such as in [[education]] or [[social program]]s, outcomes are usually in the long-term and may requires numerous intermediate changes (attitudes, social norm, industry practices, etc.) to advance progressively toward the outcomes.

By making clear the intended outcomes and the causal pathways leading to them, a program logic model provides the basis upon which planners and evaluators can develop a measurement plan and adequate instruments. Instead of only looking at the outcome progress, planners can open the "black box" and examine if the intermediate outcomes progress as planned. In addition, the pathways of numerous outcomes are still largely misunderstood due their complexity, their unpredictability and lack of scientific / practical evidences. Therefore, with proper research design, one may not only assess the progress of intermediate outcomes, but evaluate as well if the program theory of change is accurate, i.e. is successful change of an intermediate outcomes provokes the hypothesized subsequent effects in the causal pathway. Finally, outcomes may easily be achieved through processes independent of the program and an evaluation of those outcomes would suggest program success when in fact external outputs were responsible for the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = Peter H | last1 = Rossi | first2 = Mark W | last2 = Lipsey | first3 = Howard E | last3 = Freeman | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evaluation : a systematic approach |date=2004|publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-0894-4|edition=7th |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |oclc=52706526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Various types of logic models ==

=== The Inputs --&gt; Activities --&gt; Outputs --&gt; Outcomes template ===
Many authors and guides use the following template when speaking about logic model:&lt;ref name="Frechtling_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LM_EE" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McLaughlin |first=John A. |last2=Jordan |first2=Gretchen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Using Logic Models |date=2015-10-14 |work=Handbook of Practical Program Evaluation |pages=62–87 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |doi=10.1002/9781119171386.ch3 |isbn=978-1-119-17138-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Many refinements and variations{{Which|date=October 2018}} have been added to the basic template. For example, many versions of logic models set out a series of outcomes/impacts, explaining in more detail the logic of how an intervention contributes to intended or observed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Weiss CH | date = 1972 | title = Evaluation Research. Methods for Assessing Program Effectiveness. | publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc. | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others often distinguish short-term, medium-term and long-term results, and between direct and indirect results.

=== Intervention Mapping logic models ===
[[File:Logic_Model_of_the_Problem_for_Management_information_Decision_Support_Epilepsy_Tool.jpg|thumb|Logic Model of the Problem for Management information Decision Support Epilepsy Tool (MINDSET program) from Ruiter, DeSmet and Schneider (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shegog R, Begley CE | title = Clinic-Based Mobile Health Decision Support to Enhance Adult Epilepsy Self-Management: An Intervention Mapping Approach | journal = Frontiers in Public Health | volume = 5 | pages = 256 | date = 2017 | pmid = 29043247 | pmc = 5632356 | doi = 10.3389/fpubh.2017.00256 | quote = The full intervention mapping based protocol is available in the full article }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Bartholomew et al. [[Intervention mapping|Intervention Mapping]] approach&lt;ref name="Eldredge_2016" /&gt; makes an extensive use of logic model through the whole life-cycle of a health promotion program. Since this method can start from as far as a vague desired outcomes (authors example is a city whose actors decide to address "health issues" of the city), planners goes through various steps in order to develop effective interventions and properly evaluate them (see [[Intervention Mapping]] entry for a more detailed account). Distinguishable but closely interweave logic models with different purposes are being developed through the process:

* '''Logic model of the problem''', which is a graphical depiction of at-risk population and its social environment behaviours (factors) leading to the health problem and their respective causal pathways (attitudes, beliefs, skills, etc.). This may include as well at-risk population physical environment related causes such as polluants or lack of physical activity infrastructure and their respective causes, i.e. environmental agents behaviours leading to the physical environment causes and their respective causal pathways;
* Once the most relevant behaviours and causal pathways are identified, planners develop a '''logic model of change'''. This is a model of behavioural changes (performance objective) that should happen and their corresponding necessary changes higher in the cause-effects chain.
* Finally, a '''logic model of the intervention''' is developed. This model describe the various activities that will happen and the cascades of effects they are expected to cause toward the desired outcome.

Evaluators thereafter use the logic model of the intervention to design a proper evaluation plan to assess [[Program evaluation#Assessing implementation|implementation]], [[Program evaluation#Assessing the impact (effectiveness)|impact]] and [[Program evaluation#Assessing efficiency|efficiency]].

==Advantages==
By describing work in this way, managers have an easier way to define the work and measure it.  [[Performance measurement|Performance measures]] can be drawn from any of the steps.  One of the key insights of the logic model is the importance of measuring final outcomes or results, because it is quite possible to waste time and money (inputs), "spin the wheels" on work activities, or produce outputs without achieving desired outcomes.  It is these outcomes (impacts, long-term results) that are the only justification for doing the work in the first place.  For commercial organizations, outcomes relate to [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].  For [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] or [[governmental organization]]s, outcomes relate to successful achievement of mission or program goals.

==Disadvantages==
There are some potential disadvantages of logic models due to tendencies toward oversimplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The logic model guidebook : better strategies for great results | first1 = Lisa Wyatt | last1 = Knowlton | first2 = Cynthia C | last2 = Phillips | last3 =Phillips | first3 = Cynthia | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013|publisher=SAGE C.|isbn=978-1-4522-1675-1|edition=2nd|location=Los Angeles|oclc=791492618}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
#Program logic is no guarantee of actual logic in how the program may work. The world is complex, and some situations cannot be ascertained before they are implemented, so some programs may even progress against the "logic" of the model.
#It is a partial representation of a complex system.
#It is a representation of reality, not reality itself. Programs are not linear
#Normally, it does not include effects besides those initially expected.
#They do not necessarily establish causality. Many factors exert influence upon the effects.

In [[microeconomics]], the '''marginal factor cost''' (MFC) is the increment to total costs paid for a [[factor of production]] resulting from a one-unit increase in the amount of the factor employed. It is expressed in [[currency]] units per incremental unit of a factor of production (input), such as [[labour economics|labor]], per unit of time. In the case of the labor input, for example, if the wage rate paid is unaffected by the  number of units of labor hired, the marginal factor cost is identical to the [[wage]] rate. However, if hiring another unit of labor drives up the wage rate that must be paid to all existing units of labor employed, then the marginal cost of the labor factor is higher than the wage rate paid to the last unit because it also includes the increment to the rates paid to the other units.

Thus for any factor the MFC is the change in total amount paid for all units of that factor divided by the change in the quantity of that factor employed.

A firm that wants to optimize its profits hires each factor up to the point at which its marginal factor cost equals its [[marginal revenue product]] (MFC=MRP).

It equals the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the [[incremental capital-output ratio]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3923">The '''marginal revenue productivity theory of wages''' is a theory in [[neoclassical economics]] stating that [[wage]]s are paid at a level equal to the '''marginal revenue product''' of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], MRP (the value of the [[marginal product]] of labor), which is the increment to revenues caused by the increment to output produced by the last laborer employed.  In a model, this is justified by an assumption that the firm is profit-maximizing and thus would employ labor only up to the point that marginal labor costs equal the marginal revenue generated for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S. Hamermesh. 1986. The demand for labor in the long run. ''Handbook of Labor Economics'' (Orley Ashenfelter and Richard Layard, ed.) p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The marginal revenue product (MRP) of a worker is equal to the product of the marginal product of labour (MP) (the increment to output from an increment to labor used) and the marginal revenue (MR) (the increment to sales revenue from an increment to output): MRP = MP × MR. The theory states that workers will be hired up to the point when the marginal revenue product is equal to the wage rate. If the marginal revenue brought by the worker is less than the wage rate, then employing that laborer would cause a decrease in profit.

The idea that payments to factors of production equal their marginal productivity had been laid out by [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Knut Wicksell]], in simpler models. Much of the MRP theory stems from Wicksell's model.

==Mathematical relation==

The marginal revenue product of labour MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the increase in revenue per unit increase in the variable input =  ∆TR/∆L 

:MR = ∆TR/∆Q

:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L

:MR x MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) x (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

The change in output is not limited to that directly attributable to the additional worker. Assuming that the firm is operating with diminishing marginal returns then the addition of an extra worker reduces the average productivity of every other worker (and every other worker affects the marginal productivity of the additional worker).

As above noted the firm will continue to add units of labor until the MRP equals the wage rate ''w''&amp;mdash;mathematically until

:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''

:MR(MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''w''

:MR = w/MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

:MR = MC which is the profit maximizing rule.

==Marginal revenue product in a perfectly competitive market==

Under [[perfect competition]], marginal revenue product is equal to marginal physical product (extra unit produced as a result of a new employment) multiplied by price.

:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{MR(=AR=D) as perfectly competitive labour market}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{Price}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:
This is because the firm in [[perfect competition]] is a [[price taker]]. It does not have to lower the price in order to sell additional units of the good.

==MRP in monopoly or imperfect competition==

Firms operating as monopolies or in imperfect competition face downward-sloping [[demand curve]]s. To sell extra units of output, they would have to lower their output's price. Under such market conditions, marginal revenue product will not equal MPP×Price. This is because the firm is not able to sell output at a fixed price per unit. Thus the MRP curve of a firm in [[monopoly]] or in [[imperfect competition]] will slope downwards, when plotted against labor usage, at a faster rate than in perfect specific competition.

A '''mathematical model''' is a description of a [[system]] using [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and [[Language of mathematics|language]]. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed '''mathematical modeling'''. Mathematical models are used in the [[natural science]]s (such as [[physics]], [[biology]], [[earth science]], [[chemistry]]) and [[engineering]] disciplines (such as [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]]), as well      as in the [[social sciences]] (such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]]). 

A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.

== Elements of a mathematical model ==

Mathematical models can take many forms, including [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].  These and other types of models can overlap, with a given  model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include [[model theory|logical models]].  In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments.  Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed.

In the [[physical sciences]], a traditional mathematical model contains most of the following elements:
# [[Governing equation|Governing equations]]
# Supplementary sub-models
## [[Defining equation (physics)|Defining equations]]
## [[Constitutive equation|Constitutive equations]]
# Assumptions and constraints
## [[Initial condition|Initial]] and [[Boundary condition|boundary conditions]]
## [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|Classical constraints]] and [[Kinematics|kinematic equations]]

== Classifications ==
Mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and ''[[variable (mathematics)|variables]]''. Relationships can be described by ''[[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]'', such as algebraic operators, functions, differential operators, etc. Variables are abstractions of system [[parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] of interest, that can be [[Quantification (science)|quantified]]. Several classification criteria can be used for mathematical models according to their structure:
* '''Linear vs. nonlinear:''' If all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit [[linear]]ity, the resulting mathematical model is defined as linear. A model is considered to be nonlinear otherwise. The definition of linearity and nonlinearity is dependent on context, and linear models may have nonlinear expressions in them.  For example, in a [[Linear model|statistical linear model]], it is assumed that a relationship is linear in the parameters, but it may be nonlinear in the predictor variables.  Similarly, a differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written with linear [[differential operator]]s, but it can still have nonlinear expressions in it.  In a [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] model, if the objective functions and constraints are represented entirely by [[linear equation]]s, then the model is regarded as a linear model.  If one or more of the objective functions or constraints are represented with a [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] equation, then the model is known as a nonlinear model.&lt;br&gt;Nonlinearity, even in fairly simple systems, is often associated with phenomena such as [[Chaos theory|chaos]] and [[irreversibility]].  Although there are exceptions, nonlinear systems and models tend to be more difficult to study than linear ones.  A common approach to nonlinear problems is [[linearization]], but this can be problematic if one is trying to study aspects such as irreversibility, which are strongly tied to nonlinearity.
* '''Static vs. dynamic:''' A ''dynamic'' model  accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the system, while a ''static'' (or steady-state) model calculates the system in equilibrium, and thus is time-invariant.  Dynamic models typically are represented by [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s.
* '''Explicit vs. implicit:''' If all of the input parameters of the overall model are known, and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations, the model is said to be ''explicit''. But sometimes it is the ''output'' parameters which are known, and the corresponding inputs must be solved for by an iterative procedure, such as [[Newton's method]] (if the model is linear) or [[Broyden's method]] (if non-linear). In such a case the model is said to be ''implicit''. For example, a [[jet engine]]'s physical properties such as turbine and nozzle throat areas can be explicitly calculated given a design [[thermodynamic cycle]] (air and fuel flow rates, pressures, and temperatures) at a specific flight condition and power setting, but the engine's operating cycles at other flight conditions and power settings cannot be explicitly calculated from the constant physical properties.
* '''Discrete vs. continuous:''' A [[discrete modeling|discrete model]] treats objects as discrete, such as the particles in a [[molecular model]] or the states in a [[statistical model]]; while a [[continuous model]] represents the objects in a continuous manner, such as the velocity field of fluid in pipe flows, temperatures and stresses in a solid, and electric field that applies continuously over the entire model due to a point charge.
* '''Deterministic vs. probabilistic (stochastic):''' A [[deterministic system|deterministic]] model is one in which every set of variable states is uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables; therefore, a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions. Conversely, in a stochastic model—usually called a "[[statistical model]]"—randomness is present, and variable states are not described by unique values, but rather by [[probability]] distributions.
* '''Deductive, inductive, or floating:''' A deductive model is a logical structure based on a theory. An inductive model arises from empirical findings and generalization from them. The floating model rests on neither theory nor observation, but is merely the invocation of expected structure. Application of mathematics in social sciences outside of economics has been criticized for unfounded models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stanislav Andreski |first=Stanislav |last=Andreski |year=1972 |title=Social Sciences as Sorcery |publisher=[[St. Martin’s Press]] |isbn=0-14-021816-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[catastrophe theory]] in science has been characterized as a floating model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Clifford Truesdell |first=Clifford |last=Truesdell |year=1984 |title=An Idiot’s Fugitive Essays on Science |pages=121–7 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-90703-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance in the natural sciences ==
Mathematical models are of great importance in the natural sciences, particularly in [[physics]]. Physical [[theory|theories]] are almost invariably expressed using mathematical models.

Throughout history, more and more accurate mathematical models have been developed. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] accurately describe many everyday phenomena, but at certain limits [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]] must be used; even these do not apply to all situations and need further refinement{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Examples|date=September 2017}}. It is possible to obtain the less accurate models in appropriate limits, for example relativistic mechanics reduces to Newtonian mechanics at speeds much less than the [[speed of light]]. Quantum mechanics reduces to classical physics when the quantum numbers are high. For example, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] of a tennis ball is insignificantly small, so classical physics is a good approximation to use in this case.

It is common to use idealized models in physics to simplify things. Massless ropes, point particles, [[ideal gases]] and the [[particle in a box]] are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. These laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by [[molecular orbital]] models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. In [[engineering]], physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as [[finite element analysis]].

Different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe. [[Euclidean geometry]] is much used in classical physics, while [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] are examples of theories that use [[geometry|geometries]] which are not Euclidean.

== Some applications==&lt;!--whatever this section is, it isn't background (original heading), and isn't general--&gt;
Since [[prehistory|prehistorical times]] simple models such as [[map]]s and [[Mathematical diagram|diagrams]] have been used.

Often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized, they use a mathematical model. In analysis, engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis of how the system could work, or try to estimate how an unforeseeable event could affect the system. Similarly, in control of a system, engineers can try out different control approaches in [[simulation]]s.

A mathematical model usually describes a system by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables. Variables may be of many types; [[Real number|real]] or [[integer]] numbers, [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values or [[String (computing)|strings]], for example. The variables represent some properties of the system, for example, measured system outputs often in the form of [[Signal (electronics)|signals]], [[Chronometry|timing data]], counters, and event occurrence (yes/no). The actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables.

== Building blocks ==
In [[business]] and [[engineering]], mathematical models may be used to maximize a certain output. The system under consideration will require certain inputs. The system relating inputs to outputs depends on other variables too: [[decision theory|decision variables]], [[state variable]]s, [[Exogeny|exogenous]] variables, and [[random variable]]s.

Decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables.  Exogenous variables are sometimes known as [[parameter]]s or [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s.
The variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision, input, random, and exogenous variables.  Furthermore, the output variables are dependent on the state of the system (represented by the state variables).

[[Goal|Objective]]s and [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s of the system and its users can be represented as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the output variables or state variables.  The [[objective function]]s will depend on the perspective of the model's user.  Depending on the context, an objective function is also known as an ''index of performance'', as it is some measure of interest to the user.  Although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have, using or optimizing the model becomes more involved (computationally) as the number increases.

For example, [[economist]]s often apply [[linear algebra]] when using [[input-output model]]s. Complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of [[vector space|vectors]] where one symbol represents several variables.

== A priori information ==
[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|480px|To analyse something with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.]]

Mathematical modeling problems are often classified into [[black box]] or [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] models, according to how much [[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]] information on the system is available. A black-box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available. A white-box model (also called glass box or clear box) is a system where all necessary information is available. Practically all systems are somewhere between the black-box and white-box models, so this concept is useful only as an intuitive guide for deciding which approach to take.

Usually it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate. Therefore, the white-box models are usually considered easier, because if you have used the information correctly, then the model will behave correctly. Often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables. For example, if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system, we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an [[exponential decay|exponentially decaying]] function. But we are still left with several unknown parameters; how rapidly does the medicine amount decay, and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood? This example is therefore not a completely white-box model. These parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model.

In black-box models one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions. Using a priori information we could end up, for example, with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately. If there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models. An often used approach for black-box models are [[artificial neural network|neural networks]] which usually do not make assumptions about incoming data. Alternatively the NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs) algorithms which were developed as part of [[nonlinear system identification]] &lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. (2013), ''Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains'', Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to select the model terms, determine the model structure, and estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of correlated and nonlinear noise. The advantage of NARMAX models compared to neural networks is that NARMAX produces models that can be written down and related to the underlying process, whereas neural networks produce an approximation that is opaque.

=== Subjective information ===
Sometimes it is useful to incorporate subjective information into a mathematical model.  This can be done based on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[experience]], or [[expert opinion]], or based on convenience of mathematical form.  [[Bayesian statistics]] provides a theoretical framework for incorporating such subjectivity into a rigorous analysis: we specify a [[prior probability distribution]] (which can be subjective), and then update this distribution based on empirical data.

An example of when such approach would be necessary is a situation in which an experimenter bends a coin slightly and tosses it once, recording whether it comes up heads, and is then given the task of predicting the probability that the next flip comes up heads.  After bending the coin, the true probability that the coin will come up heads is unknown; so the experimenter would need to make a decision (perhaps by looking at the shape of the coin) about what prior distribution to use.  Incorporation of such subjective information might be important to get an accurate estimate of the probability.

== Complexity ==
In general, model complexity involves a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy of the model.  [[Occam's razor]] is a principle particularly relevant to modeling, its essential idea being that among models with roughly equal predictive power, the simplest one is the most desirable.  While added complexity usually improves the realism of a model, it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze, and can also pose computational problems, including [[numerical instability]].  [[Thomas Kuhn]] argues that as science progresses, explanations tend to become more complex before a [[paradigm shift]] offers radical simplification {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

For example, when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model. It is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size. Engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[classical mechanics]] is an approximated model of the real world. Still, Newton's model is quite sufficient for most ordinary-life situations, that is, as long as particle speeds are well below the [[speed of light]], and we study macro-particles only.

== Training and tuning ==
Any model which is not pure white-box contains some [[parameter]]s that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe. If the modeling is done by an [[artificial neural network]] or other [[machine learning]], the optimization of parameters is called ''training''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Why|date=September 2017}}, while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called ''tuning'' and often uses [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. In more conventional modeling through explicitly given mathematical functions, parameters are often determined by ''[[curve fitting]]''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

== Model evaluation ==
A crucial part of the modeling process is the evaluation of whether or not a given mathematical model describes a system accurately.  This question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation.

=== Fit to empirical data ===
Usually the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model fits experimental measurements or other empirical data.  In models with parameters, a common approach to test this fit is to split the data into two disjoint subsets: training data and verification data. The training data are used to estimate the model parameters.  An accurate model will closely match the verification data even though these data were not used to set the model's parameters. This practice is referred to as [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] in statistics.

Defining a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] to measure distances between observed and predicted data is a useful tool of assessing model fit.  In statistics, decision theory, and some [[economic model]]s, a [[loss function]] plays a similar role.

While it is rather straightforward to test the appropriateness of parameters, it can be more difficult to test the validity of the general mathematical form of a model.  In general, more mathematical tools have been developed to test the fit of [[statistical model]]s than models involving [[differential equations]].  Tools from [[non-parametric statistics]] can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model's mathematical form.

=== Scope of the model ===
Assessing the scope of a model, that is, determining what situations the model is applicable to, can be less straightforward.  If the model was constructed based on a set of data, one must determine for which systems or situations the known data is a "typical" set of data.

The question of whether the model describes well the properties of the system between data points is called [[interpolation]], and the same question for events or data points outside the observed data is called [[extrapolation]].

As an example of the typical limitations of the scope of a model, in evaluating Newtonian [[classical mechanics]], we can note that Newton made his measurements without advanced equipment, so he could not measure properties of particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light.  Likewise, he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles, but macro particles only. It is then not surprising that his model does not extrapolate well into these domains, even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics.

=== Philosophical considerations ===
Many types of modeling implicitly involve claims about [[causality]].  This is usually (but not always) true of models involving differential equations.  As the purpose of modeling is to increase our understanding of the world, the validity of a model rests not only on its fit to empirical observations, but also on its ability to extrapolate to situations or data beyond those originally described in the model. One can think of this as the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative predictions. One can also argue that a model is worthless unless it provides some insight which goes beyond what is already known from direct investigation of the phenomenon being studied.

An example of such criticism is the argument that the mathematical models of [[optimal foraging theory]] do not offer insight that goes beyond the common-sense conclusions of [[evolution]] and other basic principles of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pyke | first1 = G. H. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515 | title = Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 15 | pages = 523–575 | year = 1984 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* One of the popular examples in [[computer science]] is the mathematical models of various machines, an example is the [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) which is defined as an abstract mathematical concept, but due to the deterministic nature of a DFA, it is implementable in hardware and software for solving various specific problems. For example, the following is a DFA M with a binary alphabet, which requires that the input contains an even number of 0s.

[[File:DFAexample.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[state diagram]] for ''M'']]
''M'' = (''Q'', Σ, δ, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F'') where
*''Q'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;},
*Σ = {0, 1},
*''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
*''F'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}, and
*δ is defined by the following [[state transition table]]:
:{| border="1" cell padding="1" cell spacing="0"
| || &lt;center&gt;'''0'''&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;'''1'''&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

The state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents that there has been an even number of 0s in the input so far, while ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an even number of 0s or not. If the input did contain an even number of 0s, ''M'' will finish in state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.

The language recognized by ''M'' is the [[regular language]] given by the [[regular expression]] 1*( 0 (1*) 0 (1*) )*, where "*" is the [[Kleene star]], e.g., 1* denotes any non-negative number (possibly zero) of symbols "1".

* Many everyday activities carried out without a thought are uses of mathematical models. A geographical [[map projection]] of a region of the earth onto a small, plane surface  is a model&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landinfo.com/resources_dictionaryMP.htm landinfo.com, definition of map projection]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for many purposes such as planning travel.
* Another simple activity is predicting the position of a vehicle from its initial position, direction and speed of travel, using the equation that distance traveled is the product of time and speed. This is known as [[dead reckoning]] when used more formally. Mathematical modeling in this way does not necessarily require formal mathematics; animals have been shown to use dead reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallistel |first= |title=The Organization of Learning |location=Cambridge |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1990 |ISBN=0-262-07113-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whishaw | first1 = I.

* ''[[Population]] Growth''. A simple (though approximate) model of population growth is the [[Malthusian growth model]]. A slightly more realistic and largely used population growth model is the [[logistic function]], and its extensions. 
* ''Model of a particle  in a potential-field''. In this model we consider a particle as being a point of mass which describes a trajectory in space which is modeled by a function giving its coordinates in space as a function of time. The potential field is given by a function &lt;math&gt;V\!:\mathbb{R}^3\!\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the trajectory, that is a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\!:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, is the solution of the [[differential equation]]:

::&lt;math&gt; -\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}m=\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial x}\mathbf{\hat{x}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial y}\mathbf{\hat{y}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial z}\mathbf{\hat{z}}, &lt;/math&gt;

that can be written also as:

::&lt;math&gt; m\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-\nabla V[\mathbf{r}(t)]. &lt;/math&gt;

:Note this model assumes  the particle is a point mass, which is certainly known to be false in many cases in which we use this model; for example, as a model of planetary motion.

* ''Model of rational behavior for a consumer''.  In this model we assume a consumer faces a choice of ''n'' commodities labeled 1,2,...,''n'' each with a market price ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The consumer is assumed to have an [[ordinal utility]] function ''U'' (ordinal in the sense that only the sign of the differences between two utilities, and not the level of each utility, is meaningful), depending on the amounts of commodities ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed.  The model further assumes that the consumer has a budget ''M'' which is used to purchase a vector ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in such a way as to maximize ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  The problem of rational behavior in this model then becomes an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem, that is:
:: &lt;math&gt; \max U(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:: subject to:
:: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i \leq M.&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; x_{i} \geq 0   \; \; \; \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n \} &lt;/math&gt;
: This model has been used in a wide variety of economic contexts, such as in [[general equilibrium theory]] to show existence and [[Pareto efficiency]] of economic equilibria.

The '''mediocrity principle''' is the [[philosophical]] notion that "if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it's likelier to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories".&lt;ref name="Kukla2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Kukla |year=2009 |title=Extraterrestrials: A Philosophical Perspective |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739142455 |lccn=2009032272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkdqTFVNwmgC&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|evolution of the Solar System]], [[Earth's history]], the [[evolution of biological complexity]], [[human evolution]], or any one [[nation]]. It is a [[heuristic]] in the vein of the [[Copernican principle]], and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even [[supremacism|superior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1377474/principle-of-mediocrity|title=principle of mediocrity - astrobiology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MediocrePZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_12.html#myerspz|title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011 — Page 12|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial life==
[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|thumb|200px|Life is ubiquitous on Earth, but does it exist elsewhere?]]

The mediocrity principle suggests, given the existence of life on Earth, that [[life]] typically exists on [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]]s throughout the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric, and Steve McMillan. ''Astronomy: A Beginner’s Guide to the Universe.'' Ed. Nancy Whilton. San Francisco: Pearson, 2010.{{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other approaches==

The mediocrity principle is in contrast with the [[anthropic principle]], which asserts that the presence of an intelligent observer (humans) limits the circumstances to bounds under which intelligent life can be [[Observation bias|observed to exist]], no matter [[Rare Earth hypothesis|how improbable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; Both stand in contrast to the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning hypothesis]], which asserts that the natural conditions for intelligent life are implausibly rare.

The mediocrity principle implies that Earth-like environments are necessarily common, based in part on the evidence of [[Doomsday argument|any happening at all]], whereas the anthropic principle suggests that no assertion can be made about the probability of intelligent life based on a sample set of one ([[Dunning–Kruger effect|self-described]]) example, who are necessarily capable of making such an assertion about themselves.

It is also possible to handle the Mediocrity Principle as a statistical problem, a case of a single [[Data point]] statistics, also present in the [[German tank problem]].

==Other uses==
[[David Deutsch]] argues that the mediocrity principle is incorrect from a physical point of view, in reference to either humanity's part of the universe or to its species. Deutsch refers to [[Stephen Hawking]]'s quote: "The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies". Deutsch wrote that Earth's neighborhood in the universe is not typical (80% of the universe's matter is [[dark matter]]) and that a concentration of mass such as the Solar System is an "isolated, uncommon phenomenon". He also disagrees with [[Richard Dawkins]], who considers that humans, because of natural evolution, are limited to the capabilities of their species. Deutsch responds that even though evolution did not give humans the ability to detect [[neutrino]]s, scientists can currently detect them, which significantly expands their capabilities beyond what is available as a result of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=[[David Deutsch]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mental model''' is an explanation of someone's [[thought]] process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape [[behaviour]] and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal [[algorithm]]) and doing tasks.

A mental model is a kind of internal symbol or representation of external reality, hypothesized to play a major role in [[cognition]], [[reasoning]] and [[decision-making]]. [[Kenneth Craik]] suggested in 1943 that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to anticipate events.

[[Jay Wright Forrester]] defined general mental models as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In psychology, the term ''mental models'' is sometimes used to refer to [[mental representation]]s or mental simulation generally. At other times it is used to refer to {{§l||Mental models and reasoning}} and to the mental model theory of reasoning developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]].

==History==
The term ''mental model'' is believed to have originated with [[Kenneth Craik]] in his 1943 book ''The Nature of Explanation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J.|authorlink=Nancy_J._Nersessian|title=In the Theoretician's Laboratory: Thought Experimenting as Mental Modeling|journal=PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|date=1992|volume=1992|pages=291–301|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/aimosaic/faculty/nersessian/papers/in-the-theoreticians-laboratory.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014|quote=The contemporary notion that mental modelling plays a significant role in human reasoning was formulated, initially, by Kenneth Craik in 1943.|doi=10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192843}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staggers|first1=Nancy|last2=Norcio|first2=A.F.|title=Mental models: concepts for human-computer interaction research|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|date=1993|volume=38|issue=4|pages=587–605|doi=10.1006/imms.1993.1028|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~norcio/papers/1993/Staggers-MM-IJMMS.pdf|quote=Although Johnson-Laird (1989) is generally credited with coining the term mental model, the history of the concept may be traced to Craik's (1943) work entitled ''The Nature of Explanation''.|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Georges-Henri Luquet|Georges-Henri Luquet]] in ''Le dessin enfantin'' (Children's drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].

[[Philip Johnson-Laird]] published ''Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness'' in 1983. In the same year, [[Dedre Gentner]] and [[Albert Stevens]] edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled ''Mental Models''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm "Mental models"], report at www.lauradove.info.&lt;/ref&gt; The first line of their book explains the idea further: "One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people's views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task." (see the book: ''[[Mental Models (Gentner-Stevens book)|Mental Models]]'').

Since then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in [[human-computer interaction]] and [[usability]] by researchers including [[Donald Norman]] and Steve Krug (in his book ''[[Don't Make Me Think]]''). [[Walter Kintsch]] and [[Teun A. van Dijk]], using the term ''situation model'' (in their book ''Strategies of Discourse Comprehension'', 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of [[discourse]].

==Mental models and reasoning==&lt;!-- [[#Mental models and reasoning]] above links to this heading --&gt;
One view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the [[picture theory of language]] described by philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1922. [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] developed a theory of mental models which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

===Principles of mental models===
Mental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions ([[axiom]]s), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the [[psychology of reasoning]] (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of [[counterfactual conditionals]] and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

===Reasoning with mental models===
People infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).

===Criticisms===
Scientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal [[rules of inference]] (e.g., O'Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng &amp; Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).

==Mental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics==

===Characteristics===
A mental model is generally:
* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts
* '''[[Cognitive flexibility|flexible]]''' – is considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense
* an '''information filter''' – causes [[selective perception]], perception of only selected parts of [[information]]
* '''very limited''', compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a [[scientific modelling|scientific model]] is extensive and in accordance with a certain [[reality]] in the derivation of [[logical consequence]]s of it, it must take into account such restrictions as [[working memory]]; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, [[gestaltism]]s or failure of the principles of [[logic]], etc.
* dependent on sources of information, which one can not find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proverbs.cz/media/art/SM_ST.pdf |format=PDF |author=Šusta, Marek |title=Několik slov o systémové dynamice a systémovém myšlení |pages=3–9 |publisher=Proverbs, a.s. |language=Czech |accessdate= 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mild2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mildeova, S., Vojtko V. |title=Systémová dynamika |year=2003 |isbn=80-245-0626-2 |publisher=Oeconomica |location=Prague |pages=19–24 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forste1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/ford_sterman_elicit_1.pdf |format=PDF |author=Ford, David N., Sterman, John D. |title=Expert Knowledge Elicitation to Improve Mental and Formal Models |publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, US - Massachusetts Institute of Technology |pages=18–23 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as "deeply held images of thinking and acting".&lt;ref&gt;"Leading for a Change", Ralph Jacobson, 2000, Chapter 5, Page102&lt;/ref&gt; Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

===Expression of mental models of dynamic systems===
S.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:
* [[Causal loop diagram]]s – displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops
* System structure diagrams – another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system
* Stock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system
These methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Natalie A. |last2=Ross |first2=Helen |last3=Lynam |first3=Timothy |last4=Perez |first4=Pascal |last5=Leitch |first5=Anne |title=Mental Models:  An Interdisciplinary Synthesis of Theory and Methods |journal=Ecology and Society |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |doi=10.5751/ES-03802-160146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, "a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalmodeler.org/resources/Gray%20et%20al%20Mental%20Modeler%202013.pdf|title=Mental Modeler: A Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping Modeling Tool for Adaptive Environmental Management|author=|date=|website=mentalmodeler.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.

===Mental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking===
In the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome [[systemic thinking]] and [[system dynamics]].

These two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"/&gt;

* '''[[System dynamics]]''' – extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.
* '''[[Systemic thinking]]''' – seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.

===Single and double-loop learning===
After analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. [[Learning]] is a back-loop [[wikt:process|process]], and [[feedback]] loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.

====Single-loop learning====
Mental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.

====Double-loop learning====
{{Main|Double-loop learning}}
Double-loop learning (''see diagram below'') is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.&lt;ref name="mild2003"/&gt;

A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental representation is the mental imagery of things that are not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mckellar|first1=Peter|title=Imagination and thinking: A psychological analysis|date=1957|publisher=Oxford, England|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1958-00258-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], specifically in fields of [[metaphysics]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[ontology]], a mental representation is one of the prevailing ways of [[explanation|explaining]] and [[description|describing]] the nature of [[idea]]s and [[concept]]s.

Mental representations (or mental imagery) enable representing things that have never been experienced as well as things that do not exist.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author = Robert J. Sternberg|url = https://books.google.com/?id=la6mSK9vyIgC|title = Cognitive Psychology|year = 2009|isbn = 9780495506294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Think of yourself traveling to a place you have never visited before, or having a third arm. These things have either never happened or are impossible and do not exist, yet our brain and mental imagery allows us to imagine them. Although visual imagery is more likely to be recalled, mental imagery may involve representations in any of the sensory modalities, such as hearing, smell, or taste. [[Stephen Kosslyn]] proposes that images are used to help solve certain types of problems. We are able to visualize the objects in question and mentally represent the images to solve it.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009" /&gt;

Mental representations also allow people to experience things right in front of them—though the process of how the brain interprets the [[Mental content|representational content]] is debated.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Representational theories of mind ==

[[Representationalism]] (also known as [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) is the view that representations are the main way we access external reality. Another major prevailing [[philosophical theory]] posits that concepts are entirely [[abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?|url=http://philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/OntologyofConcepts.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Margolis|first1=Eric|last2=Laurence|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen Laurence|journal=Noûs|volume=41|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=561–593|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representational theory of mind attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other [[mental content]] in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of mental representations which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world.

For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness.

The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects or states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] (i.e., mentalese). The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages. For the Spanish logician and cognitive scientist Luis M. Augusto, at this abstract, formal level, the syntax of thought is the set of symbol rules (i.e., operations, processes, etc. on and with symbol structures) and the semantics of thought is the set of symbol structures (concepts and propositions). Content (i.e., thought) emerges from the meaningful co-occurrence of both sets of symbols. For instance, "8 x 9" is a meaningful co-occurrence, whereas "CAT x §" is not; "x" is a symbol rule called for by symbol structures such as "8" and "9", but not by "CAT" and "§".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Unconscious representations 2: Towards an integrated cognitive architecture.|last = Augusto|first = Luis M.|date = 2014|journal = Axiomathes |volume=24|pages=19–43|doi = 10.1007/s10516-012-9207-y|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strong vs weak, restricted vs unrestricted ===
There are two types of representationalism, strong and weak. Strong representationalism attempts to reduce phenomenal character to intentional content. On the other hand, weak representationalism claims only that phenomenal character supervenes on intentional content. Strong representationalism aims to provide a theory about the nature of phenomenal character, and offers a solution to the hard problem of consciousness. In contrast to this, weak representationalism does not aim to provide a theory of consciousness, nor does it offer a solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

Strong representationalism can be further broken down into restricted and unrestricted versions. The restricted version deals only with certain kinds of phenomenal states e.g. visual perception. Most representationalists endorse an unrestricted version of representationalism. According to the unrestricted version, for any state with phenomenal character that state’s phenomenal character reduces to its intentional content. Only this unrestricted version of representationalism is able to provide a general theory about the nature of phenomenal character, as well as offer a potential solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The successful reduction of the phenomenal character of a state to its intentional content would provide a solution to the hard problem of consciousness once a physicalist account of intentionality is worked out.

=== Problems for the unrestricted version ===
When arguing against the unrestricted version of representationalism people will often bring up phenomenal mental states that appear to lack intentional content. The unrestricted version seeks to account for all phenomenal states. Thus, for it to be true, all states with phenomenal character must have intentional content to which that character is reduced. Phenomenal states without intentional content therefore serve as a counterexample to the unrestricted version. If the state has no intentional content its phenomenal character will not be reducible to that state’s intentional content, for it has none to begin with.

A common example of this kind of state are moods. Moods are states with phenomenal character that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. Moods are thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. you are mad ''at'' your sibling, you are afraid ''of'' a dangerous animal. People conclude that because moods are undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.

Though emotions are typically considered as having directedness and intentionality this idea has also been called into question. One might point to emotions a person all of a sudden experiences that do not appear to be directed at or about anything in particular. Emotions elicited by listening to music are another potential example of undirected, nonintentional emotions. Emotions aroused in this way do not seem to necessarily be about anything, including the music that arouses them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kind|first = Amy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses&lt;!--'Directedness' redirects here--&gt; ===
In response to this objection a proponent of representationalism might reject the undirected nonintentionality of moods, and attempt to identify some intentional content they might plausibly be thought to possess. The proponent of representationalism might also reject the narrow conception of intentionality as being directed at a particular thing, arguing instead for a broader kind of intentionality.

There are three alternative kinds of '''directedness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;/[[intentionality]] one might posit for moods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Outward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content.
* Inward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
* Hybrid directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have both a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content and a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
In the case of outward directedness moods might be directed at either the world as a whole, a changing series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In the case of inward directedness moods are directed at the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness moods are directed at some combination of inward and outward things.

=== Further objections ===
Even if one can identify some possible intentional content for moods we might still question whether that content is able to sufficiently capture the phenomenal character of the mood states they are a part of. Amy Kind contends that in the case of all the previously mentioned kinds of directedness (outward, inward, and hybrid) the intentional content supplied to the mood state is not capable of sufficiently capturing the phenomenal aspects of the mood states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the case of inward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood does not seem tied to the state of one’s body, and even if one’s mood is reflected by the overall state of one’s body that person will not necessarily be aware of it, demonstrating the insufficiency of the intentional content to adequately capture the phenomenal aspects of the mood. In the case of outward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood and its intentional content do not seem to share the corresponding relation they should given that the phenomenal character is supposed to reduce to the intentional content. Hybrid directedness, if it can even get off the ground, faces the same objection.

== Philosophers ==
There is a wide debate on what kinds of representations exist. There are several philosophers who bring about different aspects of the debate. Such philosophers include Alex Morgan, Gualtiero Piccinini, and Uriah Kriegel—though this is not an exhaustive list.

=== Alex Morgan ===

There are "job description" representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is representations that (1) represent something—have [[intentionality]], (2) have a special relation—the represented object does not need to exist, and (3) content plays a causal role in what gets represented:  e.g. saying "hello" to a friend, giving a glare to an enemy.

Structural representations are also important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations are basically mental maps that we have in our minds that correspond exactly to those objects in the world (the intentional content). According to Morgan, structural representations are not the same as mental representations—there is nothing mental about them:  plants can have structural representations.

There are also internal representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations include those that involve future decisions, episodic memories, or any type of projection into the future.

=== Gualtiero Piccinini ===

In [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]'s forthcoming work, he discusses topics on natural and nonnatural mental representations. He relies on the natural definition of mental representations given by Grice (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Meaning|last = Grice|first = H.P.|date = 1957|journal = Philosophical Review |volume=66|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''P entails that P''. e.g. Those spots mean measles, entails that the patient has measles. Then there are nonnatural representations:  ''P does not entail P''. e.g. The 3 rings on the bell of a bus mean the bus is full—the rings on the bell are independent of the fullness of the bus—we could have assigned something else (just as arbitrary) to signify that the bus is full.

=== Uriah Kriegel ===

There are also objective and subjective mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 161–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective representations are closest to tracking theories—where the brain simply tracks what is in the environment. If there is a blue bird outside my window, the objective representation is that of the blue bird. Subjective representations can vary person-to-person. For example, if I am colorblind, that blue bird outside my window will not ''appear'' blue to me since I cannot represent the blueness of blue (i.e. I cannot see the color blue). The relationship between these two types of representation can vary.

&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective varies, but the subjective does not:  e.g. brain-in-a-vat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective varies, but the objective does not:  e.g. color-inverted world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in objective and none in the subjective:  e.g. thermometer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in subjective and none in the objective:  e.g. an agent that experiences in a void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Eliminativists think that subjective representations don't exist. Reductivists think subjective representations are reducible to objective. Non-reductivists think that subjective representations are real and distinct.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Neuroticism can plague an individual with severe mood swings, frequent sadness, worry, and being easily disturbed,&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tellegen 1985"/&gt; and predicts the development and onset of all "common" [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeronimus, B.F., Kotov,  R., Riese, H., Ormel, J.| year = 2016 | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | pages = 1–24 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291716001653 | doi=10.1017/S0033291716001653 | pmid=27523506 | volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that negative affectivity relates to different classes of variables: Self-reported [[stress (biological)|stress]] and (poor) coping skills,&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tessler | first1 = R. | last2 = Mechanic | first2 = D. | year = 1978 | title = Psychological distress and perceived health status | url = | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 254–262 | doi=10.2307/2136558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wills | first1 = T.

People who express high negative affectivity view themselves and a variety of aspects of the world around them in generally negative terms.&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984" /&gt; Negative affectivity is strongly related to [[subjective life satisfaction|life satisfaction]]. Individuals high in negative affect will exhibit, on average, higher levels of distress, anxiety, and dissatisfaction, and tend to focus on the unpleasant aspects of themselves, the world, the future, and other people, and also evoke more negative life events.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"/&gt; The similarities between these affective traits and life satisfaction have led some researchers to view both positive and negative affect with life satisfaction as specific indicators of the broader construct of [[subjective well-being]].

Negative affect arousal mechanisms can induce negative affective states as evidenced by a study conducted by Stanley S. Seidner on negative arousal and white noise. The study quantified reactions from Mexican and Puerto Rican participants in response to the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (1991), Negative Affect Arousal Reactions from Mexican and Puerto Rican Respondents, Washington, D.C.: ERIC, ISBN ED346711 http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED346711&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED346711&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
There are many instruments that can be used to measure negative affectivity, including measures of related concepts, such as neuroticism and trait anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = D. | last2 = Clark | first2 = L. A. | year = 1984 | title = Negative affectivity: The disposition to experience aversive emotional states | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 96 | issue = 3| pages = 465–490 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.96.3.465 | pmid=6393179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two frequently used are:

'''[[Positive and Negative Affect Schedule|PANAS]]''' – [[Positive and Negative Affect Schedule|
The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule]] incorporates a 10-item negative affect scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=D.|author2=Clark, L. A. |author3=Tellegen, A. |title=Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1988|volume=54|issue=6|pages=1063–1070|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063|pmid=3397865}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PANAS-X is an expanded version of PANAS that incorporates negative affect subscales for  Fear, Sadness, Guilt, Hostility, and Shyness.

'''I-PANAS-SF''' – The International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form is an extensively validated brief, cross-culturally reliable 10-item version of the PANAS.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E.R.|title=Development and validation of an internationally reliable short-form of the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS)|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=2007|volume=38|issue=2|pages=227–242|doi=10.1177/0022022106297301|url=http://dionysus.psych.wisc.edu/lit/Articles/ThompsonE2007a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative Affect items are Afraid, Ashamed, Hostile, Nervous and Upset. Internal consistency reliabilities between .72 and .76 are reported. The I-PANAS-SF was developed to eliminate redundant and ambiguous items and thereby derive an efficient measure for general use in research situations where either time or space are limited, or where international populations are of interest but where English may not be the mother tongue.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

==Benefits==
Recent studies indicate that negative affect has important, beneficial impacts on cognition and behavior. These developments are a remarkable departure from past psychological research, which is characterized by a unilateral emphasis on the benefits of [[positive affect]].&lt;ref name=Seed&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Don't Worry, Be Sad! On the Cognitive, Motivational, and Interpersonal Benefits of Negative Mood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2013|volume=22|issue=3|pages=225–232|doi=10.1177/0963721412474458|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/22/3/225.full.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both states of affect influence mental processes and behavior.&lt;ref name=2ndary /&gt; Negative affect is regularly recognized as a "stable, heritable trait tendency to experience a broad range of negative feelings, such as worry, anxiety, self-criticisms, and a negative self-view". This allows one to feel every type of emotion, which is regarded as a normal part of life and human nature. So, while the emotions themselves are viewed as negative, the individual experiencing them should not be classified as a negative person or depressed. They are going through a normal process and are feeling something that many individuals may not be able to feel or process due to differing problems.

These findings complement [[evolutionary psychology]] theories that affective states serve adaptive functions in promoting suitable cognitive strategies to deal with environmental challenges.&lt;ref name=2ndary&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Cognitive Theories of Affect|journal=Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|date=30 January 2010|pages=1–3|doi=10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive affect is associated with assimilative, top-down processing used in response to familiar, benign environments. Negative affect is connected with accommodative, bottom-up processing in response to unfamiliar, or problematic environments.&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler&gt;{{cite book|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Affect in social thinking and behavior|year=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY, US|isbn=1-84169-454-1|pages=65–84|author2=Herbert Bless|edition=12|editor1=Klaus Fiedler|editor2=Joseph Forgas|accessdate=4 December 2013|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;AN=2006-21670-004&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, positive affectivity promotes simplistic [[heuristic]] approaches that rely on preexisting knowledge and assumptions. Conversely, negative affectivity promotes controlled, analytic approaches that rely on externally drawn information.&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler /&gt;

Benefits of negative affect are present in areas of cognition including [[perception]], [[judgment]], [[memory]] and interpersonal personal relations.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;&lt;ref name=2ndary /&gt; Since negative affect relies more on cautious processing than preexisting knowledge, people with negative affect tend to perform better in instances involving [[deception]], manipulation, [[impression formation]], and [[stereotyping]]. Negative affectivity's analytical and detailed processing of information leads to fewer reconstructive-memory errors, whereas positive mood relies on broader schematic to thematic information that ignores detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bless, H, Schawarz, N|first=ed. by Shelly Chaiken|title=Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology|year=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=1-57230-421-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, information processing in negative moods reduces the [[misinformation effect]] and increases overall accuracy of details.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; People also exhibit less interfering responses to stimuli when given descriptions or performing any [[cognitive]] task.&lt;ref name=Seed&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Don't Worry, Be Sad! On the Cognitive, Motivational, and Interpersonal Benefits of Negative Mood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2013|volume=22|issue=3|pages=225–232|doi=10.1177/0963721412474458|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/22/3/225.full.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judgment===
People are notoriously susceptible to forming inaccurate judgments based on [[biases]] and limited information. Evolutionary theories propose that negative affective states tend to increase skepticism and decrease reliance on preexisting knowledge.&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler /&gt; Consequently, judgmental accuracy is improved in areas such as [[impression formation]], reducing [[fundamental attribution error]], [[stereotyping]], and [[gullibility]].&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; While sadness is normally associated with the hippocampus, it does not produce the same side effects that would be associated with feelings of pleasure or excitement. Sadness correlates with feeling blue or the creation of tears, while excitement may cause a spike in blood pressure and one's pulse. As far as judgment goes, most people think about how they themselves feel about a certain situation. They will jump right to their current mood when asked a question. However, some mistake this process when using their current mood to justify a reaction to a stimulus. If you're sad, yet only a little bit, chances are your reactions and input will be negative as a whole.

====Impression formation====
First impressions are one of the most basic forms of judgments people make on a daily basis; yet judgment formation is a complex and fallible process. Negative affect is shown to decrease errors in forming impressions based on presuppositions.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; One common judgment error is the [[halo effect]], or the tendency to form unfounded impressions of people based on known but irrelevant information.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; For instance, more attractive people are often attributed with more positive qualities. Research demonstrates that positive affect tends to increase the halo effect, whereas negative affect decreases it.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=She just doesn't look like a philosopher…? Affective influences on the halo effect in impression formatio|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=41|issue=7|pages=812–817|doi=10.1002/ejsp.842|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=67365761&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study involving undergraduate students demonstrated a halo effect in identifying a middle-aged man as more likely to be a philosopher than an unconventional, young woman.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; These halo effects were nearly eliminated when participants were in a negative affective state. In the study, researchers sorted participants into either happy or sad groups using an autobiographical mood induction task in which participants reminisced on sad or happy memories.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; Then, participants read a philosophical essay by a fake academic who was identified as either a middle-aged, bespectacled man or as a young, unorthodox-looking woman. The fake writer was evaluated on intelligence and competence. The positive affect group exhibited a strong halo effect, rating the male writer significantly higher than the female writer in competence.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; The negative affect group exhibited almost no halo effects rating the two equally. Researchers concluded that impression formation is improved by negative affect.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; Their findings support theories that negative affect results in more elaborate processing based upon external, available information.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt;

====Fundamental attribution error====
The systematic, attentive approach caused by negative affect reduces [[fundamental attribution error]], the tendency to inaccurately attribute behavior to a person's internal character without taking external, situational factors into account.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=On being happy and mistaken: Mood effects on the fundamental attribution  error|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1998|volume=75|issue=2|pages=318–331|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.2.318|pmid=9731311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=She just doesn't look like a philosopher…? Affective influences on the halo effect in impression formation|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=41|issue=7|pages=812–817|doi=10.1002/ejsp.842}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental attribution error (FAE) is connected with positive affect since it occurs when people use top-down cognitive processing based on inferences. Negative affect stimulates bottom-up, systematic analysis that reduces fundamental attribution error.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt;

This effect is documented in FAE research in which students evaluated a fake debater on attitude and likability based on an essay the "debater" wrote.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt; After being sorted into positive or negative affect groups, participants read one of two possible essays arguing for one side or another on a highly controversial topic. Participants were informed that the debater was assigned a stance to take in the essay that did not necessarily reflect his views.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt;  Still, the positive affect groups rated debaters who argued unpopular views as holding the same attitude expressed in the essay. They were also rated as unlikeable compared to debaters with popular stances, thus, demonstrating FAE. In contrast, the data for the negative affect group displayed no significant difference in ratings for debaters with popular stance and debaters with unpopular stances.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt; These results indicate that positive affect assimilation styles promote fundamental attribution error, and negative affect accommodation styles minimize the error in respect to judging people.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;

====Stereotyping====
Negative affect benefits judgment in diminishing the implicit use of stereotypes by promoting closer attention to stimuli.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;  In one study, participants were less likely to discriminate against targets that appeared Muslim when in a negative affective state.&lt;ref name=Unkelbach&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unkelbach|first=Christian|author2=Joseph P. Forgas |author3=Thomas F. Denson |title=The turban effect: The influence of Muslim headgear and induced affect on aggressive responses in the shooter bias paradigm|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2008|volume=44|pages=1409–1413|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After organizing participants into positive and negative affect groups, researchers had them play a computer game. Participants had to make rapid decisions to shoot only at targets carrying a gun.&lt;ref name=Unkelbach/&gt; Some of the targets wore turbans making them appear Muslim. As expected, there was a significant bias against Muslim targets resulting in a tendency to shoot at them.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; However, this tendency decreased with subjects in negative affective states. Positive affect groups developed more aggressive tendencies toward Muslims.&lt;ref name=Unkelbach/&gt; Researchers concluded that negative affect leads to less reliance on internal stereotypes, thus decreasing judgmental bias.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;

====Gullibility====
Multiple studies have shown that negative affectivity has a beneficial role in increasing skepticism and decreasing gullibility.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; Because negative affective states increase external analysis and attention to details, people in negative states are better able to detect deception.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler /&gt;

Researchers have presented findings in which students in negative affective states had improved lie detection compared to students in positive affective states.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinhard|first=Marc-André|author2=Norbert Schwarz|title=The Influence of Affective States on the Process of Lie Detection|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|year=2012|volume=18|issue=4|pages=377–389|doi= 10.1037/a0030466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study, students watched video clips of everyday people either lying or telling the truth. First, music was used to induce positive, negative, or neutral affect in participants.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)" /&gt; Then, experimenters played 14 video messages that had to be identified by participants as true or false. As expected, the negative affect group performed better in veracity judgments than the positive affect group who performed no better than chance.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)" /&gt; Researchers believe that the negative affect groups detected deception more successfully because they attended to stimulus details and systematically built inferences from those details.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)" /&gt;

===Memory===
Memory has been found to have many [[The Seven Sins of Memory|failures]] that effect the accuracy of recalled memories.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson-Riegler|first=Bridget Robinson-Riegler, Gregory|title=Cognitive psychology: Applying the Science of the mind|publisher=Pearson Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-205-03364-5|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been especially pragmatic in criminal settings as eyewitness memories have been found to be less reliable than one would hope. However, the externally focused and accommodative processing of negative affect has a positive effect on the overall improvement of memory. This evidenced by reduction of the misinformation effect and the number of false memories reported.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; The knowledge implies that negative affect can be used to enhance eyewitness memory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Joseph P. Forgas |editor2=Klaus Fiedler |editor3=Constantine Sedikides |title=Social thinking and interpersonal behavior|year=2013|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-203-13967-7|pages=221–238|type=PDF|chapter=The upside of feeling down: The benefits of negative mood for social cognition and social behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, additional research suggests that the extent to which memory is improved by negative affect does not sufficiently improve eyewitness testimonies to significantly reduce its error.

====Misinformation effect====
Negative affect has been shown to decrease susceptibility of incorporating misleading information, which is related to the misinformation effect.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; The '''misinformation effect''' refers to the finding that misleading information presented between the encoding of an event and its subsequent recall influences a witness's memory.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt; This corresponds to two types of memory failure:
:[[The Seven Sins of Memory|'''Suggestibility''']]: When recollections are influenced by the prodding or expectations of others creating [[Confabulation|false memories]].&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaPaglia|first=Jessica A.|author2=Wilford, Miko M. |author3=Rivard, Jillian R. |author4=Chan, Jason C. K. |author5= Fisher, Ronald P. |title=Misleading Suggestions can Alter Later Memory Reports even Following a Cognitive Interview|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|date=October 2013|doi=10.1002/acp.2950 |volume=28 |pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:[[Misattribution of memory|'''Misattribution''']]: When a witness gets confused and misattributes the misinformation to the original event. Also defined as the retroactive interference: When later information interferes with the ability to retain previously encoded information.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

=====In witness of events=====
Negative mood is shown to decrease suggestibility error. This is seen through reduced amounts of incorporation of false memories when misleading information is present. On the other hand, positive affect has shown to increase susceptibility to misleading information. An experiment with undergraduate students supported these results. Participants began the study in a lecture hall and witnessed what they thought was an unexpected five-minute belligerent encounter between an intruder and the lecturer. A week later, these participants watched a 10-minute-long video that generated either a positive, negative or neutral mood. They then completed a brief questionnaire about the previous incident between the intruder and lecturer that they witnessed the week earlier. In this questionnaire half of the participants received questions with misleading information and the other half received questions without any misleading information. This manipulation was used to determine if participants were susceptible to suggestibility failure. After 45 minutes of unrelated distractors participants were given a set of true or false questions which tested for false memories. Participants experiencing negative moods reported fewer numbers of false memories, whereas those experiencing positive moods reported a greater amount of false memories. This implies that positive affect promotes integration of misleading details and negative affect reduces the misinformation effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph P.|author2=Laham, Simon M. |author3=Vargas, Patrick T. |title=Mood effects on eyewitness memory: Affective influences on susceptibility to misinformation|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=November 2005|volume=41|issue=6|pages=574–588|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2004.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=das&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Weiner|editor-first=Irving B.|title=Handbook of psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781118133880|edition=2nd |type=Web|chapter=Affective Influences on Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====In recall of past public events=====
People who experience negative affectivity following an event report fewer reconstructive false memories. This was evidenced by two studies conducted around public events. The first surrounded the events of the televised O.J. Simpson trial. Participants were asked to fill out questionnaires three times: one week, two months and a year after the televised verdict. These questionnaires measured participant emotion towards the verdict and the accuracy of their recalled memory of what occurred during the trial. Overall the study found that although participant response to the event outcome did not affect the quantity of remembered information, it did influence the likelihood of false memory. Participants who were pleased with the verdict of the O.J. Simpson trial were more likely to falsely believe something occurred during the trial than those who were displeased with the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Linda|author2=Bluck, Susan|title=Painting with broad strokes: Happiness and the malleability of event memory|journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion|date=June 2004|volume=18|issue=4|pages=559–574|doi=10.1080/02699930341000446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=das2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kensinger|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Negative Emotion Enhances Memory Accuracy: Behavioral and Neuroimaging Evidence|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date= August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=213–218|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00506.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another experiment found the same findings with Red Sox fans and Yankees fans in their overall memory of events that occurred in the final game of a 2004 playoff series in which the Red Sox defeated the Yankees.&lt;ref name=das2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kensinger|first=Elizabeth A.|author2=Schacter, Daniel L.|title=When the Red Sox shocked the Yankees: Comparing negative and positive memories|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=October 2006|volume=13|issue=5|pages=757–763|doi=10.3758/BF03193993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that the Yankees fans had better memory of events that occurred than the Red Sox fans. The results from both of these experiments are consistent with the findings that negative emotion can lead to fewer memory errors and thus increased memory accuracy of events.&lt;ref name=das2 /&gt;

====Degree of enhanced memory====
Although negative affect has been shown to decrease the misinformation effect, the degree to which memory is improved is not enough to make a significant effect on witness testimony. In fact, emotions, including negative affect, are shown to reduce accuracy in identifying perpetrators from photographic lineups. Researchers demonstrated this effect in an experiment in which participants watched a video that induced either negative emotion or a neutral mood. The two videos were deliberately similar except for the action of interest, which was either a mugging (negative emotion) or a conversation (neutral emotion). After watching one of the two videos participants are shown perpetrator lineups, which either contained the target perpetrator from the video or a foil, a person that looked similar to the target. The results revealed that the participants who watched the emotion-induced video were more likely to incorrectly identify the innocent foil than to correctly identify the perpetrator. Neutral participants were more likely to correctly identify the perpetrator in comparison to their emotional counterparts. This demonstrates that emotional affect in forensic settings decreases accuracy of eyewitness memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houston|first=Kate A.|author2=Clifford, Brian R. |author3=Phillips, Louise H. |author4= Memon, Amina |title=The emotional eyewitness: The effects of emotion on specific aspects of eyewitness recall and recognition performance.|journal=Emotion|year=2013|volume=13|issue=1|pages=118–128|doi=10.1037/a0029220}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are consistent with prior knowledge that stress and emotion greatly impair eyewitness ability to recognitive perpetrators.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

===Interpersonal benefits===
Negative affectivity can produce several interpersonal benefits. It can cause subjects to be more polite and considerate with others. Unlike positive mood, which causes less assertive approaches, negative affectivity can, in many ways, cause a person to be more polite and elaborate when making requests.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;

Negative affectivity increases the accuracy of social perceptions and inferences. Specifically, high negative-affectivity people have more negative, but accurate, perceptions of the impression they make to others. People with low negative affectivity form overly-positive, potentially inaccurate impression of others that can lead to misplaced trust.&lt;ref name=per&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Jennifer D.|author2=Fehr, Beverley|title=Self-esteem and perceptions of conveyed impressions: Is negative affectivity associated with greater realism?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=58|issue=1|pages=122–133|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.1.122|pmid=2308069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intergroup discrimination====
A research conducted by Forgas J.P studied how affectivity can influence intergroup discrimination. He measured affectivity by how people allocate rewards to [[in-group]] and [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]] members. In the procedure, participants had to describe their interpretations after looking at patterns of judgments about people. Afterwards, participants were exposed to a mood induction process, where they had to watch videotapes designed to elicit negative or positive affectivity. Results showed that participants with positive affectivity were more negative and discriminated more than participants with negative affectivity. Also, happy participants were more likely to discriminate between in-group and out-group members than sad participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph P.|author2=Fiedler, Klaus|title=Us and them: Mood effects on intergroup discrimination.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1996|volume=70|issue=1|pages=28–40|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.1.28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative affect is often associated with team selection. It is viewed as a trait that could make selecting individuals for a team irrelevant, thus preventing knowledge from becoming known or predicted for current issues that may arise.

====Communication====
Negative affectivity subconsciously signals a challenging social environment.
Negative mood may increase a tendency to conform to social norms.&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = D. | last2 = Clark | first2 = L. A. | year = 1984 | title = Negative affectivity: The disposition to experience negative aversive emotional states | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 465–490 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.96.3.465 | pmid=6393179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study, college students where exposed to a mood induction process. After the mood induction process, participants were required to watch a show with positive and negative elements. After watching the show, they were asked to engage on a hypothetical conversation in which they "describe the episode (they) just observed to a friend". Their speech was recorded and transcribed during this task. Results showed that speakers in a negative mood had a better quality descriptions and greater amount of  information and details. These results show that negative mood can improve people's communication skills.&lt;ref name=com&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=Alex S.|author2=Forgas, Joseph P. |author3=Matovic, Diana |title=Can negative mood improve your conversation? Affective influences on conforming to Grice's communication norms|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=August 2013|volume=43|issue=5|pages=326–334|doi=10.1002/ejsp.1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A negative mood is closely linked to better conversation because it makes use of the hippocampus and different regions of the brain.{{cn|date=October 2018}} When someone is upset, that individual may see or hear things differently than an individual who is very upbeat and happy all the time. The small details the negative individual picks up may be something completely overlooked before. Anxiety disorders are often associated with over-thinking and ruminating on topics that would seem irrelevant and pointless to an individual without a disorder. [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]] is one common anxiety trait that allows the affected individual a different insight on how things may appear to be. A person that makes use of his or her negative affect has a different view of the world and what goes on in it, thus making their conversations different and interesting to others.

====Self-disclosure====
Results of one study show that participants with negative affectivity were more careful with the information they shared with others, being more cautious with who they could trust or not. Researchers found that negative mood not only decreases intimacy levels but also increases caution in placing trust in others.&lt;ref name=self&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph P.|title=Affective influences on self-disclosure: Mood effects on the intimacy and reciprocity of disclosing personal information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=3|pages=449–461|doi=10.1037/a0021129|pmid=21171788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6961">The '''negative double''' is a form of [[takeout double]] in [[Contract bridge|bridge]]. It is made by the responder after his right-hand opponent [[overcall]]s on the first round of bidding, and is used to show both support for the unbid suits as well as some values. It is treated as forcing, but not unconditionally so. In practice, the negative double is sometimes used as a sort of catch-all, made when no other call properly describes responder's hand. Therefore, a partnership might even treat the negative double as a wide-ranging call that merely shows some values.

==Usage==

Using the modern negative double convention, it is understood that a double over an initial overcall is conventional, and ''not'' for penalties (but see [[#Playing for penalties|Playing for penalties]]). For example, using this convention, the following doubles would be regarded as negative, not for penalty:

*1{{Clubs}} – (1{{Diams}}) – Dbl
*1m – (1M) – Dbl
*1{{Hearts}} – (1{{Spades}}) – Dbl
*1M – (2m) – Dbl

In understandings regarding negative doubles, the emphasis is on major suit lengths. This is largely due to the special value that tournament play, especially the pairs game, places on major suits. Since the mid-1980s, the negative double has been used mainly to stand in for a bid in an unbid major suit.

Most partnerships using the negative double agree that it applies only through a particular level of overcall. For example, they may agree that the double of an overcall through 3{{Spades}} is negative, and that beyond 3{{Spades}} a double is for penalties.

At [[rubber bridge]] many players are reluctant to give up the penalty double of an overcall, and so do not use the double as conventional.

==History of terms used for this bid==

The term ''negative double'' was initially employed to distinguish it from the ''penalty'', or ''business'', or ''positive'' double, and signified a double over an opponent's opening bid whose meaning was a request for partner to bid his best suit. Around 1930, the term ''informatory double'' replaced ''negative double'', and that term later gave way to ''[[takeout double]]'' as it is used at present; the original term ''negative double'' fell into disuse.

In 1957, [[Alvin Roth (bridge)|Alvin Roth]] in his partnership with [[Tobias Stone]] appropriated the abandoned term ''negative double'' to denote a conventional double by responder over an overcall and gave it its current meaning.&lt;ref name=OEB7303&gt;{{OEB|7|303}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid was also briefly known as ''Sputnik'', because it was as new as the [[Sputnik|satellite of that name]] that the Soviet Union had recently launched. The term is still used sometimes in Europe.&lt;ref name =OEB7303/&gt;

==Forcing==

The negative double is generally [[forcing bid|forcing]], but opener might pass to convert the double to a penalty double. There is a special agreement called [[negative free bid]]s, under which (after the overcall) the bid of a new suit by responder is not forcing. However, most negative doublers play that a new suit response (or [[Contract bridge glossary#F|free bid]]), whether at the one level or higher, is forcing.

The negative double loses even more definition when it can be made with a very broad range of strength, from roughly six HCP up to game forcing values. In a pinch, players use it to "get by this round of bidding."

==Playing for penalties==

The negative double does not cause the partnership to completely lose the ability to penalize an overcall. There are two ways that the overcall can be doubled for penalties. For example:

*1{{Diams}} – (1{{Hearts}}) – Dbl  – (Pass); '''Pass'''

Responder makes a negative double, and opener passes for penalties. This position is analogous to one in which a player makes a takeout double and his partner passes the double, converting it to a penalty double.

*1{{Diams}} – (1{{Hearts}}) – Pass – (Pass); Dbl – (Pass) – '''Pass'''

Responder passes the overcall, opener makes a re-opening double, and responder passes that double for penalties. This can be dangerous, because opener often doesn't know whether responder is simply too weak to make any call, or is hoping that opener can re-open with a double.

These situations are rare, though, and the more so because some five-card major partnerships play negative doubles ''over minor suit openings only.'' The rationale is that responder knows much more about opener's distribution after a major suit opening than after a minor suit opening, and can better judge whether to play in opener's major suit, to play for penalties by doubling, or to show a suit of his own.

==Support for unbid suits==

Partnerships have different understandings about the length in unbid suits that is shown by a negative double, and the understandings differ according both to which suits remain unbid and to the current level of the bidding. Nevertheless, the following are popular understandings:

*After 1{{Clubs}} – (1{{Diams}}),  a negative double is often understood to show at least four cards in both hearts and spades. The degree of support for this agreement has grown over the years. A poll of experts taken in 1983&lt;ref&gt;[[Bridge World Standard]] BWS84 poll results in [[The Bridge World]], July 1984, 17-22.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that about half concurred that doubler should have at least four hearts and at least four spades; a similar poll taken in 2000&lt;ref name="BWS2001 poll results"&gt;[http://www.bridgeworld.com/default.asp?d=bw_standard&amp;f=bwspolls.html BWS2001 poll results]&lt;/ref&gt; showed 80% in concurrence.
*After 1m – (1{{Hearts}}), a popular agreement is that a negative double shows exactly four spades. Responder would bid 1{{Spades}} with five or more. However, in 2000, this approach was favored by fewer than two thirds of polled experts.&lt;ref name="BWS2001 poll results"/&gt;
*After 1m – (1{{Spades}}), in contrast to the prior sequence, most experts prefer the negative double here to show at ''least'' four hearts – not ''exactly'' four hearts.
*After 1M – (2m), most play that a negative double shows at least four cards in the other major.
*After 1{{Diams}} – (2{{Clubs}}), few play that double shows at least four cards in ''each'' major, but most play that doubler shows at least one major at least four cards long.
*After 1{{Hearts}} - (1{{Spades}}) or 1{{Spades}} - (2{{Hearts}}), the negative double shows at least 4 cards in each minor because there are no unbid major suits.

'''Negative energy''' is a concept used in [[physics]] to explain the nature of certain [[field (physics)|fields]], including the [[gravitational field]] and various [[quantum field]] effects.

In more speculative theories, negative energy is involved in [[wormhole]]s which may allow for [[time travel]] and [[warp drive]]s for faster-than-light space travel.

==Gravitational energy==
{{Main|Gravitational energy}}
The strength of the gravitational attraction between two objects represents the amount of [[gravitational energy]] in the field which attracts them towards each other. When they are infinitely far apart, the gravitational attraction and hence energy approach zero. As two such massive objects move towards each other, the motion accelerates under [[gravity]] causing an increase in the positive kinetic energy of the system. At the same time, the gravitational attraction - and hence energy - also increase in magnitude, but the [[law of energy conservation]] requires that the net energy of the system not change. This issue can only be resolved if the change in gravitational energy is negative, thus cancelling out the positive change in kinetic energy. Since the gravitational energy is getting stronger, this decrease can only mean that it is negative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]]'' The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins'' (1997), Random House, {{ISBN|0-224-04448-6}} Appendix A: ''Gravitational Energy'' demonstrates the negativity of gravitational energy.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[universe]] in which positive energy dominates will eventually collapse in a "[[big crunch]]", while an "open" universe in which negative energy dominates will either expand indefinitely or eventually disintegrate in a "[[big rip]]". In the [[zero-energy universe]] model ("flat" or "Euclidean"), the total amount of energy in the universe is exactly [[zero]]: its amount of positive energy in the form of [[matter]] is exactly cancelled out by its negative energy in the form of [[gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; ''The Grand Design'', 2010, Page 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum field effects==
Negative energies and negative energy density are consistent with [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everett |first=Allen |author2=Roman, Thomas |title=Time Travel and Warp Drives |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2012 |page=167 |isbn=0-226-22498-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual particles===
{{Main|Virtual particles}}
In quantum theory, the [[uncertainty principle]] allows the vacuum of space to be filled with [[virtual particles|virtual]] particle-antiparticle pairs which appear spontaneously and exist for only a short time before, typically, annihilating themselves again. Some of these virtual particles can have negative energy. Their behaviour plays a role in several important phenomena, as described below.

===Casimir effect===
{{Main|Casimir effect}}
In the Casimir effect, two flat plates placed very close together restrict the wavelengths of quanta which can exist between them. This in turn restricts the types and hence number and density of [[virtual particle]] pairs which can form in the intervening vacuum and can result in a negative energy density. This causes an attractive force between the plates, which has been measured.&lt;ref name="fordroman"&gt;Ford and Roman 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hawking radiation===
{{Main|Hawking radiation}}
[[Virtual particles]] with negative energy can exist for a short period. This phenomenon is a part of the mechanism involved in [[Hawking radiation]] by which [[black hole]]s evaporate.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; ''A Brief History of Time'', Bantam 1988, Pages 105-107. {{ISBN|0-593-01518-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Squeezed light===
{{Main|Squeezed light}}
It is possible to arrange multiple beams of laser light such that destructive [[quantum interference]] suppresses the [[vacuum fluctuations]]. Such a squeezed vacuum state involves negative energy. The repetitive waveform of light leads to alternating regions of positive and negative energy.&lt;ref name="fordroman" /&gt;

===Dirac sea===
{{Main|Dirac sea}}
According to the theory of the [[Dirac sea]], developed by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1930, the [[vacuum]] of space is full of negative energy. This theory was developed to explain the anomaly of negative-energy [[quantum states]] predicted by the [[Dirac equation]].

The Dirac sea theory correctly predicted the existence of [[antimatter]] two years prior to the discovery of the [[positron]] in 1932 by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]]. However, the Dirac sea theory treats antimatter as a hole where there is the absence of a particle rather than as a real particle. [[Quantum field theory]] (QFT), developed in the 1930s, deals with antimatter in a way that treats antimatter as made of real particles rather than the absence of particles, and treats a vacuum as being empty of particles rather than full of negative-energy particles like in the Dirac sea theory.

Quantum field theory has displaced the Dirac sea theory as a more popular explanation of these aspects of physics. Both the Dirac sea theory and quantum field theory are equivalent by means of a [[Bogoliubov transformation]], so the Dirac sea can be viewed as an alternative formulation of quantum field theory, and is thus consistent with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=López de Recalde|first=Andrea|date=2017|title=The Standard Electro-Weak Theory, 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.at/books?id=mNevDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=dirac+sea+equivalent+transformation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dirac%20sea%20equivalent%20transformation&amp;f=false|location=Morrisville, North Carolina|publisher=LuLu Press, Inc.|page=65|isbn=978-1-365-65887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculative suggestions==
===Wormholes===
{{Main|Wormhole}}
Negative energy appears in the speculative theory of [[wormhole]]s, where it is needed to keep the wormhole open. A wormhole directly connects two locations which may be separated arbitrarily far apart in both space and time, and in principle allows near-instantaneous travel between them.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; "[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1269288/STEPHEN-HAWKING-How-build-time-machine.html How to build a time machine]", ''Mail Online'' 27 April 2010(retrieved 4 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warp drive===
{{Main|Warp drive}}
A theoretical principle for a [[faster-than-light]] (FTL) warp drive for spaceships has been suggested, involving negative energy. The [[Alcubierre drive]] comprises a solution to Einstein's equations of [[general relativity]], in which a bubble of spacetime is moved rapidly by expanding space behind it and shrinking space in front of it.&lt;ref name="fordroman" /&gt;

'''Negative equity''' occurs when the value of an asset used to secure a loan is less than the outstanding balance on the loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13145239 America's foreclosure plan: Can’t pay or won’t pay?], Paragraph 5, ''[[The Economist]]'' (February 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, assets (particularly [[real estate]], whose loans are [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]]) with negative equity are often referred to as being "'''underwater'''", and loans and borrowers with negative equity are said to be "'''upside down'''". 

People and companies alike may have negative equity, as reflected on their [[balance sheet]]s.

== In an asset ==

In the owner-occupied [[real estate economics|housing market]], a fall in the [[market value]] of a [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] house or apartment/flat is the usual cause of negative equity. It may occur when the property owner obtains second-mortgage home-equity loans, causing the combined loans to exceed the home value, or simply because the original mortgage was too generous. If the borrower defaults, [[repossession]] and sale of the property by the lender will not raise enough cash to repay the amount outstanding, and the borrower will still be in [[debt]] as well as having lost the property. Some US states like [[California]] require lenders to choose between going after the borrower or taking repossession, but not both.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The term negative equity was widely used in the [[United Kingdom]] during the economic recession between 1991 and 1996, and in [[Hong Kong]] between 1998 and 2003. These recessions led to increased unemployment and a decline in property prices, which in turn led to an increase in [[repossession]]s by banks and [[Building society|building societies]] of properties worth less than the outstanding debt.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

It is also common for negative equity to occur when the value of a property drops shortly after its purchase. This occurs frequently in automobile loans, where the market value of a car might drop by 20-30% as soon as the car is driven off the lot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

While typically a result of fluctuating asset prices, negative equity can occur when the value of the asset stays fixed and the loan balance increases because loan payments are less than the interest, a situation known as [[negative amortization]]. The typical assets securing such loans are [[real property]] – commercial, office or residential. When the loan is [[Nonrecourse debt|nonrecourse]], the lender can only look to the security, that is, the value of the property, when the borrower fails to repay the loan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Since 2007, those most exposed to negative equity are borrowers who obtained loans of a high percentage of the property value (such as 90% or even 100%). These were commonly available before the [[credit crunch]]. Such cases are of course the most at risk from falls in property value.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Negative net worth ==
A person who has negative equity can be said to have "negative net worth", where the person's liabilities exceed their assets. One might come to have negative equity as a result of taking out a substantial, unsecured loan. For example, one might use a [[student loan]] to pursue higher education. Although education increases the likelihood of higher future earnings, potential alone is not a financial asset. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In the United States, [[student loans]] are rarely dischargeable in [[bankruptcy]], and typically lenders provide student loans without requiring security. This stands in contrast to lenders requiring borrowers to have an equity stake in a comparably-sized real estate loan, as described above, secured by both a down payment and a mortgage. An explanation for the willingness of creditors to provide unsecured student loans is that, in a practical sense, American student loans are secured by the borrower's future earnings. This is so since creditors may legally garnish wages when a borrower defaults.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Effects ==

A home owner who is under water might be financially incapable of selling their current house and buying another one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zillow's Humphries on U.S. Housing Market Outlook|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/zillow-s-humphries-on-u-s-housing-market-outlook-4Pd_Q7stQ7WpSRarylLKdQ.html|work=bloomberg.com|publisher=BLOOMBERG L.P.|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31935">In [[theoretical physics]], '''negative mass''' is matter whose [[mass]] is of opposite sign to the mass of normal matter, e.g. −1&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/negative-mass-object-washington-state-physics-isaac-newton-upside-down-a7693701.html "Scientists observe liquid with 'negative mass', which turns physics completely upside down"], ''The Independent'', April 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fluid-negative-mass-1.4073937 "Scientists create fluid that seems to defy physics:'Negative mass' reacts opposite to any known physical property we know"], ''CBC'', April 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Such matter would violate one or more [[energy condition]]s and show some strange properties, stemming from the ambiguity as to whether attraction should refer to force or the oppositely oriented acceleration for negative mass. It is used in certain speculative [[hypothesis]], such as on the construction of traversable [[wormhole]]s and the [[Alcubierre drive]]. Initially, the closest known real representative of such exotic matter is a region of [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] density produced by the [[Casimir effect]].

[[General relativity]] describes [[gravity]] and the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] for both positive and [[negative energy]] particles, hence negative mass, but does not include the other [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]]. On the other hand, the [[Standard Model]] describes [[elementary particle]]s and the other fundamental forces, but it does not include gravity. A unified theory that explicitly includes gravity along with the other fundamental forces may be needed for a better understanding of the concept of negative mass.

==In general relativity==
Negative mass is any region of space in which for some observers the mass density is measured to be negative. This could occur due to a region of space in which the stress component of the Einstein [[stress–energy tensor]] is larger in magnitude than the mass density. All of these are violations of one or another variant of the positive [[energy condition]] of Einstein's general theory of relativity; however, the positive energy condition is not a required condition for the mathematical consistency of the theory.

===Inertial versus gravitational mass===

Ever since [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] first formulated his theory of [[gravity]], there have been at least three conceptually distinct quantities called [[mass]]:
*[[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] &amp;ndash; the mass ''m'' that appears in Newton's second law of motion, '''F'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;thinsp;'''a'''
*“active” [[gravitational mass]] &amp;ndash; the mass that produces a gravitational field that other masses respond to 
*“passive” gravitational mass &amp;ndash; the mass that responds to an external gravitational field by accelerating.

Einstein’s [[equivalence principle]] postulates that inertial mass must equal passive gravitational mass. The law of [[Momentum|conservation of momentum]] requires that active and passive gravitational mass be identical. All experimental evidence to date has found these are, indeed, always the same. In considering negative mass, it is important to consider which of these concepts of mass are negative. In most analyses of negative mass, it is assumed that the equivalence principle and conservation of momentum continue to apply, and therefore all three forms of mass are still the same.

In his 4th-prize essay for the 1951 [[Gravity Research Foundation]] competition, [[Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger]] considered the possibility of negative mass and how it would behave under gravitational and other forces.&lt;ref name="Luttinger 1951"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luttinger |first=J. M. |year=1951 |title=On "Negative" mass in the theory of gravitation |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5852e579be659442a01f27b8/t/5873dc04d1758eea4b41c720/1483987972731/luttinger.pdf |journal=Awards for Essays on Gravitation |publisher=Gravity Research Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, following Luttinger's idea, [[Hermann Bondi]] suggested in a paper in ''[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]'' that mass might be negative as well as positive.&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.29.423 |title=Negative Mass in General Relativity |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=423 |year=1957 |last1=Bondi |first1=H. |bibcode=1957RvMP...29..423B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that this does not entail a logical contradiction, as long as all three forms of mass are negative, but that the assumption of negative mass involves some counter-intuitive form of motion. For example, an object with negative inertial mass would be expected to accelerate in the opposite direction to that in which it was pushed (non-gravitationally).

There have been several other analyses of negative mass, such as the studies conducted by R. M. Price,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=R. M.|title=Negative mass can be positively amusing|journal=Am. J. Phys.|date=1993|volume=61|issue=3|page=216|doi=10.1119/1.17293 |url=http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ccline/courses/resources/wp/pdf/AJP000216.pdf|bibcode = 1993AmJPh..61..216P }}&lt;/ref&gt; however none addressed the question of what kind of energy and momentum would be necessary to describe non-singular negative mass. Indeed, the Schwarzschild solution for negative mass parameter has a naked singularity at a fixed spatial position. The question that immediately comes up is, would it not be possible to smooth out the singularity with some kind of negative mass density. The answer is yes, but not with energy and momentum that satisfies the [[Energy condition#Dominant energy condition|dominant energy condition]]. This is because if the energy and momentum satisfies the dominant energy condition within a spacetime that is asymptotically flat, which would be the case of smoothing out the singular negative mass Schwarzschild solution, then it must satisfy the positive energy theorem, i.e. its [[ADM formalism|ADM mass]] must be positive, which is of course not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shoen|first1=R.|last2=Yao|first2=S.-T.|title=On the proof of the positive mass conjecture in general relativity|journal=Commun.

===Runaway motion===
Although no particles are known to have negative mass, physicists (primarily [[Hermann Bondi]] in 1957,&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt; [[William B. Bonnor]] in 1989,&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00763458| title = Negative mass in general relativity| journal = General Relativity and Gravitation| volume = 21| issue = 11| pages = 1143| year = 1989| last1 = Bonnor | first1 = W. B.|bibcode = 1989GReGr..21.1143B }}&lt;/ref&gt; then [[Robert L. Forward]]&lt;ref name="Forward 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2514/3.23219| title = Negative matter propulsion| journal = Journal of Propulsion and Power| volume = 6| pages = 28| year = 1990| last1 = Forward | first1 = R. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have been able to describe some of the anticipated properties such particles may have. Assuming that all three concepts of mass are equivalent the gravitational interactions between masses of arbitrary sign can be explored, based on the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[equivalence principle]]:

* Positive mass attracts both other positive masses and negative masses.
* Negative mass repels  both other negative masses and positive masses.

For two positive masses, nothing changes and there is a gravitational pull on each other causing an attraction. Two negative masses would repel because of their negative inertial masses. For different signs however, there is a push that repels the positive mass from the negative mass, and a pull that attracts the negative mass towards the positive one at the same time.

Hence Bondi pointed out that two objects of equal and opposite mass would produce a constant acceleration of the system towards the positive-mass object,&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt; an effect called "runaway motion" by Bonnor who disregarded its physical existence, stating: 
{{Centered pull quote
 |I regard the runaway (or self-accelerating) motion […] so preposterous that I prefer to rule it out by supposing that inertial mass is all positive or all negative.
|author= William B. Bonnor
|source=in ''Negative mass in general relativity''.&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989" /&gt;}}

Such a couple of objects would accelerate without limit (except relativistic one); however, the total mass, momentum and energy of the system would remain 0.

This behavior is completely inconsistent with a common-sense approach and the expected behaviour of 'normal' matter; but is completely mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of conservation of momentum or [[conservation of energy|energy]]. If the masses are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, then the momentum of the system remains zero if they both travel together and accelerate together, no matter what their speed:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{sys} = mv + (-m)v = \big(m+(-m)\big)v = 0\times v = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

And equivalently for the [[kinetic energy]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{k,sys} = \tfrac12 mv^2 + \tfrac12(-m)v^2 = \tfrac12\big(m+(-m)\big)v^2 = \tfrac12(0)v^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

However, this is perhaps not exactly valid if the energy in the gravitational field is taken into account.

Forward extended Bondi's analysis to additional cases, and showed that even if the two masses {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;(−)&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;(+)&lt;/sup&gt;}} are not the same, the conservation laws remain unbroken. This is true even when relativistic effects are considered, so long as inertial mass, not rest mass, is equal to gravitational mass.

This behaviour can produce bizarre results: for instance, a gas containing a mixture of positive and negative matter particles will have the positive matter portion increase in [[temperature]] without bound. However, the negative matter portion gains negative temperature at the same rate, again balancing out. [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] pointed out other implications of Forward's analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=G.|last= Landis|title=Comments on Negative Mass Propulsion|journal=J. Propulsion and Power|volume= 7|issue= 2|pages= 304 |year=1991|doi=10.2514/3.23327}}&lt;/ref&gt; including noting that although negative mass particles would repel each other gravitationally, the [[electrostatic force]] would be attractive for like [[charge (physics)|charges]] and repulsive for opposite charges.

Forward used the properties of negative-mass matter to create the concept of diametric drive, a design for [[spacecraft propulsion]] using negative mass that requires no energy input and no [[Working mass|reaction mass]] to achieve arbitrarily high acceleration.

Forward also coined a term, "nullification", to describe what happens when ordinary matter and negative matter meet: they are expected to be able to cancel out or nullify each other's existence. An interaction between equal quantities of positive mass matter (hence of positive energy {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and negative mass matter (of negative energy {{math|−''E'' {{=}} −''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) would release no energy, but because the only configuration of such particles that has zero momentum (both particles moving with the same velocity in the same direction) does not produce a collision, all such interactions would leave a surplus of momentum, which is classically forbidden. So once this runaway phenomenon has been revealed, the [[scientific community]] considered negative mass could not exist in the universe.

===Arrow of time and energy inversion===
In 1970, [[Jean-Marie Souriau]] demonstrated, through the complete [[Poincaré group]] of dynamic [[group theory]], that reversing the energy of a particle (hence its mass, if the particle has one) is equal to reversing its [[arrow of time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Souriau |first=J.-M. |date=1970 |title=Structure des Systèmes Dynamiques |trans-title=Structure of Dynamic Systems |url=http://www.jmsouriau.com/structure_des_systemes_dynamiques.htm |location=Paris |publisher=Dunod |page=199 |language=French |issn=0750-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Souriau |first=J.-M. |title=Structure of Dynamical Systems |chapter=A mechanistic description of elementary particles: Inversions of space and time |location=Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-4612-6692-1 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0281-3_14 |url=http://ayuba.fr/souriau/Souriau-time-energy-mass-inversion.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe according to [[general relativity]] is a [[Riemannian manifold]] associated to a [[metric tensor]] solution of Einstein’s field equations. In such a framework, the runaway motion prevents the existence of negative matter.&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989" /&gt;

Some [[bimetric theory|bimetric theories]] of the universe propose that two [[multiverse|parallel universes]] instead of one may exist with an opposite arrow of time, linked together by the [[Big Bang]] and interacting only through [[gravitation]].&lt;ref name="Sakharov 1980"&gt;A.D.

According to group theory, the matter of the [[Topological conjugacy|conjugated]] metric would appear to the matter of the other metric as having opposite mass and arrow of time (though its [[proper time]] would remain positive). The coupled metrics have their own [[geodesic]]s and are solutions of two coupled field equations:&lt;ref name="Petit 2014a"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10509-014-2106-5 |title=Negative mass hypothesis in cosmology and the nature of dark energy |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=354 |issue=2 |pages=611 |year=2014 |last1=Petit |first1=J.

The [[Post-Newtonian expansion|Newtonian approximation]] then provides the following interaction laws:
* Positive mass attracts positive mass.
* Negative mass attracts negative mass.
* Positive mass and negative mass repel each other.
Those laws are different to the laws described by Bondi and Bonnor, and solve the runaway paradox. The negative matter of the coupled metric, interacting with the matter of the other metric via gravity, could be an alternative candidate for the explanation of [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]] and [[accelerating universe]].&lt;ref name="Petit 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petit 2014b" /&gt;

===In Gauss's law of gravity===
In [[electromagnetism]] one can derive the energy density of a field from [[Gauss's law]], assuming the curl of the field is 0. Performing the same calculation using [[Gauss's law for gravity]] produces a negative energy density for a gravitational field.

===Gravitational interaction of antimatter===
{{Main|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}
The overwhelming consensus among physicists is that [[antimatter]] has positive mass and should be affected by gravity just like normal matter. Direct experiments on neutral [[antihydrogen]] have not been sensitive enough to detect any difference between the gravitational interaction of antimatter, compared to normal matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms2787 |pmid=23653197 |pmc=3644108 |title=Description and first application of a new technique to measure the gravitational mass of antihydrogen |journal=Nature Communications |volume=4 |pages=1785 |year=2013 |last1=Amole |first1=C. |last2=Ashkezari |first2=M.

[[Bubble chamber]] experiments provide further evidence that antiparticles have the same inertial mass as their normal counterparts. In these experiments, the chamber is subjected to a constant magnetic field that causes charged particles to travel in [[Helix|helical]] paths, the radius and direction of which correspond to the ratio of electric charge to inertial mass. Particle–antiparticle pairs are seen to travel in helices with opposite directions but identical radii, implying that the ratios differ only in sign; but this does not indicate whether it is the charge or the inertial mass that is inverted. However, particle–antiparticle pairs are observed to electrically attract one another. This behavior implies that both have positive inertial mass and opposite charges; if the reverse were true, then the particle with positive inertial mass would be repelled from its antiparticle partner.

==Experimentation==
Physicist Peter Engels and a team of colleagues at [[Washington State University]] claimed to have observed negative mass behavior in rubidium atoms. On 10 April 2017 Engels team created negative "effective" mass by reducing the temperature of rubidium atoms to near [[absolute zero]], generating a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. By using a laser-trap, the team were able to reverse the spin of some of the rubidium atoms in this state, and observed that once released from the trap, the atoms expanded and displayed properties of negative mass, in particular accelerating towards a pushing force instead of away from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39642992|title=Physicists observe 'negative mass'|date=2017-04-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.155301 |pmid=28452531 |title=Negative-Mass Hydrodynamics in a Spin-Orbit–coupled Bose–Einstein Condensate |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=118 |issue=15 |pages=155301 |year=2017 |last1=Khamehchi |first1=M. A. |last2=Hossain |first2=Khalid |last3=Mossman |first3=M. E. |last4=Zhang |first4=Yongping |last5=Busch |first5=Th. |last6=Forbes |first6=Michael Mcneil |last7=Engels |first7=P. |bibcode=2017PhRvL.118o5301K |arxiv=1612.04055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This kind of negative effective mass is analogous to the well-known apparent negative effective mass of electrons in the upper part of the dispersion bands in solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft|first1=N. W.|last2=Mermin|first2=N. D.|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Saunders College|location=Philadelphia|pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither case is negative mass for the purposes of the [[stress–energy tensor]].

Some recent work with [[metamaterial]]s suggests that some as-yet-undiscovered composite of superconductors, metamaterials and normal matter could exhibit signs of negative effective mass in much the same way as low temperature alloys melt at below the melting point of their components or some semiconductors have negative differential resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2014.10.036 |title=Novel negative mass density resonant metamaterial unit cell |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=379 |pages=33 |year=2015 |last1=Cselyuszka |first1=Norbert |last2=Sečujski |first2=Milan |last3=Crnojević-Bengin |first3=Vesna |bibcode=2015PhLA..379...33C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In quantum mechanics==
In 1928, [[Paul Dirac]]'s theory of [[elementary particle]]s, now part of the [[Standard Model]], already included negative solutions.&lt;ref name="Dirac 1928"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspa.1928.0023 |title=The Quantum Theory of the Electron |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences |volume=117 |issue=778 |pages=610 |year=1928 |last1=Dirac |first1=P. A. M. |bibcode=1928RSPSA.117..610D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Standard Model]] is a generalization of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) and negative mass is already built into the theory.

[[Mike Morris (physicist)|Morris]], [[Kip Thorne|Thorne]] and Yurtsever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446 |pmid=10038800 |title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=61 |issue=13 |pages=1446–1449 |year=1988 |last1=Morris |first1=Michael S. |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip S. |last3=Yurtsever |first3=Ulvi |bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M }}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the quantum mechanics of the [[Casimir effect]] can be used to produce a locally mass-negative region of space–time. In this article, and subsequent work by others, they showed that negative matter could be used to stabilize a [[wormhole]]. Cramer ''et al.'' argue that such wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by negative-mass loops of [[cosmic string]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/9409051 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.51.3117 |title=Natural wormholes as gravitational lenses |journal=Physical Review D |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=3117 |year=1995 |last1=Cramer |first1=John G. |last2=Forward |first2=Robert L. |last3=Morris |first3=Michael S. |last4=Visser |first4=Matt |last5=Benford |first5=Gregory |last6=Landis |first6=Geoffrey A. |bibcode=1995PhRvD..51.3117C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] has proved that [[negative energy]] is a necessary condition for the creation of a [[closed timelike curve]] by manipulation of gravitational fields within a finite region of space;&lt;ref name="futureofspacetime"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hawking | first = Stephen | title = The Future of Spacetime | publisher = W. W. Norton |year= 2002 | pages = 96 | isbn = 0-393-02022-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; this proves, for example, that a finite [[Tipler cylinder]] cannot be used as a [[Time travel|time machine]].

===Schrödinger equation===
For energy eigenstates of the [[Schrödinger equation]], the wavefunction is wavelike wherever the particle's energy is greater than the local potential, and exponential-like (evanescent) wherever it is less. Naively, this would imply kinetic energy is negative in evanescent regions (to cancel the local potential). However, kinetic energy is an operator in [[quantum mechanics]], and its expectation value is always positive, summing with the expectation value of the potential energy to yield the energy eigenvalue.

For wavefunctions of particles with zero rest mass (such as [[photon]]s), this means that any evanescent portions of the wavefunction would be associated with a local negative mass–energy. However, the Schrödinger equation does not apply to massless particles; instead the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] is required.

One can achieve a negative mass independent of [[negative energy]]. According to [[mass–energy equivalence]], mass {{mvar|m}} is in proportion to energy {{mvar|E}} and the coefficient of proportionality is {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Actually, {{mvar|m}} is still equivalent to {{mvar|E}} although the coefficient is another constant &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Wang, Z.Y, Wang P.Y, Xu Y.R.| date=2011 | title=Crucial experiment to resolve Abraham–Minkowski Controversy | journal=Optik | volume=122 | pages=1994–1996 | doi=10.1016/j.ijleo.2010.12.018 | issue= 22| bibcode=2011Optik.122.1994W | arxiv=1103.3559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as {{math|−''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, Z.Y.|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503–508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, it is unnecessary to introduce a [[negative energy]] because the mass can be negative although the energy is positive. That is to say,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E&amp;=-mc^2&gt;0 \\
m&amp;= -\frac{E}{c^2}&lt;0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Under the circumstances,

:&lt;math&gt;dE=F\,ds=\frac{dp}{dt}\,ds=\frac{ds}{dt}\,dp=v\,dp=v\,d(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

and so,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
-c^2\,dm&amp;=v\,d(mv) \\
-c^2(2m)\,dm&amp;=2mv\,d(mv) \\
-c^2\,d(m^2)&amp;=d(m^2v^2) \\
-m^2c^2&amp;=m^2v^2+C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When {{math|''v'' {{=}} 0}},

:&lt;math&gt;C=-m_0^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
-m^2c^2&amp;=m^2v^2-m_0^2c^2 \\
m&amp;=\frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}} is [[invariant mass]] and [[invariant energy]] equals {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0}}. The squared mass is still positive and the particle can be stable.

From the above relation,

:&lt;math&gt;p=mv= \frac{m_0 v}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

The [[negative momentum]] is applied to explain [[negative refraction]], the [[inverse Doppler effect]] and the [[reverse Cherenkov effect]] observed in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The [[radiation pressure]] in the [[metamaterial]] is also negative&lt;ref name="Veselago1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veselago|first=V.

[[Pressure#Negative pressures|Negative pressure]] exists in [[dark energy]] too. Using these above equations, the [[energy–momentum relation]] should be

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the [[Planck–Einstein relation]] {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''ħω''}} and [[de Broglie]]'s {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''ħk''}}, we obtain the following [[dispersion relation]] 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 =- k^2c^2+ \omega_\mathrm{p}^2\,, \quad \left(E_0=\hbar\omega_\mathrm{p}=-m_0c^2&gt;0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

when the wave consists of a stream of particles whose [[energy–momentum relation]] is &lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt; ([[wave–particle duality]]) and can be excited in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The velocity of such a particle is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;v=c\sqrt{\frac{E_0^2}{E^2}-1}=c\sqrt{\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

and range is from zero to infinity

\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}&amp;&lt;2\,, \quad\mbox{when }v&lt;c \\
\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}&amp;&gt;2\,, \quad\mbox{when }v&gt;c
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the [[kinetic energy]] is also negative

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_\mathrm{k} &amp;= E-E_0 \\
&amp;=-mc^2-\left(-m_0 c^2\right) \\
&amp;=-\frac{m_0c^2}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} + m_0 c^2 \\

'''Negative priming''' is an [[implicit memory]] effect in which prior exposure to a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] unfavorably influences the response to the same stimulus. It falls under the category of [[priming (psychology)|priming]], which  refers to the change in the response towards a stimulus due to a [[subconscious]] memory effect. Negative priming describes the slow and error-prone reaction to a stimulus that is previously ignored.&lt;ref name="rev" &gt;Mayr, S. &amp; A. Buchner (2007) Negative priming as a memory phenomenon—A review of 20 years of negative priming research. Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 215, 35–51.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a subject may be imagined trying to pick a red pen from a pen holder. The red pen becomes the target of attention, so the subject responds by moving their hand towards it. At this time, they mentally block out all other pens as distractors to aid in closing in on just the red pen. After repeatedly picking the red pen over the others, switching to the blue pen results in a momentary delay picking the pen out (however, there is a decline in the negative priming effect when there is more than one nontarget item that is selected against&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, E. &amp; DeSchepper, B.G. (1992). An inhibition-based fan effect: Evidence for an active suppression mechanism in selective attention. Canadian Journal of Psychology, 46 (1), 1-40.&lt;/ref&gt;). The slow reaction due to the change of the distractor stimulus to target stimulus is called the negative priming effect.

Negative priming is believed to play a crucial role in [[attention]] and [[Recall (memory)|memory retrieval]] processes. When stimuli are perceived through the [[senses]], all the stimuli are encoded within the brain, where each stimulus has its own [[direct and indirect realism|internal representation]]. In this perceiving process, some of the stimuli receive more attention than others. Similarly, only some of them are stored in [[short-term memory]]. Negative priming is highly related to the selective nature of attention and memory.

Broadly, negative priming is also known as the mechanism by which inhibitory control is applied to [[cognition]]. This refers only to the inhibition stimuli that can interfere with the current short-term goal of creating a response.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Dempster, Frank N. (Ed); Brainerd, Charles J. (Ed), (1995). Interference and inhibition in cognition. San Diego, CA, US: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of inhibiting the interferences depends on the [[cognitive control]] mechanism as a higher number of distractors yields higher load on [[working memory]]. Increased load on working memory can in turn result in slower perceptual processing leading to delayed reaction. Therefore, negative priming effect depends on the amount of distractors, effectiveness of the cognitive control mechanism and the availability of the cognitive control resources.&lt;ref&gt;de Fockert, J. W., Mizon, G. A., &amp; D'Ubaldo, M. (2010). No Negative Priming Without Cognitive Control. Journal of Experimental Psychology–Human Perception and Performance, 36(6), 1333–1341.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories and classic models==
There are a number of theories and models that try to explain the reason behind negative priming. They all try to reason negative priming's role in [[cognition]] and justify why it occurs. A few of the well-known models are presented below.

===Distractor inhibition model===
[[File:Distractor inhibition model.jpg|thumb|'''Distractor inhibition model''' with selective attention and encoding process.]]
'''Distractor inhibition model''' is the oldest model that explains the negative priming effect as the result of selective attention to a target [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]]. When we pay attention to a particular stimulus, we perceive other stimuli surrounding the target as distractors in order to help focus. But when one of those distractors becomes the new target of attention, our response to the target is hampered due to immediate [[memory inhibition|residual inhibition]].&lt;ref name="does"&gt;Tipper, S.P. (2001). Does negative priming reflect inhibitory mechanisms? A review and integration of conflicting views. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Experimental Psychology, 54A, 321–343.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tipper, S.P. (1985). The negative priming effect: Inhibitory priming by ignored objects. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Experimental Psychology, 37A, 571–590.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attention#Selective Attention|Selective attention]] is the ability to respond to a specific object when there are other distractors that also compete for a response. To explain this selective attention, the distractor inhibition model proposes a dual mechanism involving [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitation]] to boost target signal and inhibition to suppress distractors. This inhibition is triggered when there is a mismatch between the [[direct and indirect realism|internal representations]] of the target and a distractor. Inhibition of the distractor's internal representation is a way of helping to selectively attend to the target stimulus. This inhibition decays gradually when the stimulus is no longer present to help with the next target. However, if a distractor stimulus is re-encountered as the target, the internal representation of the distractor stimulus may continue to be suppressed because it is too soon for the decay to dissipate already. This is referred to as the transient [[memory inhibition|residual inhibition]]. This inhibition also impairs the processing of an appropriate response to the new target stimulus and results in greater [[reaction time]].&lt;ref name= "does"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "HTM"&gt;Houghton, G., &amp; Tipper, S. P. (1994). A model of inhibitory mechanisms in selective attention. In D. Dagenbach &amp; T. H. Carr (Eds.), Inhibitory processes in attention memory and language (pp. 53–112). San Diego, CA, US: Academic Press, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few problems associated with this inhibition model. This model accounts for negative priming only when the stimuli are repetitively ignored as distractors during a goal directed behavior of selecting the target stimulus. This model does not support negative priming effects found in cases short of goal directed behavior. Another issue is that negative priming effects have been found to be long-term contradicting to the proposed transient residual inhibition.&lt;ref name= "long"&gt;Grison, S., Tipper, S. P., &amp; Hewitt, O. (2005). Long-term negative priming: Support for retrieval of prior attentional processes. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology Section a-Human Experimental Psychology, 58(7), 1199–1224.&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term persistence of negative priming questions the validity of the distractor inhibition model.

===Episodic retrieval model===
[[File:Episode retrieval model.jpg|thumb|'''Episode retrieval model''' with the retrieval of "do-not-respond" tag.]]
The '''episodic retrieval model''' is the current popular model and explains that negative priming occurs due to memory [[Recall (memory)|retrieval]]. This model theorizes that each encounter with a stimulus is encoded and stored separately as an individual episode. Each episode includes perceptual details of both the stimuli and the response developed for that stimulus. When a stimulus is encountered the second time, the previous episode regarding that stimulus along with its tags of perceptual details, role in selective attention, and response given are all retrieved automatically. When the repetitively ignored distractor stimulus is encountered as the target, a tag associated with the response to the stimulus is also retrieved. This response tag of a distractor will likely be "do-not-respond" tag as opposed to the "respond" tag of the target stimulus. [[Recall (memory)|Retrieval]] of the previous "do-not respond" tag of the stimulus conflicts with the current "respond" tag. This presents a problem of whether to respond or not. Resolving this conflict takes time and produces negative priming effect.&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="N1992"&gt;Neill, W.T., Valdes, L.A., Terry, K.M., &amp; Gorfein, D.S. (1992). Persistence of negative priming: II. Evidence for episodic trace retrieval. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 18, 993–1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Episode retrieval model has gained more popularity over the last decade compared to the distractor inhibition model due to the issues with long-term negative priming. Episode retrieval varies from the distractor inhibition model because it claims that the negative priming occurs only when the memory of the stimuli is retrieved and not during the [[encoding (memory)|encoding]] of the distractor stimuli. Recent findings lean towards this model but the model itself is not entirely complete. Its idea of association tags like the "do-not-respond" tag is vague and needs concrete evidence to support this model.

===Houghton–Tipper model===
[[File:Houghton-Tipper.jpg|thumb|'''Houghton–Tipper model''' with inhibition occurring during encoding and retrieval.]]
Due to the issues found with the distractor inhibition model, Tipper and Houghton modified the distractor inhibition model to account for long-term negative priming effects. The original inhibition account proposed that inhibition occurs only when the distractors are suppressed. The '''Houghton–Tipper model''' revised this proposition and claims that inhibition occurs during both the [[encoding (memory)|encoding]] of distractors and the retrieval of that memory. The main reason for this change is to explain the long-term negative priming and justify it using the new combined model. When a repeated distractor becomes the target, processing of this stimulus automatically retrieves the memory of the stimulus being inhibited as a distractor. This model suggests that inhibition occurs when ignoring the distractor and during the memory retrieval of the previous ignorance of the stimulus.&lt;ref name="does"/&gt; Therefore, it incorporates the inhibition account in selective attention and the episode retrieval model.

===Feature mismatch hypothesis===
This theory proposes that negative priming effect is the result of [[interference theory|interference]] due to the target being located where the distractor was once located.&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt; When the target stimulus and distractor stimulus are repeatedly placed in the same location, we know their respective location and pay attention more to the location of the target than the target itself. Our response to the target is also faster because we have already identified where to pay attention. This is called [[Simon effect]], which refers our innate tendency to respond faster and more accurately when stimuli occur in the same location. This can be explained by neuroscience in terms of [[neural facilitation]] and short-term [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]]. However, if the positions of the stimuli are not the same as before, it is no longer easy to attend to the target as it once was. The feature mismatch hypothesis states that inhibition occurs when there is a mismatch between the target and its location. 
This theory is explains the effects of location specific negative priming but lacks in its justification of negative priming when location is not involved.&lt;ref name="feature"&gt;Park, J., &amp; Kanwisher, N. (1994). Negative priming for spatial locations: Identity mismatching, not distractor inhibition. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 20, 613–623.&lt;/ref&gt; It deviates from the distractor inhibition model to describe location specific negative priming but has more loop holes than the other models.

===Temporal discrimination model===
'''Temporal discrimination model''' attempts to blend in both the selective attention and memory retrieval aspects of negative priming in a less complex model. It is based on the assumption that negative priming is caused only at the moment of response to a stimulus that was previously considered distractor.&lt;ref name="temp"&gt;Milliken, B., Joordens, S., Merikle, P.M., &amp; Seiffert, A.E. (1998). Selective attention: A reevaluation of the implications of negative priming. Psychological Review, 105, 203–229.&lt;/ref&gt; This model explains negative priming as the delayed response due to confusion in classifying a stimulus as old or new. A new stimulus is immediately classified as new and undergoes [[information processing theory|perceptual processing]]. A repeated old stimulus is familiar and cues the automatic retrieval of the prior episode. A stimulus that has been repetitively ignored prior to becoming the target is neither entirely new nor old. This ambiguity slows down the processing of the stimuli. The temporal discrimination model points to this ambiguity as the cause of slowed categorization of the stimulus leading to negative priming effect. Like feature mismatch hypothesis, this model also claims that negative priming is not due to selective attention of the target or the inhibition of the distractor. This model argues that "negative priming is an emergent consequence of a discrimination process that is inherent to memory retrieval". Temporal discrimination model explains negative priming without reference to inhibition of distractors or the "do not respond" tag and by simple discrimination of "old", "new" and "in between" categories.&lt;ref name="temp"/&gt;

==Characteristics of negative priming in experiments==

===Experimental terminology===
Experiments on negative priming consist of two main components: prime and probe. '''Prime''' trial tries to mimic real life experiences of distractor stimuli in target selection but with more repetition to get quantifiable negative priming data. It comprises the initial presentation and the repetitive trials of the target and the distractor stimuli. It is set up such that a set of distractor stimuli are constantly ignored in the process of target selection. In the previous example provided, prime refers to the repeated perception of the blue pen as the distractor. '''Probe''' trial in an experiment refers to the actual testing for negative priming effects. In this trial, the repeated distractor of the prime trial is presented as the target. The [[reaction time]] of the response for the probe target (prime distractor) is measured to quantify the negative priming effect.

Some experiments may use additional '''[[interference theory|interferences]]''' such as changing the position of the stimuli or presenting completely irrelevant stimuli during either of these trials.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; The magnitude of negative priming effects are found to be higher with these interferences. Interferences are used to investigate how the response to the distractor changes under conditions of a third interfering stimulus.

===Stimulus modality===

[[File:Stroop task1.jpg|thumb|Example of Stroop color–word task with control, prime and probe trials.]]
The primary two stimulus modalities used for negative priming research are visual and auditory stimulus materials. The stimulus presented varied from objects or symbols in visual field to human voices or artificial sounds. Stronger negative priming effects are found for auditory stimulus but the standardized effect sizes between the modalities did not vary.&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt; Evidence for negative priming has also been found across various modes of response including vocal naming, manual key press, and reaching.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; Negative priming was observed for various types of judgment such as identification, categorization, matching, counting and localization. The tasks used to find evidence for negative priming includes Stroop color–word task, lexical decision task, identification, matching, and localization tasks. The Stroop color–word task utilizes the [[Stroop effect]] to observe the distractor suppression and negative priming. Identification tasks present a set of  images, sounds, words, symbols, or letters and require the subject to select the prime target based a particular feature that differentiates the target from the distractor. [[polysemy|Lexical]] decision utilizes [[semantic]] knowledge of the subject and tests the subject ability to remember the multiple meanings and uses of one word. For example, the word "bank" has multiple meanings and can be referred in different contexts such as "bank is a place where money is deposited" or "banks of a river".&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; Matching tasks require subjects to respond "same" or "different" by matching the target letters or shapes with the explicitly specified goal while ignoring the distractor. Localization tasks require some form of movement of subjects to respond to the location of the target stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Tipper, S. P., Meegan, D., &amp; Howard, L. A. (2002). Action-centered negative priming: Evidence for reactive inhibition. Visual Cognition, 9(4–5), 591–614.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of localization task is especially used to test the feature mismatch hypothesis as it provides evidence for negative priming during the mismatch of the location and target stimuli.

===RSI effects===
'''Response–stimulus interval (RSI)''' is another form of data that is used to quantify negative priming. RSI is the time difference between the response to prime target and the onset of probe trial. Negative priming effects are observed for delays of 20 millisecond to 8000 millisecond between the prime trial and the probe trial. Several experiments found that negative priming decays rapidly during this delay between prime and probe trials.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; Many studies have tried to find a rate of this [[decay theory|decay]] but have not been successful.&lt;ref name="N1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inhib"&gt;Tipper, S. P., Weaver, B., Cameron, S., Brehaut, J. C., &amp; Bastedo, J. (1991). Inhibitory mechanisms of attention in identification and localization tasks: Time course and disruption. Journal of Experimental Psychology. Learning Memory And Cognition, 17(4), 681–692.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers of both the distractor inhibition model and episode retrieval model use varying results of the RSI effects to justify the decay as a part of their model. More globally accepted research is needed to determine concrete RSI data and establish short-term and long-term negative priming limits.

==Neuroanatomy and imaging==
Neurological evidence of negative priming effects is being researched to help understand the [[physiological]] aspects and to develop more accurate models. The most common method to find such neurological evidence is by [[neuroimaging]] the brain using [[fMRI]] while subjects go through experiments of tasks that prompt negative priming effects. The two primary bases for neurological evidence are the internal representations of stimuli and memory retrieval. Most significantly activated regions of the brain are the left temporal lobe, inferior parietal lobe, and the prefrontal cortex of the frontal lobe.&lt;ref name= "ni"&gt;Steel, C., Haworth, E. J., Peters, E., Hemsley, D. R., Sharma, T., Gray, J. A., Pickering, A., et al. (2001). Neuroimaging correlates of negative priming. NeuroReport, 12(16), 3619–3624.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for internal representations are found in the left [[anterior]] [[temporal cortex]], which has been associated with abstract [[semantic memory|semantic]] [[knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge representations]].&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, J.L., Rogers, T.T., 2003. The parallel distributed processing approach to semantic cognition. Nature Reviews, Neuroscience, 4, 310–322.&lt;/ref&gt; Left anterolateral temporal cortex was found to be directly related to the magnitude of negative priming effect.&lt;ref&gt;de Zubicaray, G., McMahon, K., Eastburn, M., Pringle, A., Lorenz, L. (2006). Classic identity negative priming involves accessing semantic representations in the left anterior temporal cortex, NeuroImage, 33(1), 383–390.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior and inferior|inferior]] [[parietal lobe]] is connected to the shifts in attention that occurs when attending to the distractors and the target. The inferior parietal cortex activated whenever attention shifted from the distractor to target stimulus or vice versa.&lt;ref name= "ni"/&gt; Another significant area of activation was found in the [[prefrontal cortex]]. The superior, inferior, and medial frontal [[gyri]], and the medial prefrontal cortex exhibited activation during the negative priming tasks.&lt;ref name= "ocd"&gt;. Wright, C.I., Keuthen, N.J., Savage, C.R., Martis, B., Williams, D., Wedig, M., McMullin, K., Rauch, S.L. (2006). Brain correlates of negative and positive visuospatial priming in adults, NeuroImage, 30(3):983–991.&lt;/ref&gt; Activations in the frontal lobe has been associated with inhibitory network and selective attention. Similarly, evidences for semantic representations and temporal lobe activations are used to support the episode retrieval model. Additional investigations of the neurophysiological data of negative priming are necessary to further clarify the relationship between selective attention and memory in negative priming.

==Pathology==
Negative priming is identified as one of the cognitive process necessary for goal directed behaviors. It is associated with many cognitive processes such as inhibition, selective attention, encoding, memory retrieval, and short-term memory. [[neuropsychiatry|Neuropsychiatric disorders]] may be due to problems with some of the above-mentioned areas of cognition. Currently, [[schizophrenia]], [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], and [[Tourette syndrome]] are being studied with reference to negative priming.&lt;ref name= "ocd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egner, T., &amp; Hirsch, J. (2005). Where memory meets attention: neural substrates of negative priming. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 17(11), 1774–1784.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the paradigm of negative priming can lead to the use of negative priming tasks as diagnosing tools to identify the disorders. Knowledge about the physiological basis of negative priming can also help in designing therapies or treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders.

==Conclusion==
Among the four theories, the feature mismatch hypothesis and the temporal discrimination model lack solid evidence and are inadequate. These two models differ slightly from the distractor inhibition model and episode retrieval model respectively and can be incorporated into the latter two. The distractor inhibition model was the dominant model until recent contradicting findings pointed to a retrieval mechanism in negative priming.&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt; The episode retrieval model is gaining more support for the memory based negative priming but lacks in its explanation of the association tags. Perhaps, further research exploring both these models may help to better understand the role of negative priming in attention, memory and cognition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10016">Nearly 78 years have passed since Paul L. Dysart, Jr. invented the Negative Volume Index and Positive Volume Index indicators. The indicators remain useful to identify primary market trends and reversals.

In 1936, Paul L. Dysart, Jr. began accumulating two series of advances and declines distinguished by whether volume was greater or lesser than the prior day's volume. He called the cumulative series for the days when volume had been greater than the prior day's volume the Positive Volume Index (PVI), and the series for the days when volume had been lesser the Negative Volume Index (NVI).

A native of Iowa, Dysart worked in Chicago's LaSalle Street during the 1920s. After giving up his [[Chicago Board of Trade]] membership, he published an advisory letter geared to short-term trading using advance-decline data. In 1933, he launched the ''Trendway'' weekly stock market letter and published it until 1969 when he died. Dysart also developed the 25-day Plurality Index, the 25-day total of the absolute difference between the number of advancing issues and the number of declining issues, and was a pioneer in using several types of volume of trading studies. Richard Russell, editor of Dow Theory Letters, in his January 7, 1976 letter called Dysart "one of the most brilliant of the pioneer market technicians."

==Dysart’s NVI and PVI==
The daily volume of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the NYSE Composite Index's advances and declines drove Dysart's indicators. Dysart believed that “volume is the driving force in the market.” He began studying market breadth numbers in 1931, and was familiar with the work of Leonard P. Ayres and James F. Hughes, who pioneered the tabulation of advances and declines to interpret stock market movements.

Dysart calculated NVI as follows: 1) if today's volume is less than yesterday's volume, subtract declines from advances, 2) add the difference to the cumulative NVI beginning at zero, and 3) retain the current NVI reading for the days when volume is greater than the prior day's volume. He calculated PVI in the same manner but for the days when volume was greater than the prior day's volume. NVI and PVI can be calculated daily or weekly.

Initially, Dysart believed that PVI would be the more useful series, but in 1967, he wrote that NVI had “proved to be the most valuable of all the breadth indexes.” He relied most on NVI, naming it AMOMET, the acronym of “'''A''' '''M'''easure '''O'''f '''M'''ajor '''E'''conomic '''T'''rend.”

Dysart's theory, expressed in his 1967 Barron's article, was that “if volume advances and prices move up or down in accordance [with volume], the move is assumed to be a good movement - if it is sustained when the volume subsides.” In other words, after prices have moved up on positive volume days, "if prices stay up when the volume subsides for a number of days, we can say that such a move is 'good'." If the market “holds its own on negative volume days after advancing on positive volume, the market is in a strong position.”

He called PVI the “majority” curve. Dysart distinguished between the actions of the “majority” and those of the “minority.” The majority tends to emulate the minority, but its timing is not as sharp as that of the minority. When the majority showed an appetite for stocks, the PVI was usually “into new high ground” as happened in 1961.

It is said that the two indicators assume that "smart" money is traded on quiet days (low volume) and that the crowd trades on very active days. Therefore, the negative volume index picks out days when the volume is lower than on the previous day, and the positive index picks out days with a higher volume.

==Dysart’s Interpretation of NVI and PVI==
Besides an article he wrote for Barron's in 1967, not many of Dysart's writings are available. What can be interpreted about Dysart's NVI is that whenever it rises above a prior high, and the DJIA is trending up, a “Bull Market Signal” is given. When the NVI falls below a prior low, and the DJIA is trending down, a “Bear Market Signal” is given. The PVI is interpreted in reverse.
However, not all movements above or below a prior NVI or PVI level generate signals, as Dysart also designated “bullish” and “bearish penetrations.” These penetrations could occur before or after a Bull or Bear Market Signal, and at times were called “reaffirmations” of a signal. In 1969, he articulated one rule: “signals are most authentic when the NVI has moved sideways for a number of months in a relatively narrow range.” Dysart cautioned that “there is no mathematical system devoid of judgment which will continuously work without error in the stock market.”

According to Dysart, between 1946 and 1967, the NVI “rendered 17 significant signals,” of which 14 proved to be right (an average of 4.32% from the final high or low) and 3 wrong (average loss of 6.33%). However, NVI “seriously erred” in 1963-1964 and in 1968, which concerned him. In 1969, Dysart reduced the weight he had previously given to the NVI in his analyses because NVI was no longer a “decisive” indicator of the primary trend, although it retained an “excellent ability to give us ‘leading’ indications of short-term trend reversals.”

A probable reason for the NVI losing its efficacy during the mid-1960s may have been the steadily higher NYSE daily volume due to the dramatic increase in the number of issues traded so that prices rose on declining volume. Dysart’s NVI topped out in 1955 and trended down until at least 1968, although the DJIA moved higher during that period.
Norman G. Fosback has attributed the “long term increase in the number of issues traded” as a reason for a downward bias in a cumulative advance-decline line. Fosback was the next influential technician in the story of NVI and PVI.

==Fosback’s Variations==
Fosback studied NVI and PVI and in 1976 reported his findings in his classic Stock Market Logic. He did not elucidate on the indicators’ background or mentioned Dysart except for saying that “in the past Negative Volume Indexes have always [his emphasis] been constructed using advance-decline data….” He posited, “There is no good reason for this fixation on the A/D Line. In truth, a Negative Volume Index can be calculated with any market index - the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500, or even ‘unweighted’ market measures.... Somehow this point has escaped the attention of technicians to date.”

The point had not been lost on Dysart, who wrote in Barron’s, “we prefer to use the issues-traded data [advances and declines] rather than the price data of any average because it is more all-encompassing, and more truly represents what’s happening in the entire market.” Dysart was a staunch proponent of using advances and declines.

Fosback made three variations to NVI and PVI:

1. He cumulated the daily percent change in the market index rather than the difference between advances and declines. On negative volume days, he calculated the price change in the index from the prior day and added it to the most recent NVI. His calculations are as follows:

If C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; denote the closing prices of today and yesterday, respectively, the NVI for today is calculated by

* adding NVI&lt;sub&gt;yesterday&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) / C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; to yesterday's NVI if today's volume is lower than yesterday's, adding zero otherwise,

and the PVI is calculated by:

* adding PVI&lt;sub&gt;yesterday&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) / C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; to yesterday's PVI if today's volume is higher than yesterday's, adding zero otherwise.

2. He suggested starting the cumulative count at a base index level such as 100.

3. He derived buy or sell signals by whether the NVI or PVI was above or below its one-year moving average.

Fosback's versions of NVI and PVI are what are popularly described in books and posted on Internet financial sites. Often reported are his findings that whenever NVI is above its one-year [[moving average (finance)|moving average]] there is a 96% (PVI - 79%) probability that a bull market is in progress, and when it is below its one-year moving average, there is a 53% (PVI - 67%) probability that a bear market is in place. These results were derived using a 1941-1975 test period. Modern tests might reveal different probabilities.

Today, NVI and PVI are commonly associated with Fosback's versions, and Dysart, their inventor, is forgotten. It cannot be said that one version is better than the other. While Fosback provided a more objective interpretation of these indicators, Dysart's versions offer value to identify primary trends and short-term trend reversals.

Although some traders use Fosback's NVI and PVI to analyze individual stocks, the indicators were created to track, and have been tested, on major market indexes. NVI was Dysart's most invaluable breadth index, and Fosback found that his version of “the Negative Volume Index is an excellent indicator of the primary market trend.” Traders can benefit from both innovations.

In [[experimental physics]], researchers have proposed '''Non-extensive self-consistent thermodynamic theory''' to describe phenomena observed in the [[Large Hadron Collider|Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]].  This theory investigates a [[Fireball concept|fireball]] for [[high-energy particle]] collisions, while using [[Tsallis entropy|Tsallis non-extensive thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=depp1/&gt; Fireballs lead to the bootstrap idea, or [[self-consistency principle]], just as in the [[Boltzmann statistics]] used by [[Rolf Hagedorn]].&lt;ref  name=hage/&gt; Assuming the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] gets variations, due to possible symmetrical change, [[Abdel Nasser Tawfik]] applied the non-extensive concepts of high-energy particle production.&lt;ref name=cley1/&gt;&lt;ref name=cley2/&gt;

The motivation to use the non-extensive statistics from Tsallis&lt;ref&gt;C. Tsallis, J Stat Phys 52, 479-487, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the results obtained by Bediaga et al&lt;ref&gt;I. Bediaga, E.M.F. Curado and J.M. de Miranda, Physica A 286 (2000) 156.&lt;/ref&gt;. They showed that with the substitution of the Boltzmann factor in Hagedorn's theory by the q-exponential function, it was possible to recover good agreement between calculation and experiment, even at energies as high as those achieved at the [[LHC]], with q&gt;1.

==Non-extensive entropy for ideal quantum gas==
The starting point of the theory is [[entropy]] for a non-extensive quantum gas of [[bosons]] and [[fermions]], as proposed by Conroy, Miller and Plastino,&lt;ref name=depp1/&gt; which is given by &lt;math&gt;S_q=S_q^{FD}+S_q^{BE}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_q^{FD}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-extended version of the Fermi–Dirac entropy and &lt;math&gt;S_q^{BE}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-extended version of the Bose–Einstein entropy.

That group&lt;ref  name=hage/&gt; and also Clemens and Worku,&lt;ref name=cley1/&gt; the entropy just defined leads to occupation number formulas that reduce to Bediaga's. C. Beck,&lt;ref name=cley2/&gt; shows the power-like tails present in the distributions found in [[high energy physics]] experiments.

== Non-extensive partition function for ideal quantum gas ==
Using the entropy defined above, the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] results are
:&lt;math&gt; \ln[1+Z_q(V_o,T)]=\frac{V_o}{2\pi^2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\int_0^{\infty}dm \int_0^{\infty}dp \, p^2 \rho(n;m)[1+(q-1)\beta \sqrt{p^2+m^2}]^{-\frac{nq}{(q-1)}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;
Since experiments have shown that &lt;math&gt;q&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, this restriction is adopted.

Another way to write the non-extensive partition function for a fireball is
:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T)=\int_0^{\infty}\sigma(E)[1+(q-1)\beta E]^{-\frac{q}{(q-1)}} dE\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the density of states of the fireballs.

==Self-consistency principle==
Self-consistency implies that both forms of partition functions must be asymptotically equivalent and that the [[mass spectrum]] and the [[density of states]] must be related to each other by
:&lt;math&gt; log[\rho(m)]= log[\sigma(E)] &lt;/math&gt;,
in the limit of &lt;math&gt;m,E&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently large.

The self-consistency can be asymptotically achieved by choosing&lt;ref name=depp1&gt;A. Deppman, Physica A 391 (2012) 6380.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; m^{3/2} \rho(m)=\frac{\gamma}{m}\big[1+(q_o-1) \beta _o m\big]^{\frac{1}{q_o -1}}=\frac{\gamma}{m}[1+(q'_o-1)  m]^{\frac{\beta _o}{q'_o -1}}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)=bE^a\big[1+(q'_o-1)E\big]^{\frac{\beta _o}{q'_o -1}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt;q'_o-1=\beta _o (q_o-1)&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;a,b,\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants. For &lt;math&gt;q' \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; the two expressions above approach the corresponding expressions in Hagedorn's theory.

==Main results==
With the mass spectrum and density of states given above, the asymptotic form of the partition function is
:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T) \rightarrow \bigg(\frac{1}{\beta - \beta _o }\bigg)^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\gamma V_o}{2\pi^2 \beta^{3/2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt; a+1=\alpha=\frac{\gamma V_o}{2\pi^2 \beta^{3/2}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

One immediate consequence of the expression for the partition function is the existence of a limiting temperature &lt;math&gt;T_o=1/\beta _o&lt;/math&gt;. This result is equivalent to Hagedorn's result.&lt;ref  name=hage&gt;R. Hagedorn, Suppl. Al Nuovo Cimento 3 (1965) 147.&lt;/ref&gt; With these results, it is expected that at sufficiently high energy, the fireball presents a constant temperature and constant entropic factor.

==Experimental evidence==

Experimental evidence of the existence of a limiting temperature and of a limiting entropic index can be found in [[Jean Cleymans|J. Cleymans]] and collaborators,&lt;ref name=cley1&gt;J. Cleymans and D. Worku, J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 39 (2012)http://iopscience.iop.org/0954-3899/39/2/025006/pdf/0954-3899_39_2_025006.pdf

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}
'''Nonsense''' is a [[Linguistics|communication]], via [[speech]], [[writing]], or any other [[symbolic system]], that lacks any coherent [[semantics|meaning]]. Sometimes in ordinary usage, nonsense is synonymous with [[absurdity]] or the [[ridiculous]]. Many [[poet]]s, [[novelist]]s and [[songwriter]]s have used nonsense in their works, often creating entire works using it for reasons ranging from pure comic amusement or satire, to illustrating a point about language or reasoning. In the philosophy of language and philosophy of science, nonsense is distinguished from [[sense]] or meaningfulness, and attempts have been made to come up with a [[coherence (linguistics)|coherent]] and [[consistent]] method of distinguishing sense from nonsense. It is also an important field of study in [[cryptography]] regarding separating a [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].

== Literary ==
[[Image:1862ca-a-book-of-nonsense--edward-lear-001.jpg|thumb|''A Book of Nonsense'' (c. 1875 James Miller edition) by Edward Lear]]
{{Main|Literary nonsense}}
The phrase "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" was coined by [[Noam Chomsky]] as an example of nonsense. However, this can easily be confused with [[poetic symbolism]]. The individual ''words'' make sense and are arranged according to proper [[grammar|grammatical rules]], yet the result is nonsense. The inspiration for this attempt at creating verbal nonsense came from the idea of [[contradiction]] and seemingly irrelevant and/or incompatible characteristics, which conspire to make the phrase meaningless, but are open to interpretation. The phrase "the square root of Tuesday" (not a similar example; the lemondrop sunshine is more comparable){{vague|date=June 2014}} operates on the latter principle. This principle is behind the inscrutability of the ''[[kōan]]'' "What is the sound of one hand clapping?", where one hand would presumably be insufficient for clapping without the intervention of another.

[[James Joyce]]’s final novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' also uses nonsense: full of [[portmanteau]] and strong words, it ''appears'' to be pregnant with multiple layers of meaning, but in many passages it is difficult to say whether any one human’s interpretation of a text could be the intended or unintended one.

=== Verse ===
''[[Jabberwocky]]'', a [[Poetry|poem]] (of [[nonsense verse]]) found in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] (1871), is a nonsense poem written in the English language. The word ''jabberwocky'' is also occasionally used as a synonym of nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jabberwocky|title=the definition of Jabberwocky|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense verse is the verse form of literary nonsense, a genre that can manifest in many other ways.  Its best-known exponent is [[Edward Lear]], author of ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'' and hundreds of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]].

Nonsense verse is part of a long line of tradition predating Lear: the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'' could also be termed a nonsense verse. There are also some works which ''appear'' to be nonsense verse, but actually are not, such as the popular 1940s song [[Mairzy Doats]].

Lewis Carroll, seeking a nonsense riddle, once posed the question ''How is a [[common raven|raven]] like a writing desk?''. Someone answered him, ''Because [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] wrote on both''. However, there are other possible answers (e.g. ''both have inky [[quill]]s'').

Lines of nonsense frequently figure in the [[refrain]]s of [[Folk music|folksong]]s, where nonsense [[riddle]]s and [[knock-knock joke]]s are often encountered.

== Philosophy of language and of science ==
{{Further|Sense}}
In the [[philosophy of language]] and the [[philosophy of science]], nonsense refers to a lack of [[sense]] or [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]. Different technical definitions of meaning delineate sense from nonsense.

=== Logical positivism ===
{{Further|Logical positivism}}

=== Wittgenstein ===
{{Further|Ludwig Wittgenstein}}
In [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s writings, the word "nonsense" carries a special technical meaning which differs significantly from the normal use of the word.  In this sense, "nonsense" does not refer to meaningless gibberish, but rather to the lack of sense in the context of [[sense and reference]].  In this context, logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and purely mathematical propositions may be regarded as "nonsense". For example, "1+1=2" is a nonsensical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=md-KV6HUueUC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=wittgenstein+tautology+nonsense|title=Wittgenstein: the way out of the fly-bottle |first=Severin |last=Schroeder |publisher=Polity |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7456-2615-4 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein wrote in [[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus]] that some of the propositions contained in his own book should be regarded as nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;Biletzki, Anat and Anat Matar, "Ludwig Wittgenstein", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition) "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#Sen ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']"&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this way, "nonsense" does not necessarily carry negative connotations.

Starting from Wittgenstein, but through an original perspective, the Italian philosopher Leonardo Vittorio Arena, in his book ''Nonsense as the meaning'', highlights this positive meaning of nonsense to undermine every philosophical conception which does not take note of the absolute lack of meaning of the world and life. Nonsense implies the destruction of all views or opinions, on the wake of the Indian Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna. In the name of nonsense, it is finally refused the conception of duality and the Aristotelian formal logic.

==Cryptography==
The problem of distinguishing sense from nonsense is important in [[cryptography]] and other [[intelligence agency|intelligence]] fields.  For example, they need to distinguish [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].  [[Cryptanalysis|Cryptanalysts]] have devised [[algorithm]]s to determine whether a given text is in fact nonsense or not. These algorithms typically analyze the presence of repetitions and [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] in a text; in meaningful texts, certain frequently used words recur, for example, ''the'', ''is'' and ''and'' in a text in the [[English language]]. A [[Randomness|random]] scattering of letters, punctuation marks and spaces do not exhibit these regularities. [[Zipf's law]] attempts to state this analysis mathematically. By contrast, cryptographers typically seek to make their [[cipher]] texts resemble random distributions, to avoid telltale repetitions and patterns which may give an opening for cryptanalysis.

It is harder for cryptographers to deal with the presence or absence of meaning in a text in which the level of redundancy and repetition is ''higher'' than found in [[natural language]]s (for example, in the mysterious text of the [[Voynich manuscript]]).

== Teaching machines to talk nonsense ==
{{See also|SCIgen}}
Scientists have attempted to teach machines to produce nonsense.  The Markov chain technique is one method which has been used to generate texts by algorithm and randomizing techniques that seem meaningful. Another method is sometimes called the ''[[Mad Libs]]'' method: it involves creating templates for various [[Sentence (linguistics)#By structure|sentence structures]] and filling in the blanks with [[noun phrase]]s or [[verb phrase]]s; these phrase-generation procedures can be looped to add [[recursion]], giving the output the appearance of greater complexity and sophistication. [[Racter]] was a computer program which generated nonsense texts by this method; however, Racter’s book, ''The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed'', proved to have been the product of heavy human editing of the program's output.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">A '''notion''' in [[philosophy]] is a reflection in the [[mind]] of [[reality|real]] [[object (philosophy)|object]]s and [[phenomena]] in their [[essence|essential]] features and relations.  Notions are usually described in terms of scope and content. This is because notions are often created in response to [[empirical]] [[observations]] (or [[experiment]]s) of covarying trends among variables.

''Notion'' is the common translation for ''Begriff'' as used by [[Hegel]] in his [[Science of Logic#Introduction|Science of Logic]] (1816).

== Primitive notion ==
A [[primitive notion]] is used in [[logic]] or [[mathematics]] as an undefined term or concept at the foundation of an axiomatic system to be constructed. 

However, in philosophy the term "primitive notion" has historical content. For example, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] wrote ''De Alphabeto Cogitationum Humanarum'' ([[English language|English]]: ''An Alphabet for Human Thought''). Jaap Maat (2004) reviewed Leibniz for ''Philosophical Languages of the 17th Century''. According to Leibniz, "The alphabet of human thought is a catalogue of primitive notions, or those we cannot render clearer by any definitions." Maat explains, "a thing which is known without other intermediate notions can be considered to be primitive," and further, "a primitive notion is said to be conceived through itself".

Another example is in the ''Meditations'' of [[René Descartes]]:
:I think that there are certain primitive notions in us which are like originals. There are very few such notions. For apart from the most general notions of being, number, duration, etc which apply to everything that we can conceive, we have only the notion of extension that is specifically for the body, and from that flow the notions of shape and movement; and for the soul on its own we have only the concept of thought, which includes perceptions of the understanding and inclinations of the will. Finally, for the body and soul together, we have only the concept of their union, on which depends the notion of the soul's power to move the body and the body's power to act on the soul by causing its sensations and passions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond M. Clarke]] (2003) ''Descartes's Theory of Mind'', page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

:"[Descartes'] claim that mind-body unity is a primitive notion on a par with the primitive notions of thinking and extended substance..."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber (1992) ''Descartes' Metaphysical Physics'', page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">An '''organizing principle''' is a core assumption from which everything else by proximity can derive a classification or a value.  It is like a central reference point that allows all other objects to be located, often used in a [[conceptual framework]]. Having an organizing principle might help one simplify and get a handle on a particularly complicated domain or phenomenon.  On the other hand, it might create a deceptive prism that colors one's judgment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9632">'''Pontryagin's maximum (or minimum) principle''' is used in [[optimal control]] theory to find the best possible control for taking a [[dynamical system]] from one state to another, especially in the presence of constraints for the state or input controls. It was formulated in 1956 by the Russian mathematician [[Lev Pontryagin]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;See ref. below for first published work.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has as a special case the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the [[calculus of variations]].

The principle states, informally, that the ''control Hamiltonian'' must take an extreme value over controls in the set of all permissible controls. Whether the extreme value is maximum or minimum depends both on the problem and on the sign convention used for defining the Hamiltonian. The normal convention, which is the one used in [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]], leads to a maximum hence ''maximum principle'' but the sign convention used in this article makes the extreme value a minimum.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of values of permissible controls then the principle states that the optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t) \leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t), \quad \forall u \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in [t_0, t_f]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x^*\in C^1[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal state trajectory and &lt;math&gt;\lambda^* \in BV[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal [[costate]] trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;More info on [[Smoothness#Order of continuity|C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Bounded variation|BV]] spaces&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was first successfully applied to minimum time problems where the input control is constrained, but it can also be useful in studying state-constrained problems.

Special conditions for the Hamiltonian can also be derived. When the final time &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; is fixed and the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\partial H}{\partial t} \equiv 0\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv \mathrm{constant}\,&lt;/math&gt;
and if the final time is free, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
More general conditions on the optimal control are given below.

When satisfied along a trajectory, Pontryagin's minimum principle is a [[necessary condition]] for an optimum. The [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]] provides a [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary and sufficient condition]] for an optimum, but this condition must be satisfied over the whole of the state space.

While the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation admits [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation#Extension to stochastic problems|a straightforward extension]] to stochastic optimal control problems, the minimum principle does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yong|first1=J.|last2=Zhou|first2=X. Y.|title=Stochastic Controls: Hamiltonian Systems and HJB Equations|date=1999|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximization and minimization==

The principle was first known as ''Pontryagin's maximum principle'' and its proof is historically based on maximizing the Hamiltonian. The initial application of this principle was to the maximization of the terminal speed of a rocket. However, as it was subsequently mostly used for minimization of a performance index it has here been referred to as the ''minimum principle''.  Pontryagin's book solved the problem of minimizing a performance index.&lt;ref&gt;See p.13 of the 1962 book of Pontryagin et al. referenced below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
In what follows we will be making use of the following notation.
:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_T(x(T))= \frac{\partial \Psi(x)}{\partial T}|_{x=x(T)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_x(x(T))=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial
\Psi(x)}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x(T)} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial
\Psi(x)}{\partial x_n} |_{x=x(T)}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
H_x(x^*,u^*,\lambda^*,t)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\lambda=\lambda^*}
&amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\lambda=\lambda^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L_x(x^*,u^*)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
&amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f_x(x^*,u^*)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} &amp;
\ldots &amp; \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Formal statement of necessary conditions for minimization problem==
Here the necessary conditions are shown for minimization of a functional. Take &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be the state of the [[dynamical system]] with input &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, such that
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{x}=f(x,u), \quad x(0)=x_0, \quad u(t) \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in
[0,T]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of admissible controls and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal (i.e., final) time of the system. The control &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; must be chosen for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; to minimize the objective functional &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; which is defined by the application and can be abstracted as

:&lt;math&gt;
J=\Psi(x(T))+\int^T_0 L(x(t),u(t)) \,dt
&lt;/math&gt;

The constraints on the system dynamics can be adjoined to the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by introducing time-varying [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrange multiplier]] vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, whose elements are called the costates of the system. This motivates the construction of the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; defined for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; by:
:&lt;math&gt;
H(x(t),u(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f(x(t),u(t))+L(x(t),u(t)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\rm T}&lt;/math&gt; is the transpose of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

Pontryagin's minimum principle states that the optimal state trajectory &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;, optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt;, and corresponding Lagrange multiplier vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; must  minimize the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;
(1) \qquad H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t)\leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

for all time &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; and for all permissible control inputs &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. It must also be the case that

:&lt;math&gt;
(2) \qquad \Psi_T(x(T))+H(T)=0 \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, the [[costate equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;
(3) \qquad -\dot{\lambda}^{\rm T}(t)=H_x(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))+L_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))
&lt;/math&gt;

must be satisfied. If the final state &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is not fixed (i.e., its differential variation is not zero), it must also be that the terminal costates are such that

:&lt;math&gt;
(4) \qquad \lambda^{\rm T}(T)=\Psi_x(x(T)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

These four conditions in (1)-(4) are the necessary conditions for an optimal control. Note that (4) only applies when &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is free. If it is fixed, then this condition is not necessary for an optimum.

{{Psychology sidebar}}

The '''Positive and Negative Affect Schedule''' ('''PANAS''') is a self-report questionnaire that consists of two 10-item scales to measure both [[Positive affectivity|positive]] and [[Negative affectivity|negative affect]]. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 1 ''(not at all)'' to 5 ''(very much)''. The measure has been used mainly as a research tool in group studies, but can be utilized within clinical and non-clinical populations as well.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=John R.|last2=Henry|first2=Julie D.|title=The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS): Construct validity, measurement properties and normative data in a large non-clinical sample|url=http://doi.crossref.org/10.1348/0144665031752934|journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=245–265|doi=10.1348/0144665031752934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortened, elongated, and children's versions of the PANAS have been developed, taking approximately 5–10 minutes to complete.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Clinical and non-clinical studies have found the PANAS to be a reliable and valid instrument in the assessment of positive and negative affect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=David|last2=Clark|first2=Lee A.|last3=Tellegen|first3=Auke|title=Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=54|issue=6|pages=1063–1070|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and history ==
The PANAS was developed in 1988 by researchers from the University of Minnesota and Southern Methodist University. Previous mood measures have shown correlations of variable strength between positive and negative affect, and these same measures have questionable reliability and validity. Watson, Clark, and Tellegen developed the PANAS in an attempt to provide a better, purer measure of each of these dimensions.

The researchers extracted 60 terms from the factor analyses of Michael Zevon and Tellegen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zevon|first=Michael A.|last2=Tellegen|first2=Auke|date=1982-07-01|title=The structure of mood change: An idiographic/nomothetic analysis.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/43/1/111|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=English|volume=43|issue=1|pages=111–122|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.1.111|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown to be relatively accurate markers of either positive or negative affect, but not both. They chose terms that met a strong correlation to one corresponding dimension but exhibited a weak correlation to the other. Through multiple rounds of elimination and preliminary analyses with a test population, the researchers arrived at 10 terms for each of the two scales, as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
! scope="col"| Positive affect

===PANAS-C===
The '''PANAS for Children (PANAS-C)''' was developed in an attempt to differentiate the affective expressions of anxiety and depression in children. The tripartite model on which this measure is based suggests that high levels of negative affect is present in those with anxiety and depression, but high levels of positive affect is not shared between the two. Previous mood scales for children have been shown to reliably capture the former relationship but not the latter; the PANAS-C was created as a tool with better discriminant validity for child assessment. Similar to the development of the original PANAS, the PANAS-C drew from terms of the PANAS-X and eliminated several terms with insufficient correlations between the term and the affective construct after preliminary analyses with a non-clinical sample of children. The final version of the measure consists of 27 items: 12 positive affect terms and 15 negative affect terms. Despite the purpose of its development, however, the measure’s discriminant validity is still wanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Alicia A.|last2=Kendall|first2=Philip C.|date=2009-01-14|title=Psychometric Properties of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children (PANAS-C) in Children with Anxiety Disorders|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10578-009-0130-4|journal=Child Psychiatry and Human Development|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=343–352|doi=10.1007/s10578-009-0130-4|issn=0009-398X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PANAS-SF===
The '''PANAS-SF''',  comprises 10 items that were determined through the highest factor loadings on the exploratory [[factor analysis]] reported by Watson et al. (1988) in his original PANAS. Previous mood scales, such that of Bradburn, had low reliabilities and high correlations between subscales. Watson was able to address these concerns in his study of the original PANAS; however, his participants consisted mostly of student populations. The purpose of the PANAS-SF was not only to provide a shorter and more concise form of the PANAS, but to be able to apply the schedules to older clinical populations. Overall, it was reported that this modified model was consistent with Watson’s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kercher|first=Kyle|date=1992-06-01|title=Assessing Subjective Well-Being in the Old-Old The PANAS as a Measure of Orthogonal Dimensions of Positive and Negative Affect|url=http://roa.sagepub.com/content/14/2/131|journal=Research on Aging|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=131–168|doi=10.1177/0164027592142001|issn=0164-0275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===I-PANAS-SF===
Separate from the PANAS-SF,  Edmund Thompson created the international PANAS short form ('''I-PANAS-SF''') in order to make a 10 item mood scale that can be implemented effectively on an international level, provide more clarity on the content of the items, reduce ambiguities, address the limitations of the original and the previous short form of the PANAS, and also to provide a shorter, yet dependable and valid scale. To determine the 10 items of the 20 original items, two focus groups were utilized to evaluate all of the original 20 PANAS items. They found that while some items were easily understood by the participant, certains items had different meanings or were too ambiguous. Items that had too much ambiguity were eliminated from the modified form. Researchers found that the I-PANAS-SF had high correlations with the original PANAS. Through multiple tests and studies, they were able to determine that the I-PANAS-SF was on par with the original scale and can be used as a reliable, valid, brief, and efficient instrument on an international scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Edmund R.|date=2007-03-01|title=Development and Validation of an Internationally Reliable Short-Form of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)|url=http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/38/2/227|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=227–242|doi=10.1177/0022022106297301|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PANAS-X===
In 1994, Watson and Clark developed an expanded form of the PANAS, called the '''PANAS-X''', that consists of 60 items that can be completed in 10 minutes or less. The PANAS-X incorporates the original, higher order dimensions specified in the PANAS in addition to the measures of 11 lower order emotional states. These measures are broken down into three main categories: basic negative emotion scales consisting of fear, hostility, guilt, and sadness; basic positive emotion scales consisting of joviality, self-assurance, and attentiveness; and other affective states consisting of shyness, fatigue, serenity, and surprise. Through extensive analyses, all eleven affective states, with the exception of surprise, were shown to be stable, valid measures that assess how an individual’s emotional states fluctuate over time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Watson,|last2=Anna|first2=Clark, Lee|date=1999-01-01|title=The PANAS-X: Manual for the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Expanded Form|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/psychology_pubs/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Many forms of the PANAS (PANAS-C, PANAS-X, I-PANAS-SF, and among others) have shown that the PANAS has been widely employed. Recent studies have also shown that the PANAS can be administered in a large general adult population, as well as other populations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, to date, the PANAS is mostly used as a research tool in group studies, but it has the potential to be utilized in clinical work with individuals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, the PANAS has the potential to be used to evaluate mental illnesses, as shown in an experiment conducted by Dyck, Jolly, and Kramer, which demonstrated its effectiveness in distinguishing between depression and anxiety in clinical samples.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

== Limitations ==
Since the PANAS is a self-report questionnaire, it can be difficult to assess people’s mood accurately, as people can overstate or understate their experience of their moods. In addition, the original PANAS had a limited sample size of college students, which concerns with wide applicability to other samples. Furthermore, some studies claim that the PANAS is too long or that its items are redundant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The PANAS does not encompass higher order mood states.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], the concept of a '''possible world''' is used to express [[modal logic|modal claims]]. The concept of possible worlds is common in contemporary philosophical discourse but has been disputed.

== Possibility, necessity, and contingency ==
{{Further|Modal logic#The ontology of possibility}}
Those theorists who use the concept of possible worlds consider the ''actual'' world to be one of the many possible worlds. For each distinct way the world could have been, there is said to be a distinct possible world; the actual world is the one we in fact live in. Among such theorists there is disagreement about the nature of possible worlds; their precise [[Modal logic#The ontology of possibility|ontological status]] is disputed, and especially the difference, if any, in ontological status between the actual world and all the other possible worlds. One position on these matters is set forth in [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s modal realism (see below). There is a close relation between [[proposition]]s and possible worlds. We note that every proposition is either true or false at any given possible world; then the ''[[modal logic|modal status]]'' of a proposition is understood in terms of the ''worlds in which it is true'' and ''worlds in which it is false''. The following are among the assertions we may now usefully make:

* '''[[Truth|True propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969").
* '''[[Falsity|False propositions]]''' are those that are ''false in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Ronald Reagan]] became president in 1969"). (Reagan did not run for president until 1976, and thus couldn't possibly have been elected.)
* '''[[Logical possibility|Possible propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in at least one possible world'' (for example: "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969"). (Humphrey did run for president in 1968, and thus could have been elected.) This includes propositions which are necessarily true, in the sense below.
* '''[[Contradiction|Impossible propositions]]''' (or ''necessarily false propositions'') are those that are ''true in no possible world'' (for example: "Melissa and Toby are taller than each other at the same time").
* '''[[Logical truth|Necessarily true propositions]]''' (often simply called '''necessary propositions''') are those that are ''true in all possible worlds'' (for example: "2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4"; "all bachelors are unmarried").&lt;ref&gt;See "A Priori and A Posteriori" (author: Jason S. Baehr), at ''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/apriori/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]'': "A necessary proposition is one the truth value of which remains constant across all possible worlds. Thus a necessarily true proposition is one that is true in every possible world, and a necessarily false proposition is one that is false in every possible world. By contrast, the truth value of contingent propositions is not fixed across all possible worlds: for any contingent proposition, there is at least one possible world in which it is true and at least one possible world in which it is false." Accessed 7 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Contingency (philosophy)|Contingent propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in some possible worlds and false in others'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently false'' and "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently true'').

The idea of possible worlds is most commonly attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]], who spoke of possible worlds as ideas in the mind of [[God]] and used the notion to argue that our actually created world must be "the [[best of all possible worlds]]". [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that on the contrary our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were only a little worse it could not continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, "De Welt als Wille and Vorstellung," supplement to the 4th book "Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens" p. 2222, see also R.B. Haldane and J. Kemp's translation [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation/Supplements_to_the_Fourth_Book "On the Vanity and Suffering of Life"] pp 395-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have found implicit earlier traces of the idea of possible worlds in the works of [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;"Nor could we doubt that, if God had created many worlds, they would not be as true in all of them as in this one. Thus those who could examine sufficiently the consequences of these truths and of our rules, could be able to discover effects by their causes, and, to explain myself in the language of the schools, they could have a priori demonstrations of everything that could be produced in this new world." -The World, Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; a major influence on Leibniz, [[Al-Ghazali]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), [[Averroes]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]''),&lt;ref name=Kukkonen&gt;{{citation|title=Possible Worlds in the Tahâfut al-Falâsifa: Al-Ghazâlî on Creation and Contingency|author=Taneli Kukkonen|journal=[[Journal of the History of Philosophy]]|volume=38|issue=4|year=2000|pages=479–502|doi=10.1353/hph.2005.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (''Matalib al-'Aliya'')&lt;ref name=Setia&gt;{{citation|title=Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi on Physics and the Nature of the Physical World: A Preliminary Survey|author=Adi Setia|journal=Islam &amp; Science|volume=2|year=2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QYQ/is_2_2/ai_n9532826/|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name=Kukkonen/&gt; The modern philosophical use of the notion was pioneered by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Saul Kripke]].

== Formal semantics of modal logics ==
{{Main|Modal logic#Semantics}}

A semantics for modal logic was first introduced in the late-1950s work of [[Saul Kripke]] and his colleagues. A statement in modal logic that is ''possible'' is said to be true in at least one possible world; a statement that is ''necessary'' is said to be true in all possible worlds.

== From modal logic to philosophical tool ==
From this groundwork, the theory of possible worlds became a central part of many philosophical developments, from the 1960s onwards &amp;ndash; including, most famously, the analysis of [[counterfactual conditional]]s in terms of "nearby possible worlds" developed by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Robert Stalnaker]]. On this analysis, when we discuss what ''would'' happen ''if'' some set of conditions ''were'' the case, the truth of our claims is determined by what is true at the nearest possible world (or the ''set'' of nearest possible worlds) where the conditions obtain. (A possible world W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be near to another possible world W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R to the degree that the same things happen in W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R; the more different something happens in two possible worlds in a certain respect, the "further" they are from one another in that respect.) Consider this conditional sentence: "If George W. Bush hadn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore would have." The sentence would be taken to express a claim that could be reformulated as follows: "In all nearest worlds to our actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore became president of the U.S. then instead." And on this interpretation of the sentence, if there is or are some nearest worlds to the actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president but Al Gore didn't either, then the claim expressed by this counterfactual would be false.

Today, possible worlds play a central role in many debates in philosophy, including especially debates over the [[philosophical zombie|Zombie Argument]], and [[physicalism]] and [[supervenience]] in the [[philosophy of mind]]. Many debates in the [[philosophy of religion]] have been reawakened by the use of possible worlds. Intense debate has also emerged over the [[ontology|ontological]] status of possible worlds, provoked especially by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s defense of [[modal realism]], the doctrine that talk about "possible worlds" is best explained in terms of innumerable, ''really existing'' worlds beyond the one we live in. The fundamental question here is: ''given'' that modal logic works, and that some possible-worlds semantics for modal logic is correct, ''what has to be true'' of the world, and just what ''are'' these possible worlds that we range over in our interpretation of modal statements? Lewis argued that what we range over are real, concrete ''worlds'' that exist just as unequivocally as our actual world exists, but that are distinguished from the actual world simply by standing in no spatial, temporal, or causal relations with the actual world. (On Lewis's account, the only "special" property that the ''actual'' world has is a relational one: that ''we'' are in it. This doctrine is called "the indexicality of actuality": "actual" is a merely [[indexicality|indexical]] term, like "now" and "here".) Others, such as [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] and [[William Lycan]], reject Lewis's picture as metaphysically extravagant, and suggest in its place an interpretation of possible worlds as consistent, maximally complete sets of descriptions of or propositions about the world, so that a "possible world" is conceived of as a complete ''description'' of ''a way the world could be'' &amp;ndash; rather than a ''world that is that way''. (Lewis describes their position, and similar positions such as those advocated by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]], as "''ersatz'' modal realism", arguing that such theories try to get the benefits of possible worlds semantics for modal logic "on the cheap", but that they ultimately fail to provide an adequate explanation.) [[Saul Kripke]], in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', took explicit issue with Lewis's use of possible worlds semantics, and defended a ''stipulative'' account of possible worlds as purely ''formal'' (logical) entities rather than either really existent worlds or as some set of propositions or descriptions.

== Possible-world theory in literary studies ==
Possible worlds theory in literary studies uses concepts from possible-world logic and applies them to worlds that are created by fictional texts, [[fictional universe]]. In particular, possible-world theory provides a useful vocabulary and conceptual framework with which to describe such worlds. However, a literary world is a specific type of possible world, quite distinct from the possible worlds in logic. This is because a literary text houses its own system of modality, consisting of actual worlds (actual events) and possible worlds (possible events). In fiction, the principle of simultaneity, it extends to cover the dimensional aspect, when it is contemplated that two or more physical objects, realities, perceptions and objects non-physical, can coexist in the same space-time.{{vague|date=April 2015}} Thus, a literary universe is granted autonomy in much the same way as the actual universe.

Literary critics, such as [[Marie-Laure Ryan]], [[Lubomír Doležel]], and [[Thomas Pavel]], have used possible-worlds theory to address notions of literary truth, the nature of fictionality, and the relationship between fictional worlds and reality. Taxonomies of fictional possibilities have also been proposed where the likelihood of a fictional world is assessed. Possible-world theory is also used within narratology to divide a specific text into its constituent worlds, possible and actual. In this approach, the modal structure of the fictional text is analysed in relation to its [[narrative]] and thematic concerns. [[Rein Raud]] has extended this approach onto "cultural" worlds, comparing possible worlds to the particular constructions of reality of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;"Identity, Difference and Cultural Worlds", in Lang, V. &amp; Kull, K. (eds) (2014) Estonian Approaches to Culture Theory. Approaches to Culture Theory 4, 164–179. University of Tartu Press, Tartu, https://www.academia.edu/9128313/Identity_Difference_and_Cultural_Worlds&lt;/ref&gt; However, the metaphor of the "cultural possible worlds" relates to the framework of [[cultural relativism]] and, depending on the ontological status ascribed to possible worlds, warrants different, often controversial claims ranging from ethnocentrism to cultural imperialism.

The '''principle of explosion''' (Latin: ''ex falso (sequitur) quodlibet'' (EFQ), "from falsehood, anything (follows)", or ''ex contradictione (sequitur) quodlibet'' (ECQ), "from contradiction, anything (follows)"), or the '''principle of [[Pseudo-Scotus]]''', is the law of [[classical logic]], [[intuitionistic logic]] and similar logical systems, according to which any statement can be proven from a contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;Carnielli, W. and Marcos, J. (2001) [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.107.70 "Ex contradictione non sequitur quodlibet"] ''Proc. 2nd Conf. on Reasoning and Logic'' (Bucharest, July 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; That is, once a contradiction has been asserted, any proposition (including their negations) can be inferred from it. This is known as '''deductive explosion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As a demonstration of the principle, consider two contradictory statements – "All lemons are yellow" and "Not all lemons are yellow", and suppose (for the sake of argument) that both are simultaneously true.  If that is the case, anything can be proven, e.g. "unicorns exist", by using the following argument:
# We know that "All lemons are yellow" as it is defined to be true.
# Therefore, the statement that ("All lemons are yellow" OR "unicorns exist”) must also be true, since the first part is true.
# However, if "Not all lemons are yellow" (and this is also defined to be true), unicorns must exist – otherwise statement 2 would be false (in rigor, given that at least one lemon exists).  It has thus been "proven" that unicorns exist. The same could be applied to any assertion, including the statement "unicorns do not exist".

Due to the principle of explosion, the existence of a contradiction ([[inconsistency]]) in a [[formal system|formal axiomatic system]] is disastrous; since any statement can be proved true it trivializes the concepts of truth and falsity.&lt;ref name="McKubre-Jordens"&gt;{{cite web

Mathematicians such as [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Ernst Zermelo]], [[Abraham Fraenkel]], and [[Thoralf Skolem]] put much effort into revising [[set theory]] to eliminate these contradictions, resulting in the modern [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].    

In a different solution to these problems, a few mathematicians have devised alternate theories of [[logic (mathematics)|logic]] called [[paraconsistent logic]]s, which eliminate the principle of explosion.&lt;ref name="McKubre-Jordens" /&gt;  These allow some contradictory statements to be proved without affecting other proofs.

==Symbolic representation==
In [[symbolic logic]], the principle of explosion can be expressed in the following way
:&lt;math&gt;\forall P \forall Q: (P \land \lnot P) \vdash Q&lt;/math&gt;
(For any statements ''P'' and ''Q'', if ''P'' and not-''P'' are both true, then ''Q'' is true)

==Proof==
Below is a formal proof of the principle using [[symbolic logic]]
#&lt;math&gt;P \wedge \neg P&lt;/math&gt;
#:assumption
#&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
#:from (1) by [[conjunction elimination]]
#&lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;
#:from (1) by conjunction elimination
#&lt;math&gt;P \vee Q&lt;/math&gt;
#:from (2) by [[disjunction introduction]]
#&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;
#:from (3) and (4) by [[disjunctive syllogism]]
#&lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \neg P) \to Q&lt;/math&gt;
#:from (5) by [[conditional proof]] (discharging assumption 1)

This is just the symbolic version of the informal argument given in the introduction, with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; standing for "all lemons are yellow" and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; standing for "Unicorns exist". From "all lemons are yellow and not all lemons are yellow" (1), we infer "all lemons are yellow" (2) and "not all lemons are yellow" (3); from "all lemons are yellow" (2), we infer "all lemons are yellow or unicorns exist" (4); and from "not all lemons are yellow" (3) and "all lemons are yellow or unicorns exist" (4), we infer "unicorns exist" (5). Hence, if all lemons are yellow and not all lemons are yellow, then unicorns exist.

===Semantic argument===
An alternate argument for the principle stems from [[model theory]].  A sentence &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a ''[[semantic consequence]]'' of a set of sentences &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; only if every model of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a model of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.  But there is no model of the contradictory set &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt;.  [[A fortiori]], there is no model of &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt; that is not a model of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, vacuously, every model of &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt; is a model of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.   Thus &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a semantic consequence of &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Paraconsistent logic==

[[Paraconsistent logic]]s have been developed that allow for sub-contrary forming operators.   [[Formal semantics (logic)|Model-theoretic]] paraconsistent logicians often deny the assumption that there can be no model of &lt;math&gt;\{\phi , \lnot \phi \}&lt;/math&gt; and devise semantical systems in which there are such models. Alternatively, they reject the idea that propositions can be classified as true or false.  [[Proof-theoretic semantics|Proof-theoretic]] paraconsistent logics usually deny the validity of one of the steps necessary for deriving an explosion, typically including disjunctive syllogism, disjunction introduction, and [[reductio ad absurdum]].

==Use==
The [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] value of the principle of explosion is that for any logical system where this principle holds, any derived [[mathematical theory|theory]] which proves [[false (logic)|⊥]] (or an equivalent form, &lt;math&gt;\phi \land \lnot \phi&lt;/math&gt;) is worthless because ''all'' its [[statement (logic)|statements]] would become [[theorem]]s, making it impossible to distinguish [[truth]] from falsehood. That is to say, the principle of explosion is an argument for the [[law of non-contradiction]] in classical logic, because without it all truth statements become meaningless.

:''This article discusses the history of the principle of least action. For the application, please refer to [[action (physics)]].''
The '''principle of least action''' – or, more accurately, the '''principle of stationary action''' – is a [[variational principle]] that, when applied to the [[action (physics)|action]] of a [[mechanics|mechanical]] system, can be used to obtain the [[equations of motion]] for that system. In relativity, a different action must be minimized or maximized. The principle can be used to derive [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] [[equations of motion]], and even [[general relativity]] (see [[Einstein–Hilbert action]]).

Schwinger, Selected Papers on Electrodynamics, Dover Publications Inc.(1958), pp. 312.{{ISBN|9780883076484}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and after him Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman, demonstrated how this principle can also be used in quantum calculations.&lt;ref&gt;R.

The principle remains central in [[modern physics]] and [[mathematics]], being applied in [[thermodynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.aop.2008.04.007 |title=Thermodynamics based on the principle of least abbreviated action: Entropy production in a network of coupled oscillators |journal=Annals of Physics |volume=323 |issue=8 |pages=1844–58 |year=2008 |last1=García-Morales |first1=Vladimir |last2=Pellicer |first2=Julio |last3=Manzanares |first3=José A. |bibcode=2008AnPhy.323.1844G |arxiv=cond-mat/0602186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fluid mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Principle_of_least_action&lt;/ref&gt; the [[theory of relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1942PhDT.........5F |title=The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics |author1=Feynman |first1=Richard Phillips |year=1942 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[particle physics]], and [[string theory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/LeastAction.pdf Principle of Least Action - damtp]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a focus of modern mathematical investigation in [[Morse theory]]. [[Maupertuis' principle]] and [[Hamilton's principle]] exemplify the principle of stationary action.

The action principle is preceded by earlier ideas in [[optics]]. In [[ancient Greece]], [[Euclid]] wrote in his ''Catoptrica'' that, for the path of light reflecting from a mirror, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] equals the [[angle of reflection]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Hero of Alexandria]] later showed that this path was the shortest length and least time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Scholars often credit [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] for formulating the principle of least action because he wrote about it in 1744&lt;ref name="mau44"&gt;P.L.M. de Maupertuis, ''[[s:fr:Accord de différentes loix de la nature qui avoient jusqu’ici paru incompatibles|Accord de différentes lois de la nature qui avaient jusqu'ici paru incompatibles.]]'' (1744) Mém.

In 1933, [[Paul Dirac]] discerned the [[Path integral formulation#Quantum action principle|quantum mechanical underpinning]] of the principle in the [[Interference (wave propagation)#Quantum interference|quantum interference]] of amplitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dirac |first=Paul A.

==General statement==
[[File:Least action principle.svg|250px|thumb|As the system evolves, '''q''' traces a path through [[configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (only some are shown). The path taken by the system (red) has a stationary action (''δS'' = 0) under small changes in the configuration of the system (''δ'''''q''').&lt;ref name=penrose&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage books| year=2007 | page = 474|isbn=0-679-77631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The starting point is the ''[[action (physics)|action]]'', denoted &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; (calligraphic S), of a physical system. It is defined as the [[integral (mathematics)|integral]] of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] ''L'' between two instants of [[time in physics|time]] ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - technically a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the ''N'' [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'') which define the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{q} : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}^N &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}[\mathbf{q}, t_1, t_2] 
= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}(t),\mathbf{\dot{q}}(t), t) dt &lt;/math&gt;

where the dot denotes the [[time derivative]], and ''t'' is time.

Mathematically the principle is&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{ISBN|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Analytical Mechanics 2008"&gt;Analytical Mechanics, L.N. Hand, J.D. Finch, Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-521-57572-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ'' (lowercase Greek [[Delta (letter)|delta]]) means a ''small'' change. In words this reads:&lt;ref name=penrose/&gt;

:''The path taken by the system between times t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and configurations q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the one for which the '''action''' is '''stationary (no change)''' to '''first order'''.''

In applications the statement and definition of action are taken together:&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mechanics, T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{ISBN|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}},t) dt = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the coordinates in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

==Origins, statements, and controversy==

===Fermat===
{{main article|Fermat's principle}}
In the 1600s, [[Pierre de Fermat]] postulated that "''light travels between two given points along the path of shortest time''," which is known as the '''principle of least time''' or '''[[Fermat's principle]]'''.&lt;ref name="Analytical Mechanics 2008"/&gt;

===Maupertuis===
{{main article|Maupertuis principle}}
Credit for the formulation of the '''principle of least action''' is commonly given to [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]], who felt that "Nature is thrifty in all its actions", and applied the principle broadly:

{{quote|The laws of movement and of rest deduced from this principle being precisely the same as those observed in nature, we can admire the application of it to all phenomena. The movement of animals, the vegetative growth of plants ... are only its consequences; and the spectacle of the universe becomes so much the grander, so much more beautiful, the worthier of its Author, when one knows that a small number of laws, most wisely established, suffice for all movements.|Pierre Louis Maupertuis&lt;ref&gt;Chris Davis. [http://www.idlex.freeserve.co.uk/idle/evolution/ref/leastact.html ''Idle theory''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615043538/http://www.idlex.freeserve.co.uk/idle/evolution/ref/leastact.html |date=2006-06-15 }} (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This notion of Maupertuis, although somewhat deterministic today, does capture much of the essence of mechanics.

In application to physics, Maupertuis suggested that the quantity to be minimized was the product of the duration (time) of movement within a system by the "[[vis viva]]",

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''Maupertuis' principle'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\delta \int 2T(t)  dt=0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

which is the integral of twice what we now call the [[kinetic energy]] ''T'' of the system.

===Euler===

[[Leonhard Euler]] gave a formulation of the action principle in 1744, in very recognizable terms, in the ''Additamentum 2'' to his ''Methodus Inveniendi Lineas Curvas Maximi Minive Proprietate Gaudentes''. Beginning with the second paragraph:

{{cquote|Let the mass of the projectile be ''M'', and let its speed be ''v'' while being moved over an infinitesimal distance ''ds''.   The body will have a momentum ''Mv'' that, when multiplied by the distance ''ds'', will give {{nowrap|''Mv'' ''ds''}}, the momentum of the body integrated over the distance ''ds''.  Now I assert that the curve thus described by the body to be the curve (from among all other curves connecting the same endpoints) that minimizes
:&lt;math&gt;\int Mv\,ds&lt;/math&gt;
or, provided that ''M'' is constant along the path,
:&lt;math&gt;M\int v\,ds&lt;/math&gt;.|20px|20px|Leonhard Euler&lt;ref name="eul44" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Euler, [[s:la:Methodus inveniendi/Additamentum II|Additamentum II]] ([http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E065h external link]), ibid. ([[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Translation:Methodus_inveniendi/Additamentum_II&amp;oldid=6399338| English translation]])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Euler states, ∫''Mv''d''s'' is the integral of the momentum over distance travelled, which, in modern notation, equals the abbreviated or [[reduced action]]

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''Euler's principle'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\delta\int p\,dq=0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

Thus, Euler made an equivalent and (apparently) independent statement of the variational principle in the same year as Maupertuis, albeit slightly later. Curiously, Euler did not claim any priority, as the following episode shows.

===Disputed priority===

Maupertuis' priority was disputed in 1751 by the mathematician [[Samuel König]], who claimed that it had been invented by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in 1707. Although similar to many of Leibniz's arguments, the principle itself has not been documented in Leibniz's works. König himself showed a ''copy'' of a 1707 letter from Leibniz to [[Jacob Hermann (mathematician)|Jacob Hermann]] with the principle, but the ''original'' letter has been lost. In contentious proceedings, König was accused of forgery,&lt;ref name="oco03" /&gt; and even the [[Frederick the Great|King of Prussia]] entered the debate, defending Maupertuis (the head of his Academy), while [[Voltaire]] defended König.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Euler, rather than claiming priority, was a staunch defender of Maupertuis, and Euler himself prosecuted König for forgery before the Berlin Academy on 13 April 1752.&lt;ref name="oco03" /&gt; The claims of forgery were re-examined 150 years later, and archival work by [[C.I. Gerhardt]] in 1898&lt;ref name="ger98" /&gt; and [[W. Kabitz]] in 1913&lt;ref name="kab13" /&gt; uncovered other copies of the letter, and three others cited by König, in the [[Bernoulli family|Bernoulli]] archives.

==Further development==

Euler continued to write on the topic; in his ''Reflexions sur quelques loix generales de la nature'' (1748), he called the quantity "effort". His expression corresponds to what we would now call [[potential energy]], so that his statement of least action in statics is equivalent to the principle that a system of bodies at rest will adopt a configuration that minimizes total potential energy.

===Lagrange and Hamilton===
{{main article|Hamilton's principle}}
Much of the calculus of variations was stated by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] in 1760&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=D. J. Struik|title=A Source Book in Mathematics, 1200-1800|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass|year=1969}} pp. 406-413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1972|isbn=0-19-501496-0}} pp. 582-589&lt;/ref&gt; and he proceeded to apply this to problems in dynamics. In ''Méchanique Analytique'' (1788) Lagrange derived the general [[Lagrangian equations of motion|equations of motion]] of a mechanical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lagrange|first=Joseph-Louis|title=Mécanique Analytique|year=1788}} p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1834 and 1835&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Hamilton, "On a General Method in Dynamics", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/GenMeth.pdf Part I (1834) p.247-308]; [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/SecEssay.pdf Part II (1835) p. 95-144]. (''From the collection [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/ Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865): Mathematical Papers] edited by David R. Wilkins, School of Mathematics, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland. (2000); also reviewed as [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Dynamics/ On a General Method in Dynamics]'')&lt;/ref&gt; applied the variational principle to the classical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]

:&lt;math&gt;L=T-V&lt;/math&gt;

to obtain the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] in their present form.

===Jacobi and Morse===
In 1842, [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]] tackled the problem of whether the variational principle always found minima as opposed to other [[stationary points]] (maxima or stationary [[saddle points]]); most of his work focused on [[geodesics]] on two-dimensional surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;G.C.J. Jacobi, ''Vorlesungen über Dynamik, gehalten an der Universität Königsberg im Wintersemester 1842-1843''. A. Clebsch (ed.) (1866); Reimer; Berlin. 290 pages, available online [http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/cgi-bin/oeitem?id=OE_JACOBI__8_1_0  Œuvres complètes volume '''8'''] at [http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/OEUVRES/ Gallica-Math] from the [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ Gallica Bibliothèque nationale de France].&lt;/ref&gt; The first clear general statements were given by [[Marston Morse]] in the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Marston Morse (1934). "The Calculus of Variations in the Large", ''American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publication'' '''18'''; New York.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to what is now known as [[Morse theory]]. For example, Morse showed that the number of [[conjugate points]] in a trajectory equalled the number of negative eigenvalues in the second variation of the Lagrangian.

===Gauss and Hertz===
Other extremal principles of [[classical mechanics]] have been formulated, such as [[Gauss's principle of least constraint]] and its corollary, [[Hertz's principle of least curvature]].

==Disputes about possible teleological aspects==

The  mathematical equivalence of the [[differential equation|differential]] [[equations of motion]] and their [[integral equation|integral]]
counterpart has important philosophical implications.  The differential equations are statements about quantities localized to a single point in space or single moment of time.  For example, [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

states that the ''instantaneous'' force '''F''' applied to a mass ''m'' produces an acceleration '''a''' at the same ''instant''.  By  contrast, the action principle is not localized to a point; rather, it involves integrals over an interval of time and (for fields) an extended region of space.  Moreover, in the usual formulation of [[classical physics|classical]] action principles, the initial and final states of the system are fixed, e.g.,

:''Given that the particle begins at position x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ends at position x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at time t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the physical trajectory that connects these two endpoints is an [[extremum]] of the action integral.''

In particular, the fixing of the ''final'' state has been interpreted as giving the action principle a [[teleology|teleological character]] which has been controversial historically. However, according to W. Yourgrau and S. Mandelstam, ''the teleological approach... presupposes that the variational principles themselves have mathematical characteristics which they ''de facto'' do not possess''&lt;ref name="Stöltzner1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stöltzner|first=Michael|title=Inside Versus Outside: Action Principles and Teleology|year=1994|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-48649-4|pages=33–62 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-48647-0_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some critics maintain this apparent [[teleology]] occurs because of the way in which the question was asked. By specifying some but not all aspects of both the initial and final conditions (the positions but not the velocities) we are making some inferences about the initial conditions from the final conditions, and it is this "backward" inference that can be seen as a teleological explanation. Teleology can also be overcome if we consider the classical description as a limiting case of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] formalism of [[Path integral formulation|path integration]], in which stationary paths are obtained as a result of interference of amplitudes along all possible paths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The short story ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' by the speculative fiction writer [[Ted Chiang]] contains visual depictions of [[Fermat's Principle]] along with a discussion of its teleological dimension. [[Keith Devlin]]'s ''The Math Instinct'' contains a chapter, "Elvis the Welsh Corgi Who Can Do Calculus" that discusses the calculus "embedded" in some animals as they solve the "least time" problem in actual situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19261">The '''principle of sufficient reason''' states that everything must have a [[Reason (argument)|reason]] or a [[cause]]. The modern&lt;ref&gt;From Hamilton 1860:67" 
In modern times, the attention of philosophers was called to this law of Leibnitz, who, on the two principles of Reason and of Contradiction, founded the whole edifice of his philosophy.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; See Théodicée, § 44. [[Monadology|Monadologie]], §§ 81, 82. —ED."&lt;/ref&gt; formulation of the principle is usually attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;There are numerous anticipations. One often pointed to is in [[Anselm of Canterbury]]: his phrase [http://12koerbe.de/pan/curdeus5.htm ''quia Deus nihil sine ratione facit''] and the formulation of the [[ontological argument for the existence of God]]. A clearer connection is with the [[cosmological argument for the existence of God]]. The principle can be seen in both [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[William of Ockham]]. Leibniz formulated it, but was not an originator. See chapter on Leibniz and Spinoza in [[A. O. Lovejoy]], ''The Great Chain of Being''.&lt;/ref&gt; although the idea was conceived of and utilized by various philosophers who preceded him, including [[Anaximander]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World|last= Freeman|first= Charles|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Allen Lane|location= |isbn= 0-7139-9224-7|page= 152|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parmenides]], [[Archimedes]],&lt;ref name="Principle of Sufficient Reason"&gt;{{cite web |title= Principle of Sufficient Reason |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton66"&gt;[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] 1860:66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton66"/&gt; [[Avicenna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Kara|title=Avicenna and the Principle of Sufficient Reason|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2014|volume=67|issue=4|pages=743–768}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spinoza |last=Della Rocca |first=Michael |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn= 0415283302 |pages=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers have associated the principle of sufficient reason with "''[[ex nihilo nihil fit]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander R. Pruss (2007) "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit: Augments new and old for the Principle of Sufficient Reason" in ''Explication Topic in Contemporary Philosophy'' Ch. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton attributes this expression to [[Cicero]]; Hamilton 1860:66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] identified the laws of inference [[modus ponens]] with the "law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent" and [[modus tollens]] with its [[contrapositive]] expression.&lt;ref&gt;From Hamilton 1860:241–242: “2°, "If the essential nature of an Hypothetical Syllogism consist in this, – that the subsumption affirms or denies one or other of the two parts of a thought, standing to each other in the relation of the thing conditioning and the thing conditioned, it will be the law of an hypothetical syllogism, that, – If the condition or antecedent be affirmed, so also must be the conditioned or consequent, and that if the conditioned or consequent be denied, so likewise must be the condition or antecedent. But this is manifestly nothing else than the law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent." &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The principle of this syllogism is thus variously enounced: ''Posita conditione, ponitur conditionatum, sublato conditionato, tlitur conditio''. Or, otherwise, ''a ratione ad rationatum, a negatione rationati ad negationem rationis, valet consequentia''. The one alternative of either rule being regulative of ''modus ponens'', the other of the ''modus tollens''. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Esser, Logik, I 91, p. 174. —ED. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; See Kant, Logik §§ 75–76 . Krug, Logik, § 82. —ED." See in particular Hamilton's discussion that leads to this quote starting at page 239ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation==

The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

*For every entity ''X'', if ''X'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''X'' exists.
*For every event ''E'', if ''E'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''E'' occurs.
*For every proposition ''P'', if ''P'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''P'' is true.

A sufficient explanation may be understood either in terms of ''reasons'' or ''causes,'' for like many philosophers of the period, Leibniz did not carefully distinguish between the two. The resulting principle is very different{{clarify|reason=needs elaboration|date=March 2016}}, however, depending on which interpretation is given.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

It is an open question whether the principle of sufficient reason can be applied to [[axiom]]s within a logic construction like a mathematical or a physical theory, because axioms are propositions accepted as having no justification possible within the system
&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix
|link=Wikipedia:Citation needed
|text=citation needed
|class=Template-Fact
|title=This claim needs references to reliable sources
}}&lt;!--{{Fact}} end--&gt;. 
The principle declares that all propositions considered to be true within a system should be [[deductive reasoning|deducible]] from the set axioms at the base of the construction (with some theoretical exceptions: see [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]]).

==Leibniz's view==
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] identified two kinds of truth, necessary and contingent truths. He believed necessary mathematical truths to be derived from the [[law of identity]] (and the [[principle of contradiction]]): "Necessary truths are those that can be demonstrated through an analysis of terms, so that in the end they become identities, just as in Algebra an equation expressing an identity ultimately results from the substitution of values [for variables]. That is, necessary truths depend upon the principle of contradiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muhit|first=Abdul|title=Leibniz on Necessary and Contingent Truths|url=http://www.banglajol.info/index.php/AFJ/article/download/12936/9300|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz states that the sufficient reason for necessary truths is that their negation is a contradiction.&lt;ref name="Principle of Sufficient Reason"/&gt;

Leibniz admitted contingent truths on the basis of [[infinitary]] reasons, to which [[God]] had access but humans did not:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In contingent truths, even though the predicate is in the subject, this can never be demonstrated, nor can a proposition ever be reduced to an equality or to an identity, but the resolution proceeds to infinity, God alone seeing, not the end of the resolution, of course, which does not exist, but the connection of the terms or the containment of the predicate in the subject, since he sees whatever is in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=G. W. Leibniz:  Philosophical Essays|year=1989|publisher=Hackett |location=Indianapolis|editors=Ariew, Roger and Daniel Garber, eds and trans}}, p. 94, ''On Freedom'' (1689?).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Without this qualification, the principle can be seen as a description of a certain notion of [[closed system]], in which there is no 'outside' to provide unexplained events with causes. It is also in tension with the paradox of [[Buridan's ass]].  Leibniz denied that the paradox of Buridan's ass could ever occur, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In consequence of this, the case also of Buridan's ass between two meadows, impelled equally towards both of them, is a fiction that cannot occur in the universe....For the universe cannot be halved by a plane drawn through the middle of the ass, which is cut vertically through its length, so that all is equal and alike on both sides.....Neither the parts of the universe nor the viscera of the animal are alike nor are they evenly placed on both sides of this vertical plane. There will therefore always be many things in the ass and outside the ass, although they be not apparent to us, which will determine him to go on one side rather than the other. And although man is free, and the ass is not, nevertheless for the same reason it must be true that in man likewise the case of a perfect equipoise between two courses is impossible. ([http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17147 ''Theodicy'', pg. 150])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leibniz also used the principle of sufficient reason to refute the idea of [[absolute space and time|absolute space]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I say then, that if space is an absolute being, there would be something for which it would be impossible there should be a sufficient reason. Which is against my axiom. And I prove it thus. Space is something absolutely uniform; and without the things placed in it, one point in space does not absolutely differ in any respect whatsoever from another point of space.  Now from hence it follows, (supposing space to be something in itself, beside the order of bodies among themselves,) that 'tis impossible that there should be a reason why God, preserving the same situation of bodies among themselves, should have placed them in space after one particular manner, and not otherwise; why everything was not placed the quite contrary way, for instance, by changing East into West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=H.G. |title=The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence |date=1956 |publisher=Barnes and Noble |location=New York, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==As a law of thought==

The principle was one of the four recognised [[laws of thought]], that held a place in European [[pedagogy]] of [[logic]] and [[reasoning]] (and, to some extent, [[philosophy]] in general) in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was influential in the thinking of [[Leo Tolstoy]], amongst others, in the elevated form that [[history]] could not be accepted as [[random]].

A sufficient reason is sometimes described as the coincidence of every single thing that is needed for the occurrence of an effect (i.e. of the so-called ''necessary conditions'').&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. T. Hobbes, ''Quaestiones de libertate et necessitate, contra Doctorem Bramhallum'', 7. Quoted in: A. Schopenhauer, [[On the Freedom of the Will]], c. 4. See also: [[John Bramhall]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such view could perhaps be also applied to indeterministic systems, as long as randomness is in a way incorporated in the preconditions.

===Hamilton's fourth law: "Infer nothing without ground or reason"===
Here is how [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]], circa 1837–1838,&lt;ref&gt;From the Preface: "The Lectures on Logic, like those on Metaphysics, were chiefly composed during, the session in which they were first delivered (1837–8)." The lectures were assembled, with added footnotes marked by "—ED." by Mansel and Veitch and published in 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his "fourth law" in his LECT. V. LOGIC. 60–61:

:"I now go on to the fourth law.

:"'''Par. XVII. Law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent''':

:"XVII. The thinking of an object, as actually characterized by positive or by negative attributes, is not left to the caprice of Understanding – the faculty of thought; but that faculty must be necessitated to this or that determinate act of thinking by a knowledge of something different from, and independent of; the process of thinking itself. This condition of our understanding is expressed by the law, as it is called, of Sufficient Reason ('''principium Rationis Sufficientis'''); but it is more properly denominated the law of Reason and Consequent ('''principium Rationis et Consecutionis'''). That knowledge by which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit something else, is called the ''logical reason ground,'' or ''antecedent''; that something else which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit, is called the ''logical consequent''; and the relation between the reason and consequent, is called the ''logical connection or consequence''. This law is expressed in the formula – Infer nothing without a ground or reason.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

:"'''Relations between Reason and Consequent''': The relations between Reason and Consequent, when comprehended in a pure thought, are the following:
:1. When a reason is explicitly or implicitly given, then there must ¶ exist a consequent; and, ''vice versa'', when a consequent is given, there must also exist a reason.

::&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; See Schulze, ''Logik'', §19, and Krug, ''Logik'', §20, – ED.&lt;ref&gt;From the index: "SCHULZE, G. E., KRUG, W. T." These are philosophers [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]] (23 August 1761 – 14 January 1833) and [[Wilhelm Traugott Krug]] (22 June 1770 – 12 January 1842).&lt;/ref&gt;

:"2. Where there is no reason there can be no consequent; and, ''vice versa'', where there is no consequent (either implicitly or explicitly) there can be no reason. That is, the concepts of reason and of consequent, as reciprocally relative, involve and suppose each other.

:"'''The logical significance of this law''': The logical significance of the law of Reason and Consequent lies in this, – That in virtue of it, thought is constituted into a series of acts all indissolubly connected; each necessarily inferring the other. Thus it is that the distinction and opposition of possible, actual and necessary matter, which has been introduced into Logic, is a doctrine wholly extraneous to this science."

==Schopenhauer's Four Forms==
{{main|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason}}
According to [[Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', there are four distinct forms of the principle.

First Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Becoming (principium rationis sufficientis fiendi); appears as the law of causality in the understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 20, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Knowing (principium rationis sufficientis cognoscendi); asserts that if a judgment is to express a piece of knowledge, it must have a sufficient ground or reason, in which case it receives the predicate true.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 29, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Being (principium rationis sufficientis essendi); the law whereby the parts of space and time determine one another as regards those relations.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 36, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Example in arithmetic: Each number presupposes the preceding numbers as grounds or reasons of its being; "I can reach ten only by going through all the preceding numbers; and only by virtue of this insight into the ground of being, do I know that where there are ten, so are there eight, six, four."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 38, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now just as the subjective correlative to the first class of representations is the understanding, that to the second the faculty of reason, and that to the third pure sensibility, so is the subjective correlative to this fourth class found to be the inner sense, or generally self-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, page 212, S 42, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fourth Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Acting (principium rationis sufficientis agendi); briefly known as the law of motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Any judgment that does not follow its previously existing ground or reason" or any state that cannot be explained away as falling under the three previous headings "must be produced by an act of will which has a motive." As his proposition in 43 states, "Motivation is causality seen from within."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed proofs of universal validity==
{{See also|Free will#Free will and views of causality|label 1=Views of causality (from the article on free will)}}
Several proofs have been prepared in order to demonstrate that the universe is at bottom causal, i.e. works in accord with the principle in question; perhaps not in every single case (randomness might still play a part here and there), but that causality must be the way it works at least ''in general'', in most of what we see; and that our minds are aware of the principle even before any experience. The two famous arguments or proofs were proposed by Immanuel Kant (from the form of Time, temporal ordering of events and "directionality" of time) and by Arthur Schopenhauer (by demonstrating how all perception depends on causality and the intellect).

Once it is agreed (e.g. from a kind of an "arrow of time") that causal interconnections, as a form of principle of sufficient reason, indeed must in general exist everywhere in the universe (at least in the large scale), ''backwards'' causality in general might then be precluded using a form of the [[paradox of free will]] (i.e. an event that has a future source might cause us to remove that source quick enough and thus causality would not work&lt;ref&gt;Likewise, announcing prophecies so that they will still be correct requires, in general, a lot of high-level research of human psychics, because sometimes they will be in accord with human determination and will be welcome, but sometimes announcing them without interference with the prophesied outcome is just impossible. The requirement of such high-level research, in every single case, seems in general to rule out the possibility of backwards causality in physics.&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''Rationes seminales''''' ([[Latin]], from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''λόγοι σπερματικοὶ'' or ''logoi spermatikoi''), translated variously as germinal or causal principles, primordial reasons, original factors, seminal reasons or virtues, or seedlike principles, is a [[theological]] theory on the origin of species. It is the doctrine that [[God]] created the world in seed form, with certain potentialities, which then developed or unfolded accordingly over time; what appears to be change is simply the realization of the preexisting potentialities. The theory is a metaphor of the growth of a plant: much like a planted seed eventually develops into a tree, so when God created the world he planted ''rationes seminales'', from which all life sprung. It is intended to reconcile the belief that God created all things, with the evident fact that new things are constantly developing.

The roots of this idea can be found within the Greek philosophy of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Neoplatonism]]
.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Helmig,''Forms and Concepts: Concept Formation in the Platonic Tradition'', Walter de Gruyter (2012), p. 194)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea was incorporated into [[Christian]] thought through the writings of authors such as  [[Athenagoras of Athens]], [[Tertullian]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Roger Bacon]], until mostly rejected in the modern period. [[Evolution]], though now it is seen to be compatible with evolution theories (cf "Man incarnate spirit" by Ramon Lucas Lucas). &lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman, ''Neoplatonism and Jewish Thought'',  SUNY Press, (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of ''rationes seminales'' was also used as an explanation for [[spontaneous generation]].

E. H. Love]], "A treatise on the mathematical theory of elasticity," Cambridge University Press, 1927. (Dover reprint {{ISBN|0-486-60174-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... the difference between the effects of two different but statically equivalent loads becomes very small at sufficiently large distances from load.}}

The original statement was published in French by Saint-Venant in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. C. B. Saint-Venant,  1855, Memoire sur la Torsion des Prismes, Mem. Divers Savants, 14, pp. 233–560.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this informal statement of the principle is well known among structural and mechanical engineers, more recent mathematical literature gives a rigorous interpretation in the context of partial differential equations. An early such interpretation was made by [[Richard von Mises|von Mises]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;R. von Mises, On Saint-Venant's Principle. Bull. AMS, 51, 555–562, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saint-Venant's principle allows elasticians to replace complicated stress distributions or weak boundary conditions with ones that are easier to solve, as long as that boundary is geometrically short. Quite analogous to the [[electrostatics]], where the [[electric field]] due to the ''i''-th moment of the load (with 0th being the net charge, 1st the [[dipole]], 2nd the [[quadrupole]]) decays as &lt;math&gt;1/r^{i+2} &lt;/math&gt;  over space, Saint-Venant's principle states that high order momentum of mechanical load (moment with order higher than [[torque]]) decays so fast that they never need to be considered for regions far from the short boundary. Therefore, the Saint-Venant's principle can be regarded as a statement on the [[asymptotic]] behavior of the [[Green's function]] by a point-load.

The '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is a [[variational method|variational]] approach to [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. This theory was introduced by [[Julian Schwinger]]. In this approach, the '''quantum action''' is an operator. Although it is superficially different from the [[path integral formulation]] where the action is a classical function, the modern formulation of
the two formalisms are identical.

Suppose we have two states defined by the values of a [[complete set of commuting operators]] at two times. Let the early and late states be &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Suppose that there is a parameter in the Lagrangian which can be varied, usually a source for a field. The main equation of '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \langle B|A\rangle = i \langle B| \delta S |A\rangle,\ &lt;/math&gt;

where the derivative is with respect to small changes in the parameter.

In the path integral formulation, the transition amplitude is represented by the sum
over all histories of &lt;math&gt;\exp(iS)&lt;/math&gt;, with appropriate [[boundary condition]]s representing the states &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;. The infinitesimal change in the amplitude is clearly given by Schwinger's formula. Conversely, starting from Schwinger's formula, it is easy to show that the fields obey canonical commutation relations and the classical equations
of motion, and so have a path integral representation. Schwinger's formulation was most significant because it could treat fermionic anticommuting fields with the same formalism as bose fields, thus implicitly introducing differentiation and integration
with respect to anti-commuting coordinates.

'''Scientific modelling''' is a scientific activity, the aim of which is to make a particular part or feature of the world easier to [[Understanding|understand]], [[Definition|define]], [[quantification (science)|quantify]], [[Visual system|visualize]], or [[Simulation|simulate]] by referencing it to existing and usually commonly accepted [[knowledge]]. It requires selecting and identifying relevant aspects of a situation in the real world and then using different types of models for different aims, such as [[conceptual model]]s to better understand, operational models to [[operational definition|operationalize]], [[mathematical model]]s to quantify, and [[graphical model]]s to visualize the subject. Modelling is an essential and inseparable part of many scientific disciplines, each of which have their own ideas about specific types of modelling.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, Nancy. 1983. ''How the Laws of Physics Lie''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian. 1983. ''Representing and Intervening. Introductory Topics in the Philosophy of Natural Science''. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an increasing attention to scientific modelling&lt;ref&gt;Frigg and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann]] (2009) state: "Philosophers are acknowledging the importance of models with increasing attention and are probing the assorted roles that models play in scientific practice". Source: Frigg, Roman and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann, Stephan]], "Models in Science", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), ([http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/models-science/ source])&lt;/ref&gt; in fields such as [[science education]], [[philosophy of science]], [[systems theory]], and [[Visualization (graphics)#Knowledge visualization|knowledge visualization]]. There is growing collection of [[Scientific method|methods]], techniques and meta-[[theory]] about all kinds of specialized scientific modelling.

== Overview ==
[[File:MathModel.svg|right]]
A scientific model seeks to represent [[empiricism|empirical]] objects, phenomena, and physical processes in a [[logic]]al and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] way. All models are ''in simulacra'', that is, simplified reflections of reality that, despite being approximations, can be extremely useful.&lt;ref&gt;Box, George E.P. &amp; Draper, N.R. (1987). [Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces.] ''Wiley''. p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; Building and disputing models is fundamental to the scientific enterprise. Complete and true representation may be impossible, but scientific debate often concerns which is the better model for a given task, e.g., which is the more accurate climate model for seasonal forecasting.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, R. ''et al.'' (2005) [http://www.ecmwf.int/staff/paco_doblas/abstr/tellus05_1.pdf, http://www.ecmwf.int/staff/paco_doblas/abstr/tellus05_1.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Tellus'' 57A:219–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to [[formal language|formalize]] the [[laws of science|principle]]s of the [[empirical science]]s use an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] to model reality, in the same way logicians [[axiomatic system|axiomatize]] the [[rule of inference|principle]]s of [[logic]]. The aim of these attempts is to construct a [[formal system]] that will not produce theoretical consequences that are contrary to what is found in [[reality]]. Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true.&lt;ref name="tcarotmimanass"&gt;[[Leo Apostel]] (1961). "Formal study of models". In: ''The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social''. Edited by [[Hans Freudenthal]]. Springer. pp. 8–9 ([https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=8083fb2EuAMC&amp;dq=The+Concept+and+the+Role+of+the+Model+in+Mathematics+and+Natural+and+Social+Sciences&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bF9aEC4e6L&amp;sig=iduhMF0ektNGV87_ZkwuY5thw0U#PPA8,M1 Source])]'',&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritchey, T.  (2012) [http://www.amg.swemorph.com/pdf/amg-1-1-2012.pdf Outline for a Morphology of Modelling Methods: Contribution to a General Theory of Modelling]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the scientist, a model is also a way in which the human thought processes can be amplified.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. West Churchman]], ''The Systems Approach'', New York: Dell publishing, 1968, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, models that are rendered in software allow scientists to leverage computational power to simulate, visualize, manipulate and gain intuition about the entity, phenomenon, or process being represented. Such computer models are ''in silico''. Other types of scientific models are ''in vivo'' (living models, such as [[laboratory rat]]s) and ''in vitro'' (in glassware, such as [[tissue culture]]).&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, E. C. (2010) [https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/emily-griffiths/whatisamodel.pdf What is a model?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basics of scientific modelling ==

===Modelling as a substitute for direct measurement and experimentation===
Models are typically used when it is either impossible or impractical to create experimental conditions in which scientists can directly measure outcomes. Direct measurement of outcomes under [[Scientific control|controlled conditions]] (see [[Scientific method]]) will always be more reliable than modelled estimates of outcomes.

Within [[Modeling and simulation|modelling and simulation]], a model is a task-driven, purposeful simplification and abstraction of a perception of reality, shaped by physical, legal, and cognitive constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, A. (2015). Learning something right from models that are wrong – Epistemology of Simulation. In Yilmaz, L. (Ed.) ''Concepts and Methodologies in Modeling and Simulation.'' Springer–Verlag. pp. 87–106&lt;/ref&gt; It is task-driven, because a model is captured with a certain question or task in mind. Simplifications leave all the known and observed entities and their relation out that are not important for the task. Abstraction aggregates information that is important, but not needed in the same detail as the object of interest. Both activities, simplification and abstraction, are done purposefully. However, they are done based on a perception of reality. This perception is already a ''model'' in itself, as it comes with a physical constraint. There are also constraints on what we are able to legally observe with our current tools and methods, and cognitive constraints which limit what we are able to explain with our current theories. This model comprises the concepts, their behavior, and their relations in formal form and is often referred to as a [[conceptual model]]. In order to execute the model, it needs to be implemented as a [[computer simulation]]. This requires more choices, such as numerical approximations or the use of heuristics.&lt;ref&gt;Oberkampf, W. L., DeLand, S. M., Rutherford, B. M., Diegert, K. V., &amp; Alvin, K. F. (2002). Error and uncertainty in modeling and simulation. ''Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety'' 75(3): 333–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all these epistemological and computational constraints, simulation has been recognized as the third pillar of scientific methods: theory building, simulation, and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Ihrig, M. (2012). A New Research Architecture For The Simulation Era. In ''European Council on Modelling and Simulation''. pp. 715–20).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simulation===
A [[simulation]] is the implementation of a model.  A steady state simulation provides information about the system at a specific instant in time (usually at equilibrium, if such a state exists).  A dynamic simulation provides information over time. A simulation brings a model to life and shows how a particular object or phenomenon will behave. Such a simulation can be useful for testing, analysis, or training in those cases where real-world systems or concepts can be represented by models.&lt;ref name="SEF"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
[[Structure]] is a fundamental and sometimes intangible notion covering the recognition, observation, nature, and stability of patterns and relationships of entities. From a child's verbal description of a snowflake, to the detailed [[scientific analysis]] of the properties of [[magnetic field]]s, the concept of structure is an essential foundation of nearly every mode of inquiry and discovery in science, philosophy, and art.&lt;ref name="Pullan000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pullan | first = Wendy | title = Structure | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-521-78258-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems===
A [[system]] is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. In general, a system is a construct or collection of different elements that together can produce results not obtainable by the elements alone.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick PA. (1995). Simulation Model Design and Execution: Building Digital Worlds. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of an 'integrated whole' can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships which are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime.  There are two types of system models: 1) discrete in which the variables change instantaneously at separate points in time and, 2) continuous where the state variables change continuously with respect to time.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, J.A., Banks, C.M.(2009). Principles of Modelling and Simulation. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generating a model===
Modelling is the process of generating a model as a conceptual representation of some phenomenon. Typically a model will deal with only some aspects of the phenomenon in question, and two models of the same phenomenon may be essentially different—that is to say, that the differences between them comprise more than just a simple renaming of components.

Such differences may be due to differing requirements of the model's end users, or to conceptual or aesthetic differences among the modellers and to contingent decisions made during the modelling process. Considerations that may influence the [[structure]] of a model might be the modeller's preference for a reduced [[ontology]], preferences regarding [[statistical model]]s versus [[Deterministic system|deterministic models]], discrete versus continuous time, etc. In any case, users of a model need to understand the assumptions made that are pertinent to its validity for a given use.

Building a model requires [[abstraction]].  Assumptions are used in modelling in order to specify the domain of application of the model. For example, the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] assumes an [[inertial frame of reference]]. This assumption was contextualized and further explained by the [[general theory of relativity]]. A model makes accurate predictions when its assumptions are valid, and might well not make accurate predictions when its assumptions do not hold. Such assumptions are often the point with which older theories are succeeded by new ones (the [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]] works in non-inertial reference frames as well).

The term "assumption" is actually broader than its standard use, etymologically speaking. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) and online Wiktionary indicate its Latin source as ''assumere'' ("accept, to take to oneself, adopt, usurp"), which is a conjunction of ''ad-'' ("to, towards, at") and ''sumere'' (to take). The root survives, with shifted meanings, in the Italian ''sumere'' and Spanish ''sumir''.  In the OED, "assume" has the senses of (i) “investing oneself with (an attribute), ” (ii) “to undertake” (especially in Law), (iii) “to take to oneself in appearance only, to pretend to possess,” and (iv) “to suppose a thing to be.” Thus, "assumption" connotes other associations than the contemporary standard sense of “that which is assumed or taken for granted; a supposition, postulate,” and deserves a broader analysis in the philosophy of science.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Evaluating a model===
{{See also|Models of scientific inquiry#Choice of a theory}}
A model is evaluated first and foremost by its consistency to empirical data; any model inconsistent with reproducible observations must be modified or rejected. One way to modify the model is by restricting the domain over which it is credited with having high validity. A case in point is Newtonian physics, which is highly useful except for the very small, the very fast, and the very massive phenomena of the universe. However, a fit to empirical data alone is not sufficient for a model to be accepted as valid.  Other factors important in evaluating a model include:{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
* Ability to explain past observations
* Ability to predict future observations
* Cost of use, especially in combination with other models
* Refutability, enabling estimation of the degree of confidence in the model
* Simplicity, or even aesthetic appeal
People may attempt to quantify the evaluation of a model using a [[utility function]].

===Visualization===
[[Visualization (computer graphics)|Visualization]] is any technique for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate a message. Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of man. Examples from history include [[cave painting]]s, [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], Greek [[geometry]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s revolutionary methods of technical drawing for engineering and scientific purposes.

===Space mapping===
[[Space mapping]] refers to a methodology that employs a "quasi-global" modeling formulation to link companion "coarse" (ideal or low-fidelity) with "fine" (practical or high-fidelity) models of different complexities. In [[engineering optimization]], space mapping aligns (maps) a very fast coarse model with its related expensive-to-compute fine model so as to avoid direct expensive optimization of the fine model. The alignment process iteratively refines a "mapped" coarse model ([[surrogate model]]).

== Applications ==
===Modelling and simulation===

One application of scientific modelling is the field of [[modelling and simulation]], generally referred to as "M&amp;S".  M&amp;S has a spectrum of applications which range from concept development and analysis, through experimentation, measurement and verification, to disposal analysis.  Projects and programs may use hundreds of different simulations, simulators and model analysis tools.

=== Model-based learning in education ===
[[File:Flowchart MBR.png|center|Flowchart Describing One Style of Model-based Learning]]

Model–based learning in education, particularly in relation to learning science involves students creating models for scientific concepts in order to:&lt;ref name=cambridgeref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lehrer|first1=Richard|last2=Schauble|first2=Leona|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Learning Sciences|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-84554-0|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gain insight of the scientific idea(s)
* Acquire deeper understanding of the subject through visualization of the model
* Improve student engagement in the course

Different types of model based learning techniques include:&lt;ref name=cambridgeref /&gt;
* Physical macrocosms
* Representational systems
* Syntactic models
* Emergent models

Model–making in education is an iterative exercise with students refining, developing and evaluating their models over time. This shifts learning from the rigidity and monotony of traditional curriculum to an exercise of students' creativity and curiosity. This approach utilizes the constructive strategy of social collaboration and learning scaffold theory. Model based learning includes cognitive reasoning skills where existing models can be improved upon by construction of newer models using the old models as a basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J|title=The Cognitive Basis of Science|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-01177-9|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Model–based learning entails determining target models and a learning pathway that provide realistic chances of understanding." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clement|first1=JJ|last2=Rea-Ramirez|first2=Mary Anne|title=Model Based Learning and Instruction in Science|date=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-6493-7|page=45|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model making can also incorporate [[blended learning]] strategies by using web based tools and simulators, thereby allowing students to:
* Familiarize themselves with on-line or digital resources
* Create different models with various virtual materials at little or no cost
* Practice model making activity any time and any place
* Refine existing models

"A well-designed simulation simplifies a real world system while heightening awareness of the complexity of the system. Students can participate in the simplified system and learn how the real system operates without spending days, weeks or years it would take to undergo this experience in the real world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blumschein|first1=Patrick|last2=Hung|first2=Woei|last3=Jonassen|first3=David|last4=Strobel|first4=Johannes|title=Model-Based Approaches to Learning|date=2009|publisher=Sense Publishers|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-90-8790-711-2|url=https://www.sensepublishers.com/media/659-model-based-approaches-to-learning.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teacher's role in the overall teaching and learning process is primarily that of a [[facilitator]] and arranger of the learning experience. He or she would assign the students, a model making activity for a particular concept and provide relevant information or support for the activity. For virtual model making activities, the teacher can also provide information on the usage of the digital tool and render troubleshooting support in case of glitches while using the same. The teacher can also arrange the group discussion activity between the students and provide the platform necessary for students to share their observations and knowledge extracted from the model making activity.

Model–based learning evaluation could include the use of [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]] that assess the ingenuity and creativity of the student in the model construction and also the overall classroom participation of the student vis-a-vis the knowledge constructed through the activity.

It is important, however, to give due consideration to the following for successful model–based learning to occur:
* Use of the right tool at the right time for a particular concept
* Provision within the educational setup for model–making activity: e.g., computer room with internet facility or software installed to access simulator or digital tool

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11668">'''Signed zero''' is [[zero]] with an associated [[Plus and minus signs|sign]]. In ordinary arithmetic, the number 0 does not have a sign, so that −0, +0 and 0 are identical. However, in [[computing]], some number representations allow for the existence of two zeros, often denoted by '''−0''' ('''negative zero''') and '''+0''' ('''positive zero'''), regarded as equal by the numerical comparison operations but with possible different behaviors in particular operations. This occurs in the ''sign and magnitude'' and ''ones' complement'' [[signed number representation]]s for integers, and in most [[floating-point number]] representations. The number 0 is usually encoded as +0, but can be represented by either +0 or −0.

The [[IEEE 754]] standard for floating-point arithmetic (presently used by most computers and programming languages that support floating point numbers) requires both +0 and −0. Real arithmetic with signed zeros can be considered a variant of the [[extended real number line]] such that 1/−0 = −[[infinity|∞]] and 1/+0 = +∞; [[Division (mathematics)|division]] is only [[Indeterminate form|undefined]] for [[Plus-minus sign|±]]0/±0 and ±∞/±∞.

Negatively signed zero echoes the [[mathematical analysis]] concept of approaching 0 from below as a [[one-sided limit]], which may be denoted by ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0−, or ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;↑0.  The notation "−0" may be used informally to denote a small negative number that has been [[rounding|rounded]] to zero.  The concept of negative zero also has some theoretical applications in [[statistical mechanics]] and other disciplines.

It is claimed that the inclusion of signed zero in IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 makes it much easier to achieve numerical accuracy in some critical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], "Branch Cuts for Complex Elementary Functions, or Much Ado About Nothing's Sign Bit", in [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=59678 ''The State of the Art in Numerical Analysis''] (eds. Iserles and Powell), Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular when computing with [[complex number|complex]] elementary functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Math185/Derivative.pdf Derivatives in the Complex z-plane], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the concept of signed zero runs contrary to the general assumption made in most mathematical fields that negative zero is the same thing as zero.  Representations that allow negative zero can be a source of errors in programs, if software developers do not take into account that while the two zero representations behave as equal under numeric comparisons, they yield different results in some operations.

==Representations==
The widely used [[two's complement]] encoding does not allow a negative zero.  In a 1+7-bit [[signed magnitude|sign-and-magnitude]] representation for integers, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1000|0000}}. In an 8-bit [[one's complement]] representation, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1111|1111}}. In all three encodings, positive zero is represented by {{gaps|0000|0000}}.

[[Image:IEEE 754 Single Negative Zero.svg|thumb|right|400px|Negative zero by IEEE 754 representation in [[binary32]] ]]
In [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE 754]] binary floating point numbers, zero values are represented by the biased exponent and [[significand]] both being zero. Negative zero has the sign bit set to one.  One may obtain negative zero as the result of certain computations, for instance as the result of [[arithmetic underflow]] on a negative number, or &lt;code&gt;−1.0×0.0&lt;/code&gt;, or simply as &lt;code&gt;−0.0&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE 754]] decimal floating point encoding, a negative zero is represented by an exponent being any valid exponent in the range for the encoding, the true significand being zero, and the sign bit being one.

==Properties and handling==
The IEEE 754 floating point standard specifies the behavior of positive zero and negative zero under various operations.  The outcome may depend on the current [[floating point#Rounding modes|IEEE rounding mode]] settings.

===Notation===
In systems that include both signed and unsigned zeros, the notation &lt;math&gt;0^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0^-&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used for signed zeros.

===Arithmetic===
Addition and multiplication are commutative, but there are some special rules that have to be followed, which mean the usual mathematical rules for algebraic simplification may not apply. The &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; sign below shows the signed result of the operations.

The usual rule for signs is always followed when multiplying or dividing:

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{ \left| x \right| } = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) \cdot (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

There are special rules for adding or subtracting signed zero:

* &lt;math&gt;x + (\pm 0) = x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) + (-0) = (-0) - (+0) = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(+0) + (+0) = (+0) - (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x - x = x + (-x) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for any finite &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, −0 when rounding toward negative)

Because of negative zero (and also when the rounding mode is upward or downward), the expressions {{nowrap|−(''x'' − ''y'')}} and {{nowrap|(−''x'') − (−''y'')}}, for floating-point variables ''x'' and ''y'', cannot be replaced by {{nowrap|''y'' − ''x''}}. However {{nowrap|(−0) + ''x''}} can be replaced by ''x'' with rounding to nearest (except when ''x'' can be a [[NaN#Signaling NaN|signaling NaN]]).

Some other special rules:

* &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-0} = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daops.html#refsqrt|title=Decimal Arithmetic: Arithmetic operations{{snd}}square-root|first=Mike|last=Cowlishaw|authorlink=Mike Cowlishaw|date=7 April 2009|publisher=speleotrove.com ([[IBM Corporation]])|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{-\infty} = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left|x\right|}{-0} = -\infty\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (for non-zero &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;{\pm 0} \times {\pm \infty} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ([[Not a Number]] or interrupt for [[indeterminate form]])
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pm 0}{\pm 0} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Division of a non-zero number by zero sets the divide by zero [[flag (computing)|flag]], and an operation producing a NaN sets the invalid operation flag. An [[exception handling|exception handler]] is called if enabled for the corresponding flag.

===Comparisons===
According to the IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 standard, negative zero and positive zero should compare as equal with the usual (numerical) comparison operators, like the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operators of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java programming language|Java]].  In those languages, special programming tricks may be needed to distinguish the two values:

* [[Type punning]] the number to an integer type, so as to look at the sign bit in the bit pattern;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;copysign()&lt;/code&gt; function (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 copySign operation) to copy the sign of the zero to some non-zero number;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;signbit()&lt;/code&gt; macro (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 isSignMinus operation) that returns whether the sign bit of a number is set;
* taking the reciprocal of the zero to obtain either 1/(+0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+∞ or 1/(−0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−∞ (if the [[division by zero]] exception is not trapped).

Note: [[Cast (computer programming)|Casting]] to integral type will not always work, especially on two's complement systems.

However, some programming languages may provide alternative comparison operators that do distinguish the two zeros. This is the case, for example, of the &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; method in Java's &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; wrapper class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29 http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals(java.lang.Object)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific uses==
Informally, one may use the notation "−0" for a negative value that was rounded to zero.  This notation may be useful when a negative sign is significant; for example, when tabulating [[Celsius]] temperatures, where a negative sign means ''below freezing''.

In statistical mechanics, one sometimes uses [[negative temperature]]s to describe systems with [[population inversion]], which can be considered to have a temperature greater than positive infinity, because the coefficient of energy in the population distribution function is &amp;minus;1/Temperature. In this context, a temperature of &amp;minus;0 is a (theoretical) temperature larger than any other negative temperature, corresponding to the (theoretical) maximum conceivable extent of population inversion, the opposite extreme to +0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Charles Kittel|Kittel, Charles]] and [[Herbert Kroemer]] | title=Thermal Physics (2nd ed.) | publisher=W. H. Freeman Company | year=1980 | isbn=0-7167-1088-9|page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Selfref|Regarding the use–mention distinction when writing Wikipedia articles, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Text formatting|Words as words}} and {{section link|Wikipedia:Writing better articles|Use of "refers to"}}.}}

The '''use–mention distinction''' is a [[foundational]] concept of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler (2005) p. 568&lt;/ref&gt; according to which it is necessary to make a [[Dichotomy|distinction]] between {{em|using}} a word (or phrase) and {{em|mentioning}} it,&lt;ref name="Devitt99"&gt;Devitt and Sterelny (1999) pp. 40–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suine40p24"&gt;[[W.V. Quine]] (1940) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and many philosophical works have been "vitiated by a failure to distinguish use and mention".&lt;ref name="Devitt99"/&gt; The distinction is disputed by non-analytic philosophers.&lt;ref name="Derrida77p79"/&gt;

The distinction between use and mention can be illustrated for the word ''cheese'':&lt;ref name="Devitt99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suine40p24"/&gt;
* ''Use'': Cheese is derived from milk.
* ''Mention'': 'Cheese' is derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''ċēse''.

The first sentence is a statement about the substance called "cheese"; it &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; the word 'cheese' to refer to that substance. The second is a statement about the word 'cheese' as a [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]]; it &lt;em&gt;mentions&lt;/em&gt; the word without &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; it to refer to anything other than itself.

== Grammar ==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}

In written language, '''mentioned''' words or phrases often appear between [[quotation mark]]s (as in {{" '}}Chicago' contains three vowels") or in [[italics]] (as in "When I say ''honey'', I mean the sweet stuff that bees make"), and style authorities such as ''[[Strunk and White]]'' insist that mentioned words or phrases must always be made visually distinct in this manner. '''Used''' words or phrases (much more common than mentioned ones) do not bear any typographic distinction. In spoken language, or in absence of the use of stylistic cues such as quotation marks or italics in written language, the audience must identify mentioned words or phrases through semantic and pragmatic cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Shomir|title=A Computational Theory of the Use-Mention Distinction in Natural Language|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/11694|publisher=Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Maryland|accessdate=16 February 2013|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If quotation marks are used, it is sometimes the practice to distinguish between the quotation marks used for speech and those used for mentioned words, with double quotes in one place and single in the other:
* When Larry said, "That has three letters," he was referring to the word 'bee'.
* With reference to 'bumbershoot', Peter explained that "The term refers to an umbrella."

A few authorities recommend against such a distinction, and prefer one style of quotation mark to be used for both purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Butcher's Copy-Editing: the Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Copy-editors and Proofreaders.'' 4th edition, by Judith Butcher, Caroline Drake and Maureen Leach. Cambridge University Press, 2006. Butcher's recommends against the practice, but ''The Chicago Manual of Style'', section 7.58 (15th edition, 2003), indicates that "philosophers" use single quotes for a practice akin to the use/mention distinction, though it is not explained in this way.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In philosophy ==
The general phenomenon of a term's having different [[references]] in different contexts was called ''[[Supposition Theory|suppositio]]'' (substitution)  by medieval logicians.&lt;ref&gt;See Read, Stephen (2006). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-terms Medieval Theories: Properties of Terms]. In [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; It describes how one has to substitute a term in a sentence based on its meaning—that is, based on the term's referent. In general, a term can be used in several ways. For nouns, they are:
* Properly with a ''[[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] and real referent'': "That is my ''pig''" (assuming it exists). (personal supposition)
* Properly with a ''concrete but unreal referent'': "Santa Claus's pig is very big." (also personal supposition)
* Properly with a ''generic referent'': "Any ''pig'' breathes air." (simple supposition)
* Improperly by way of ''metaphor'': "Your grandfather is a ''pig''". (improper supposition)
* As a ''pure term'': "''Pig'' has only three letters". (material supposition)

The last sentence contains a mention example.

The use–mention distinction is especially important in [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quotation|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quotation/#2.2|date=16 July 2005|accessdate=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to properly distinguish use from mention can produce false, misleading, or [[meaningless statement]]s or [[category error]]s. For example, the following correctly distinguish between use and mention:
* "Copper" contains six letters, and is not a metal.
* Copper is a metal, and contains no letters.

The first sentence, a mention example, is a statement about the word "copper" and not the chemical element. Notably, the word is composed of six letters, but not any kind of metal or other tangible thing.  The second sentence, a use example, is a statement about the chemical element copper and not the word itself. Notably, the element is composed of 29 electrons and protons and a number of neutrons, but not any letters.

[[Stanisław Leśniewski]] was perhaps the first to make widespread use of this distinction and the [[fallacy]] that arises from overlooking it, seeing it all around in analytic philosophy of the time, for example in Russell and Whitehead's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simons|first=Peter|title=[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], 2nd edition|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Gale|isbn=0-02-866072-2|edition=e-book|authorlink=Peter Simons (academic)|editor=Borchert, Donald M|page=292|chapter=Leśniewski, Stanisław}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the logical level, a use–mention mistake occurs when two heterogeneous levels of meaning or context are confused inadvertently.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

{{anchor|both use and mention}}
[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] told that in his student years, "quotation was usually introduced as a somewhat shady device, and the introduction was accompanied by a stern sermon on the sin of confusing the use and mention of expressions". He presented a class of sentences like
{{quote|Quine said that "quotation has a certain anomalous feature."}}
which both use the meaning of the quoted words to complete the sentence, and mention them as they are attributed to [[W. V. Quine]], to argue against his teachers' hard distinction. His claim was that quotations could not be analyzed as simple expressions that mention their content by means of [[proper name|naming]] it or [[definite description|describing]] its parts, as sentences like the above would lose their exact, twofold meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF00126690| issn = 0040-5833| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 27–40| last = Davidson| first = Donald| title = Quotation| journal = Theory and Decision| accessdate = 8 December 2010| date = March 1979| url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/v234l47038554624/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-reference|Self-referential]] statements mention themselves or their components, often producing logical [[paradox]]es, such as [[Quine's paradox]]. A mathematical analogy of self-referential statements lies at the core of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] ([[diagonal lemma]]). There are many examples of self-reference and use–mention distinction in the works of [[Douglas Hofstadter]], who makes the distinction thus:

{{quote|When a word is used to ''refer'' to something, it is said to be being ''used''. When a word is ''quoted'', though, so that someone is examining it for its surface aspects (typographical, phonetic, etc.), it is said to be being ''mentioned''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Metamagical Themas |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas R. |year=1985 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the standard notation for mentioning a term in philosophy and logic is to put the term in quotation marks, issues arise when the mention is itself of a mention. Notating using italics might require a potentially infinite number of typefaces, while putting quotation marks within quotation marks may lead to ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Logic, Logic, and Logic |last=Boolos |first=George |authorlink=George Boolos |year=1999 |page=398 |quote=In this 1995 paper, Boolos discussed ambiguities in using quotation marks as part of a [[formal language]], and proposed a way of distinguishing levels of mentioning using a finite number of marks, using "′" to modify the succeeding "°", as in:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;According to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. Quine]],&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;Whose views on quotation are fine,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;°Boston° names Boston,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;and ′°°Boston°′° names °Boston°, &lt;!-- sic; for more explanation, you must read the paper --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;But 9 doesn't designate 9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analytic philosophers have said the distinction "may seem rather pedantic".&lt;ref name="Devitt99" /&gt;

In a 1977 response to analytic philosopher [[John Searle]], [[Jacques Derrida]] mentioned the distinction as "rather laborious and problematical".&lt;ref name="Derrida77p79"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ANhg9zaAtIC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Derrida |year=1977 |p=79 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''−1''' is the [[additive inverse]] of [[1 (number)|1]], that is, the number that when [[addition|added]] to 1 gives the additive identity element, 0. It is the [[negative number|negative]] [[integer]] greater than negative two (−2) and less than&amp;nbsp;[[0 (number)|0]].

Negative one bears relation to [[Euler's identity]] since ''e''{{sup|''i''{{pi}}}} = −1.

In [[software development]], '''−1''' is a common initial value for integers and is also used to show that [[Sentinel value|a variable contains no useful information]].

In [[programming languages]], '''−1''' can be used to [[array slicing|index]] the last (or 2nd last) item of an [[array data structure|array]], depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.

'''Negative one''' has some similar but slightly different properties to positive one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xrh89dLWZqEC Mathematical analysis and applications]

== Algebraic properties ==
Multiplying a number by −1 is equivalent to changing the sign on the number. This can be proved using the [[distributive law]] and the axiom that 1 is the multiplicative identity: for ''x'' [[real number|real]], we have

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=1\cdot x+(-1)\cdot x=(1+(-1))\cdot x=0 \cdot x=0&lt;/math&gt;

where we used the fact that any real ''x'' times 0 equals 0, implied by [[cancellation property|cancellation]] from the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0\cdot x=(0+0)\cdot x=0\cdot x+0\cdot x \, &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:ImaginaryUnit5.svg|thumb|right|0, 1, −1, '''''[[imaginary unit|i]]''''', and −'''''i''''' in the [[complex plane|complex]] or [[cartesian plane]]]]

In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

so (−1)&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x'', or&amp;nbsp;−''x'', is the arithmetic inverse of ''x''.

=== Square of −1 ===
The [[square (algebra)|square]] of −1, i.e. −1 multiplied by −1, equals 1. As a consequence, a product of two negative real numbers is positive.

For an algebraic proof of this result, start with the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot 0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]&lt;/math&gt;

The first equality follows from the above result. The second follows from the definition of −1 as additive inverse of 1: it is precisely that number that when added to 1 gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]=-1\cdot1+(-1)\cdot(-1)=-1+(-1)\cdot(-1)&lt;/math&gt;

The second equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation implies

:&lt;math&gt;(-1) \cdot (-1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The above arguments hold in any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], a concept of [[abstract algebra]] generalizing integers and real numbers.

=== Square roots of −1 ===
Although there are no [[Real number| real]] square roots of -1, the [[complex number]] ''[[Imaginary unit|i]]'' satisfies ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1, and as such can be considered as a [[square root]] of −1. The only other complex number who's square is 1 is −''i''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58251.html |title=Ask Dr. Math |publisher=Math Forum |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the algebra of [[quaternion]]s, which contain the complex plane, [[Quaternion#Square roots of −1|the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1 has infinite solutions]].

== Exponentiation to negative integers ==
[[Exponentiation]] of a non-zero real number can be extended to [[Exponentiation#Negative integer exponents|negative integers]]. We make the definition that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = {{sfrac|1|''x''}}, meaning that we define raising a number to the power −1 to have the same effect as taking its [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]]. This definition is then extended to negative integers preserves the exponential law ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''a'' + ''b'')&lt;/sup&gt; for real numbers ''a'' and ''b''.

Exponentiation to negative integers can be extended to invertible elements of a ring, by defining  ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as the multiplicative inverse of ''x''.

−1 that appears next to functions or matrices does not mean raising them to the power −1 but their [[inverse functions]] or [[inverse matrices]]. For example, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is the inverse of ''f''(''x''), or sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is a notation of [[arcsine]] function.

== Computer representation ==
{{Main|Signed number representations}}
Most computer systems represent negative integers using [[two's complement]]. In such systems, −1 is represented using a bit pattern of all ones. For example, an 8-bit signed integer using two's complement would represent −1 as the bitstring "11111111", or "FF" in [[hexadecimal]] (base 16). If interpreted as an unsigned integer, the same bitstring of ''n'' ones represents 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, the largest possible value that ''n'' bits can hold. For example, the 8-bit string "11111111" above represents 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;255.

== Programming languages ==
In some programming languages, when used to [[array slicing|index some data types]] (such as an [[array data structure|array]]), then -1 can be used to identify the very last (or 2nd last) item, depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.
If the first item is indexed by 0, then -1 identifies the last item.
If the first item is indexed by 1, then -1 identifies the second-to-last item.
