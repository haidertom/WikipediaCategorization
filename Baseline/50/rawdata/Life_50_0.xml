'''Ahab''' (Dr. '''Roderick "Rory" Campbell''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Dr. Roderick Campbell made his live action debut as the main antagonist of the first season of [[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|''The Gifted'']] television series portrayed by [[Garret Dillahunt]]. This version of the character was shown as the head researcher of Trask Industries.

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
Based upon [[Herman Melville]]'s [[Captain Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} but also named after [[Stan Lee]]'s childhood friend Rory Campbell from Portland, Oregon,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Ahab is a [[cyborg]]. Ahab's first appearance was a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four Annual]]'' #23, as part of the "[[Days of Future Present]]" storyline.

==Fictional character biography==
In his future timeline, Ahab was the master of the [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], [[mind control]]led [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] who hunted down other mutants for Ahab and his masters, the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]. One of the Hounds, [[Rachel Summers]], escaped from him and eventually [[time travel]]led to the present. Ahab followed her to the past and was defeated by the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the [[New Mutants]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] during the "[[Days of Future Present]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]].&lt;ref&gt;Fantastic Four Annual #23, X-Factor Annual #5, New Mutants Annual #6, Uncanny X-Men Annual #14&lt;/ref&gt;

Later issues of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' revealed that scientist Rory Campbell was the man who would become Ahab in the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' Vol 1 #75&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell learned of this in the present and tried to prevent this fate, but he was eventually merged with his future self.{{issue|date=October 2014}} The merged Ahab joined the [[Four Horsemen of Apocalypse (comics)|Four Horsemen]] of the immortal supervillain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], taking up the position of "Famine" within that group.{{issue|date=October 2014}} He aided in the capture of several of [[Apocalypse (comics)#The Twelve|The Twelve]],{{issue|date=October 2014}} before being sent into an alternate dimension by [[Mikhail Rasputin]].{{issue|date=October 2014}}

In the not too distant future, he captured then killed [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] (who is immortal).{{issue|date=October 2014}} He worked beside an armored figure, with light coming from his left eye. Due to time travel, it is not known at what point in Ahab's life this was.&lt;ref&gt;''Cable'' #71&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahab joined the Red Skull as one of his [[S-Men]] to fulfill his role during World War Hate.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' #23&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Ahab was present when Magneto killed the S-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' #25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Ahab can generate powerful energy harpoons that are formed from, and attached to, his own life force. Anyone who attempts to grab a harpoon gets burned. Each harpoon is keyed to its target's genetic structure, and cannot be moved or deflected by energy; it only stops when it strikes its target, or a close blood relative thereof. A hit from one of these harpoons can kill or seriously injure the target. A person who survives finds their neural pathways burned out and unable to move.

Ahab is a cyborg. His limbs are mostly of artificial construction and presumably this makes him superhumanly strong. So far he has found no need to engage in hand-to-hand combat due to his ability to use ranged attacks, his Hounds, and giant androids. He is largely immune to telepathic intrusion and attack, even from telepaths as powerful as [[Rachel Summers]]. Ahab's technology allows him to track, clothe and control [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]].

As Famine, Ahab drains his victims' lifeforce resulting in emaciation and worse.

'''Astrobiology''' is an interdisciplinary scientific field concerned with the [[abiogenesis|origins]], [[Protocell|early evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]]. Astrobiology considers the question of whether [[extraterrestrial life]] exists, and how humans can detect it if it does.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about-astrobiology/ |title=About Astrobiology |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=21 January 2008 |work=NASA Astrobiology Institute |publisher=NASA | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081011192341/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about-astrobiology/| archivedate= 11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''exobiology''' is similar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exobiology Mirriam Webster Dictionary entry "Exobiology"] (accessed 11 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrobiology makes use of [[molecular biology]], [[biophysics]], [[biochemistry]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], [[physical cosmology]], [[exoplanetology]] and [[geology]] to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize [[biosphere]]s that might be different from that on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life and death of planet Earth |last1=Ward |first1=P.

The term was first proposed by the Russian ([[Soviet]]) astronomer [[Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov|Gavriil Tikhov]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cockell |first=Charles S. |title='Astrobiology' and the ethics of new science |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Cockell/publication/42790151_%27Astrobiology%27_and_the_ethics_of_new_science/links/0a85e530540978d399000000/Astrobiology-and-the-ethics-of-new-science.pdf |format=PDF |date=2001 |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews  |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=90–96 |doi=10.1179/0308018012772533}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Astrobiology'' is etymologically derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄστρον}}, ''astron'', "constellation, star"; {{lang|grc|βίος}}, ''bios'', "life"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', ''study''. The synonyms of astrobiology are diverse; however, the synonyms were structured in relation to the most important sciences implied in its development: [[astronomy]] and [[biology]]. A close synonym is ''exobiology'' from the Greek {{lang|grc|Έξω}}, "external"; Βίος, ''bios'', "life"; and λογία, -logia, ''study''. The term exobiology was coined by molecular biologist and Nobel Prize winner [[Joshua Lederberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/BB/p-nid/32 Launching a New Science: Exobiology and the Exploration of Space] ''The National Library of Medicine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Exobiology is considered to have a narrow scope limited to search of life external to Earth, whereas subject area of astrobiology is wider and investigates the link between life and the [[universe]], which includes the search for extraterrestrial life, but also includes the study of life on Earth, its origin, evolution and limits.

Another term used in the past is [[xenobiology]], ("biology of the foreigners") a word used in 1954 by science fiction writer [[Robert Heinlein]] in his work ''[[The Star Beast]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinlein R, Harold W|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Xenobiology |journal=Science |date=21 July 1961 |pages=223, 225 | doi=10.1126/science.134.3473.223 |jstor=1708323 |volume=134 |issue=3473|bibcode = 1961Sci...134..223H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term xenobiology is now used in a more specialized sense, to mean "biology based on foreign chemistry", whether of extraterrestrial or terrestrial (possibly synthetic) origin. Since alternate chemistry analogs to some life-processes have been created in the laboratory, xenobiology is now considered as an extant subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Markus Schmidt | title=Xenobiology: A new form of life as the ultimate biosafety tool | journal=BioEssays | date=9 March 2010 | pages=322–331 | doi=10.1002/bies.200900147 | volume=32 | issue=4 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.200900147/abstract | pmid=20217844 | pmc=2909387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is an emerging and developing field, the question of whether [[life]] exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of [[science|scientific]] inquiry.&lt;ref name="NAT-20170216"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Livio |first=Mario |title=Winston Churchill's essay on alien life found |url=http://www.nature.com/news/winston-churchill-s-essay-on-alien-life-found-1.21467 |date=15 February 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=542 |issue=7641 |pages=289–291 |doi=10.1038/542289a |accessdate=18 February 2017 |bibcode = 2017Natur.542..289L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170215"&gt;{{cite news |last=De Freytas-Tamura |first=Kimiko |title=Winston Churchill Wrote of Alien Life in a Lost Essay |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/world/europe/winston-churchill-aliens.html |date=15 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=18 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though once considered outside the mainstream of scientific inquiry, astrobiology has become a formalized field of study. Planetary scientist [[David Grinspoon]] calls astrobiology a field of natural philosophy, grounding speculation on the unknown, in known scientific theory.&lt;ref&gt;Grinspoon 2004&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's interest in exobiology first began with the development of the U.S. Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded an Exobiology Program, which is now one of four main elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Living Universe: NASA and the Development of Astrobiology |author1=Steven J.

NASA's [[Viking program|Viking missions]] to Mars, launched in 1976, included [[Viking biological experiments|three biology experiments]] designed to look for [[metabolism]] of present [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]].

Advancements in the fields of astrobiology, observational astronomy and discovery of large varieties of [[extremophile]]s with extraordinary capability to thrive in the harshest environments on Earth, have led to speculation that life may possibly be thriving on many of the extraterrestrial bodies in the universe. A particular focus of current astrobiology research is the search for [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]] due to this planet's proximity to Earth and geological history. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that Mars has previously had a considerable amount of [[Water on Mars|water on its surface]],&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=T. |date=2000 |title=Argyre Planitia and the Mars Global Hydrologic Cycle |volume=XXXI |bibcode=2000LPI....31.2033P |journal=Lunar and Planetary Science |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2000/pdf/2033.pdf |format=PDF |last2=Clifford |first2=S.

Missions specifically designed to search for current life on Mars were the [[Viking program]] and [[Beagle 2]] probes. The Viking results were inconclusive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Viking Biological Investigation: Preliminary Results |journal=Science |date=1 October 1976 |vauthors=Klein HP, Levin GV|lastauthoramp=yes |volume=194 |issue=4260 |pages=99–105 |doi=10.1126/science.194.4260.99 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/194/4260/99 |accessdate=15 August 2008 |pmid=17793090 |bibcode = 1976Sci...194...99K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Beagle 2 failed minutes after landing.&lt;ref name="BBC News 16 Jan 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |title=Lost Beagle2 probe found 'intact' on Mars |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-30784886|date=16 January 2015 |work=[[BBC]] |accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A future mission with a strong astrobiology role would have been the [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]], designed to study the frozen moons of Jupiter—some of which may have liquid water—had it not been cancelled. In late 2008, the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix lander]] probed the environment for past and present [[planetary habitability]] of [[microbe|microbial]] [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]], and researched the history of water there.

The [[European Space Agency]]'s astrobiology roadmap from 2016, identified five main research topics, and specifies several key scientific objectives for each topic. The five research topics are:&lt;ref name='ESA AstRoMap 2016'&gt;[https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/ast.2015.1441 AstRoMap European Astrobiology Roadmap].

In November 2011, NASA launched the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission carrying the [[Curiosity rover|''Curiosity'']] rover, which [[Curiosity rover#Landing|landed]] on Mars at [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name="Gale Crater"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webster |first1=Guy |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |title=NASA's Next Mars Rover To Land At Gale Crater |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[NASA JPL]] |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-222#1 |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale Crater2"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Chow |first1=Dennis |title=NASA's Next Mars Rover to Land at Huge Gale Crater |url=http://www.space.com/12394-nasa-mars-rover-landing-site-unveiled.html |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale Crater3"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |title=Mars rover aims for deep crater |date=22 July 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14249524 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate = 22 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722170810/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14249524| archivedate= 22 July 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Curiosity'' rover is currently probing the environment for past and present [[planetary habitability]] of [[microbe|microbial]] [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]].

==Methodology==

=== Planetary habitability ===
{{Main|Planetary habitability}}

When looking for life on other planets like Earth, some simplifying assumptions are useful to reduce the size of the task of the astrobiologist. One is the informed assumption that the vast majority of life forms in our galaxy are based on [[Carbon-based life|carbon chemistries]], as are all life forms on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: An Interview With Dr. Farid Salama |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2000 |work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620075201/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |archivedate=20 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon is well known for the unusually wide variety of [[molecule]]s that can be formed around it. Carbon is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element]] in the universe and the energy required to make or break a bond is at just the appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of extremely long and [[organic compound|complex molecules]].

The presence of liquid water is an assumed requirement, as it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules that could eventually lead to the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/astrobiology-spsc-04/ |title=Astrobiology |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2006 |publisher=Macmillan Science Library: Space Sciences. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers posit environments of water-[[ammonia]] mixtures as possible solvents for [[hypothetical types of biochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article2057.html |title=The Ammonia-Oxidizing Gene |accessdate=20 October 2008 |author=Penn State |date=19 August 2006 |publisher=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third assumption is to focus on planets orbiting [[Sun]]-like [[star]]s for increased probabilities of [[planetary habitability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |title=Stars and Habitable Planets |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2007 |publisher=Sol Company |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001194624/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |archivedate=1 October 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life might not have time to emerge on [[planet]]s orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be [[Tidal lock|tidally "locked"]] to the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/display/?id=223364&amp;source=r |title=M Dwarfs: The Search for Life is On |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=29 August 2005 |publisher=Red Orbit &amp; [[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The long lifetimes of [[red dwarf]]s could allow the development of habitable environments on planets with thick atmospheres. This is significant, as red dwarfs are extremely common. (See [[Habitability of red dwarf systems]]).

Since Earth is the only planet known to harbor [[life]], there is no evident way to know if any of these simplifying assumptions are correct.

===Communication attempts===
{{Main|Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence}}
[[File:Pioneer10-plaque tilt.jpg|right|thumb|The illustration on the [[Pioneer plaque]] ]]
Research on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence ([[Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence|CETI]]) focuses on composing and deciphering messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. Communication attempts by humans have included broadcasting mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the [[Arecibo message]] and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering 'natural' language communication. The [[SETI]] program, for example, uses both [[radio telescope]]s and [[optical telescope]]s to search for deliberate signals from an  [[extraterrestrial intelligence]].

While some high-profile scientists, such as [[Carl Sagan]], have advocated the transmission of messages,&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl. Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence. MIT Press, 1973, 428 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/you-never-get-a-seventh-chance-to-make-a-first-impression-an-awkward-history-of-our-space-transmissions/| title=You Never Get a Seventh Chance to Make a First Impression: An Awkward History of Our Space Transmissions| work=Lightspeed Magazine| accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientist [[Stephen Hawking]] warned against it, suggesting that aliens might simply raid Earth for its resources and then move on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/25/stephen-hawking-aliens_n_551035.html|title=Stephen Hawking: Humans Should Fear Aliens|date=2010-06-25|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elements of astrobiology===

==== Astronomy ====
{{Main|Astronomy}}
[[Image:OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb planet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Artist's impression of the [[extrasolar planet]] [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] orbiting its star 20,000 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]]; this planet was discovered with [[gravitational microlensing]].]]
[[Image:Telescope Kepler-NASA.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The [[NASA]] [[Kepler mission]], launched in March 2009, searches for [[extrasolar planets]].]]
Most astronomy-related astrobiology research falls into the category of [[extrasolar planet]] (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, then it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably [[NASA]]'s [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF) and [[European Space Agency|ESA's]] [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]] programs, both of which have been cancelled. NASA launched the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'' mission]] in March 2009, and the [[French Space Agency]] launched the [[COROT]] space mission in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/ |title=Kepler Mission |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2008 |publisher=NASA | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081031070350/http://kepler.nasa.gov/| archivedate= 31 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/ |title=The COROT space telescope |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=17 October 2008 |publisher=CNES |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108130307/http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/ |archivedate=8 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway.

The goal of these missions is not only to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]]. By examining planetary spectra, it would be possible to determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vpl.astro.washington.edu/main/about_vpl.html |title=The Virtual Planet Laboratory |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2008 |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.

An estimate for the number of planets with intelligent ''communicative'' [[extraterrestrial life]] can be gleaned from the [[Drake equation]], essentially an equation expressing the probability of intelligent life as the product of factors such as the fraction of planets that might be habitable and the fraction of planets on which life might arise:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setileague.org/general/drake.htm |title=What is the Drake Equation? |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Ford |first=Steve |date=August 1995 |publisher=SETI League | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081029212425/http://www.setileague.org/general/drake.htm| archivedate= 29 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N = R^{*} ~ \times ~ f_{p} ~ \times ~ n_{e} ~ \times ~ f_{l} ~ \times ~ f_{i} ~ \times ~ f_{c} ~ \times ~ L&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* '''''N''''' = The number of communicative civilizations
* '''''R*''''' = The rate of formation of suitable stars (stars such as our Sun)
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of those stars with planets (current evidence indicates that planetary systems may be common for stars like the Sun)
* '''''n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The number of Earth-sized worlds per planetary system
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of those Earth-sized planets where life actually develops
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of life sites where intelligence develops
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of communicative planets (those on which electromagnetic communications technology develops)
* '''''L''''' = The "lifetime" of communicating civilizations

However, whilst the rationale behind the equation is sound, it is unlikely that the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. The problem with the formula is that it is not usable to generate or support [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first term, '''''R*''''', number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, ''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', stars with planets and ''f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star's neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/seti/seti_history_07.html|author=Amir Alexander| title=The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Short History – Part 7: The Birth of the Drake Equation}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or [[pseudoscientific]] arguments.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 17 January 2011 | date = 26 September 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101212184044/http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html| archivedate= 12 December 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another associated topic is the [[Fermi paradox]], which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the [[universe]], then there should be obvious signs of it.

Another active research area in astrobiology is [[planetary system]] formation. It has been suggested that the peculiarities of the [[Solar System]] (for example, the presence of [[Jupiter]] as a protective shield)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europlanet-eu.org/demo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=999 |title=Jupiter: Friend or foe? |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Horner |first=Jonathan |author2=Barrie Jones |date=24 August 2007 |publisher=Europlanet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65SpMGrmN?url=http://www.europlanet-eu.org/demo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=999 |archivedate=15 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; may have greatly increased the probability of intelligent life arising on our planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=3910 |title=The Role Of Astrobiology in Solar System Exploration |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last1=Jakosky |first1=Bruce |author2=David Des Marais |date=14 September 2001 |work=NASA |publisher=SpaceRef.com |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1222 |title=Coming Soon: "Good" Jupiters |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Bortman |first=Henry |date=29 September 2004 |work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1970s, [[life]] was thought to be entirely dependent on energy from the [[Sun]]. Plants on Earth's surface capture energy from [[sunlight]] to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process that is then consumed by oxygen-respiring organisms, passing their energy up the [[food chain]]. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was thought to obtain its nourishment either from consuming [[marine snow|organic detritus rained down from the surface waters]] or from eating animals that did.&lt;ref name="smoker"&gt;{{cite web |title= Black Smokers and Giant Worms |author=Chamberlin, Sean |date=1999 |work=Fullerton College |url=http://www.courseworld.com/ocean/smokers.html |accessdate=11 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  world's ability to support life was thought to depend on its access to [[sunlight]]. However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the [[Galapagos Rift]] in the deep-sea exploration submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', scientists discovered colonies of [[giant tube worm]]s, [[clam]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[mussel]]s, and other assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as [[black smoker]]s.&lt;ref name="smoker"/&gt; These creatures thrive despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they comprise an entirely independent [[ecosystem]]. Although most of these multicellular lifeforms need dissolved oxygen (produced by oxygenic photosynthesis) for their aerobic cellular respiration and thus are not completely independent from sunlight by themselves, the basis for their food chain is a form of [[bacterium]] that derives its energy from [[Redox|oxidization]] of reactive chemicals, such as [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]], that bubble up from the Earth's interior. Other lifeforms entirely decoupled from the energy from sunlight are green sulphur bacteria which are capturing geothermal light for anoxygenic photosynthesis or bacteria running chemolithoautotrophy based on the radioactive decay of uranium.&lt;ref name="Trixler2013"&gt;{{cite journal | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768233/pdf/COC-17-1758.pdf|last=Trixler|first=F|title=Quantum tunnelling to the origin and evolution of life.|journal=Current Organic Chemistry|date=2013|volume=17|number=16|pages=1758–1770|doi=10.2174/13852728113179990083|pmc=3768233|pmid=24039543}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[chemosynthesis]] revolutionized the study of biology and astrobiology by revealing that life need not be sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.

[[Extremophiles]], organisms able to survive in extreme environments, are a core research element for astrobiologists. Such organisms include [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] which are able to survive several kilometers below the ocean's surface near [[hydrothermal vent]]s and [[microbe]]s that thrive in highly acidic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/050207_extremophiles.html |title=Wild Things: The Most Extreme Creatures |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Carey |first=Bjorn |date=7 February 2005 |work=Live Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that extremophiles thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life.&lt;ref name=Cavicchioli &gt;{{cite journal| title=Extremophiles and the search for extraterrestrial life|journal=Astrobiology|date=Fall 2002 |first=R. |last=Cavicchioli |volume=2 |issue=3|pages=281–92 |pmid=12530238 |doi=10.1089/153110702762027862 |bibcode = 2002AsBio...2..281C |url=http://somosbacteriasyvirus.com/extremophiles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats.

The origin of life, known as [[abiogenesis]], distinct from the [[Evolution#Evolution of life|evolution of life]], is another ongoing field of research. [[Oparin]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane|Haldane]] postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive to the formation of [[organic compound]]s from [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic elements]] and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of [[panspermia]] is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth—the [[panspermia]] hypothesis.

====Astroecology====
{{Main|Astroecology}}
[[Astroecology]] concerns the interactions of life with space environments and resources, in [[planets]], [[asteroids]] and [[comets]]. On a larger scale, astroecology concerns resources for life about [[stars]] in the [[galaxy]] through the cosmological future. Astroecology attempts to quantify future life in space, addressing this area of astrobiology.

Experimental astroecology investigates resources in planetary soils, using actual space materials in [[meteorite]]s.&lt;ref name = "AstroecologyIcarus2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary bioresources and astroecology. 1.

==== Astrogeology ====
{{Main|Geology of solar terrestrial planets}}
[[Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Astrogeology]] is a [[planetary science]] discipline concerned with the [[geology]] of [[celestial bodies]] such as the [[planet]]s and their [[moon]]s, [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteorite]]s. The information gathered by this discipline allows the measure of a [[planet]]'s or a [[natural satellite]]'s potential to develop and sustain [[life]], or [[planetary habitability]].

An additional discipline of astrogeology is [[geochemistry]], which involves study of the [[chemistry|chemical]] composition of the Earth and other [[planet]]s, chemical processes and reactions that govern the composition of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and [[soil]]s, the cycles of matter and energy and their interaction with the [[hydrosphere]] and the [[atmosphere]] of the planet. Specializations include [[cosmochemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and [[organic geochemistry]].

The [[fossil record]] provides the oldest known evidence for life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/fossils/succession.html |title=Fossil Succession |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=14 August 1997 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081014190106/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/fossils/succession.html| archivedate= 14 October 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; By examining the fossil evidence, [[paleontologists]] are able to better understand the types of organisms that arose on the early Earth. Some regions on Earth, such as the [[Pilbara]] in [[Western Australia]] and the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] of Antarctica, are also considered to be geological analogs to regions of Mars, and as such, might be able to provide clues on how to search for past [[life on Mars]].

The various organic functional groups, composed of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a host of metals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc, provide the enormous diversity of chemical reactions necessarily catalyzed by a living [[organism]]. Silicon, in contrast, interacts with only a few other atoms, and the large silicon molecules are monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules.&lt;ref name=BC/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt; Indeed, it seems likely that the basic building blocks of life anywhere will be similar  those on Earth, in the generality if not in the detail.&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt; Although terrestrial life and life that might arise independently of Earth are expected to use many similar, if not identical, building blocks, they also are expected to have some biochemical qualities that are unique. If life has had a comparable impact elsewhere in the Solar System, the relative abundances of chemicals key for its survival – whatever they may be – could betray its presence. Whatever extraterrestrial life may be, its tendency to chemically alter its environment might just give it away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Michael | title = Telltale chemistry could betray ET | date = 21 January 2011 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20927962.700-telltale-chemistry-could-betray-et.html | work = New Scientists | accessdate = 22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two of the natural atoms, [[carbon]] and [[silicon]], are known to serve as the backbones of molecules sufficiently large to carry biological information. As the structural basis for life, one of carbon's important features is that unlike silicon, it can readily engage in the formation of chemical bonds with many other atoms, thereby allowing for the chemical versatility required to conduct the reactions of biological metabolism and propagation.

== Rare Earth hypothesis ==
{{Main|Rare Earth hypothesis}}

The Rare Earth hypothesis postulates that multicellular life forms found on Earth may actually be more of a rarity than scientists assume. It provides a possible answer to the Fermi paradox which suggests, "If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?" It is apparently in opposition to the [[principle of mediocrity]], assumed by famed astronomers [[Frank Drake]], [[Carl Sagan]], and others. The Principle of Mediocrity suggests that life on Earth is not exceptional, but rather that life is more than likely to be found on innumerable other worlds.

;Methane
In 2004, the spectral signature of [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane]] ({{chem|C|H|4}}) was detected in the Martian atmosphere by both Earth-based telescopes as well as by the ''[[Mars Express]]'' orbiter. Because of [[solar radiation]] and [[cosmic radiation]], methane is predicted to disappear from the Martian atmosphere within several years, so the gas must be actively replenished in order to maintain the present concentration.&lt;ref name="results"&gt;

;Planetary systems
It is possible that some exoplanets may have moons with solid surfaces or liquid oceans that are hospitable. Most of the planets so far discovered outside the Solar System are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether the Solar System, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observation time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, NASA's [[Kepler Mission]] seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's [[light curve]] as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft. Progress in [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimeter astronomy]] has revealed the constituents of other [[star system]]s.

;Planetary habitability
{{main|Planetary habitability}}
Efforts to answer questions such as the abundance of potentially habitable planets in [[habitable zone]]s and chemical precursors have had much success. Numerous [[extrasolar planet]]s have been detected using the [[Doppler spectroscopy|wobble method]] and [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|transit method]], showing that planets around other [[star]]s are more numerous than previously postulated. The first Earth-sized extrasolar planet to be discovered within its star's habitable zone is [[Gliese 581 c]].&lt;ref name="Gliese"&gt;{{cite news | first=Ker | last=Than | title=Major Discovery: New Planet Could Harbor Water and Life | date=24 April 2007 | publisher=Space.com | url =http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html | pages = | accessdate =20 October 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081015075030/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html| archivedate= 15 October 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Missions ==
Research into the environmental limits of life and the workings of extreme [[ecosystem]]s is ongoing, enabling researchers to better predict what planetary environments might be most likely to harbor life. Missions such as the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]], [[Mars Science Laboratory]], [[ExoMars]], [[Mars 2020]] rover to Mars, and the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' probe]] to [[Saturn]]'s moons aim to further explore the possibilities of life on other planets in the Solar System.

;''Viking'' program
{{main|Viking lander biological experiments}}
[[File:Sagan Viking.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Sagan]] posing with a model of the Viking Lander.]]
The two [[Viking program|Viking landers]] each carried four types of biological experiments to the surface of Mars in the late 1970s. These were the only Mars landers to carry out experiments looking specifically for [[metabolism]] by current microbial [[Life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]]. The landers used a robotic arm to collect soil samples into sealed test containers on the craft. The two landers were identical, so the same tests were carried out at two places on Mars' surface; [[Viking 1]] near the equator and [[Viking 2]] further north.&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''basilar skull fracture''' is a [[bone fracture|break of a bone]] in the [[base of skull|base of the skull]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; Symptoms may include [[Battle sign|bruising behind the ears]], [[periorbital ecchymosis|bruising around the eyes]], or [[hemotympanum|blood behind the ear drum]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; A [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) leak occurs in about 20% of cases and can result in [[rhinorrhea|fluid leaking from the nose]] or [[otorrhea|ear]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; [[Meningitis]] is a complication in about 14% of cases.&lt;ref name=Nel2014/&gt; Other complications include [[cranial nerve]] or blood vessel injury.&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
They typically require a significant degree of trauma to occur.&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; The break is of at least one of the following bones: [[temporal bone]], [[occipital bone]], [[sphenoid bone]], [[frontal bone]], or [[ethmoid bone]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; They are divided into [[anterior fossa]], [[middle fossa]], and [[Posterior cranial fossa|posterior fossa]] fractures.&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; [[Facial fractures]] often also occur.&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; Diagnosis is typically by [[CT scan]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
Treatment is generally based on the injury to structures inside the head.&lt;ref name=Bau2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baugnon|first1=KL|last2=Hudgins|first2=PA|title=Skull base fractures and their complications|journal=Neuroimaging Clinics of North America|date=August 2014|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–65, vii–viii|doi=10.1016/j.nic.2014.03.001|pmid=25086806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgery may be done for a CSF leak that does not stop or an injury to a blood vessel or nerve.&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; Preventative [[antibiotics]] are of unclear use.&lt;ref name=Ra2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ratilal |first1=Bernardo O |last2=Costa |first2=João |last3=Pappamikail |first3=Lia |last4=Sampaio |first4=Cristina |last5=Ratilal |first5=Bernardo O |title=Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing meningitis in patients with basilar skull fractures |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=4 |issue= 4|pages=CD004884 |year=2015 |pmid=25918919 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004884.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nel2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nellis|first1=JC|last2=Kesser|first2=BW|last3=Park|first3=SS|title=What is the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in basilar skull fractures?|journal=The Laryngoscope|date=January 2014|volume=124|issue=1|pages=8–9|doi=10.1002/lary.23934|pmid=24122671}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs in about 12% of people with a severe [[head injury]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Bilateral periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes).jpg|thumb|Bilateral raccoon eyes]]

*[[Battle's sign]] – [[ecchymosis|bruising]] of the [[mastoid process]] of the temporal bone.
*[[Raccoon eyes]] – bruising around the eyes, i.e. "[[black eye]]s"
*[[Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea]]
*[[Cranial nerve]] [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]]
*Bleeding (sometimes profuse) from the nose and ears
*[[Hemotympanum]]
*Conductive or perceptive [[deafness]], [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[vomitus]]
*In 1–10% of patients, [[optic nerve]] entrapment occurs.&lt;ref name="singh"&gt;{{EMedicine|article|907273|Pediatric Head Trauma}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optic nerve is compressed by the broken skull bones, causing irregularities in vision.
*Serious cases usually result in [[death]]

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:BasSkullFracMark.png|thumb|A basilar skull fracture as seen on CT]]
[[File:Cranial bones en.svg|thumb|Diagram showing bones that may be involved in a basilar skull fracture]]
Basilar skull fractures include breaks in the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[skull base]] or [[Anterior (anatomy)|anterior]] skull base. The former involve the occipital bone, temporal bone, and portions of the sphenoid bone; the latter, superior portions of the sphenoid and ethmoid bones. The [[temporal bone fracture]] is encountered in 75% of all basilar skull fractures and may be longitudinal, transverse or mixed, depending on the course of the fracture line in relation to the longitudinal axis of the [[petrous part of the temporal bone|pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|248108|Skull Fracture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bones may be broken around the [[foramen magnum]], the hole in the base of the skull through which the [[brain stem]] exits and becomes the [[spinal cord]], creating the risk that blood vessels and nerves exiting the hole may be damaged.&lt;ref name="BAIUSA"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Brain Injury Association of America |url=http://www.biausa.org/about-brain-injury.htm |title=About Brain Injury |date=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the proximity of the [[cranial nerve]]s, injury to those nerves may occur.&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt; This can cause loss of function of the [[facial nerve]] or [[oculomotor nerve]] or hearing loss due to damage of [[cranial nerve VIII]].&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt;

==Management==
Evidence does not support the use of preventative [[antibiotic]]s regardless of the presence of a [[cerebrospinal fluid]] leak.&lt;ref name=Ra2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nel2014/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Non-displaced fractures usually heal without intervention. Patients with basilar skull fractures are especially likely to get [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name="Dagi"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dagi |first1=T.Forcht |last2=Meyer |first2=Frederick B. |last3=Poletti |first3=Charles A. |title=The incidence and prevention of meningitis after basilar skull fracture |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=295–8 |year=1983 |pmid=6680635 |doi=10.1016/0735-6757(83)90109-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in these cases is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=96|title = Antibiotics in base of skull fractures|accessdate = 2014-03-22|website = BestBets|last = Butler|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal bone fractures===
Acute injury to the internal [[carotid artery]] ([[carotid dissection]], occlusion, [[pseudoaneurysm]] formation) may be asymptomatic or result in life-threatening bleeding. They are almost exclusively observed when the [[carotid canal]] is fractured, although only a minority of carotid canal fractures result in vascular injury. Involvement of the petrous segment of the carotid canal is associated with a relatively high incidence of carotid injury.&lt;ref name="Resnick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Resnick |first1=Daniel K. |last2=Subach |first2=Brian R. |last3=Marion |first3=Donald W. |title=The Significance of Carotid Canal Involvement in Basilar Cranial Fracture |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1177–81 |year=1997 |pmid=9179890 |doi=10.1097/00006123-199706000-00012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Basilar skull fractures are a common cause of death in many [[motor racing]] accidents.

'''Biological immortality''' (sometimes referred to ''bio-indefinite'' mortality) is a state in which the [[rate of mortality]] from [[senescence]] is stable or decreasing, thus decoupling it from [[chronological]] age. Various unicellular and multicellular species, including some vertebrates, achieve this state either throughout their existence or after living long enough. A [[Biology|biologically]] immortal [[life|living]] being can still die from means other than senescence, such as through injury or disease.

This definition of [[immortality]] has been challenged in the ''Handbook of the Biology of Aging'',&lt;ref name="Masoro2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=E.J. |last=Masoro |editor=Austad, S.N. |year=2006 |title=Handbook of the Biology of Aging |edition=Sixth |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego, CA |isbn=0-12-088387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age may be negligible at extremely [[old age]]s, an idea referred to as the [[Late-life mortality deceleration|late-life mortality plateau]]. The rate of mortality may cease to increase in old age, but in most cases that rate is typically very high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Late life: a new frontier for physiology |author1=Michael R.

The term is also used by biologists to describe cells that are not subject to the [[Hayflick limit]] on how many times they can divide.

==Cell lines==
{{Main article|Cell culture|Immortalised cell line}}
[[Biologist]]s chose the word "immortal" to designate cells that are not subject to the [[Hayflick limit]], the point at which cells can no longer divide due to [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] or shortened [[telomere]]s. Prior to [[Leonard Hayflick]]'s theory, [[Alexis Carrel]] hypothesized that all normal [[somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells were immortal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shay, J.

The term "immortalization" was first applied to [[cancer]] cells that expressed the telomere-lengthening [[enzyme]] [[telomerase]], and thereby avoided [[apoptosis]]—i.e. cell death caused by intracellular mechanisms. Among the most commonly used cell lines are [[HeLa]] and [[Jurkat cells|Jurkat]], both of which are immortalized cancer cell lines. HeLa cells originated from a sample of [[cervical cancer]] taken from [[Henrietta Lacks]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="Immortal Life"&gt;{{cite book | last = Skloot | first = Rebecca | authorlink = Rebecca Skloot | title = [[The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]] | publisher = Crown/Random House | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4000-5217-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cells have been and still are widely used in biological research such as creation of the [[polio vaccine]],&lt;ref name="Smith_2002"&gt;{{cite news | first = Van | last = Smith | title = The Life, Death, and Life After Death of Henrietta Lacks, Unwitting Heroine of Modern Medical Science. | url = http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3426 | publisher = [[Baltimore City Paper]] | date = 2002-04-17 | accessdate = 2010-03-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040814160109/http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3426 | archivedate = 2004-08-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; sex hormone steroid research,&lt;ref&gt;Bulzomi, Pamela.

===Bacteria and some yeast===
Many unicellular organisms age: as time passes, they divide more slowly and ultimately die. Asymmetrically dividing [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]] also age. However, symmetrically dividing [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]] can be biologically immortal under ideal growing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Current Biology: Volume 23, Issue 19, 7 October 2013, Pages 1844–1852 "Fission Yeast Does Not Age under Favorable Conditions, but Does So after Stress." Miguel Coelho1, 4, Aygül Dereli1, Anett Haese1, Sebastian Kühn2, Liliana Malinovska1, Morgan E. DeSantis3, James Shorter3, Simon Alberti1, Thilo Gross2, 5, Iva M. Tolić-Nørrelykke1&lt;/ref&gt; In these conditions, when a cell splits symmetrically to produce two daughter cells, the process of [[cell division]] can restore the cell to a youthful state. However, if the parent asymmetrically buds off a daughter only the daughter is reset to the youthful state—the parent isn't restored and will go on to age and die. In a similar manner [[stem cell]]s and [[gamete]]s can be regarded as "immortal".

===Hydra===
[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|''Hydra'']]
[[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]] are a [[genus]] of the [[Cnidaria]] phylum. All cnidarians can regenerate, allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Hydras are simple, [[freshwater]] animals possessing [[radial symmetry]] and no post-[[mitotic]] cells. All hydra cells continually divide.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} It has been suggested that hydras do not undergo [[senescence]], and, as such, are biologically immortal. In a four-year study, 3 cohorts of hydra did not show an increase in mortality with age. It is possible that these animals live much longer, considering that they reach maturity in 5 to 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martínez |first=Daniel E. |year=1998 |url=http://www.biochem.uci.edu/Steele/PDFs/Hydra_senescence_paper.pdf |title=Mortality patterns suggest lack of senescence in Hydra |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=217–225 |publisher=Elsevier Science Inc. |doi=10.1016/S0531-5565(97)00113-7 |pmid=9615920 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426043703/http://www.biochem.uci.edu/steele/PDFs/Hydra_senescence_paper.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not explain how hydras are consequently able to maintain [[telomere]] lengths.

===Jellyfish===
''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', or ''[[Turritopsis nutricula]]'', is a small ({{convert|5|mm|in|sp=us}}) species of [[jellyfish]] that uses [[transdifferentiation]] to replenish cells after [[sexual reproduction]]. This cycle can repeat indefinitely, potentially rendering it biologically immortal. This organism originated in the [[Caribbean sea]], but has now spread around the world. Similar cases include hydrozoan ''Laodicea undulata''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|author = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|volume=149|pages=339–346|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scyphozoan ''[[Aurelia (genus)|Aurelia]]'' sp.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 2015-12-21|journal = PLOS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|access-date = 2015-12-31|volume = 10|pages = e0145314|display-authors = etal|pmc = 4687044|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109164816/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0145314|archivedate = 2016-01-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobsters===
{{further information|Lobster#Longevity}}
Research suggests that lobsters may not slow down, weaken, or lose fertility with age, and that older lobsters may be more fertile than younger lobsters. This does not however make them immortal in the traditional sense, as they are significantly more likely to die at a shell moult the older they get (as detailed below).

Their longevity may be due to [[telomerase]], an [[enzyme]] that repairs long repetitive sections of [[DNA sequence]]s at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as [[telomeres]]. Telomerase is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages but is generally absent from adult stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cong YS | title = Human Telomerase and Its Regulation | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–425 |date=2002 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.66.3.407-425.2002 | pmid=12208997 | pmc=120798}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike vertebrates, lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfram Klapper |author2=Karen Kühne |author3=Kumud K.

Older lobsters are also known to stop moulting, which means that the shell will eventually become damaged, infected, or fall apart and they die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/?no-ist|title=Don’t Listen to the Buzz: Lobsters Aren’t Actually Immortal|first=Marina|last=Koren|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150212053821/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/?no-ist|archivedate=2015-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European lobster]] has an average life span of 31 years for males and 54 years for females.

===Planarian flatworms===
[[File:Polycelis felina.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Polycelis felina'', a freshwater planarian]]
[[Planarian|Planarian flatworms]] have both sexually and asexually reproducing types. Studies on genus [[Schmidtea mediterranea]] suggest these planarians appear to regenerate (i.e. heal) indefinitely, and asexual individuals have an "apparently limitless [telomere] regenerative capacity fueled by a population of highly proliferative adult stem cells". "Both asexual and sexual animals display age-related decline in telomere length; however, asexual animals are able to maintain telomere lengths somatically (i.e. during reproduction by fission or when regeneration is induced by [[amputation]]), whereas sexual animals restore telomeres by extension during sexual reproduction or during embryogenesis like other sexual species. Homeostatic telomerase activity observed in both asexual and sexual animals is not sufficient to maintain telomere length, whereas the increased activity in regenerating asexuals is sufficient to renew telomere length... "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thomas C. J. Tan |author2=Ruman Rahman |author3=Farah Jaber-Hijazi |author4=Daniel A. Felix |author5=Chen Chen |author6=Edward J.

Lifespan: For sexually reproducing planaria: "the lifespan of individual planarian can be as long as 3 years, likely due to the ability of neoblasts to constantly replace aging cells". Whereas for asexually reproducing planaria: "individual animals in clonal lines of some planarian species replicating by fission have been maintained for over 15 years".

In 2015, Elizabeth Parrish, CEO of BioViva, treated herself using [[gene therapy]], with the goal of not just halting, but reversing aging.&lt;ref name=TR-EP-GT&gt;{{cite news | title = A Tale of Do-It-Yourself Gene Therapy | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/542371/a-tale-of-do-it-yourself-gene-therapy/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since reported feeling more energetic, and no obvious negative side effects have been noticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartman |first=Brady |date=February 12, 2018 |title=BioViva's Liz Parrish reports promising progress on human gene therapy |url=http://longevityfacts.com/bioviva-elizabeth-parrish-progress-human-gene-therapy/ |website=LongevityFacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, scientists at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the Mayo Clinic employed genetic and pharmacological approaches to ablate pro-aging senescent cells, extending healthy lifespan of mice by over 25%. The startup Unity Biotechnology is further developing this strategy in human clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/02/25-median-life-extension-in-mice-via-senescent-cell-clearance-unity-biotechnology-founded-to-develop-therapies/|title=25% Median Life Extension in Mice via Senescent Cell Clearance, Unity Biotechnology Founded to Develop Therapies|date=2016-02-03|work=Fight Aging!|access-date=2018-03-04|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312023228/https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/02/25-median-life-extension-in-mice-via-senescent-cell-clearance-unity-biotechnology-founded-to-develop-therapies|archivedate=2018-03-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, Harvard scientists headed by biologist [[David Andrew Sinclair|David Sinclair]] announced they have tested a metabolic precursor that increases [[NAD+]] levels in mice and have successfully reversed the cellular aging process and can protect the DNA from future damage. "The old mouse and young mouse cells are indistinguishable", David was quoted. Human trials are to begin shortly in what the team expect is 6 months at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/03/harvard-scientists-pinpoint-critical-step-in-dna-repair-cellular-aging/|title=Harvard scientists pinpoint critical step in DNA repair, cellular aging|date=2017-03-23|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
To achieve the more limited goal of halting the increase in mortality rate with age, a solution must be found to the fact that any intervention to remove senescent cells that creates competition among cells will increase age-related mortality from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Paul |last2=Masel |first2=Joanna |title=Intercellular competition and the inevitability of multicellular aging |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=5 December 2017 |volume=114 |issue=49 |pages=12982–12987 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1618854114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immortalism and immortality as a movement ==
{{main|Anti-aging movement}}
In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, pro-immortality transhumanist [[political parties]] were launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/stambler20120823|title=The Longevity Party - Who Needs it?

They aim to make it possible to provide access to such technologies to the majority of people alive today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php |title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science |publisher=Fight Aging! |date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116112041/http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php |archivedate=January 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future medicine, life extension and  "swallowing the doctor"==

Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to [[life extension#Nanotechnology|life extension]] through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical [[molecular machines]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]].]]
'''Biorobotics''' is a term that loosely covers the fields of [[cybernetics]], [[bionics]] and even [[genetic engineering]] as a collective study.

Biorobotics is often used to refer to a real subfield of [[robotics]]: studying how to make robots that emulate or simulate living biological organisms mechanically or even chemically. 

The term is also used in a reverse definition: making biological organisms as manipulatable and functional as robots, or making biological organisms as components of robots. In the latter sense, biorobotics can be referred to as a [[theoretical]] discipline of comprehensive genetic engineering in which organisms are created and designed by artificial means. The creation of life from non-living matter for example, would be biorobotics. The field is in its infancy and is sometimes known as [[synthetic biology]] or [[bionanotechnology]].

== Bio-inspired robotics ==
{{Main|Bio-inspired robotics}}
Bio-inspired robotics is the practice of making robots that are inspired by real biological systems, while being simpler and more effective. In contrast, the resemblance of [[animatronics]] to biological organisms is usually only in general shape and form.

==Practical experimentation==

A biological brain, grown from cultured neurons which were originally separated, has been developed as the neurological entity subsequently embodied within a robot body by [[Kevin Warwick]] and his team at [[University of Reading]]. The brain receives input from sensors on the robot body and the resultant output from the brain provides the robot's only motor signals.

==History==
===Squibb===
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by [[Edward Robinson Squibb]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], New York.  Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (''Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica'') after failing to convince the [[American Medical Association]] to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the ''Materia Medica'', Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inverse Type of Temperature in Typhoid Fever, with a Report of Two Cases — Temperature Peculiarities in Epidemics, with a Report of Seven Cases in One Family |journal=Boston Medical and Surgical Journal |date=January 8, 1885 |last=Hollopeter |first=W.C. |volume=112 |pages=28–32 |doi=10.1056/NEJM188308301090903 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM188710271171706 |accessdate=2014-11-25 |quote="The writer noticed (in December, 1882) the important fact that when common or Japan camphor and crystallized carbolic acid are mixed together and subjected to heat, a colorless liquid would be the result.

===Bristol-Myers===
In 1887, [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] graduates [[William McLaren Bristol]] and [[John Ripley Myers]] purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton]], New York. In 1898, they decided to rename it '''Bristol, Myers and Company'''. Following Myers' death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the '''Bristol-Myers Corporation'''. The first nationally recognized product was [[Sal Hepatica]], a [[laxative]] mineral salt in 1903. Its second national success was [[Ipana]] toothpaste, from 1901 through the 1960s.&lt;ref name="MarketingChannels"&gt;Bert Rosenbloom, ''Marketing Channels'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=6WMJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA609 Bristol-Myers Squibb], 2011, page 609&lt;/ref&gt; Other divisions were Clairol (hair colors and haircare) and Drackett (household products such as Windex and Drano).

In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of [[acidophilus|acidophilus milk]] in [[East Syracuse, New York]], and converted the plant to produce [[penicillin]] for the [[Allies of World War II|World War II Allied forces]]. After the war, the company renamed the plant [[Bristol Laboratories]] in 1945 and entered the civilian [[antibiotics]] market, where it faced competition from Squibb, which had opened the world's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.&lt;ref name="MarketingChannels"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol-Myers Squibb|url=https://www.drugwatch.com/manufacturer/bristol-myers-squibb/|website=Drugwatch|accessdate=November 14, 2016|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other [[biopharmaceutical|biologic medicines]] for clinical trials and commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bms.com/sustainability/worldwide_facilities/north_america/Pages/syracuse_new_york.aspx Bristol-Meyers Squibb, ''Syracuse, New York'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merger===
Bristol-Myers and Squibb merged in 1989, with Bristol-Myers as the nominal survivor. The merged company became Bristol-Myers Squibb.

In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the [[National Medal of Technology]], the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."

===2000 to 2010===
In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of maintaining illegally a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit 5 years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/06/04/news/companies/bristol |title= Bristol hit with antitrust suit |date=June 4, 2002 |accessdate=Jul 10, 2013 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was involved in an [[accounting scandal]] in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "[[channel stuffing]]" as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

On October 24, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001 while revising this year's earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-68980061.html |title= Bristol-Myers to restate earnings as third quarter profits plunge}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-92165333.html |title= Bristol-Myers restates results upward due to accounting errors}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.

An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the [[FBI]] raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of [[collusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=565&amp;fArticleId=3367635 Business Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817193955/http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=565&amp;fArticleId=3367635 |date=17 August 2007 }}, July 31, 2006. Retrieved September 7, 2006. Archived at&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge [[Frederick B. Lacey]], urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/12/news/companies/bristol/index.htm?postversion=2006091217 CNN.com], September 12, 2006. Retrieved September 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company.

In 2009, a major restructuring began focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs.  This was part of a business strategy launched in 2007 to transform the company from a large diversified pharma company to a specialty biopharma company, which also included the closure of half of their manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.qgdigitalpublishing.com/publication/?i=531504&amp;p=&amp;pn=#{%22issue_id%22:531504,%22page%22:20}|title=From Big to Specialty&amp;mdash;The Operational Transformation of Bristol-Myers Squibb|last=Wright|first=Rob|date=October 2018|work=Life Science Leader|access-date=17 October 2018|publisher=VertMarkets|issue=10|location=Erie, Pennsylvania|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|19}}  As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In August, BMS acquired the [[biotechnology]] firm [[Medarex]] as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/BristolMyers-Squibb-to-bw-571310065.html?x=0&amp;.v=1&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals.

BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies.

In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas.  [[Lamberto Andreotti]] was named [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] this year; he had previously served as "president and [[Chief operating officer|COO]] responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = BMS CEO Andreotti to Retire; COO named as Successor|last = Staff|date = 15 February 2015|work = [[Gen.

'''''British Tar''''' was launched at Shields in 1792 and made five voyages as a [[whaler]] and several as a [[West Indiaman]]. She then became a general trader. She was lost on 29 January 1818.

==Career==
''British Tar'' enters ''[[Lloyd's Register]]'' in 1792 with J. Fitch, master, Mangles, owner, and trade London–South Seas fisheries.&lt;ref name=LR1792&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015004281252?urlappend=%3Bseq=56 ''Lloyd's Register'' (1792), Seq.№525.]&lt;/ref&gt;

For her first whale fishing voyage ''British Tar'' sailed to Peru under the command of Jedediah Fitch. On 8 February 1793 she was at [[Saint Helena|St Helena]], homeward bound, and she arrived in England with 219 tuns of [[sperm oil]].&lt;ref name=bswf&gt;[https://whalinghistory.org/bv/voyages/ British Southern Whale Fishery - Voyages: ''British Tar''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On her second voyage she sailed in 1793 for Peru under the command of Blythe (or Thomas Bligh). She returned on 29 July 1794.&lt;ref name=bswf/&gt;
	
Her third voyage was again under the command of Bligh (or Blythe, or Blight),&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (2014), Addendum p.3&lt;/ref&gt; but this time he sailed her for the Pacific Ocean, where she was reported to be in August–September 1796. She returned to England on 8 May 1797.&lt;ref name=bswf/&gt;
	
''British Tar'' then spent several years sailing to the West Indies. John and James Mangles still owned her and she sailed to San Domingo, but more often to Jamaica.&lt;ref name=bswf/&gt;

On 8 January 1802 Captain Innis sailed ''British Tar'' to the [[Galápagos Islands]] for her fourth whaling voyage. At some Point Captain Rowe replaced Innis. Homeward bound, she left St Helena on 4 May 1804, and arrived in England on 17 July.
		
Captain Charles Harrax (or Harrass, or Harrat, or Haddock),&lt;ref name=Clayton&gt;Clayton (2014), pp.77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; left England on 12 November 1804 and returned on 15 April 1807. This is the last whaling voyage for ''British Tar''{{'}}s that has any details.&lt;ref name=bswf/&gt; However, she may continued to whale into 1810.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt;

The ''Register of Shipping'' for 1810, in its supplemental pages, shows ''British Tar'' with Anthony, master, J. Pirie, owner, and trade London–Guadeloupe.&lt;ref name=RS1810&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024214333?urlappend=%3Bseq=103 ''Register of Shipping'' (1810), "B" supplemental pages.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811 she underwent a large repair, and her trade became London–Newcastle.&lt;ref name=RS1812&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024214317?urlappend=%3Bseq=106 ''Register of Shipping'' (1812), "B" supplemental pages.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==
The ''Register of Shipping'' for 1818 shows ''British Tar'' with J. Pirie, owner and master, and trade London–Madeira. The entry has a line through it and the notation "Lost".&lt;ref name=RS1818&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024214259?urlappend=%3Bseq=106 ''Register of Shipping'' (1818), Seq. №570.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
''[[Lloyd's List]]'' reported on 3 February 1818 that a gale on 29 January 1818 had caused the total loss of ''British Tar'', John Pirie, master, between [[Lymington]] and [[Christchurch, Dorset]]. She was on her return voyage from Sierra Leone to London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735028?urlappend=%3Bseq=261 ''Lloyd's List'' Seq. №5251.]&lt;/ref&gt; All on board, at least 14 people, were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=(untitled) |day_of_week=Monday |date=9 February 1818 |page_number=2 |issue=10375 |column=E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after ''British Tar'' was lost, the body of a four-foot long African lizard was found on the beach by Hordle Cliff, near Milford. Apparently this animal was the largest of the kind ever brought to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Magazine'' (1819), Vol. 53, p.394.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[deep learning]], a '''convolutional neural network''' ('''CNN''', or '''ConvNet''') is a class of [[Deep neural network|deep]], [[Feedforward neural network|feed-forward]] [[artificial neural network]]s, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

CNNs use a variation of [[multilayer perceptron]]s designed to require minimal [[Data pre-processing|preprocessing]].&lt;ref name="LeCun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/|title=LeNet-5, convolutional neural networks|last=LeCun|first=Yann|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as '''shift invariant''' or '''space invariant artificial neural networks''' ('''SIANN'''), based on their shared-weights architecture and [[translation invariance]] characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Wei|date=1988|title=Shift-invariant pattern recognition neural network and its optical architecture|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B65v6Wo67Tk5Zm03Tm1kaEdIYkE/view?usp=sharing|journal=Proceedings of annual conference of the Japan Society of Applied Physics|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Wei|date=1990|title=Parallel distributed processing model with local space-invariant interconnections and its optical architecture|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B65v6Wo67Tk5ODRzZmhSR29VeDg/view?usp=sharing|journal=Applied Optics|volume=29|issue=32|pages=4790–7|doi=10.1364/AO.29.004790|pmid=20577468|access-date=|via=|bibcode=1990ApOpt..29.4790Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convolutional networks were [[mathematical biology|inspired]] by [[biological]] processes&lt;ref name="robust face detection"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matusugu|first=Masakazu|year=2003|title=Subject independent facial expression recognition with robust face detection using a convolutional neural network|url=http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pift6080/H09/documents/papers/sparse/matsugo_etal_face_expression_conv_nnet.pdf|journal=Neural Networks|volume=16|issue=5|pages=555–559|doi=10.1016/S0893-6080(03)00115-1|author2=Katsuhiko Mori|author3=Yusuke Mitari|author4=Yuji Kaneda|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that the connectivity pattern between [[Artificial neuron|neurons]] resembles the organization of the animal [[visual cortex]]. Individual [[cortical neuron]]s respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the [[visual field]] known as the [[receptive field]]. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field.

CNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other [[Image classification|image classification algorithms]]. This means that the network learns the [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]] that in traditional algorithms were [[Feature engineering|hand-engineered]]. This independence from prior knowledge and human effort in feature design is a major advantage.

They have applications in [[Computer vision|image and video recognition]], [[recommender system]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5004-deep-content-based-music-recommendation.pdf|title=Deep content-based music recommendation|last=van den Oord|first=Aaron|last2=Dieleman|first2=Sander|last3=Schrauwen|first3=Benjamin|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Curran Associates, Inc.|editor-last=Burges|editor-first=C.

== Design ==
A CNN consists of an input and an output layer, as well as multiple [[Multilayer perceptron#Layers|hidden layers]]. The hidden layers of a CNN typically consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers and normalization layers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Description of the process as a [[convolution]] in neural networks is by convention. Mathematically it is a [[cross-correlation]] rather than a convolution (although cross-correlation is a related operation). This only has significance for the indices in the matrix, and thus which weights are placed at which index.

=== Convolutional ===
Convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer. The convolution emulates the response of an individual neuron to visual stimuli.&lt;ref name="deeplearning"&gt;{{cite web|title=Convolutional Neural Networks (LeNet) – DeepLearning 0.1 documentation|url=http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html|work=DeepLearning 0.1|publisher=LISA Lab|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each convolutional neuron processes data only for its [[receptive field]]. Although [[Multilayer perceptron|fully connected feedforward neural networks]] can be used to learn features as well as classify data, it is not practical to apply this architecture to images. A very high number of neurons would be necessary, even in a shallow (opposite of deep) architecture, due to the very large input sizes associated with images, where each pixel is a relevant variable. For instance, a fully connected layer for a (small) image of size 100 x 100 has 10000 weights for ''each'' neuron in the second layer. The convolution operation brings a solution to this problem as it reduces the number of free parameters, allowing the network to be deeper with fewer parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987790957|title=Guide to convolutional neural networks : a practical application to traffic-sign detection and classification|last=Habibi,|first=Aghdam, Hamed|others=Heravi, Elnaz Jahani,|isbn=9783319575490|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=987790957}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, regardless of image size, tiling regions of size 5 x 5, each with the same shared weights, requires only 25 learnable parameters. In this way, it resolves the vanishing or exploding gradients problem in training traditional multi-layer neural networks with many layers by using [[backpropagation]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Pooling ===
Convolutional networks may include local or global pooling layers,{{clarify|date=September 2016}} which combine the outputs of neuron clusters at one layer into a single neuron in the next layer.&lt;ref name="flexible" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Alex Krizhevsky|Krizhevsky]]|first=Alex|title=ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks|url=http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/supervision.pdf|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''max pooling'' uses the maximum value from each of a cluster of neurons at the prior layer.&lt;ref name="mcdns"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ciresan |first1=Dan |first2=Ueli |last2=Meier |first3=Jürgen |last3=Schmidhuber |title=Multi-column deep neural networks for image classification |journal=2012 [[IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition]] |date=June 2012 |pages=3642–3649 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6248110 |doi=10.1109/CVPR.2012.6248110 |arxiv=1202.2745 |accessdate=2013-12-09 |isbn=978-1-4673-1226-4 |oclc=812295155 |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is ''average pooling'', which uses the average value from each of a cluster of neurons at the prior layer.&lt;ref name="cnnbackground"&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/37491583/A_Survey_of_FPGA-based_Accelerators_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks A Survey of FPGA-based Accelerators for Convolutional Neural Networks]", NCAA, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fully connected ===
Fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in another layer. It is in principle the same as the traditional [[multi-layer perceptron]] neural network (MLP).

=== Receptive field ===
In neural networks, each neuron receives input from some number of locations in the previous layer. In a fully connected layer, each neuron receives input from ''every'' element of the previous layer. In a convolutional layer, neurons receive input from only a restricted subarea of the previous layer. Typically the subarea is of a square shape (e.g., size 5 by 5). The input area of a neuron is called its ''receptive field''.  So, in a fully connected layer, the receptive field is the entire previous layer. In a convolutional layer, the receptive area is smaller than the entire previous layer.

=== Weights ===
Each neuron in a neural network computes an output value by applying some function to the input values coming from the receptive field in the previous layer. The function that is applied to the input values is specified by a vector of weights and a bias (typically real numbers). Learning in a neural network progresses by making incremental adjustments to the biases and weights. The vector of weights and the bias are called a ''filter'' and represents some [[Feature (machine learning)|feature]] of the input (e.g., a particular shape). A distinguishing feature of CNNs is that many neurons share the same filter. This reduces [[memory footprint]] because a single bias and a single vector of weights is used across all receptive fields sharing that filter, rather than each receptive field having its own bias and vector of weights.&lt;ref name="LeCun" /&gt;

== History ==

CNN design follows vision processing in [[living organisms]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Receptive fields in the visual cortex ===
Work by [[David H. Hubel|Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel|Wiesel]] in the 1950s and 1960s showed that cat and monkey visual [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]]es contain neurons that individually respond to small regions of the [[visual field]]. Provided the eyes are not moving, the region of visual space within which visual stimuli affect the firing of a single neuron is known as its [[receptive field|'''receptive field''']].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Neighboring cells have similar and overlapping receptive fields.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Receptive field size and location varies systematically across the cortex to form a complete map of visual space.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The cortex in each hemisphere represents the contralateral [[visual field]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Their 1968 paper identified two basic visual cell types in the brain:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Receptive fields and functional architecture of monkey striate cortex|journal = The Journal of Physiology|date = 1968-03-01|issn = 0022-3751|pmc = 1557912|pmid = 4966457|pages = 215–243|volume = 195|issue = 1|first = D.

*[[simple cells (visual cortex)|simple cell]]s, whose output is maximized by straight edges having particular orientations within their receptive field
*[[complex cells (visual cortex)|complex cell]]s, which have larger [[receptive field]]s, whose output is insensitive to the exact position of the edges in the field.

The "[[neocognitron]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Yann |last1=LeCun |first2=Yoshua |last2=Bengio |first3=Geoffrey |last3=Hinton |title=Deep learning |journal=Nature |volume=521 |issue=7553 |year=2015 |pages=436–444 |doi=10.1038/nature14539|pmid=26017442 |bibcode=2015Natur.521..436L }}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in 1980.&lt;ref name=mcdns /&gt;&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fukushima|first=Kunihiko|title=Neocognitron: A Self-organizing Neural Network Model for a Mechanism of Pattern Recognition Unaffected by Shift in Position|journal=Biological Cybernetics|year=1980|volume=36|issue=4|pages=193–202|url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr08/cos598B/Readings/Fukushima1980.pdf|accessdate=16 November 2013|doi=10.1007/BF00344251|pmid=7370364}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[neocognitron]] does not require units located at multiple network positions to have the same trainable weights.

=== Time delay neural networks ===
The [[time delay neural network]] (TDNN) was the first convolutional network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Phoneme Recognition Using Time-Delay Neural Networks |last1=Waibel |first1=Alex |date=December 1987 |location=Tokyo, Japan |conference=Meeting of the Institute of Electrical, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="speechsignal"&gt;[[Alex Waibel|Alexander Waibel]] et al., ''Phoneme Recognition Using Time-Delay Neural Networks'' IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Volume 37, No. 3, pp. 328. - 339 March 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

TDNNs are fixed-size convolutional networks that share weights along the temporal dimension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=LeCun |first1=Yann |last2=Bengio |first2=Yoshua | editor-last=Arbib |editor-first=Michael A. |title=Convolutional networks for images, speech, and time series |encyclopedia=The handbook of brain theory and neural networks |edition=Second |year=1995 |publisher=The MIT press|pages=276–278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow speech signals to be processed time-invariantly, analogous to the translation invariance offered by CNNs.&lt;ref name="speechsignal"/&gt; They were introduced in the early 1980s.

=== Trainable weights ===
A system to recognize hand-written [[ZIP Code]] numbers&lt;ref&gt;Denker, J S , Gardner, W R., Graf, H.

Jackel, [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition]; AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yann LeCun]] et al. (1989)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; used back-propagation to learn the convolution kernel coefficients directly from images of hand-written numbers. Learning was thus fully automatic, performed better than manual coefficient design, and was suited to a broader range of image recognition problems and image types.

==== LeNet-5 ====
LeNet-5, a pioneering 7-level convolutional network by [[Yann LeCun|LeCun]] et al. in 1998,&lt;ref name="lecun98"&gt;{{cite journal|last=LeCun|first=Yann|author2=Léon Bottou |author3=Yoshua Bengio |author4=Patrick Haffner |title=Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|year=1998|volume=86|issue=11|pages=2278–2324|url=http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf|accessdate=October 7, 2016|doi=10.1109/5.726791}}&lt;/ref&gt; that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks ({{Lang-en-GB|cheques}}) digitized in 32x32 pixel images. The ability to process higher resolution images requires larger and more layers of convolutional neural networks, so this technique is constrained by the availability of computing resources.

== Distinguishing features ==
Traditional [[multilayer perceptron]] (MLP) models were successfully used for image recognition.{{examples|date=October 2017}} However, due to the full connectivity between nodes they suffer from the [[curse of dimensionality]], and thus do not scale well to higher resolution images. A 1000×1000 pixel image with [[RGB color model|RGB color]] channels has 3 million dimensions, which is too high to feasibly process efficiently at scale with full connectivity.
[[File:Conv layers.png|left|thumb|237x237px|CNN layers arranged in 3 dimensions]]
For example, in [[CIFAR-10]], images are only of size 32×32×3 (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a single fully connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular neural network would have 32*32*3 = 3,072 weights. A 200×200 image, however, would lead to neurons that have 200*200*3 = 120,000 weights.

Also, such network architecture does not take into account the spatial structure of data, treating input pixels which are far apart in the same way as pixels that are close together. This ignores [[locality of reference]] in image data, both computationally and semantically. Thus, full connectivity of neurons is wasteful for purposes such as image recognition that are dominated by [[Spatial locality|spatially local]] input patterns.

Convolutional neural networks are biologically inspired variants of multilayer perceptrons that are designed to emulate the behavior of a [[visual cortex]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} These models mitigate the challenges posed by the MLP architecture by exploiting the strong spatially local correlation present in natural images. As opposed to MLPs, CNNs have the following distinguishing features:
* '''3D volumes of neurons'''. The layers of a CNN have neurons arranged in [[Three-dimensional space|3 dimensions]]: width, height and depth. The neurons inside a layer are connected to only a small region of the layer before it, called a receptive field. Distinct types of layers, both locally and completely connected, are stacked to form a CNN architecture.
* '''Local connectivity''': following the concept of receptive fields, CNNs exploit spatial locality by enforcing a local connectivity pattern between neurons of adjacent layers. The architecture thus ensures that the learned "[[Filter (signal processing)|filters]]" produce the strongest response to a spatially local input pattern. Stacking many such layers leads to [[Nonlinear filter|non-linear filters]] that become increasingly global (i.e. responsive to a larger region of pixel space) so that the network first creates representations of small parts of the input, then from them assembles representations of larger areas.
* '''Shared weights''': In CNNs, each filter is replicated across the entire visual field. These replicated units share the same parameterization (weight vector and bias) and form a feature map. This means that all the neurons in a given convolutional layer respond to the same feature within their specific response field. Replicating units in this way allows for features to be detected regardless of their position in the visual field, thus constituting a property of [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]].

Together, these properties allow CNNs to achieve better generalization on [[Computer vision|vision problems]]. Weight sharing dramatically reduces the number of [[Free parameter|free parameters]] learned, thus lowering the memory requirements for running the network and allowing the training of larger, more powerful networks.

== Building blocks ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

A CNN architecture is formed by a stack of distinct layers that transform the input volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores) through a differentiable function. A few distinct types of layers are commonly used. These are further discussed below.[[File:Conv layer.png|left|thumb|Neurons of a convolutional layer (blue), connected to their receptive field (red)|229x229px]]

=== Convolutional layer ===
The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN. The layer's parameters consist of a set of learnable [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]] (or [[Kernel (image processing)|kernels]]), which have a small receptive field, but extend through the full depth of the input volume. During the forward pass, each filter is [[Convolution|convolved]] across the width and height of the input volume, computing the [[dot product]] between the entries of the filter and the input and producing a 2-dimensional [[Activation function|activation map]] of that filter. As a result, the network learns filters that activate when it detects some specific type of [[Feature (machine learning)|feature]] at some spatial position in the input.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;When applied to other types of data than image data, such as sound data, "spatial position" may variously correspond to different points in the [[time domain]], [[frequency domain]] or other [[Space (mathematics)|mathematical spaces]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Stacking the activation maps for all filters along the depth dimension forms the full output volume of the convolution layer. Every entry in the output volume can thus also be interpreted as an output of a neuron that looks at a small region in the input and shares parameters with neurons in the same activation map.

==== Local connectivity ====

[[File:Typical cnn.png|thumb|395x395px|Typical CNN architecture]]

When dealing with high-dimensional inputs such as images, it is impractical to connect neurons to all neurons in the previous volume because such a network architecture does not take the spatial structure of the data into account. Convolutional networks exploit spatially local correlation by enforcing a [[Sparse network|sparse local connectivity]] pattern between neurons of adjacent layers: each neuron is connected to only a small region of the input volume.

The extent of this connectivity is a [[Hyperparameter optimization|hyperparameter]] called the [[receptive field]] of the neuron. The connections are [[Spatial Locality|local in space]] (along width and height), but always extend along the entire depth of the input volume. Such an architecture ensures that the learnt filters produce the strongest response to a spatially local input pattern.

==== Spatial arrangement ====

Three [[Hyperparameter (machine learning)|hyperparameters]] control the size of the output volume of the convolutional layer: the depth, [[Stride of an array|stride]] and zero-padding.

* The ''&lt;u&gt;depth&lt;/u&gt;'' of the output volume controls the number of neurons in a layer that connect to the same region of the input volume. These neurons learn to activate for different features in the input. For example, if the first convolutional layer takes the raw image as input, then different neurons along the depth dimension may activate in the presence of various oriented edges, or blobs of color.
*&lt;u&gt;''Stride''&lt;/u&gt; controls how depth columns around the spatial dimensions (width and height) are allocated. When the stride is 1 then we move the filters one pixel at a time. This leads to heavily [[Intersection (set theory)|overlapping]] receptive fields between the columns, and also to large output volumes. When the stride is 2 then the filters jump 2 pixels at a time as they slide around. Similarly, for any integer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;S &gt; 0,&lt;/math&gt; a stride of ''S'' causes the filter to be translated by ''S'' units at a time per output. In practice, stride lengths of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;S \geq 3&lt;/math&gt; are rare. The receptive fields overlap less and the resulting output volume has smaller spatial dimensions when stride length is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/|title=CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition|website=cs231n.github.io|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sometimes it is convenient to pad the input with zeros on the border of the input volume. The size of this padding is a third hyperparameter. Padding provides control of the output volume spatial size. In particular, sometimes it is desirable to exactly preserve the spatial size of the input volume.

The spatial size of the output volume can be computed as a function of the input volume size &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, the kernel field size of the convolutional layer neurons &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, the stride with which they are applied &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and the amount of zero padding &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; used on the border. The formula for calculating how many neurons "fit" in a given volume is given by

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\frac{W-K+2P}{S} + 1.&lt;/math&gt; 

If this number is not an [[integer]], then the strides are incorrect and the neurons cannot be tiled to fit across the input volume in a [[Symmetry|symmetric]] way. In general, setting zero padding to be &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P = (K-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; when the stride is &lt;math&gt;S=1&lt;/math&gt; ensures that the input volume and output volume will have the same size spatially. However, it's not always completely necessary to use all of the neurons of the previous layer. For example, a neural network designer may decide to use just a portion of padding.

==== Parameter sharing ====

A parameter sharing scheme is used in convolutional layers to control the number of free parameters. It relies on one reasonable assumption: if a patch feature is useful to compute at some spatial position, then it should also be useful to compute at other positions. In other words, denoting a single 2-dimensional slice of depth as a '''depth slice''', we constrain the neurons in each depth slice to use the same weights and bias.

Since all neurons in a single depth slice share the same parameters, the forward pass in each depth slice of the convolutional layer can be computed as a [[convolution]] of the neuron's weights with the input volume.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;hence the name "'''convolutional layer'''"&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is common to refer to the sets of weights as a filter (or a [[Kernel (image processing)|kernel]]), which is convolved with the input. The result of this convolution is an [[Activation function|activation map]], and the set of activation maps for each different filter are stacked together along the depth dimension to produce the output volume. Parameter sharing contributes to the [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]] of the CNN architecture.

Sometimes, the parameter sharing assumption may not make sense. This is especially the case when the input images to a CNN have some specific centered structure; for which we expect completely different features to be learned on different spatial locations. One practical example is when the inputs are faces that have been centered in the image: we might expect different eye-specific or hair-specific features to be learned in different parts of the image. In that case it is common to relax the parameter sharing scheme, and instead simply call the layer a "locally connected layer".

=== Pooling layer ===
[[File:Max pooling.png|thumb|314x314px|Max pooling with a 2x2 filter and stride = 2]]
Another important concept of CNNs is pooling, which is a form of non-linear [[Downsampling (signal processing)|down-sampling]]. There are several non-linear functions to implement pooling among which ''max pooling'' is the most common. It [[Partition of a set|partitions]] the input image into a set of non-overlapping rectangles and, for each such sub-region, outputs the maximum. 

Intuitively, the exact location of a feature is less important than its rough location relative to other features. This is the idea behind the use of pooling in convolutional neural networks. The pooling layer serves to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation, to reduce the number of parameters, [[memory footprint]] and amount of computation in the network, and hence to also control [[overfitting]]. It is common to periodically insert a pooling layer between successive convolutional layers in a CNN architecture.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018|reason=This is generally accepted but to someone unfamiliar may be questioned}} The pooling operation provides another form of translation invariance.

The pooling layer operates independently on every depth slice of the input and resizes it spatially. The most common form is a pooling layer with filters of size 2×2 applied with a stride of 2 downsamples at every depth slice in the input by 2 along both width and height, discarding 75% of the activations. In this case, every [[Maximum|max operation]] is over 4 numbers. The depth dimension remains unchanged.

In addition to max pooling, pooling units can use other functions, such as [[average]] pooling or [[Euclidean norm|ℓ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-norm]] pooling. Average pooling was often used historically but has recently fallen out of favor compared to max pooling, which performs better in practice.&lt;ref name="Scherer-ICANN-2010"&gt;{{cite conference

Due to the aggressive reduction in the size of the representation,{{Which?|date=December 2018}} there is a recent trend towards using smaller filters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Fractional Max-Pooling|eprint= 1412.6071|date = 2014-12-18|first = Benjamin|last = Graham|class= cs.CV}}&lt;/ref&gt; or discarding pooling layers altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net|eprint= 1412.6806|date = 2014-12-21|first = Jost Tobias|last = Springenberg|first2 = Alexey|last2 = Dosovitskiy|first3 = Thomas|last3 = Brox|first4 = Martin|last4 = Riedmiller|class= cs.LG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ReLU layer ===
ReLU is the abbreviation of [[Rectifier (neural networks)|rectified linear unit]], which applies the non-saturating [[activation function]] &lt;math alt="function of x equals maximum between zero and x" display="inline"&gt;f(x)=\max(0,x)&lt;/math&gt;. Effectively, it removes negative values from an activation map by setting them to zero. It increases the [[Nonlinearity|nonlinear properties]] of the [[Decision boundary|decision function]] and of the overall network without affecting the receptive fields of the convolution layer.

Other functions are also used to increase nonlinearity, for example the saturating [[hyperbolic tangent]] &lt;math alt="function of x equals hyperbolic tangent of x"&gt;f(x)=\tanh(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math alt="function of x equals absolute value of the hyperbolic tangent of x"&gt;f(x)=|\tanh(x)|&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[sigmoid function]] &lt;math alt="function of x equals the inverse of one plus e to the power of minus x" display="inline"&gt;\sigma(x)=(1+e^{-x} )^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. ReLU is often preferred to other functions because it trains the neural network several times faster without a significant penalty to [[Generalization (learning)|generalization]] accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krizhevsky|first=A.|author2=Sutskever, I. |author3=Hinton, G. E. |title=Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks|journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems |volume=1|year=2012|pages=1097–1105|url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fully connected layer ===
Finally, after several convolutional and max pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done via fully connected layers. Neurons in a fully connected layer have connections to all activations in the previous layer, as seen in regular (non-convolutional) [[Artificial neural network|artificial neural networks]]. Their activations can thus be computed as an [[affine transformation]], with [[matrix multiplication]] followed by a bias offset ([[vector addition]] of a learned or fixed bias term).

=== Loss layer ===
{{Main|Loss function|Loss functions for classification}}
The '''"loss layer"''' specifies how [[training]] penalizes the deviation between the predicted (output) and [[Ground truth|true]] labels and is normally the final layer of a neural network. Various [[Loss function|loss functions]] appropriate for different tasks may be used. 

[[Softmax function|Softmax]] loss is used for predicting a single class of ''K'' mutually exclusive classes.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;So-called [[categorical data]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmoid function|Sigmoid]] [[Cross entropy|cross-entropy]] loss is used for predicting ''K'' independent probability values in &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean]] loss is used for [[Regression (machine learning)|regressing]] to [[Real number|real-valued]] labels &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Choosing hyperparameters ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
CNNs use more [[Hyperparameter (machine learning)|hyperparameters]] than a standard multilayer perceptron (MLP). While the usual rules for [[Learning rate|learning rates]] and [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] constants still apply, the following should be kept in mind when optimizing.

=== Number of filters ===

Since feature map size decreases with depth, layers near the input layer will tend to have fewer filters while higher layers can have more. To equalize computation at each layer, the product of feature values ''v&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' with pixel position is kept roughly constant across layers. Preserving more information about the input would require keeping the total number of activations (number of feature maps times number of pixel positions) non-decreasing from one layer to the next.

The number of feature maps directly controls the capacity and depends on the number of available examples and task complexity.

=== Filter shape ===

Common filter shapes found in the literature vary greatly, and are usually chosen based on the dataset.

The challenge is, thus, to find the right level of granularity so as to create abstractions at the proper scale, given a particular dataset, and without [[overfitting]].

=== Max pooling shape ===

Typical values are 2×2. Very large input volumes may warrant 4×4 pooling in the lower layers. However, choosing larger shapes will dramatically [[Dimensionality reduction|reduce the dimension]] of the signal, and may result in excess [[Data loss|information loss]]. Often, non-overlapping pooling windows perform best.&lt;ref name="Scherer-ICANN-2010" /&gt;

== Regularization methods ==
{{main|Regularization (mathematics)}}{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
[[Regularization (mathematics)|Regularization]] is a process of introducing additional information to solve an [[ill-posed problem]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;or to prevent [[overfitting]]. CNNs use various types of regularization.

=== Empirical ===

==== Dropout ====
Because a fully connected layer occupies most of the parameters, it is prone to [[overfitting]]. One method to reduce overfitting is [[Dropout (neural networks)|dropout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Srivastava|first=Nitish|author2=C. Geoffrey Hinton|author3=Alex Krizhevsky |author4=Ilya Sutskever |author5=Ruslan Salakhutdinov|title=Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from overfitting|journal=Journal of Machine Learning Research |year=2014|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1929–1958|url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/srivastava14a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DLPATTERNS"&gt;{{Cite web | title=A Pattern Language for Deep Learning| author=Carlos E. Perez| url=http://www.deeplearningpatterns.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At each training stage, individual nodes are either "dropped out" of the net with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt; or kept with probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, so that a reduced network is left; incoming and outgoing edges to a dropped-out node are also removed. Only the reduced network is trained on the data in that stage. The removed nodes are then reinserted into the network with their original weights.

In the training stages, the probability that a hidden node will be dropped is usually 0.5; for input nodes, this should be much lower, intuitively because information is directly lost when input nodes are ignored.

At testing time after training has finished, we would ideally like to find a sample average of all possible &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; dropped-out networks; unfortunately this is unfeasible for large values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. However, we can find an approximation by using the full network with each node's output weighted by a factor of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, so the expected value of the output of any node is the same as in the training stages. This is the biggest contribution of the dropout method: although it effectively generates &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; neural nets, and as such allows for model combination, at test time only a single network needs to be tested.

By avoiding training all nodes on all training data, dropout decreases overfitting. The method also significantly improves training speed. This makes model combination practical, even for deep neural nets. The technique seems to reduce node interactions, leading them to learn more robust features that better generalize to new data.

==== DropConnect ====

DropConnect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Regularization of Neural Networks using DropConnect {{!}} ICML 2013 {{!}} JMLR W&amp;CP|url = http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/wan13.html|website = jmlr.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the generalization of dropout in which each connection, rather than each output unit, can be dropped with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt;. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer.

DropConnect is similar to dropout as it introduces dynamic sparsity within the model, but differs in that the sparsity is on the weights, rather than the output vectors of a layer. In other words, the fully connected layer with DropConnect becomes a sparsely connected layer in which the connections are chosen at random during the training stage.

==== Stochastic pooling ====

A major drawback to Dropout is that it does not have the same benefits for convolutional layers, where the neurons are not fully connected.

In stochastic pooling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Stochastic Pooling for Regularization of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks|eprint= 1301.3557|date = 2013-01-15|first = Matthew D.|last = Zeiler|first2 = Rob|last2 = Fergus|class= cs.LG}}&lt;/ref&gt; the conventional [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] pooling operations are replaced with a stochastic procedure, where the activation within each pooling region is picked randomly according to a [[multinomial distribution]], given by the activities within the pooling region. The approach is hyperparameter free and can be combined with other regularization approaches, such as dropout and data augmentation.

An alternate view of stochastic pooling is that it is equivalent to standard max pooling but with many copies of an input image, each having small local deformations. This is similar to explicit elastic deformations of the input images,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Best Practices for Convolutional Neural Networks Applied to Visual Document Analysis – Microsoft Research|url = http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=68920|website = research.microsoft.com|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which delivers excellent MNIST performance. Using stochastic pooling in a multilayer model gives an exponential number of deformations since the selections in higher layers are independent of those below.

==== Artificial data ====

Since the degree of model overfitting is determined by both its power and the amount of training it receives, providing a convolutional network with more training examples can reduce overfitting. Since these networks are usually trained with all available data, one approach is to either generate new data from scratch (if possible) or perturb existing data to create new ones. For example, input images could be asymmetrically cropped by a few percent to create new examples with the same label as the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|title = Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors|eprint=1207.0580|last1= Hinton|first1=Geoffrey E.|last2=Srivastava|first2=Nitish|last3=Krizhevsky|first3=Alex|last4=Sutskever|first4=Ilya|last5= Salakhutdinov|first5=Ruslan R.|class=cs.NE|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Explicit ===

==== Early stopping ====
{{main|Early stopping}}
One of the simplest methods to prevent overfitting of a network is to simply stop the training before overfitting has had a chance to occur. It comes with the disadvantage that the learning process is halted.

==== Number of parameters ====
Another simple way to prevent overfitting is to limit the number of parameters, typically by limiting the number of hidden units in each layer or limiting network depth. For convolutional networks, the filter size also affects the number of parameters. Limiting the number of parameters restricts the predictive power of the network directly, reducing the complexity of the function that it can perform on the data, and thus limits the amount of overfitting. This is equivalent to a "[[zero norm]]".

==== Weight decay ====
A simple form of added regularizer is weight decay, which simply adds an additional error, proportional to the sum of weights ([[L1-norm|L1 norm]]) or squared magnitude ([[L2 norm]]) of the weight vector, to the error at each node. The level of acceptable model complexity can be reduced by increasing the proportionality constant, thus increasing the penalty for large weight vectors.

L2 regularization is the most common form of regularization. It can be implemented by penalizing the squared magnitude of all parameters directly in the objective. The L2 regularization has the intuitive interpretation of heavily penalizing peaky weight vectors and preferring diffuse weight vectors. Due to multiplicative interactions between weights and inputs this has the useful property of encouraging the network to use all of its inputs a little rather than some of its inputs a lot.

L1 regularization is another common form. It is possible to combine L1 with L2 regularization (this is called [[Elastic net regularization]]). The L1 regularization leads the weight vectors to become sparse during optimization. In other words, neurons with L1 regularization end up using only a sparse subset of their most important inputs and become nearly invariant to the noisy inputs.

==== Max norm constraints ====
Another form of regularization is to enforce an absolute upper bound on the magnitude of the weight vector for every neuron and use [[Sparse approximation#Projected Gradient Descent|projected gradient descent]] to enforce the constraint. In practice, this corresponds to performing the parameter update as normal, and then enforcing the constraint by clamping the weight vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{w}&lt;/math&gt; of every neuron to satisfy &lt;math&gt;\|\vec{w}\|_{2}&lt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Typical values of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are order of 3–4. Some papers report improvements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting|url = http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html|website = jmlr.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; when using this form of regularization.

== Hierarchical coordinate frames ==
Pooling loses the precise spatial relationships between high-level parts (such as nose and mouth in a face image). These relationships are needed for identity recognition. Overlapping the pools so that each feature occurs in multiple pools, helps retain the information. Translation alone cannot extrapolate the understanding of geometric relationships to a radically new viewpoint, such as a different orientation or scale. On the other hand, people are very good at extrapolating; after seeing a new shape once they can recognize it from a different viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hinton | first1 = Geoffrey | year = 1979 | title = Some demonstrations of the effects of structural descriptions in mental imagery | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 231–250 | doi=10.1016/s0364-0213(79)80008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the common way to deal with this problem is to train the network on transformed data in different orientations, scales, lighting, etc. so that the network can cope with these variations. This is computationally intensive for large data-sets. The alternative is to use a hierarchy of coordinate frames and to use a group of neurons to represent a conjunction of the shape of the feature and its pose relative to the [[retina]]. The pose relative to retina is the relationship between the coordinate frame of the retina and the intrinsic features' coordinate frame.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Irvin. "The frame of reference." The legacy of Solomon Asch: Essays in cognition and social psychology (1990): 243–268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, one way of representing something is to embed the coordinate frame within it. Once this is done, large features can be recognized by using the consistency of the poses of their parts (e.g. nose and mouth poses make a consistent prediction of the pose of the whole face). Using this approach ensures that the higher level entity (e.g. face) is present when the lower level (e.g. nose and mouth) agree on its prediction of the pose. The vectors of neuronal activity that represent pose ("pose vectors") allow spatial transformations modeled as linear operations that make it easier for the network to learn the hierarchy of visual entities and generalize across viewpoints. This is similar to the way the human [[visual system]] imposes coordinate frames in order to represent shapes.&lt;ref&gt;J.

They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters, an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into fine-grained categories such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this.

In 2015 a many-layered CNN demonstrated the ability to spot faces from a wide range of angles, including upside down, even when partially occluded, with competitive performance. The network was trained on a database of 200,000 images that included faces at various angles and orientations and a further 20 million images without faces. They used batches of 128 images over 50,000 iterations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/view/535201/the-face-detection-algorithm-set-to-revolutionize-image-search|title = The Face Detection Algorithm Set To Revolutionize Image Search|last = |first = |date = February 16, 2015|work = Technology Review|accessdate = 27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video analysis ===
Compared to image data domains, there is relatively little work on applying CNNs to video classification. Video is more complex than images since it has another (temporal) dimension. However, some extensions of CNNs into the video domain have been explored. One approach is to treat space and time as equivalent dimensions of the input and perform convolutions in both time and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-25446-8_4|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2011-11-16|isbn = 978-3-642-25445-1|pages = 29–39|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|first = Moez|last = Baccouche|first2 = Franck|last2 = Mamalet|first3 = Christian|last3 = Wolf|first4 = Christophe|last4 = Garcia|first5 = Atilla|last5 = Baskurt|editor-first = Albert Ali|editor-last = Salah|editor-first2 = Bruno|editor-last2 = Lepri|doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-25446-8_4|chapter = Sequential Deep Learning for Human Action Recognition|title = Human Behavior Unterstanding|volume = 7065}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Human Action Recognition|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165309|journal = IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 0162-8828|pages = 221–231|volume = 35|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/TPAMI.2012.59|pmid = 22392705|first = Shuiwang|last = Ji|first2 = Wei|last2 = Xu|first3 = Ming|last3 = Yang|first4 = Kai|last4 = Yu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way is to fuse the features of two convolutional neural networks, one for the spatial and one for the temporal stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv | last=Huang | first=Jie | last2=Zhou | first2=Wengang | last3=Zhang | first3=Qilin | last4=Li | first4=Houqiang | last5=Li | first5=Weiping | title=Video-based Sign Language Recognition without Temporal Segmentation |eprint=1801.10111| class=cs.CV | year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karpathy, Andrej, et al.

=== Drug discovery ===
CNNs have been used in [[drug discovery]]. Predicting the interaction between molecules and biological [[proteins]] can identify potential treatments. In 2015, Atomwise introduced AtomNet, the first deep learning neural network for structure-based [[Drug design|rational drug design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = AtomNet: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Bioactivity Prediction in Structure-based Drug Discovery|eprint= 1510.02855|date = 2015-10-09|first = Izhar|last = Wallach|first2 = Michael|last2 = Dzamba|first3 = Abraham|last3 = Heifets|class= cs.LG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system trains directly on 3-dimensional representations of chemical interactions.

=== Health Risk Assessment and Biomarkers of Aging discovery ===

CNNs can be naturally tailored to analyze a sufficiently large collection of time series representing one week long human physical activity streams augmented by the rich clinical data (including the death register, as provided by, e.g., the [[NHANES]] study). A simple CNN was combined with Cox-Gompertz [[proportional hazards model]] and used to produce a proof-of-concept example of digital [[biomarkers of aging]] in the form of all-causes-mortality predictor.&lt;ref name="pmid 29581467"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Tim Pyrkov, Konstantin Slipensky, Mikhail Barg, Alexey Kondrashin, Boris Zhurov, Alexander Zenin, Mikhail Pyatnitskiy, Leonid Menshikov, Sergei Markov, and Peter O.

=== Checkers ===
CNNs have been used in the game of [[Draughts|checkers]]. From 1999 to 2001, [[David B. Fogel|Fogel]] and Chellapilla published papers showing how a convolutional neural network could learn to play checkers using co-evolution. The learning process did not use prior human professional games, but rather focused on a minimal set of information contained in the checkerboard: the location and type of pieces, and {{clarify span|the piece differential|date=January 2018}}. Ultimately, the program ([[Blondie24]]) was tested on 165 games against players and ranked in the highest 0.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18252639 | doi=10.1109/72.809083 | volume=10 | issue=6 | title=Evolving neural networks to play checkers without relying on expert knowledge | journal=IEEE Trans Neural Netw | pages=1382–91 | last1 = Chellapilla | first1 = K | last2 = Fogel | first2 = DB| year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/942536/&lt;/ref&gt; It also earned a win against the program [[Chinook (draughts player)|Chinook]] at its "expert" level of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fogel |first= David |date= 2001 |title= Blondie24: Playing at the Edge of AI |location= San Francisco, CA|publisher= Morgan Kaufmann|page= |isbn= 1558607838|author-link= David B. Fogel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Go ===
CNNs have been used in [[computer Go]]. In December 2014, Clark and Storkey published a paper showing that a CNN trained by supervised learning from a database of human professional games could outperform [[GNU Go]] and win some games against [[Monte Carlo tree search]] Fuego 1.1 in a fraction of the time it took Fuego to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|eprint=1412.3409|last1=Clark|first1=Christopher|title=Teaching Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to Play Go|last2=Storkey|first2=Amos|class=cs.AI|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was announced that a large 12-layer convolutional neural network had correctly predicted the professional move in 55% of positions, equalling the accuracy of a [[Go ranks and ratings|6 dan]] human player. When the trained convolutional network was used directly to play games of Go, without any search, it beat the traditional search program [[GNU Go]] in 97% of games, and matched the performance of the [[Monte Carlo tree search]] program Fuego simulating ten thousand playouts (about a million positions) per move.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|eprint=1412.6564|last1= Maddison|first1= Chris J.|title= Move Evaluation in Go Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks|last2= Huang|first2= Aja|last3= Sutskever|first3= Ilya|last4= Silver|first4= David|class= cs.LG|year= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple of CNNs for choosing moves to try ("policy network") and evaluating positions ("value network") driving MCTS were used by [[AlphaGo]], the first to beat the best human player at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deepmind.com/alpha-go.html|title=AlphaGo – Google DeepMind|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fine-tuning ==
For many applications, little training data is available. Convolutional neural networks usually require a large amount of training data in order to avoid [[overfitting]]. A common technique is to train the network on a larger data set from a related domain. Once the network parameters have converged an additional training step is performed using the in-domain data to fine-tune the network weights. This allows convolutional networks to be successfully applied to problems with small training sets.&lt;ref&gt;Durjoy Sen Maitra; Ujjwal Bhattacharya; S.K.

[[File:Eddie August Schneider (1911-1940) death certificate.gif|thumb|[[Eddie August Schneider]]'s (1911-1940) death certificate, issued in [[New York (state)|New York]].]]
The phrase '''death certificate''' can refer either to a document issued by a medical practitioner certifying the deceased state of a person or, popularly, to a document issued by a person such as a registrar of [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]] that declares the date, location and [[cause of death|cause]] of a person's [[death]] as later entered in an official register of deaths.

==Nature of a certificate==
Each governmental jurisdiction prescribes the form of the document for use in its preview and the procedures necessary to legally produce it. One purpose of the certificate is to review the cause of death to determine if foul-play occurred as it can rule out an accidental death or a murder going by the findings and ruling of the medical examiner.  It may also be required in order to arrange a burial or cremation to provide [[Prima facia|prima facie]] evidence of the fact of death, which can be used to prove a person's will or to claim on a person's life insurance. Lastly, death certificates are used in [[public health]] to compile data on [[List of causes of death by rate|leading causes of death]] among other statistics (See: [[Descriptive statistics]])

Before issuing a death certificate, the authorities usually require a certificate from a [[physician]] or [[coroner]] to validate the [[cause of death]] and the identity of the deceased.  In cases where it is not completely clear that a person is dead (usually because their body is being sustained by [[life support]]), a [[neurologist]] is often called in to verify [[brain death]] and to fill out the appropriate documentation. The failure of a physician to immediately submit the required form to the government (to trigger issuance of the death certificate) is often both a [[crime]] and cause for loss of one's license to practice.  This is because of past scandals in which dead people continued to receive public benefits or voted in elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/17848541/detail.html#-, |title=Dead People Voting Throughout Florida |date=30 Oct 2008 |work=WFTV Orlando |accessdate=26 December 2010 |location=VOLUSIA COUNTY, Fla. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523090407/http://www.wftv.com/news/17848541/detail.html |archivedate=23 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Death certificates may also be issued pursuant to a [[Court of law|court order]] or an [[Executive (government)|executive order]] in the case of individuals who have been [[declared death in absentia|declared dead ''in absentia'']]. [[Missing person]]s and victims of mass disasters (such as the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'') may be issued death certificates in one of these manners.

In some jurisdictions, a [[police officer]] or a [[paramedic]] may be allowed to sign a death certificate under specific circumstances. This is usually when the cause of death seems obvious and no foul play is suspected, such as in extreme old age. In such cases, an [[autopsy]] is rarely performed. This varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; in some areas police officers may sign death certificates for victims of [[sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]],{{Citation needed|date = July 2013}} but in others all deaths of individuals under 18 must be certified by a physician. Accident deaths where there is no chance of survival (decapitations, for instance) may be certified by police or paramedics, but autopsies are still commonly performed if there is any chance that [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s played a role in the accident.

A full explanation of the cause of death includes four items:
* the immediate cause of death, such as the heart stopping,
* the intermediate causes, which triggered the immediate cause, such as a [[myocardial infarction]],
* the underlying causes, which triggered the chain of events leading to death, such as [[atherosclerosis]], and
* any other diseases and disorders the person had at the time of death, even though they did not directly cause the death.&lt;ref name="Altman"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/health/making-the-right-call-even-in-death.html|title=Making the Right Call, Even in Death|last=Altman|first=Lawrence K.|date=1 July 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public documents==
{{globalize|section|date=June 2018}}
In most of the [[United States]], death certificates are considered public domain documents and can therefore be obtained for any individual regardless of the requester's relationship to the deceased. Other jurisdictions take a different view, and restrict the issue of certificates. For example, in the State of New York, death certificates are only obtainable by close relatives, including the spouse, parent, child or sibling of the deceased, and other persons who have a documented lawful right or claim, documented medical need, or a New York State Court Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.ny.gov/vital_records/death.htm|title=Death Certificates|publisher=New York State Department of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In Europe and North America, death records were kept by the local churches, along with baptism and marriage records.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;  In what would become the United States, the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] was the first to have the secular courts keep these records, in 1639.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;  By the end of the 19th century, European countries were pursuing centralized systems for recording deaths.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;

In the United States, a standard model death certificate was developed around 1910.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;  This promoted uniformity and consistency in record keeping.

==Specific jurisdictions==

===United States===
[[File:John Wayne Gacy certificate of death.jpg|thumb|[[Illinois]] certificate of death issued after the execution of [[John Wayne Gacy]].]]
In the United States, certificates issued to the general public for deaths after 1990 may in some states be redacted to erase the specific cause of death (in cases where death was from [[natural causes]]) to comply with [[HIV]] [[confidentiality]] rules. In New York State, for instance, the cause of death on a general death certificate is only specified if death was accidental, homicide, suicide, or [[Declared death in absentia|declared in absentia]]; all other deaths are only referred to as [[Natural death|natural]]. All states have provisions, however, whereby immediate family members, law enforcement agencies, and governmental authorities (such as occupational health and safety groups) are able to obtain death certificates containing the full cause of death, even in cases of natural death.

In some cases, such as the death of a minor or infant, certificates may be kept confidential from the public as requested by legal guardian and therefore cannot be obtained by the general public but rather through immediate family members.

===United Kingdom===
Registration in the UK is organised separately in the constituent jurisdictions. A register of deaths contains the information supplied by an informant, nowadays usually containing and repeating the information given in a ''Medical Certificate of Death'' (MCOD) supplied by the medical practitioner who certifies that life is extinct, this being the real "death certificate" distinct from the "registration of a death" in a register. Further information might be added after the first registration if the death was the subject of an inquest (Northern Ireland or England and Wales) or a [[Fatal Accident Inquiry]] (Scotland); this can result in a later copy of a death registration giving more details of the cause of death or the associated circumstances.

====England and Wales====
In England and Wales, compulsory national registration of deaths began in 1837. Originally the death registration listed when and where a person died, their name and surname, the parent or parents (if the deceased was a child), sex, age, occupation, cause of death, the description and residence of the informant, when the death was registered and the registrar's signature. Further details have since been recorded including the deceased's date and place of birth, maiden surnames and other former surnames of women who have been divorced.

Beginning in 1879, a doctor's certificate was necessary for the issuance of a death certificate (prior to that, no cause of death needed to be given).

====Northern Ireland====
The form of indexing and the layout of register pages generally follows that of England and Wales.

====Scotland====
National registration began in 1855; registrations are rather more detailed&lt;ref name=GROS&gt;{{cite web|title=Items Included in the Main Registers |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/regscot/items-included-in-the-registers.html |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland |accessdate=14 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608112918/http://gro-scotland.gov.uk/regscot/items-included-in-the-registers.html |archivedate=8 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  than in England and Wales. In the first year of registration many more details than in later years were recorded including the children of the deceased with their ages, the deceased's birthplace and how long they were resident in the district where they died. The burial place was recorded from 1855 to 1860. Standard details have until now included the deceased's name, age, marital status, spouse(s) (if any), details of both parents, cause of death and the informant's description. Current (2011) registrations show the date of birth. The prescribed forms are part of secondary legislation and those for recent years can thus be seen online in the [http://legislation.gov.uk Statute Law Database].

Unlike England and Wales, information is not limited to being supplied in the form of certified copies; original register pages (or filmed images) can be viewed in person at local register offices or at the General Register Office in Edinburgh, online (fees apply) on the [http://scotlandspeople.gov.uk Scotlands People] website or in microfilms (1855-1875, 1881, 1891) available at family history centres operated by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

===United Kingdom's Crown dependencies and British Overseas Territories===
These jurisdictions do not form part of the United Kingdom and each has its own registration system. Their older records tend to follow the layout used in England and Wales.

==Stillbirths==

===England and Wales===
[[Stillbirth]]s (beyond 24 weeks gestation) have been registered since 1927 in a register that is closed from public access. A single stillbirth registration takes the place of both birth and death registration for the stillborn infant. Prior to 1960 such certificates gave no cause of death.

Stillbirth certificates can only be ordered by the mother or father of the deceased contacting the General Register Office by phone or letter. In the event of the parents both having died, an adult sibling can order the certificate if they can provide the dates of death for both parents.

===Scotland===
Registration of still-births commenced in 1939. The registers are not open to public view and extracts are only issued "in exceptional circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office Leaflet S1 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
A 2007 article in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine revealed that in the case of a stillbirth it is not standard practice to issue both a [[birth certificate]] and a death certificate. Most states instead issue a "certificate of birth resulting in stillbirth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingangelsbill.org|title=Welcome to MISSing Angels Bill|author=|date=|website=www.missingangelsbill.org|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33355">{{hatnote|For specific emerging technologies, see the [[List of emerging technologies]]}}

'''Emerging technologies''' are technologies that are perceived as capable of changing the status quo. These technologies are generally new but include older technologies that are still controversial and relatively undeveloped in potential, such as [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] and [[gene therapy]] which date to 1989 and 1990 respectively.

Emerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty, relatively fast growth, coherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and ambiguity. In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as "a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes. Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous.".&lt;ref&gt;Rotolo, D., Hicks, D., Martin, B. R. (2015) What is an emerging technology? Research Policy 44(10): 1827–1843. Available [https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2564094 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerging technologies include a variety of technologies such as [[educational technology]], [[information technology]], [[nanotechnology]], [[biotechnology]], [[cognitive science]], psychotechnology, [[robotics]], and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;other examples of developments described as "emerging technologies" can be found [http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/18/keynotes.html here] – O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference 2008 .&lt;/ref&gt;

New technological fields may result from the [[technological convergence]] of different systems evolving towards similar goals. Convergence brings previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video together so that they share resources and interact with each other, creating new efficiencies.

Emerging technologies are those technical innovations which represent progressive developments within a field for [[economic competition|competitive advantage]];&lt;ref&gt;International Congress Innovation and Technology XXI: Strategies and Policies Towards the XXI Century, &amp; Soares, O. D. D. (1997). Innovation and technology: Strategies and policies. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals. However, the opinion on the degree of the impact, status and economic viability of several emerging and converging technologies.

== History of emerging technologies==
{{main|History of technology}}
In the [[history of technology]], emerging technologies&lt;ref&gt;Emerging Technologies: From Hindsight to Foresight. Edited by Edna F. Einsiedel. UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerging technologies: where is the federal government on the high tech curve? : hearing before the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology of the Committee on Government Reform, House of Representatives, One Hundred Sixth Congress, second session, April 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; are contemporary advances and innovation in various fields of [[technology]].

Over centuries innovative methods and new technologies are developed and opened up. Some of these technologies are due to theoretical research, and others from commercial [[research and development]].

Technological growth includes incremental developments and [[disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]]. An example of the former was the gradual roll-out of [[DVD]] (digital video disc) as a development intended to follow on from the previous optical technology [[compact disc]]. By contrast, disruptive technologies are those where a new method replaces the previous technology and makes it redundant, for example, the replacement of horse-drawn carriages by automobiles and other vehicles.

== Emerging technology debates  ==
{{see also|Technology and society}}
Many writers, including [[computer scientist]] [[Bill Joy]],&lt;ref&gt;See: ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]",&lt;/ref&gt; have identified clusters of  technologies that they consider critical to humanity's future. Joy warns that the technology could be used by elites for [[Good and evil|good]] or [[evil]]. They could use it as "good shepherds" for the rest of humanity, or decide everyone else is superfluous and push for mass extinction of those made unnecessary by technology.&lt;ref name="Joy 2000"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Joy, Bill| author-link = Bill Joy | title = Why the future doesn't need us | date = 2000 | url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy_pr.html| accessdate=2005-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the benefits of [[technological change]] typically see emerging and converging technologies as offering hope for the betterment of the [[human condition]]. Cyberphilosophers [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] argue in ''The Futurica Trilogy'' that while Man himself is basically constant throughout human history ([[Genetics|genes]] change very slowly), all relevant change is rather a direct or indirect result of technological innovation ([[Memetics|memes]] change very fast) since new ideas always emanate from technology use and not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=9187173247|title=The Futurica Trilogy|first1=Alexander|last1=Bard|first2=Jan|last2=Söderqvist|date=8 May 2012|publisher=Stockholm Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man should consequently be regarded as history's main constant and technology as its main variable. However, critics of the risks of technological change, and even some advocates such as [[transhumanist]] philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]], warn that some of these technologies could pose dangers, perhaps even contribute to the [[human extinction|extinction of humanity]] itself; i.e., some of them could involve [[existential risk]]s.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Bostrom, Nick| author-link = Nick Bostrom| title = Existential risks: analyzing human extinction scenarios| date = 2002 | url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html| accessdate=2006-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Warwick|Warwick, K]]: “March of the Machines”, University of Illinois Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Much [[ethics of technology|ethical debate]] centers on issues of [[distributive justice]] in allocating access to beneficial forms of technology. Some thinkers, such as [[environmental ethics|environmental ethicist]] [[Bill McKibben]], oppose the continuing development of advanced technology partly out of fear that its benefits will be distributed unequally in ways that could worsen the [[economic inequality|plight of the poor]].&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=McKibben, Bill|author-link=Bill McKibben|title=Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age|publisher=Times Books|date=2003|isbn=0-8050-7096-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[inventor]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] is among [[techno-utopianism|techno-utopians]] who believe that emerging and converging technologies could and will [[post scarcity|eliminate poverty]] and abolish suffering.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = Kurzweil, Raymond| author-link = Raymond Kurzweil| title = [[The Singularity Is Near|The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology]] | publisher = Viking Adult| date = 2005 | isbn = 0-670-03384-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts such as Martin Ford, author of ''The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future'',&lt;ref name="Ford2009Lights"&gt;{{Ford 2009 The lights in the tunnel}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that as information technology advances, robots and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant [[unemployment]] as machines and software begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine jobs.

As robotics and artificial intelligence develop further, even many skilled jobs may be threatened. Technologies such as machine learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://econfuture.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/machine-learning-a-job-killer/|title=Machine Learning: A job killer?|first=|last=econfuture|date=14 April 2011|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; may ultimately allow computers to do many knowledge-based jobs that require significant education. This may result in substantial unemployment at all skill levels, stagnant or falling wages for most workers, and increased concentration of income and wealth as the owners of capital capture an ever-larger fraction of the economy. This in turn could lead to depressed consumer spending and economic growth as the bulk of the population lacks sufficient discretionary income to purchase the products and services produced by the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://singularityhub.com/2009/12/15/martin-ford-asks-will-automation-lead-to-economic-collapse/|title=Martin Ford Asks: Will Automation Lead to Economic Collapse?|first=Aaron|last=Saenz|date=15 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

{{Main|List of emerging technologies}}

=== Artificial intelligence ===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence|Outline of artificial intelligence}}

''Artificial intelligence'' (''AI'') is the sub intelligence exhibited by machines or software, and the branch of [[computer science]] that develops machines and software with animal-like intelligence. Major AI researchers and textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents", where an [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], who coined the term in 1942, defines it as "the study of making intelligent machines".

The central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, [[natural language processing]] (communication), [[perception]] and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (or "[[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]") is still among the field's long-term goals. Currently popular approaches include deep learning, statistical methods, computational intelligence and traditional symbolic AI. There are an enormous number of tools used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, methods based on probability and economics, and many others.

=== 3D Printing ===
{{Main|3D Printing}}
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, has been posited by [[Jeremy Rifkin]] and others as part of the [[Digital Revolution|third industrial revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thethirdindustrialrevolution.com/|title=Home – Office of Jeremy Rifkin|website=Office of Jeremy Rifkin|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with Internet technology, 3D printing would allow for digital blueprints of virtually any material product to be sent instantly to another person to be produced on the spot, making purchasing a product online almost instantaneous.

Although this technology is still too crude to produce most products, it is rapidly developing and created a controversy in 2013 around the issue of 3D printed guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/3d-printed-guns-are-only-getting-better-and-scarier-1677747439|title=3D-Printed Guns Are Only Getting Better, and Scarier|first=Adam Clark|last=Estes|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene therapy ===

{{Main|Gene therapy}}
{{See also|Genetic engineering timeline}}

Gene therapy was first successfully demonstrated in late 1990/early 1991 for [[adenosine deaminase deficiency]], though the treatment was somatic – that is, did not affect the patient's germ line and thus was not heritable. This led the way to treatments for other genetic diseases and increased interest in [[germ line gene therapy]] – therapy affecting the gametes and descendants of patients.

Between September 1990 and January 2014 there were around 2,000 gene therapy trials conducted or approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/genmed/clinical/|title=Gene Therapy Clinical Trials Worldwide|website=www.wiley.com|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer vaccines ===
{{Main|Cancer vaccine}}

A ''cancer vaccine'' is a [[vaccine]] that treats existing [[cancer]] or prevents the development of cancer in certain high-risk individuals. Vaccines that treat existing cancer are known as ''therapeutic'' cancer vaccines. There are currently no vaccines able to prevent cancer in general.

On April 14, 2009, [[Dendreon]] Corporation announced that their Phase III clinical trial of [[Provenge]], a cancer vaccine designed to treat prostate cancer, had demonstrated an increase in survival. It received [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)  approval for use in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer patients on April 29, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ApprovedProducts/ucm210215.htm |date=2010-04-29 |title=Approval Letter – Provenge |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approval of Provenge has stimulated interest in this type of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/analysis-and-insight/what-comes-after-dendreon-s-provenge/77899342/ |title=What Comes After Dendreon’s Provenge? |date=18 Oct 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''In vitro'' meat ===
{{Main|In vitro meat}}

''In vitro meat'', also called ''cultured meat'', ''clean meat'', ''cruelty-free meat'', ''shmeat'', and ''test-tube meat'', is an animal-flesh product that has never been part of a living animal with exception of the [[fetal calf serum]] taken from a slaughtered cow.  In the 21st century, several research projects have worked on ''in vitro'' meat in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |last = Siegelbaum |first = D.J. |title = In Search of a Test-Tube Hamburger |publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date = 2008-04-23 |url = http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1734630,00.html?imw=Y |accessdate = 2009-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cultured meat#First public trial|first in vitro beefburger]], created by a Dutch team, was eaten at a demonstration for the press in London in August 2013.&lt;ref name=BBC5Aug&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23576143|title=World's first lab-grown burger is eaten in London|date=5 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There remain difficulties to be overcome before ''in vitro'' meat becomes commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/science/engineering-the-325000-in-vitro-burger.html|title=Engineering the $325,000 In Vitro Burger|first=Henry|last=Fountain|date=12 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultured meat is prohibitively expensive, but it is expected that the cost could be reduced to compete with that of conventionally obtained meat as technology improves.&lt;ref name="no-kill carnivore"&gt;{{cite news |last= Temple |first= James |title = The Future of Food: The No-kill Carnivore |publisher = [[Portfolio.com]] |date = 2009-02-23 |url = http://www.portfolio.com/views/columns/dual-perspectives/2009/02/23/The-No-kill-Carnivore|accessdate = 2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pharma Concepts"&gt;[http://www.new-harvest.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/culturedmeatecon.pdf Preliminary Economics Study of Cultured Meat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003000000/http://www.new-harvest.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/culturedmeatecon.pdf |date=October 3, 2015 }}, eXmoor Pharma Concepts, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''In vitro'' meat is also an ethical issue. Some argue that it is less objectionable than traditionally obtained meat because it doesn't involve killing and reduces the risk of animal cruelty, while others disagree with eating meat that has not developed naturally.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Nanotechnology ===
{{Main|Nanotechnology|Outline of nanotechnology}}

''Nanotechnology'' (sometimes shortened to ''nanotech'') is the manipulation of matter on an [[atom]]ic, [[molecular]], and [[Supramolecular chemistry|supramolecular]] scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology&lt;ref name=Engines1&gt;{{cite book|last=Drexler|first=K. Eric|title=Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology|date=1986|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=0-385-19973-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nanotsystems&gt;{{cite book|last=Drexler|first=K. Eric|title=Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation|date=1992|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-57547-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as [[molecular nanotechnology]]. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]], which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 [[nanometers]]. This definition reflects the fact that [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects are important at this [[quantum realm|quantum-realm]] scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold.

=== Robotics ===
{{Main|Robotics|Outline of robotics}}

''Robotics'' is the branch of [[technology]] that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of [[robot]]s,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite web|title=robotics|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0714530#m_en_gb0714530|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, and/or cognition. A good example of robots which resembles humans is [[Sophia (robot)|Sophia]], a social [[humanoid robot]] developed by [[Hong Kong]]-based company [[Hanson Robotics Limited|Hanson Robotics]] which was activated on April 19, 2015. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of [[bio-inspired robotics]].

=== Stem cell therapy ===
{{Main|Stem cell therapy}}

''Stem cell therapy'' is an intervention strategy that introduces new adult stem cells into damaged tissue in order to treat disease or injury. Many [[medical research]]ers believe that stem cell treatments have the potential to change the face of human disease and alleviate suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindvall |first1=O. |last2=Kokaia |first2=Z. |date=2006 |title=Stem cells for the treatment of neurological disorders |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue= 7097| doi = 10.1038/nature04960 | pmid=16810245 |pages=1094–1096 |bibcode=2006Natur.441.1094L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of [[stem cell]]s to self-renew and give rise to subsequent generations with variable degrees of differentiation capacities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81692-X |author=Weissman IL |title=Stem cells: units of development, units of regeneration, and units in evolution |journal=Cell |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=157–68 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10647940 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674(00)81692-X}} as cited in {{cite journal |author=Gurtner GC|author2=Callaghan MJ|author3=Longaker MT |title=Progress and potential for regenerative medicine |journal=Annu.

=== Distributed ledger technology===
{{Main|Blockchain|Smart contracts}}''Distributed ledger'' or ''blockchain technology'' is a technology which provides transparent and immutable lists of transactions. Blockchains can enable autonomous transactions through the use of [[smart contract]]s. Smart contracts are self-executing transactions which occur when pre-defined conditions are met. The original idea of a smart contract was conceived by [[Nick Szabo]] in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html|title=Nick Szabo -- Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets|website=www.fon.hum.uva.nl|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these original theories about how these smart contracts could work remained unrealised because there was no technology to support programmable agreements and transactions between parties. His example of a smart contract was the vending machine that holds goods until money has been received and then the goods are released to the buyer. The machine holds the property and is able to enforce the contract. There were two main issues that needed to be addressed before smart contracts could be used in the real world. Firstly, the control of physical assets by smart contracts to be able to enforce agreements. Secondly, the last of trustworthy computers that are reliable and trusted to execute the contract between two or more parties. It is only with the advent of [[cryptocurrency]] and [[encryption]] that the technology for smart contracts has come to fruition. Many potential applications of smart contracts have been suggested that go beyond the transfer of value from one party to another, such as supply chain management, electronic voting, law and the internet of things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2017/581948/EPRS_IDA(2017)581948_EN.pdf How blockchain technology could change our lives] - European Parliamentary Research Service&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Innovation Through Blockchain: The B3 Perspective|last=Vincenzo|first=Morabito|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=101–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of emerging technologies ==
As innovation drives economic growth, and large economic rewards come from new inventions, a great deal of resources (funding and effort) go into the development of emerging technologies.  Some of the sources of these resources are described below...

=== Research and development ===
[[Research and development]] is directed towards the advancement of technology in general, and therefore includes development of emerging technologies.  ''See also [[List of countries by research and development spending]].''

[[Applied research]] is a form of systematic inquiry involving the practical application of science. It accesses and uses some part of the research communities' (the academia's) accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, often state-, business-, or client-driven purpose.

[[Science policy]] is the area of public policy which is concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the science and research enterprise, including the funding of science, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring.

=== DARPA ===
The [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] is an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.

DARPA was created in 1958 as the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Its purpose was to formulate and execute research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, with the aim to reach beyond immediate military requirements.

Projects funded by DARPA have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as the [[ARPANET|Internet]] and Global Positioning System technology.

=== Technology competitions and awards ===
There are awards that provide incentive to push the limits of technology (generally synonymous with emerging technologies).  Note that while some of these awards reward achievement after-the-fact via analysis of the merits of technological breakthroughs, others provide incentive via competitions for awards offered for goals yet to be achieved.

The [[Orteig Prize]] was a $25,000 award offered in 1919 by French hotelier [[Raymond Orteig]] for the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris.  In 1927, underdog [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize in a modified single-engine Ryan aircraft called the [[Spirit of St. Louis]].  In total, nine teams spent $400,000 in pursuit of the Orteig Prize.

The XPRIZE series of awards, public competitions designed and managed by the non-profit organization called the [[X Prize Foundation]], are intended to encourage technological development that could benefit mankind. The most high-profile XPRIZE to date was the $10,000,000 Ansari XPRIZE relating to spacecraft development, which was awarded in 2004 for the development of [[SpaceShipOne]].

The [[Turing Award]] is an annual prize given by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) to "an individual selected for contributions of a technical nature made to the computing community". It is stipulated that "The contributions should be of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field". The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science, and in 2014 grew to $1,000,000.

The [[Millennium Technology Prize]] is awarded once every two years by [[Technology Academy Finland]], an independent fund established by Finnish industry and the Finnish state in partnership.  The first recipient was [[Tim Berners-Lee]], inventor of the [[World Wide Web]].

In 2003, [[David Gobel]] seed-funded the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]] (Mprize) to encourage the development of new life extension therapies in mice, which are genetically similar to humans. So far, three Mouse Prizes have been awarded: one for breaking longevity records to Dr. Andrzej Bartke of [[Southern Illinois University]]; one for late-onset rejuvenation strategies to Dr. Stephen Spindler of the [[University of California]]; and one to Dr. Z. Dave Sharp for his work with the pharmaceutical rapamycin.

== Role of science fiction ==

[[Science fiction]] has criticized developing and future technologies, but also inspires [[innovation]] and new technology. This topic has been more often discussed in literary and sociological than in scientific forums. Cinema and media theorist [[Vivian Sobchack]] examines the dialogue between science fiction films and technological imagination. Technology impacts artists and how they portray their fictionalized subjects, but the fictional world gives back to science by broadening imagination. ''[[How William Shatner Changed the World]]'' is a documentary that gave a number of real-world examples of actualized technological imaginations. While more prevalent in the early years of science fiction with writers like [[Arthur C. Clarke]], new authors still find ways to make currently impossible technologies seem closer to being realized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2594">{{Humanism}}
'''Existential humanism''' is humanism that validates the human subject as struggling for self-knowledge and self-responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;G. B. Messer/A. S. Gurman, ''Essential Psychotherapies'' (2011) p. 261-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] suggested that the best use of our capacity for making choices is to freely choose to live a fully human life, rooted in a personal search for values, rather than an external code.&lt;ref&gt;G. B. Messer/A. S. Gurman, ''Essential Psychotherapies'' (2011) p. 261-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] said "[[Existentialism and Humanism|existentialism is a humanism]]" because it expresses the power of human beings to make freely-willed choices, independent of the influence of religion or society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike traditional humanisms, however, Sartre disavowed any reliance on an essential nature of man – on deriving values from the facts of human nature – but rather saw human value as self-created through undertaking projects in the world: experiments in living.&lt;ref&gt;B. Leiter/M. Rosen eds., ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'' (2007) p. 674-7 and p. 691&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Albert Camus]], in his book ''[[The Plague]]'', suggests that some of us may choose to be heroic, even knowing that it will bring us neither reward nor salvation;{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], in her book ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]'', argues that embracing our own personal freedom requires us to fight for the freedoms of all humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/de-beauvoir/ambiguity/index.htm Ethics of Ambiguity by Simone de Beauvoir]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[Martin Heidegger]] attacked Sartre's concept of existential humanism in his ''[[Letter on Humanism]]'' of 1946, accusing Sartre of elevating [[Reason]] above [[Being]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (2005) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault]] followed Heidegger in attacking Sartre's humanism as a kind of theology of man,&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; though in his emphasis on the self-creation of the human being he has in fact been seen as very close to Sartre's existential humanism.&lt;ref&gt;B. Leiter/M. Rosen eds., ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'' (2007) p. 702&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27512">'''Free will in antiquity''' was not discussed in the same terms as used in the modern [[free will]] debates, but historians of the problem have speculated who exactly was first to take positions as [[determinism|determinist]], [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]], and [[compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilist]] in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Bobzien, ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy''; Timothy O'Keefe, ''Epicurus on Freedom'', R. W. Sharples, ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate '', David Furley, ''Two Studies in the Greek Atomists'', Richard Sorabji, "Necessity, Cause, and Blame "&lt;/ref&gt; There is wide agreement that these views were essentially fully formed over 2000 years ago. Candidates for the first thinkers to form these views, as well as the idea of a non-physical "agent-causal" libertarianism, include [[Democritus]] (460–370), [[Aristotle]] (384–322), [[Epicurus]] (341–270), [[Chrysippus]] (280–207), and [[Carneades]] (214–129).

==Pre-Socratic thought==
Early religious accounts of man's fate explored the degree of human freedom permitted by superhuman gods. A strong fatalism is present in tales that foretell the future, based on the idea that the gods have foreknowledge of future events. Anxious not to annoy the gods, the myth-makers rarely challenged the idea that the gods' foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom.

The first thinkers to look for explanatory causes (ἀιτία) in natural phenomena (rather than gods controlling events) were the Greek [[Pre-Socratic]] philosophers (''physiologoi''). The reasons or rules (λόγοι) behind the physical (φύσις) world became the ideal "laws" governing material phenomena. [[Anaximander]] (610-546) coined the term physis (φύσις) and perhaps even the cosmological combination of cosmos (κόσμος), as organized nature, and logos (λόγος), as the law behind nature. The Greeks had a separate word for the laws (or conventions) of society, nomos (νόμος). [[Heraclitus]] (535–475) claimed that everything changes ("you can't step twice into the same river") but that there were laws or rules (the logos) behind all the change. The early cosmologists imagined that the universal laws were all-powerful and must therefore explain the natural causes behind all things, from the regular motions of the heavens to the mind (νοῦς) of man. These ''physiologoi'' transformed pre-philosophical arguments about gods controlling the human will into arguments about pre-existing causes controlling it.

==Democritus and Leucippus==
The materialist philosophers [[Democritus]] and his mentor [[Leucippus]] were the first [[determinism|determinists]]. They claimed that all things, including humans, were made of atoms in a void, with individual atomic motions strictly controlled by causal laws. Democritus said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    By convention (nomos) color, by convention sweet, by convention bitter, but in reality atoms and a void.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    νόμῳ χροιή, νόμῳ γλυκύ, νόμῳ πικρόν, ἑτεῇ δ’ ἄτομα καὶ κενόν&lt;ref&gt;Diels Kranz, fragment B125&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Democritus wanted to wrest control of man's fate from arbitrary gods and make us more responsible for our actions. But ironically, he and Leucippus originated two of the great dogmas of determinism, [[physical determinism]] and [[logical truth|logical necessity]], which lead directly to the traditional and modern problem of free will and determinism.

Leucippus dogmatically declared an absolute necessity which left no room in the cosmos for chance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    Nothing occurs at random (maten), but everything for a reason (logos) and by necessity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    οὐδὲν χρῆμα μάτην γίνεται, ἀλλὰ πάντα ἐκ λόγου τε καὶ ὑπ’ ἀνάγκης&lt;ref&gt;Leucippus, Fragment 569 – from Fr. 2 Actius I, 25, 4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consequence is a world with but one possible future, completely determined by its past.

==Socrates==
In Plato's Gorgias (and in the Protagoras 345c4-e6), Socrates argues that no one does wrong willingly, one of the most famous doctrines to be associated with him. When framed in modern (Western) terms, the implication is that it is ignorance, rather that free individual agency, that is responsible for morally wrong actions.

==Aristotle==
[[File:Aristotle Bust White Background Transparent.png|thumb|right|Aristotle]]

Michael Frede typifies the prevailing view of recent scholarship, namely that Aristotle did not have a notion of free-will.&lt;ref&gt; http://philpapers.org/archive/BOB_FW.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] elaborated the four possible causes (material, efficient, formal, and final). Aristotle's word for these causes was ἀιτία, which translates as causes in the sense of the multiple factors responsible for an event. Aristotle did not subscribe to the simplistic "every event has a (single) cause" idea that was to come later.
Then, in his ''Physics'' and ''Metaphysics'', Aristotle also said there were "accidents" caused by "chance (τυχή)". In his ''Physics'', he noted that the early physicists had found no place for chance among their causes.

Aristotle opposed his accidental chance to necessity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Nor is there any definite cause for an accident, but only chance (τυχόν), namely an indefinite (ἀόριστον) cause.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', Book V, 1025a25&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    It is obvious that there are principles and causes which are generable and destructible apart from the actual processes of generation and destruction; for if this is not true, everything will be of necessity: that is, if there must necessarily be some cause, other than accidental, of that which is generated and destroyed. Will this be, or not? Yes, if this happens; otherwise not.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', Book VI, 1027a29&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tracing any particular sequence of events back in time will usually come to an accidental event – a "starting point" or "fresh start" (Aristotle calls it an origin or arche (ἀρχή) – whose major contributing cause (or causes) was itself uncaused.

Whether a particular thing happens, says Aristotle, may depend on a series of causes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    goes back to some starting-point, which does not go back to something else. This, therefore, will be the starting-point of the fortuitous, and nothing else is the cause of its generation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' Book VI 1027b12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In general, many such causal sequences contribute to any event, including human decisions. Each sequence has a different time of origin, some going back before we were born, some originating during our deliberations. Beyond causal sequences that are the result of chance or necessity, Aristotle felt that some breaks in the causal chain allow us to feel our actions "depend on us" (ἐφ' ἡμῖν). These are the causal chains that originate within us (ἐv ἡμῖν).

[[Richard Sorabji]]'s 1980 ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'' surveyed Aristotle's positions on causation and necessity, comparing them to his predecessors and successors, especially the Stoics and Epicurus. Sorabji argues that Aristotle was an indeterminist, that real chance and uncaused events exist, but never that human actions are uncaused in the extreme libertarian sense that some commentators mistakenly attribute to Epicurus.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aristotle accepted the past as fixed, in the sense that past events were irrevocable. But future events cannot be necessitated by claims about the present truth value of statements about the future. Aristotle does not deny the excluded middle (either p or not p), only that the truth value of p does not exist yet. Indeed, although the past is fixed, the truth value of past statements about the future can be changed by the outcome of future events. This is the problem of [[future contingents]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'', p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he thinks Aristotle was not aware of the "problem" of free will vis-a-vis determinism (as first described by Epicurus), Sorabji thinks Aristotle's position on the question is clear enough. Voluntariness is too important to fall before theoretical arguments about necessity and determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    I come now to the question of how determinism is related to involuntariness. Many commentators nowadays hold one or more parts of the following view. Determinism creates a problem for belief in the voluntariness of actions. Regrettably, but inevitably, Aristotle was unaware of this problem, and so failed to cope with it. Indeed, the problem was not discovered until Hellenistic times, perhaps by Epicurus, who was over forty years junior to Aristotle, and who reached Athens just too late to hear his lectures. In Aristotle's time no one had yet propounded a universal determinism, so that he knew of no such theory. His inevitable failure to see the threat to voluntariness is all the more regrettable in that he himself entertained a deterministic account of actions, which exacerbated the problem of how any could be voluntary. I shall argue that this account misrepresents the situation&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'', p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Epicurus==
[[File:Epicurus-PergamonMuseum.png|thumb|right|Epicurus]]
It is with Epicurus and the Stoics that clearly indeterministic and deterministic positions are first formulated. Writing one generation after Aristotle, [[Epicurus]] argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would "swerve" (''[[clinamen]]'') from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions (''[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]]''), something impossible if every action was deterministically caused.

Epicurus did not say the swerve was directly involved in decisions. But following Aristotle, Epicurus thought human agents have the autonomous ability to transcend necessity and chance (both of which destroy responsibility), so that praise and blame are appropriate. Epicurus finds a ''tertium quid'', beyond necessity (Democritus' physics) and beyond chance. His ''tertium quid'' is agent autonomy, what is "up to us".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...some things happen of necessity (ἀνάγκη), others by chance (τύχη), others through our own agency (παρ’ ἡμᾶς).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...necessity destroys responsibility and chance is inconstant; whereas our own actions are autonomous, and it is to them that praise and blame naturally attach.&lt;ref&gt;Epicurus, ''Letter to Menoeceus'', §133&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Lucretius]] (1st century [[BCE]]), a strong supporter of Epicurus, saw the randomness as enabling free will, even if he could not explain exactly how, beyond the fact that random swerves would break the causal chain of determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Again, if all motion is always one long chain, and new motion arises out of the old in order invariable, and if the first-beginnings do not make by swerving a beginning of motion such as to break the decrees of fate, that cause may not follow cause from infinity, whence comes this freedom (''libera'') in living creatures all over the earth, whence I say is this will (''voluntas'') wrested from the fates by which we proceed whither pleasure leads each, swerving also our motions not at fixed times and fixed places, but just where our mind has taken us? For undoubtedly it is his own will in each that begins these things, and from the will movements go rippling through the limbs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1967, [[Pamela Huby]] suggested that Epicurus was the original discoverer of the "freewill problem". Huby noted that there had been two main free will problems, corresponding to different determinisms, namely theological determinism (predestination and foreknowledge) and the physical causal determinism of Democritus.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is unfortunate that our knowledge of the early history of the Stoics is so fragmentary, and that we have no agreed account of the relations between them and Epicurus. On the evidence we have, however, it seems to me more probable that Epicurus was the originator of the freewill controversy, and that it was only taken up with enthusiasm among the Stoics by Chrysippus, the third head of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Huby, "The First Discovery of the Freewill Problem", ''Philosophy'', 42 (1967), p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2000 [[Susanne Bobzien]] challenged Pamela Huby's 1967 assertion that Epicurus discovered the "free will problem".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    In 1967 Epicurus was credited with the discovery of the problem of free will and determinism. Among the contestants were Aristotle and the early Stoics. Epicurus emerged victorious, because – so the argument went – Aristotle did not yet have the problem, and the Stoics inherited it from Epicurus. In the same year David Furley published his essay 'Aristotle and Epicurus on Voluntary Action', in which he argued that Epicurus' problem was not the free will problem. In the thirty-odd years since then, a lot has been published about Epicurus on freedom and determinism. But it has only rarely been questioned whether Epicurus, in one way or another, found himself face to face with some version of the free will problem.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bobzien thinks Epicurus did not have a model of what she calls "two-sided freedom," because she believes that Epicurus
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"assumed....a gap in the causal chain immediately before, or simultaneously with, the decision or choice, a gap which allows the coming into being of a spontaneous motion. In this way every human decision or choice is directly linked with causal indeterminism....To avoid misunderstandings, I should stress that I do believe that Epicurus was an indeterminist of sorts – only that he did not advocate indeterminist free decision or indeterminist free choice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[A. A. Long]] and [[David Sedley|D. N. Sedley]], however, agree with Pamela Huby that Epicurus was the first to notice the modern problem of free will and determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Epicurus' problem is this: if it has been necessary all along that we should act as we do, it cannot be up to us, with the result that we would not be morally responsible for our actions at all. Thus posing the problem of determinism he becomes arguably the first philosopher to recognize the philosophical centrality of what we know as the Free Will Question. His strongly libertarian  approach to it can be usefully contrasted with the Stoics' acceptance of determinism.&lt;ref&gt;Long and Sedley, ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'', section 20, "Free Will," p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The question remains how random swerves can help to explain free action. In her 1992 book, ''The Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind'', [[Julia Annas]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...since swerves are random, it is hard to see how they help to explain free action. We can scarcely expect there to be a random swerve before every free action. Free actions are frequent, and (fairly) reliable. Random swerves cannot account for either of these features. This problem would be lessened if we could assume that swerves are very frequent, so that there is always likely to be one around before an action. However, if swerves are frequent, we face the problem that stones and trees ought to be enabled to act freely. And even in the case of humans random swerves would seem to produce, if anything, random actions; we still lack any clue as to how they could produce actions which are free.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Annas, ''The Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind'', p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One view, going back to the 19th century historian [[Carlo Giussani]], is that Epicurus' atomic swerves are involved directly in every case of human free action, not just somewhere in the past that breaks the causal chain of determinism.&lt;ref&gt;"The complete conception of the will according to Epicurus comprises two elements, a complex atomic movement which has the characteristic of spontaneity, that is, is withdrawn from the necessity of mechanical causation: and then the sensus, or self-consciousness in virtue of which the will, illuminated by previous movements of sensation, thought, and emotion, profits by the peculiar liberty or spontaneity of the atomic motions, to direct or not to direct these in a direction seen or selected." — Carlo Giussani, ''Studi Lucreziani'' 1896 (p. 126) (Cyril Bailey translation)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 [[Cyril Bailey]] agreed with Giussani that the atoms of the mind-soul provide a break in the continuity of atomic motions, otherwise actions would be necessitated. Bailey imagined complexes of mind-atoms that work together to form a consciousness that is not determined, but also not susceptible to the pure randomness of individual atomic swerves, something that could constitute Epicurus' idea of actions being "up to us" (πὰρ' ἡμάς).&lt;ref&gt;It is a commonplace to state that Epicurus, like his follower Lucretius, intended primarily to combat the 'myths' of the orthodox religion, to show by his demonstration of the unfailing laws of nature the falseness of the old notions of the arbitrary action of the gods and so to relieve humanity from the terrors of superstition. But it is sometimes forgotten that Epicurus viewed with almost greater horror the conception of irresistible 'destiny' or 'necessity', which is the logical outcome of the notion of natural law pressed to its conclusion. This conclusion had been accepted in its fulness by Democritus, but Epicurus conspicuously broke away from him: 'it were better to follow the myths about the gods than to become a slave to the "destiny" of the natural philosophers: for the former suggests a hope of placating the gods by worship, whereas the latter involves a necessity which knows no placation'. — Cyril Bailey, ''The Greek Atomists and Epicurus'', p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey states that Epicurus did not ''identify'' freedom of the will with chance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It may be that [Giussani's] account presses the Epicurean doctrine slightly beyond the point to which the master had thought it out for himself, but it is a direct deduction from undoubted Epicurean conceptions and is a satisfactory explanation of what Epicurus meant: that he should have thought that the freedom of the will was chance, and fought hard to maintain it as chance and no more, is inconceivable.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bailey, ''The Greek Atomists and Epicurus'' p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1967 [[David Furley]] de-emphasized the importance of the swerve in both Epicurus and Lucretius so as to defend Epicurus from the "extreme" libertarian view that our actions are caused directly by random swerves. (Bailey had also denied this "traditional interpretation".) Furley argues for a strong connection between the ideas of Aristotle and Epicurus on autonomous actions that are "up to us".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    If we now put together the introduction to Lucretius' passage on ''voluntas'' and Aristotle's theory of the voluntary, we can see how the swerve of atoms was supposed to do its work. Aristotle's criterion of the voluntary was a negative one: the source of the voluntary action is in the agent himself, in the sense that it cannot be traced back beyond or outside the agent himself. Lucretius says that voluntas must be saved from a succession of causes which can be traced back to infinity. All he needs to satisfy the Aristotelian criterion is a ''break in the succession of causes'', so that the source of an action cannot be traced back to something occurring before the birth of the agent.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The swerve, then, plays a purely negative part in Epicurean psychology. It saves ''voluntas'' from necessity, as Lucretius says it does, but it does not feature in every act of ''voluntas''.&lt;ref&gt;David Furley, ''Two Studies in the Greek Atomists'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, in his 1983 thesis, "Lucretius on the Clinamen and 'Free Will'", [[Don Paul Fowler]] defended the ancient claim that Epicurus proposed random swerves as directly causing our actions.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I turn to the overall interpretation. Lucretius is arguing from the existence of ''voluntas'' to the existence of the ''clinamen''; nothing comes to be out of nothing, therefore ''voluntas'' must have a cause at the atomic level, viz. the ''clinamen''. The most natural interpretation of this is that every act of ''voluntas'' is caused by a swerve in the atoms of the animal's mind....There is a close causal, physical relationship between the macroscopic and the atomic. Furley, however, argued that the relationship between ''voluntas''  and the ''clinamen'' was very different; not every act of volition was accompanied by a swerve in the soul-atoms, but the ''clinamen'' was only an occasional event which broke the chain of causation between the σύστασις of our mind at birth and the 'engendered' state (τὸ ἀπογεγεννημένον) which determines our actions.Its role in Epicureanism is
merely to make a formal break with physical determinism, and it has no real effect on the outcome of particular actions. (p. 338).&lt;ref&gt;Don Fowler, "Lucretius on the Clinamen and 'Free Will'", Συζήτησισ: ''Studi sull'epicureismo greco e romano offerti a Marcello Gigante'', (Naples, 1983) 329–52&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a 1999 ''Phronesis'' article, Purinton agreed with Fowler that random swerves directly cause volitions and actions:&lt;blockquote&gt;"since they do not make volition itself a fresh start of motion, and Sedley's view does not do justice to his atomism...It seems to me, therefore, that there is no good reason to reject the thesis that Epicurus held that swerves cause volitions from the bottom up. And there are a number of good reasons to accept it."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Purinton, "Epicurus on 'Free Volition' and the Atomic Swerve,'" ''Phronesis'', 44, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Stoicism==
It was the [[Stoicism|Stoic school of philosophy]] that solidified the idea of natural laws controlling all things, including the mind. [[Zeno of Citium]], the original founder of Stoicism, had a simple but powerful idea of the causal chain compared to Aristotle. Zeno said that every event has a cause, and that cause necessitates the event. Given exactly the same circumstances, exactly the same result will occur.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    It is impossible that the cause be present yet that of which it is the cause not obtain.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ἀδύνατον δ’ εἴναι τὸ μὲν αἴτιον παρεῖναι, οὖ δέ ἐστιν αἴτιον μὴ ὑπάρχειν.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Chrysippus bust.jpg|thumb|right|Chrysippus]]
The major developer of Stoicism, [[Chrysippus]], took the edge off strict necessity. Like Democritus, Aristotle, and Epicurus before him, he wanted to strengthen the argument for moral responsibility, in particular defending it from Aristotle's and Epicurus' indeterminate chance causes.

Whereas the past is unchangeable, Chrysippus argued that some future events that are possible do not occur by necessity from past external factors alone, but might (as Aristotle and Epicurus maintained) depend on us. We have a choice to assent or not to assent to an action. Chrysippus said our actions are determined (in part by ourselves as causes) and fated (because of God's foreknowledge), but he also said that they are not necessitated, i.e., pre-determined from the distant past. Chrysippus would be seen today as a [[compatibilism|compatibilist]].

[[Robert Sharples (classicist)|R. W. Sharples]] describes the first compatibilist arguments to reconcile responsibility and determinism by Chrysippus
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Stoic position, given definitive expression by Chrysippus  (c. 280–207 BC), the third head of the school, represents not the opposite extreme from that of Epicurus but an attempt to compromise, to combine determinism and responsibility. Their theory of the universe is indeed a completely deterministic one; everything is governed by fate, identified with the sequence of causes; nothing could happen otherwise than it does, and in any given set of circumstances one and only one result can follow – otherwise an uncaused motion would occur.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chrysippus was concerned to preserve human responsibility in the context of his determinist system. His position was thus one of 'soft determinism', as opposed on the one hand to that of the 'hard determinist' who claims that determinism excludes responsibility, and on the other to that of the libertarian who agrees on the incompatibility but responsibility by determinism. The Greek to eph' hemin (ἐφ΄ ἡμῖν), 'what depends on us', like the English 'responsibility', was used both by libertarians and by soft determinists, though they differed as to what it involved; thus he occurrence of the expression is not a safe guide to the type of position involved. The situation is complicated by the fact that the debate is in Greek philosophy conducted entirely in terms of responsibility (to eph' hemin) rather than of freedom or free will; nevertheless it can be shown that some thinkers, Alexander among them, have a libertarian rather than a soft-determinist conception of responsibility, and in such cases I have not hesitated to use expressions like 'freedom'.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Sharples, ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Alexander of Aphrodisias==
[[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (c. 150–210), the most famous ancient commentator on Aristotle, wrote in the age of Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics. He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today. Greek philosophy had no precise term for "free will" as did Latin (''liberum arbitrium'' or ''libera voluntas''). The discussion was in terms of responsibility, what "depends on us" (in Greek ἐφ ἡμῖν).

Alexander believed that Aristotle was not a strict determinist like the Stoics, and Alexander himself argued that some events do not have pre-determined causes. In particular, man is responsible for self-caused decisions, and can choose to do or not to do something, as Chrysippus argued. However, Alexander denied the foreknowledge of events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature.

[[Robert Sharples (classicist)|R. W. Sharples]] described Alexander's ''De Fato'' as perhaps the most comprehensive treatment surviving from classical antiquity of the problem of responsibility (τὸ ἐφ’ ἡμίν) and determinism. It especially shed a great deal of light on Aristotle's position on free will and on the Stoic attempt to make responsibility compatible with determinism.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Sharples, translation and commentary ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lundgren started Vital 5's Arbitrary Art Grants program in 2009, issuing $500 grants to local artists to "serve as catalysts to create large-scale group projects and performances".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=10 years of Arbitrary Art Grants|date=December 2, 2012|publisher=[[Walden Three]] Seattle|url=http://w3seattle.com/blog/10-years-of-arbitrary-art-grants/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Vital 5 Productions retrofitted the 3rd floor of the historic King Street Station in downtown Seattle for contemporary art exhibition. This 22,000 square foot space hosted Out of Sight - a survey of contemporary art in the Pacific Northwest concurrent with the Seattle Art Fair. Giant Steps - a 48 Hour Artist Residency on the Moon, a group exhibition and competition, opened in the space on March 3, 2016. The second year of Out of Sight will launch on August 4, 2016.

==Lundgren Monuments==
His [[funeral monument]] business, Lundgren Monuments, opened in 2004,&lt;ref name=Eaton2006/&gt; and he opened a "death [[boutique]]" showroom on Seattle's [[First Hill, Seattle, Washington|First Hill]] in 2008 including work by other artists such as [[Jesse Edwards (artist)]] and [[Michael Leavitt (artist)]].&lt;ref name=twist2008/&gt; Lundgren has been noted for "bring[ing] more art and design into the world" of [[Death care industry|death care]],&lt;ref name=FBA2014/&gt; and creating "a renaissance in the funerary arts in 21st-century America."&lt;ref name=Kiley2008/&gt;

Lundgren Monuments specializes in large-scale cast glass monuments with the intent of bringing more color, light and diversity into the cemetery landscape. They also design and build modern urns and host group exhibitions focused on contemporary design and alternatives to traditional death care.

An exhibit at Lundgren Monuments in 2010 was called "the first time in history that a group of architects have focused their talents on the [[cremation urn]] as an architectural object".&lt;ref name=archinect2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArchDaily2010/&gt;

An urn/artwork called ''The Final Turn'', which he collaborated with architect [[Tom Kundig]] in designing, was noted in ''[[Robb Report]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', and is shown in [[Cooper-Hewitt]]'s [[National Design Awards]] gallery.&lt;ref name=cooperhewitt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brooks2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lasky2012/&gt;

==The Order of the Good Death==
Lundgren, along with mortician and author [[Caitlin Doughty]], [[TED (conference)|TED speaker]] Jae Rhim Lee, alternative funeral home director Jeff Jorgenson, and other death professionals, founded [[The Order of the Good Death]], promoting alternative death care and putting Seattle in the forefront of this new endeavor.&lt;ref name=Kiley2014a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kiley2014b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hot topics: Hey funeral directors, move out of the way! | editor=Damon Sayles | work=Funeral Home and Cemetery Executive Briefing|date=December 16, 2014|url=http://www.multibriefs.com/briefs/MV-FuneralEB/MV-FUNERALEB121614.php|accessdate=2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Members: Death Professionals|publisher=The Order of the Good Death|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/members/death-professionals|accessdate=2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/ '''High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment'''] (HIVE) is a [[distributed computing environment]] used for biological research, including analysis of [[DNA sequencing#Next-generation methods|Next Generation Sequencing]] (NGS) data, post market data, adverse events, metagenomic data, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simonyan |first1=Vahan |last2=Mazumder |first2=Raja |title=High-Performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE) Tools and Applications for Big Data Analysis |journal=Genes |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=957–81 |year=2014 |pmid=25271953 |pmc=4276921 |doi=10.3390/genes5040957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
HIVE is a massively parallel [[distributed computing environment]] where the distributed storage library and the distributed computational powerhouse are linked seamlessly.&lt;ref&gt;https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/help/HIVEWhitePaper_12_16_2014.pdf{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system is both robust and flexible due to maintaining both storage and the [[metadata]] database on the same network.&lt;ref&gt;https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/help/HIVEInfrastructuresUK.pdf{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distributed storage layer of software is the key component for file and archive management and is the backbone for the deposition pipeline. The data deposition back-end allows automatic uploads and downloads of external datasets into HIVE data repositories. The metadata database can be used to maintain specific information about extremely large files ingested into the system (big data) as well as metadata related to computations run on the system.  This metadata then allows details of a computational pipeline to be brought up easily in the future in order to validate or replicate experiments.  Since the metadata is associated with the computation, it stores the parameters of any computation in the system eliminating manual record keeping.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Differentiating HIVE from other object oriented databases is that HIVE implements a set of unified [[Application programming interface|APIs]] to search, view, and manipulate data of all types. The system also facilitates a highly secure hierarchical access control and permission system, allowing determination of data access privileges in a finely granular manner without creating a multiplicity of rules in the security subsystem. The security model, designed for sensitive data, provides comprehensive control and auditing functionality in compliance with HIVE's designation as a [[Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002|FISMA]] Moderate system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=C. A. |last2=Simonyan |first2=V. |title=FDA's Activities Supporting Regulatory Application of 'Next Gen' Sequencing Technologies |journal=PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=626–30 |year=2014 |pmid=25475637 |doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2014.01024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIVE technological capabilities==
*'''Data-retrieval''': the HIVE is capable of retrieving data from a variety of sources such as local, cloud-based or network storage, sequencing instruments, and from http, ftp and sftp repositories. Additionally, HIVE implements the sophisticated handshake protocols with existing large scale data platforms such as NIH/NCBI to download large amounts of reference genomic or sequence read data on behalf of users in an easy and accurate manner.
*'''Data-warehousing''': HIVE honeycomb data model was specifically created for adopting complex hierarchy of scientific datatypes, providing a platform for standardization and provenance of data within the framework of object-oriented data models. By using an integrated data-engine, honeycomb, HIVE contributes to the veracity of biomedical computations and helps ensure reproducibility, and harmonization of bio-computational processes.
*'''Security''': HIVE-honeycomb employs a hierarchical security control system, allowing the determination of access privileges in an acutely granular manner without overwhelming the security subsystem with a multiplicity of rules. It provides on the fly encryption/decryption of PII and is compliant with the highest security protocols as requested for systems authorized to operate in regulatory FISMA moderate environments.

[[File:HIVE-visualizations.png|300px|right|HIVE-visualizations]]

*'''Integration''': HIVE provides unified Application Program Interface (API) to search, edit, view, secure, share and manipulate data and computations of all types.  As an Integrator platform HIVE provides developers means to develop (C/C++, Python, Perl, JavaScript, R) and integrate existing almost any open source or commercial tools using generic adaptation framework to integrate command line tools. Additionally session controlled web-API provides means to drive HIVE to perform data quality control and complex computations on behalf of remote users. Currently there are tens of big data analytics tools  in production HIVE and dozens more being developed; these include but are not limited to DNA-, RNA-, Transposon-, Chip-, Immune-sequencing), de novo assembly, population genomics metagenomic sequencing, differential profiling, statistical, classification and clusterization utilities to study bacteria, viruses, human germline and somatic profiles, quasispecies, infections, pathogens.
*'''Computations''': Unlike many virtual computing environments, HIVE virtualizes services, not processes: it provides computations as a service by introducing agnostic abstraction layer between hardware, software and the computational tasks requested by users. The novel paradigm of relocating computations closer to the data, instead of moving data to computing cores has proven to be the key for optimal flow of tasks and data through network infrastructure.
*'''Visualization''': HIVE provides number of scientific visualization components using technologies as HTML5, SVG, D3JS within its Data Driven Document context. The native data and metadata and computational results provided in JSON, CSV-based communication protocols, which are used to generate interactive, user driven, customizable tools allow bioinformaticians to manipulate terabytes of extra-large data using only an Internet browser.

==HIVE open source==
FDA launched HIVE Open Source as a platform to support end to end needs for NGS analytics. 
https://github.com/FDA/fda-hive

'''HIVE biocompute harmonization platform''' is at the core of High-throughput Sequencing Computational Standards for Regulatory Sciences (HTS-CSRS) project. Its mission is to provide the scientific community with a framework to harmonize biocomputing, promote interoperability, and verify bioinformatics protocols (https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/htscsrs). For more information, see the project description on the FDA Extramural Research page (https://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RegulatoryScience/ucm491893.htm

==HIVE architecture==
[[File:HIVE-hardware.png|300px|right|HIVE-hardware]]

*'''Hardware architecture''': At the core of HIVE there exists a solid backbone hardware made of few redundant critical components and scalable compute and storage units. The diagram at the right demonstrates the connectivity and components assignations for such HIVE cluster. Core components providing the vital functions for HIVE cloud include 
**web servers facing outside through the high-end secure firewall to support web-portal functionality; 
**cloud servers are the core functional units orchestrating distributed storage and computations workflows through complex queuing and prioritization schemas; 
**high availability dron hardware serves as a computational unit for scientific visualization and user interface support functionalities; 
**ultra-fast inter-process communication storage units organize distributed computations data interchange staging arena. 
**switches and firewall hardware organize the secure high performance network environment for HIVE cloud.
**permanent storage units each are designed to store hundres of terabytes of NGS data and reference genomes as well as storage for computational results and personal user files. 
Sub-clusters of scalable high performance high density compute cores are there to serve as a powerhouse for extra-large distributed parallelized computations of NGS algorithmics. System is extremely scalable and has deployment instances ranging from a single HIVE in a box appliance to massive enterprise level systems of thousands of compute units.

*'''Software architecture''': HIVE software infrastructure consists of layers incrementally providing more functionality. 
[[File:HIVE-software.png|right|300px|HIVE software layers]]
**The Kernel backbone layer provides integration with heterogeneous hardware and operating system platforms.
**HIVE cloud backbone supports distributed storage, security and computing environment.
**Science backbone represents set of low level scientific libraries to perform variety of scientific computations, mathematical apparatus for chemical, biological, statistical and other purely scientific concepts
**CGI and Java-script layers provide web-portal and web-application compatibility layers.
**Low level libraries provide Application Programming Interface (API) for developing tools and utilities.
**Integrated apps provide major NGS tool arsenal 
**Web-apps and HIVE –portal provide web-portal functionality

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4714">'''Human-rating certification''', also known as '''man-rating''', is the certification of a [[spacecraft]] or [[launch vehicle]] as capable of safely transporting humans. (Since the 1990s, NASA and the U.S. [[GAO]] prefer to use "human-rating" instead of "man-rating" when describing requirements for these systems.)

According to [[NASA]], human-rating requires not just that a system is designed to be tolerant of failure and to protect the crew even if unrecoverable failure occurs, but also that astronauts aboard a human-rated spacecraft must have some control over it.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&amp;c=8705&amp;s=2C |title=Human Rating Requirements for Space Systems |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of technical requirements and the associated certification process for crewed space systems is required in addition to the standards and requirements that are mandatory for all of NASA's space flight programs.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt;

==NASA Commercial Crew Program==
In November 2011, [[Ed Mango (NASA)|Ed Mango]], the agency head of the NASA [[Commercial Crew Program]] (CCP), gave an extended interview on the new NASA requirements for human rating of spacecraft that will fly to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116&gt;

That’s loss of crew for the entire mission profile, including ascent, on-orbit, and entry. The thing that drives the 1 in 270 is really micrometeorites and orbital debris ... whatever things that are in space that you can collide with. So that’s what drops that number down, because you’ve got to look at the 210 days, the fact that your heat shield or something might be exposed to whatever that debris is for that period of time. NASA looks at Loss of Vehicle the same as Loss of Crew.  If the vehicle is damaged and it may not be detected prior to de-orbit, then you have loss of crew.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NASA CCP human-rating standards require that the [[probability]] of a loss on ascent is no more than 1 in 500, and that the probability of a loss on descent is no more than 1 in 500.  The overall mission loss risk, which includes vehicle risk from [[micrometeorite]]s and [[space debris|orbital debris]] while in orbit for up to 210 days, is required to be no more than 1 in 270.&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116/&gt;  Maximum sustained [[g-force|G-loads]] are limited to three [[Gravity of Earth|Earth-standard g's]].&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116/&gt;

The development of the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]] pre-dates the NASA Human-Rating requirements. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Columbia]] accidents, the criteria used by NASA for human-rating spacecraft have been made more stringent.&lt;ref name=ulaCrew/&gt;

The [[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA) published{{when|date=November 2011}} a paper submitted to [[AIAA]] detailing the modifications to its [[Delta IV]] and [[Atlas V]] launch vehicles that would be needed to conform to NASA Standard 8705.2B.&lt;ref name=ulaCrew&gt;

ULA has since been awarded $6.7 million under NASA's [[Commercial Crew Development]] (CCDev) program for development of an [[Emergency Detection System]], one of the final pieces that would be needed to make these launchers suitable for human spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA and ULA confirm Atlas V baseline for human rated launches|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/07/nasa-ula-confirm-atlas-v-baseline-human-rated-launches/|website=NASASpaceflight.com|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Immorality''' is the violation of [[morality|moral]] [[law]]s, [[Norm (social)|norm]]s or standards. Immorality is normally applied to people or actions, or in a broader sense, it can be applied to groups or corporate bodies, beliefs, religions, and works of art.

==Aristotle==
[[Aristotle]] saw many vices as excesses or deficits in relation to some virtue, as cowardice and rashness relate to courage. Some attitudes and actions{{snd}}such as [[envy]], [[murder]], and [[theft]]{{snd}}he saw as [[wrong]] in themselves, with no question of a deficit/excess in relation to the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|mean]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and sexuality==
Immorality is often closely linked with both [[religion and sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Kirkpatrick ed, ''Roget's Thesaurus'' (1998) pp. 650 and 670&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]] saw rational articulated religions as engaged in a long-term struggle with more physical forms of religious experience linked to dance, intoxication and sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Durkheim]] pointed out how many primitive rites culminated in abandoning the distinction between licit and immoral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971) p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freud]]'s dour conclusion was that "In every age immorality has found no less support in religion than morality has".&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual immorality==
{{See also|Paraphilia}}

Coding of sexual behavior has historically been a feature of all human societies, as too; has been the policing of breaches of its [[mores]]{{snd}}sexual immorality{{snd}}by means of formal and [[informal social control]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Dabhoiwala, 'The first sexual revolution', ''The Oxford Historian'' X (2012) p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; Interdictions and [[taboo]]s among primitive societies&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; were arguably no less severe than in traditional agrarian societies.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter, the degree of control might vary from time to time and region to region, being least in urban settlements;&lt;ref&gt;E. Ladurie, ''Montaillou'' (1980) p. 149 and p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; however, only the last three centuries of intense urbanisation, commercialisation and modernisation have broken with the restrictions of the pre-modern world,&lt;ref&gt;Dabhoiwala, p. 41–3&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of a successor society of fractured and competing sexual codes and subcultures, where sexual expression is integrated into the workings of the commercial world.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''One-Dimensional Man'' (2002) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, while the meaning of sexual immorality has been drastically redefined in recent times, arguably the boundaries of what is acceptable remain publicly policed and as highly charged as ever, as the decades-long debates in the US over reproductive rights after ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', or 21st-century [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|controversy over child images on Wikipedia]] and Amazon would tend to suggest.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lih, ''The Wikipedia Revolution'' (2010) p. 204–9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==
[[Michel Foucault]] considered that the modern world was unable to put forward a coherent [[morality]]&lt;ref&gt;G, Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}an inability underpinned philosophically by [[emotivism]]. Nevertheless, [[modernism]] has often been accompanied by a cult of immorality,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Games People Play'' (1966) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; as for example when [[John Ciardi]] acclaimed [[Naked Lunch]] as "a monumentally moral descent into the hell of narcotic addiction".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Campbell, ''This is the Beat Generation'' (1999) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immoral psychoanalysis==
[[Psychoanalysis]] received much early criticism for being the unsavory product of an immoral town{{snd}}Vienna; psychoanalysts for being both unscrupulous and dirty-minded.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 194-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud himself however was of the opinion that "anyone who has succeeded in educating himself to truth about himself is permanently defended against the danger of immorality, even though his standard of morality may differ".&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 485-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary references==
*When questioned by a proof-reader whether his description of [[Meleager of Gadara|Meleager]] as the immoral poet should be immor''t''al poet, [[T. E. Lawrence]] replied: "Immorality I know. Immortality I cannot judge. As you please: Meleager will not sue us for libel".&lt;ref&gt;T. E. Lawrence, ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' (1936) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[De Quincey]] set out an (inverted) hierarchy of immorality in his study [[On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts]]: "if once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think little of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and from that to procrastination and incivility...this downward path".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas De Quincey, ''On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts'' (2004) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Japanese submarine ''I-185''''' (originally '''''I-85''''') was a [[Kaidai type submarine|''Kaidai'' type]] [[cruiser submarine]] of the KD7 [[ship class|sub-class]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the 1940s. She was sunk with all hands by an American [[destroyer]] during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in mid-1944.

==Design and description==
The submarines of the KD7 sub-class were medium-range attack submarines developed from the preceding KD6 sub-class. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{Convert|1833|LT|t|0|disp=flip|sp=us}} surfaced and {{Convert|2602|LT|t|0|disp=flip|sp=us}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|105.5|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|8.25|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.6|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The boats had a diving depth of {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a complement of 86 officers and crewmen.&lt;ref name=cd3&gt;Carpenter &amp; Polmar, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|4000|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|900|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|8|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the KD7s had a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}; submerged, they had a range of {{convert|50|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|5|kn}}.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, all in the bow. They carried one reload for each tube; a total of a dozen [[torpedo]]es. They were originally intended to be armed with two twin-gun mounts for the [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|{{convert|25|mm|abbr=on|1}} Type 96]] [[anti-aircraft gun]], but a [[Type 3 120 mm 45 caliber naval gun|{{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] [[deck gun]] for combat on the surface was substituted for one 25&amp;nbsp;mm mount during construction.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, pp. 183, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
Built by the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]], the boat was [[laid down]] on 9 February 1942&lt;ref name=hk/&gt; as ''I-85'' and renamed ''I-185'' in 1942. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 16 September 1943 and completed on 23 September.&lt;ref name=cd3/&gt; The boat was sunk with the loss of all 95 officers and crewmen aboard by the destroyer {{USS|Newcomb|DD-586|6}} on 22 June 1944 near [[Saipan]]. ''I-185'' was stricken from the [[Navy List]] on 10 September 1944.&lt;ref name=hk&gt;Hackett &amp; Kingsepp&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Japanese submarine ''I-55''''' was one of three [[Type C submarine|Type C]] [[cruiser submarine]]s of the C3 [[ship class|sub-class]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the 1940s.

==Design and description==
The Type C3 submarines were derived from the earlier C2 sub-class although with fewer [[torpedo tube]]s, an additional [[deck gun]], and less-powerful engines to extend their range. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{Convert|2564|LT|t|0|disp=flip}} surfaced and {{Convert|3644|LT|t|0|disp=flip}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|108.7|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.1|m|ftin|sp=us}}. They had a diving depth of {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|2350|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|600|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|17.7|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|6.5|kn}} underwater.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; On the surface, the ''C3''s had a range of {{convert|27000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}; submerged, they had a range of {{convert|105|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|3|kn}}.&lt;ref name=cd3/&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal bow {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} torpedo tubes and carried a total of 19 [[torpedo]]es. They were also armed with two [[14 cm/40 11th Year Type naval gun|{{convert|140|mm|in|abbr=on}}/40]] deck guns and one twin mount for [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|{{convert|25|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} Type 96]] [[anti-aircraft gun]]s.&lt;ref name=cd3&gt;Carpenter &amp; Dorr, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
Assigned to the defense of the Marianas, during a mission to rescue staff of the 1st Air Fleet on [[Tinian]], she was presumably found and sunk by the [[USS Gilmer (APD-11)|USS ''Gilmer'']] and [[USS William C. Miller (DE-259)|USS ''William C. Miller'']] on 14 July 1944, though some sources claim this sinking was actually the [[Japanese submarine Ro-48|Ro-48]].

See also [[USS Wyman (DE-38)|USS ''Wyman'']] and [[USS Reynolds (DE-42)|USS ''Reynolds'']] references to the sinking of this submarine in which Wyman claims credit for this sinking on 28 July 1944.

There are several references in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] (the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]) to [[Jesus]] '''predicting his own death''', the first two occasions building up to the final prediction of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]].&lt;ref&gt;''St Mark's Gospel and the Christian faith'' by Michael Keene 2002 {{ISBN|0-7487-6775-4}} pages 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;  Matthew's Gospel adds a prediction, before he and his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]s enter [[Jerusalem]], that he will be crucified there.&lt;ref&gt;''The Temptations of Jesus in Mark's Gospel'' by Susan R. Garrett 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-8028-4259-6}} pages 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gospel of Mark]], generally agreed to be the earliest Gospel, written around the year 70,{{sfnp|Witherington|2001|p=31|ps=: 'from 66 to 70, and probably closer to the latter'}}{{sfnp|Hooker|1991|p=8|ps=: 'the Gospel is usually dated between AD 65 and 75.'}} Jesus predicts his death three times. Walter Schmithals, noting that this Gospel also contains verses in which Jesus appears to predict his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], suggests that these represent the earlier traditions available to the author, and the three death predictions are redactional creations of the author.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Schmithals, ''The Theology of the First Christians'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1997) page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The setting for the first prediction is somewhere near [[Caesarea Philippi]], immediately after [[Apostle Peter|Peter]] proclaims Jesus as the Messiah. Jesus tells his followers that "the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]] must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again".&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel according to Mark: meaning and message'' by George Martin 2005 {{ISBN|0-8294-1970-5}} pages 200-202&lt;/ref&gt; When Peter objects, Jesus tells him: "Get behind me, Satan! You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men". ({{bibleverse||Mark|8:31–33|NRSV}})

The Gospel of {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:21–28|NRSV}} includes this episode,&lt;ref&gt;''Matthew for Everyone: Chapters 16-28'' by Tom Wright 2004 {{ISBN|0-664-22787-2}} page 9&lt;/ref&gt; saying that Jesus "from that time", i.e. on a number of occasions, Jesus "began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|16:21|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospel of {{bibleverse||Luke|9:22–27|NRSV}} shortens the account, dropping the dialogue between Jesus and Peter.

Each time Jesus predicts [[Passion of Jesus|his arrest and death]], the disciples in some way or another manifest their incomprehension, and Jesus uses the occasion to teach them new things.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercer Dictionary of the Bible'' by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} page 550&lt;/ref&gt; The second warning appears in {{bibleverse||Mark|9:30–32|NIV}} (and also in {{bibleverse||Matthew|17:22–23|NIV}}) as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise." But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%209:30-9:32&amp;version=NRSV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Mark 9:30-32 - New Revised Standard Version|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The third prediction in the {{bibleverse||Matthew|20:17–19|NIV}} specifically mentions crucifixion:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2020:17-20:19&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 20:17-19 - New International Version|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fourth prediction in Matthew is found in Matthew 26:1-2 immediately precedes the plot made against him by the religious Jewish leaders:

"As you know, the Passover is two days away—and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."

The hypothetical [[Q source]], widely considered by scholars to be a collection of sayings of Jesus used, in addition to the Gospel of Mark, by the authors of the Luke and Matthew Gospels, contains no predictions of the death of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;John S Kloppenborg, ''Q, the Earliest Gospel'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 2008) page 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gospel of John]], in chapters 12 to 17, also mentions several occasions where Jesus prepared his disciples for his departure, which the gospel also refers to as his "glorification":&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of biblical imagery'' by Leland Ryken, Jim Wilhoit, Tremper Longman, Colin Duriez, Douglas Penney, Daniel G. Reid 1998 {{ISBN|0-8308-1451-5}} page 269&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Jesus answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the [[Son of Man]] should be glorified. Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of [[wheat]] falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|John|12:23-24|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Each of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] refers more times Jesus foretelling His death and resurrection after three days. The [[Bible concordance|concordances]] are summarized in the following table:

A '''Kelgian''' ([[Sector General#Sector General's physiological classification system|physiological classification]] '''DBLF''') is one of about seventy known intelligent species in the fictional [[Sector General]] universe, and one of the most common species in Sector 12 General Hospital itself.  Overall, A Kelgian resembles a 5–6&amp;nbsp;ft. long furry [[caterpillar]] whose fur is constantly rippling in various patterns.  The motion of the fur of a Kelgian is a completely accurate guide to what it is feeling and necessary for communication within the species itself.  This trait makes the Kelgians completely incapable of any form of untruth.

==Physical summary==

===Requirements===
Kelgians, as indicated by the first letter "D" of their classification, are oxygen breathers whose normal gravity approximates the [[standard gravity]] of Earth.  Their atmosphere is an oxygen-nitrogen combination that also approximates Earth's.  They are [[herbivores]], eating plants (such as crelletin vine shoots) by putting their face inside of their bowl.  They sleep in an "S" or a question mark pose in zero-gravity or, in regular gravity, on a bed.

===Physiology===
They are about 5–6&amp;nbsp;ft. long once they reach maturity and they walk and lie [[horizontal plane|horizontally]], although they can temporarily stand up on their rearmost four legs, at which point they would be at eye level with average humans. They have four extensible eye-stalks which can turn to give a 360° view of their surroundings.  Their number of legs varies throughout the series, but is generally held to be 12 pairs, or 24 legs.&lt;ref name="24legs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvwood.org/Gurps/SectorGeneral/Kelgians.html|title=GURPS Sector General races|year=2002|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|accessdate=11 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have no neck or skeleton, due to an immense and highly vulnerable [[cardiovascular system]].  This system is complex, with two hearts and many thin-walled [[blood vessels]] near the surface. This, combined with high pressure and a high pulse rate, makes cuts very dangerous; a Kelgian can bleed to death from a minor injury if not controlled. Their skin is thicker than a human's, and they have two mouths, one for their digestive system and one for their respiratory system.  A Kelgian female conceives once in her lifetime, producing two offspring of each gender.  Their speech sounds like a series of hoots and whines to human ears.

Their fur, which is always in motion, is a perfect and uncontrollable mirror to their emotional state, and gives emotional context to the Kelgian voice which has no emotion in it.  They highly value their fur, as it is very important to their pre-marriage proposals and allows them to speak properly.  Doctors operating on them will try to remove as little fur as possible.  Because of the properties of their fur, Kelgians never developed the concept of being diplomatic, lying, or politeness (and indeed are infamous for this trait).

The first part of this section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those mass murders where the perpetrators predominantly targeted their (former) co-workers, while the second part focuses on cases where soldiers willfully killed their own comrades.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator(s) shall not be counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the tables are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]].

'''MV ''Derbyshire''''' was an [[ore-bulk-oil carrier|ore-bulk-oil combination carrier]] built in 1976 by [[Swan Hunter]], as the last in the series of the [[Bridge-class OBO carrier|''Bridge''-class]] sextet. She was registered at [[Liverpool]] and owned by [[Bibby Line]].&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|title=MV Derbyshire - HC Deb 03 July 1996 vol 280 cc883-904|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1996/jul/03/mv-derbyshire|website=www.hansard.millbanksystems.com|publisher=Hansard / House of Commons proceedings|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was lost on 9 September 1980 during [[1980 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Orchid (Toyang)|Typhoon Orchid]], south of [[Japan]]. All 42 crew members and two of their wives were killed in the sinking. At 91,655 [[gross register ton]]s, she was—and remains—the largest British ship ever to have been lost at sea.&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of websites and links of the enquiries of Derbyshire sinking|url=http://c4tx.org/ctx/job/cdb/cas_list/precis.php?id=19800909_001|website=www.c4tx.org|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Derbyshire'' was launched in late 1975 and entered service in June 1976, as the last ship of the ''Bridge''-class combination carrier, originally named ''Liverpool Bridge''. ''Liverpool Bridge'' and ''English Bridge'' (later ''Worcestershire'', and ''Kowloon Bridge'' respectively) were built by Seabridge for Bibby Line. The ship was laid up for two of its four years of service life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What really happened to the Derbyshire|url=http://www.bsnet.co.uk/derbyshire/|accessdate=17 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917114552/http://www.bsnet.co.uk/derbyshire/|archivedate=17 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, ''Liverpool Bridge'' was renamed ''Derbyshire'', the fourth vessel to carry the name in the company's fleet. On 11 July 1980, on what turned out to be the vessel's final voyage, ''Derbyshire'' left [[Sept-Îles, Quebec]], Canada, her destination being [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Japan]], though she foundered near [[Okinawa]] (Southern Japan). ''Derbyshire'' was carrying a cargo of 157,446 tonnes of iron ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The final voyage of Derbyshire|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/visit/floor-plan/life-at-sea/derbyshire/final-voyage.aspx|website=www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|publisher=Liverpool museum|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 1980, ''Derbyshire'' [[Heaving to|hove-to]] in [[1980 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Orchid .28Toyang.29|Typhoon Orchid]] some 230 miles from Okinawa, and was overwhelmed by the tropical storm killing all aboard. ''Derbyshire'' never issued a [[Mayday]] distress message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The final voyage of MV Derbyshire|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/exhibitions/derbyshire/final_voyage.aspx|publisher=Liverpool Museums|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel had been following [[weather routing]] advice by "Ocean routes", a commercial [[weather routing]] company (subsequently renamed WRI Weather routing incorporated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us - Our history|url=http://www.wriwx.com/cargo/contactus.php#about|website=www.wriwx.com|publisher=WRI|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marston|first1=Paul|title=Crew cleared over sinking of Derbyshire|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1373769/Crew-cleared-over-sinking-of-Derbyshire.html|accessdate=27 July 2017|publisher=The Telegraph|date=9 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for ''Derbyshire'' commenced on 15 September 1980 and was called off six days later when no trace of the vessel was found, and it was declared lost. Six weeks after ''Derbyshire'' sank, one of the vessel's lifeboats was sighted by a Japanese tanker.&lt;ref name="Mearns"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mearns |first=David |title=Searching for the Derbyshire |url=http://www.north-country.co.uk/derbyshire.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010813033209/http://www.north-country.co.uk/Derbyshire.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 August 2001 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the loss of her sister ship ''[[MV Kowloon Bridge]]'' off the coast of the Republic of Ireland in 1986, after an unfortunate series of events precipitated by deck cracking discovered after an Atlantic crossing the ''Derbyshire'' investigation was re-opened by the relatives of the victims of the sinking. With financial support from the Seafarers Union in 1994 a deep water search began.

In June 1994, the wreck of ''Derbyshire'' was found at a depth of 4&amp;nbsp;km, spread over 1.3&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conclusions |url=http://www.bsnet.co.uk/derbyshire/conclusion.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000408225347/http://www.bsnet.co.uk/derbyshire/conclusion.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 April 2000 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional expedition spent over 40 days photographing and examining the debris field looking for evidence of what sank the ship. Ultimately it was determined that waves crashing over the front of the ship had sheared off the covers of small ventilation pipes near the bow. Over the next 30+ hours, seawater had entered through the exposed pipes into the forward section of the ship, causing the bow to slowly ride lower and lower in the water. Eventually, the bow was completely exposed to the full force of the rough waves which caused the massive hatch on the first cargo hold to buckle inward allowing hundreds of tons of water to enter in moments. As the ship started to sink, the second, then third hatches also failed, dragging the ship underwater. As the ship sank, the water pressure caused the ship to be twisted and torn apart by implosion.

==Memorials==

A bronze plaque was placed on the wreckage as a memorial to those who were lost.&lt;ref name="Mearns" /&gt;

On 21 September 1980, the Bibby Line vessel ''Cambridgeshire'' held a memorial service for the ''Derbyshire'' in the area the vessel was lost.

The 20th anniversary of the vessel's loss was marked by a memorial service in [[Liverpool, England]], which was attended by Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]], himself a former merchant seaman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prescott remembers Derbyshire victims|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/917209.stm|publisher=BBC News | date=9 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a memorial service was held in the vessel's home port of Liverpool on the 30th anniversary of ''Derbyshire'''s loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Gary|title=Memorial service to remember loss of MV Derbyshire|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2010/09/13/memorial-service-to-remember-loss-of-mv-derbyshire-92534-27255388/|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent memorial was dedicated on 15th September 2018 in the garden of the [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool]].

'''Mantis shrimps''', or '''stomatopods''', are marine [[crustacean]]s of the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Stomatopoda'''. Some species have specialised calcified "clubs" which can strike with great power, others have sharp forelimbs used to capture prey. They [[Phylogenetic tree|branched]] from other members of the class [[Malacostraca]] around 400 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Circular polarization vision in a stomatopod crustacean.|journal=Current Biology|volume=18|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mantis shrimps typically grow to around {{convert|10|cm|abbr=off}} in length.

Varieties range from shades of brown to vivid colors, as there are more than 450 species of mantis shrimp. They are among the most important [[Predation|predators]] in many shallow, [[Tropics|tropical]], and [[Subtropics|subtropical]] marine [[habitat]]s. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood as many species spend most of their life tucked away in burrows and holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Ross Piper]] |year=2007 |title=Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals |publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |isbn=0-313-33922-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In captivity, some larger species can break through [[aquarium]] glass.&lt;ref name=smasher_usatoday&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/aprilholladay/2006-01-09-shrimp_x.htm |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=September 1, 2006 |title=Shrimp spring into shattering action |author=April Holladay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Around 400 species of mantis shrimp have currently been discovered worldwide; all living species are in the suborder '''Unipeltata'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Stomatopoda/6299 |title=Stomatopoda |work=[[Tree of Life Web Project]] |date=January 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These aggressive and typically solitary sea creatures spend most of their time hiding in rock formations or burrowing intricate passageways in the sea bed. They rarely exit their homes except to feed and relocate, and can be active during the day, [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]], or active primarily at twilight, depending on the species. Unlike most crustaceans, they sometimes hunt, chase, and kill prey. Although some live in temperate seas, most species live in tropical and [[subtropics|subtropical]] waters in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans between eastern Africa and Hawaii.

==Claws==
[[File:Squilla mantis.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Squilla mantis]]'', showing the spearing appendages]]
[[File:Mantis shrimp from front.jpg|upright|thumb|Mantis shrimp from the front]]
The mantis shrimp's second pair of thoracic appendages has been adapted for powerful close-range combat with high modifications. The appendage differences divide mantis shrimp into two main types: those that hunt by impaling their prey with spear-like structures and those that smash prey with a powerful blow from a heavily mineralised appendage type club. A considerable amount of damage can be inflicted after impact with these robust, hammer-like claws. This club is further divided into three sub-regions: the impact region, the periodic region, and the striated region. Mantis shrimp are commonly separated into two distinct groups determined by the type of claw they possess:
*''Smashers'' possess a much more developed club and a more rudimentary spear (which is nevertheless quite sharp and still used in fights between their own kind); the club is used to bludgeon and smash their meals apart. The inner aspect of the terminal portion of the appendage can also possess a sharp edge, used to cut prey while the mantis shrimp swims.
*''Spearers'', on the other hand, are armed with spiny appendages topped with barbed tips, used to stab and snag prey.

Both types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their [[raptorial]] claws at the prey, and can inflict serious damage on victims significantly greater in size than themselves. In smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, with an acceleration of 10,400&amp;nbsp;[[g-force|''g'']] (102,000&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 335,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and speeds of {{convert|23|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on|lk=on}} from a standing start.&lt;ref name="Patek et al"&gt;{{cite journal |author=S.

The impact can also produce [[sonoluminescence]] from the collapsing bubble. This will produce a very small amount of light within the collapsing bubble, although the light is too weak and short-lived to be detected without advanced scientific equipment. The light emission probably has no biological significance but is rather a side-effect of the rapid snapping motion. [[Alpheidae|Pistol shrimp]] produce this effect in a very similar manner.

Smashers use this ability to attack [[snail]]s, [[crab]]s, [[Mollusca|molluscs]], and rock [[oyster]]s, their blunt clubs enabling them to crack the shells of their prey into pieces. Spearers, on the other hand, prefer the meat of softer animals, like [[fish]], which their barbed claws can more easily slice and snag.

The appendages are being studied as a micro-scale analogue for new macro-scale material structures.&lt;ref name=20160601_SD&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Mantis_shrimp_inspires_next_generation_of_ultra_strong_materials_999.html Mantis shrimp inspires next generation of ultra-strong materials], SpaceDaily.com, 1 June 2016, accessed 3 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''N. bredini'', a species with a variety of habitats ranging from a depth of 5 to 10 metres (although it can be found up to 20 m below the surface), spectral tuning was observed, but the ability to alter wavelengths of maximum absorbance was not as pronounced as in ''N. wennerae'', a species with much higher ecological/photic habitat diversity.

[[File:Mantis Shrimp Eyes.JPG|thumb|Closeup of a mantis shrimp showing the structure of the eyes]] 
Each [[compound eye]] is made up of up tens of thousands [[ommatidium|ommatidia]], clusters of photoreceptor cells.&lt;ref name="Best eyes"/&gt; Each eye consists of two flattened hemispheres separated by parallel rows of specialised ommatidia, collectively called the ''midband''. The number of omatidial rows in the midband ranges from 2 to 6.&lt;ref name="PTRSB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Best eyes"/&gt; This divides the eye into three regions. This configuration enables mantis shrimp to see objects with three parts of the same eye. In other words, each eye possesses trinocular vision and therefore [[depth perception]]. The upper and lower hemispheres are used primarily for recognition of form and motion, like the eyes of many other crustaceans.&lt;ref name="PTRSB"/&gt;

Mantis shrimp can perceive wavelengths of light ranging from [[Ultraviolet#Subtypes|deep ultraviolet]] (UVB) to [[far-red]] (300 to 720 [[nanometre]]s) and [[Polarization (waves)|polarized light]].&lt;ref name="Best eyes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorn|first1=Hanne H.|last2=How|first2=Martin J.|last3=Chiou|first3=Tsyr-Huei|last4=Marshall|first4=Nicholas Justin|title=A Different Form of Color Vision in Mantis Shrimp|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=January 24, 2014|volume=334|issue=6169|pages=411–413|doi=10.1126/science.1245824|bibcode=2014Sci...343..411T}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mantis shrimp in the superfamilies Gonodactyloidea, Lysiosquilloidea and Hemisquilloidea, the midband is made up of six omatodial rows.

There are 12 types of photoreceptor cells in rows 1 to 4, four of which detect ultraviolet light.&lt;ref name="PTRSB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Best eyes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Nicholas Justin|last2=Oberwinkler|first2=Johannes|title=Ultraviolet vision: the colourful world of the mantis shrimp|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=October 28, 1999|volume=401|pages=873–874|doi=10.1038/44751|pmid=10553902|issue=6756|bibcode=1999Natur.401..873M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich; a tier, a colour filter of one class, a tier again, a colour filter of another class, and then a last tier. These colour filters allow the mantis shrimp to see with diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum: about 490 to 550 nm.&lt;ref name=OP30&gt;{{cite journal |title=The molecular genetics and evolution of colour and polarization vision in stomatopod crustaceans.|journal=Ophthalmic Physiology|volume=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rows 5 to 6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment, the ninth class, and are specialised for polarization vision.

The species ''[[Gonodactylus smithii]]'' is the only organism known to simultaneously detect the four linear and two circular polarisation components required to measure all four [[Stokes parameters]], which yield a full description of polarisation.

This is achieved by rotational eye movements to maximise the polarisation contrast between the object in focus and its background. Since each eye moves independently from the other, it creates two separate streams of visual information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/mantis-shrimp-have-perfected-eye-roll-better-see-things-we-cant-even-imagine-480162|title=Mantis shrimp have perfected the eye roll to see things we can’t imagine|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The midband covers only about 5 to 10 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] of the visual field at any given instant, but, like most crustaceans, mantis shrimps' eyes are mounted on stalks. In mantis shrimps the movement of the stalked eye is unusually free, and can be driven up to 70° in all possible axes of movement by eight eyecup muscles divided into six functional groups. By using these muscles to scan the surroundings with the midband, they can add information about forms, shapes, and landscape which cannot be detected by the upper and lower hemisphere of the eye. They can also track moving objects using large, rapid eye movements where the two eyes move independently. By combining different techniques, including movements in the same direction, the midband can cover a very wide range of the visual field.

The huge diversity seen in mantis shrimp photoreceptors likely comes from ancient gene duplication events.&lt;ref name=OP30/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Complexity in the Visual Systems of Stomatopods: Insights from Transcriptomics.|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=53|doi=10.1093/icb/ict060}}&lt;/ref&gt; One interesting consequence of this duplication is the lack of correlation between opsin transcript number and physiologically expressed photoreceptors.&lt;ref name=OP30/&gt; One species may have 6 different opsin genes, but only express one spectrally distinct photoreceptor. Over the years, some mantis shrimp species have lost the ancestral phenotype, although some still maintain 16 distinct photoreceptors and 4 light filters. Species that live in a variety of photic environments have high selective pressure for photoreceptor diversity, and maintain ancestral phenotypes better than species that live in murky waters or are primarily nocturnal.&lt;ref name=OP30/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evolution of anatomical and physiological specialisation in the compound eyes of stomatopod crustaceans.|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggested advantages of visual system===
[[File:Pseudosquilla.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Close-up of the trinocular vision of ''[[Pseudosquilla ciliata]]'']]
What advantage sensitivity to polarisation confers is unclear; however, polarisation vision is used by other animals for sexual signaling and secret communication that avoids the attention of predators. This mechanism could provide an evolutionary advantage; it only requires small changes to the cell in the eye and could be easily [[Natural selection|selected for]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2009/6591.html Bristol University: Mantis shrimps could show us the way to a better DVD, 25 October 2009].

The eyes of mantis shrimp may enable them to recognise different types of coral, prey species (which are often transparent or semi-transparent), or predators, such as [[barracuda]], which have shimmering scales. Alternatively, the manner in which mantis shrimp hunt (very rapid movements of the claws) may require very accurate ranging information, which would require accurate depth perception.

During mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively [[fluoresce]], and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C. H. Mazel |author2=T. W. Cronin |author3=R. L. Caldwell |author4=N. J. Marshall |year=2004 |title=Fluorescent enhancement of signaling in a mantis shrimp |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=303 |issue=5654 |page=51 |doi=10.1126/science.1089803 |pmid=14615546}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females are only fertile during certain phases of the [[Tide|tidal cycle]]; the ability to perceive the [[lunar phase|phase of the moon]] may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts. It may also give mantis shrimp information about the size of the tide, which is important to species living in shallow water near the shore.

It has been suggested that the capacity to see UV light enables observation of otherwise hard-to-detect prey on coral reefs.&lt;ref name= "Science 6UV"/&gt;

Research also shows their visual experience of colours is not very different from humans'. The eyes are actually a mechanism that operates at the level of individual cones and makes the brain more efficient. This system allows visual information to be preprocessed by the eyes instead of the brain, which would otherwise have to be larger to deal with the stream of raw data and thus require more time and energy. While the eyes themselves are complex and not yet fully understood, the principle of the system appears to be simple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/mantis-shrimp-s-super-colour-vision-debunked-1.14578 Mantis shrimp's super colour vision debunked]. Nature.com (2014-01-23). Retrieved on 2015-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar in function to the human eye but works in the opposite manner. In the human brain, the inferior temporal cortex has a huge amount of colour-specific neurons which process visual impulses from the eyes to create colourful experiences. The mantis shrimp instead uses the different types of photoreceptors in its eyes to perform the same function as the human brain neurons, resulting in a hardwired and more efficient system for an animal that requires rapid colour identification. Humans have fewer types of photoreceptors, but more colour-tuned neurons, while mantis shrimps appears to have fewer colour neurons and more classes of photoreceptors.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Macknik (March 20, 2014) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140322121558/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/2014/03/20/shrimp_v_human/ Parallels Between Mantis Shrimp and Human Color Vision].

An October 2014 publication by researchers from the [[University of Queensland]] stated that the compound eyes of mantis shrimp can detect cancer and the activity of [[neuron]]s, because they are sensitive to detecting polarised light that reflects differently from cancerous and healthy tissue. The study claims that this ability can be replicated through a camera through the use of aluminium nanowires to replicate polarisation-filtering microvilli on top of photodiodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2014|author1=T.

It allows the manipulation of light across the structure rather than through its depth, the typical way polarisers work. This allows the structure to be both small and microscopically thin, and still be able to produce big, bright, colourful polarised signals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2016/february/mantis-shrimp.html New type of optical material discovered in the secret language of the mantis shrimp].

==Behaviour==
[[File:MantisShrimpLyd.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of a mantis shrimp by [[Richard Lydekker]], 1896]]
Mantis shrimp are long-lived and exhibit complex behaviour, such as ritualised fighting. Some species use [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] patterns on their bodies for signalling with their own and maybe even other species, expanding their range of behavioural signals. They can learn and remember well, and are able to recognise individual neighbours with whom they frequently interact. They can recognise them by visual signs and even by individual smell. Many have developed complex social behaviour to defend their space from rivals.

In a lifetime, they can have as many as 20 or 30 breeding episodes. Depending on the species, the eggs can be laid and kept in a burrow, or they can be carried around under the female's tail until they hatch. Also depending on the species, male and female may come together only to mate, or they may bond in [[monogamous]] long-term relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sharing the job: monogamy and parental care |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/aquarius/monogamy.html |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the monogamous species, the mantis shrimp remain with the same partner for up to 20&amp;nbsp;years. They share the same burrow and may be able to coordinate their activities. Both sexes often take care of the eggs (biparental care). In ''[[Pullosquilla]]'' and some species in ''[[Nannosquilla]]'', the female will lay two clutches of eggs: one that the male tends and one that the female tends. In other species, the female will look after the eggs while the male hunts for both of them. After the eggs hatch, the offspring may spend up to three months as [[plankton]].

Although stomatopods typically display the standard types of movement seen in [[shrimp|true shrimp]] and [[lobster]]s, one species, ''[[Nannosquilla decemspinosa]]'', has been observed flipping itself into a crude wheel. The species lives in shallow, sandy areas. At low tides, ''N. decemspinosa'' is often stranded by its short rear legs, which are sufficient for movement when the body is supported by water, but not on dry land. The mantis shrimp then performs a forward flip in an attempt to roll towards the next tide pool. ''N. decemspinosa'' has been observed to roll repeatedly for {{convert|2|m|ft}}, but specimens typically travel less than {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caldwell, Roy L. |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=282 |pages=71–73 |year=1979 |title=A unique form of locomotion in a stomatopod&amp;nbsp;– backward somersaulting |doi=10.1038/282071a0 |issue=5734|bibcode= 1979Natur.282...71C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culinary uses==
[[File:Hai san Hau Loc05.JPG|thumb|left|Mantis shrimp caught at [[Hậu Lộc District|Hậu Lộc]], [[Thanh Hóa]], [[Vietnam]]]]
In [[Japanese cuisine]], the mantis shrimp species ''[[Oratosquilla oratoria]]'', called {{nihongo|''shako''|蝦蛄}}, is eaten boiled as a [[sushi]] topping and, occasionally, raw as [[sashimi]].

Mantis shrimp are abundant in the coastal regions of south [[Vietnam]], known in Vietnamese as ''tôm tít'', or ''tôm tech''. In regions such as Nha Trang, they are called "bàn chải", named for its resemblance to a scrub brush. The shrimp can be steamed, boiled, grilled or dried, used with [[black pepper|pepper]], salt and [[lime (fruit)|lime]], [[fish sauce]] and [[tamarind]], or [[fennel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinhduong.com.vn/story/tom-tit-ac-san-mien-song-nuoc |title=Tôm tít&amp;nbsp;– Đặc sản miền sông nước |date=October 1, 2009 |accessdate=January 8, 2011 |language=Vietnamese |publisher=Dinh dưỡng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cantonese cuisine]], the mantis shrimp is known as "pissing shrimp" ({{zh|c=瀨尿蝦|p=lài niào xiā|j=laaih niu hā}}) because of their tendency to shoot a jet of water when picked up. After cooking, their flesh is closer to that of [[lobster]]s than that of [[shrimp]], and like lobsters, their shells are quite hard and require some pressure to crack. Usually they are deep fried with garlic and chili peppers.

In the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] countries the mantis shrimp ''[[Squilla mantis]]'' is a common seafood, especially on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coasts ([[canocchia]]) and the [[Gulf of Cádiz]] (galera).

In the [[Philippines]], the mantis shrimp is known as tatampal, hipong-dapa, or alupihang-dagat, and is cooked and eaten like any other shrimp.

In [[Hawaii]], some mantis shrimp have grown unusually large in the very dirty water of the Grand [[Ala Wai Canal]] in [[Waikiki]]. The usual dangers associated with consuming seafood caught in contaminated waters still applies to mantis shrimp.&lt;ref name=Hawaii/&gt;

==Aquaria==
[[File:OdontodactylusScyllarus.jpg|thumb|A colourful stomatopod, the [[Odontodactylus scyllarus|peacock mantis shrimp]] (''[[Odontodactylus scyllarus]]''), seen in the [[Andaman Sea]] off [[Thailand]]]]
Some saltwater aquarists keep stomatopods in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reefkeeping.com/issues/2004-03/jf/feature/index.php A Load of Learnin' About Mantis Shrimps], by James Fatherree, in [http://www.reefkeeping.com/joomla/index.php/reefkeeping-blog ReefKeeping] online magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Odontodactylus scyllarus|peacock mantis]] is especially colourful and desired in the trade.

While some aquarists value mantis shrimp, others consider them harmful pests, because:

*They are voracious predators, eating other desirable inhabitants of the tank,
*Some of the largest species can break aquarium glass by striking it
*Some rock-burrowing species can do more damage to [[live rock]] than the fishkeeper would prefer

The live rock with mantis shrimp burrows are actually considered useful by some in the [[marine aquarium]] trade and are often collected. It is not uncommon for a piece of live rock to convey a live mantis shrimp into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, they may feed on fish and other inhabitants. They are notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nick Dakin |year=2004 |title=The Marine Aquarium |publisher=London: Andromeda |isbn=1-902389-67-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are accounts of them breaking glass tanks. While stomatopods do not eat coral, smashers can damage it if they try to make a home within it.&lt;ref name=smasher_usatoday/&gt;

'''Mi-Go''' are a fictional race of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] created by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and used by others in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] setting. The word Mi-Go comes from "Migou", a Tibetan word for [[yeti]]. The aliens are fungus-based lifeforms which are extremely varied due to their prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill. The variants witnessed by Akeley in "The Whisperer in Darkness" look like winged humanoid crabs, and do not resemble yeti.

Mi-Go are first named as such in Lovecraft's short story "[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]" (1931). However this is considered an elaboration on earlier references in his [[sonnet cycle]] ''[[Fungi from Yuggoth]]'' (1929–30) to descriptions of alien vegetation on dream-worlds.

The Mi-Go have appeared across a range of media set in the Cthulhu Mythos.

==Description==
The "Mi-Go" are large, pinkish, fungoid, [[crustacean]]-like entities the size of a man; where a head would be, they have a "convoluted ellipsoid" composed of pyramided, fleshy rings and covered in antennae. They are about {{convert|5|ft|m|spell=in}} long, and their crustacean-like bodies bear numerous sets of paired appendages. They possess a pair of membranous bat-like wings which are used to fly through the "[[Luminiferous aether|aether]]" of outer space.&lt;ref&gt;The aether concept attempted explain the travel of light through space and is now scientifically discredited, but was widely accepted up to about 1900 and was presumably part of Lovecraft's education.&lt;/ref&gt; The wings do not function well on Earth. Several other races in Lovecraft's Mythos also have wings like these.

In the original short story, the creatures cannot be recorded using ordinary photographic film, due to their bodies being formed from otherworldly matter.
They are capable of going into suspended animation until softened and reheated by the sun or some other source of heat.

The Mi-Go can transport humans from Earth to [[Pluto]] (and beyond) and back again by removing the subject's [[Human brain|brain]] and placing it into a "brain cylinder" as an [[isolated brain]], which can be attached to external devices to allow it to see, hear, and speak.

In "[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]" the Mi-Go are heard to give praise to [[Nyarlathotep]] and [[Shub-Niggurath]], suggesting some form of worship. Their moral system is completely alien, making them seem highly malicious from a human perspective.

One of the moons of [[Yuggoth]] holds designs that are sacred to the Mi-Go; these are useful in various processes mentioned in the ''[[Necronomicon]]''. It is said that transcriptions of these designs can be sensed by the Mi-Go, and those possessing them shall be hunted down by the few remaining on earth.&lt;ref&gt;In "The Whisperer in Darkness", a "black stone with unknown hieroglyphics" from Yuggoth is among the items owned by the narrator that the Mi-Go want to recover as part of their plot to lure him to the Akeley farmhouse.{{clarify|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supposedly, a group known as the Brotherhood of the [[Yellow Sign]] are dedicated to hunting them down and exterminating the fungoid threat, though it is unknown if this is actually true since it was given as a reason for their remaining hidden. [[Hastur]], which is mentioned in passing among several other places and things, was eventually converted into a God-Like alien being by [[August Derleth]] who gave it the title "Him Who is Not to be Named". However, in "The Whisperer in Darkness", a human ally of the Mi-Go mentions "Him Who Is Not to Be Named" in the list of honored entities along with Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath. Lovecraft never made a connection between Hastur and "Him Who Is Not to Be Named", and indeed didn't even imply Hastur was a being; Derleth was the one to do so.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Other appearances ==

The Mi-Go appear in the Lovecraft novella ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' (1931), in which they are described as having made war with the [[Elder Things]] long before the existence of humans.

The Mi-Go appeared in [[comic book]]s in the first three issues of ''[[H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu: The Whisperer in Darkness]]'' that featured the [[Miskatonic Project]], created by [[Mark Ellis (American author)|Mark Ellis]].

The Mi-Go are prominent antagonists in [[Pagan Publishing]]'s ''[[Delta Green]]'' sourcebook for the ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' role-playing game. It mentions three castes: scientist, soldier, and worker. The book states that the Mi-Go usually have five pairs of appendages, though the number can vary. Normally, the first pair is designed for grasping and manipulating, but in the scientist caste it is usually the first two pairs. The remaining appendages are used for locomotion. The soldiers may have two or more pairs of wings. Some individuals do not have wings at all if they are deemed unnecessary to their task. The Mi-Go apparently can modify their own bodies. This source suggests that all their external accoutrements are actually extruded at will from the central gelatinous mass similar to the way the [[Shoggoth]] extrude body parts. In the ''Delta Green'' setting, the "[[grey alien|Greys]]" are puppets remotely controlled by the Mi-Go.

They are distinguished by their mastery in various fields of [[science]], especially [[surgery]]. Although they originate from beyond our [[solar system]], they have set up an outpost on [[Pluto]] (known as [[Yuggoth]] in the mythos) and sometimes visit Earth to mine for minerals and other natural resources. The Mi-Go normally communicate by changing the colors of their orb-like heads or by emitting odd buzzing noises. They can also speak any human language upon receiving the appropriate surgical modification.

The Mi-Go are one of the main enemies of humanity in the role-playing game [[CthulhuTech]], which combines Lovecraft's fiction with tropes and themes from [[mecha anime]]. In the game, their name is spelled “Migou” (see below), but they are commonly referred to as ''bugs'' by humans.

They are presented in CthulhuTech much as they are in the original Lovecraft stories, and somewhat similar to that in Delta Green: they are masters of science and genetics, and in particular human genetics. Their hostility to humanity could be seen{{by whom|date=January 2012}} as jealousy that humans had created a technology which they had never thought of, combined with a fear of humanity's growing power. Although it is stated that they have emotions vastly different from our own, their campaign on Earth developed into genocidal hatred of humans.

In ''[[Allan and the Sundered Veil]]'', [[Allan Quatermain]], [[Randolph Carter]], [[John Carter of Mars]], and [[The Time Traveller (character)|the Time Traveller]] encounter the Mi-Go, which are stated to be the same as [[Morlock]]s and the [[Yeti]]s.

In "[[To Mars and Providence]]", the Mi-Go engage in trade with the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martian]]s from ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''.

The Mi-Go appear in the final segment of the movie ''[[Necronomicon (film)|Necronomicon]]'', directed by Brian Yuzna.

A Mi-Go is scripted to walk across the stage during the "Tentacles" number of ''[[A Shoggoth on the Roof]]'', prompting Armitage to say "some horrible creature... I do not even want to know what ''that'' is".

The horror-themed miniatures game [[HorrorClix]], which features Cthulhu as a colossal figure, includes a Mi-Go as a unique figure in its ''The Lab'' expansion.

The Mi-Go also appear as sinister brain collectors in the short story "Boojum", written by [[Sarah Monette]] and [[Elizabeth Bear]].

The computer game ''[[Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead]]'' features the Mi-Go among the numerous different types of monster that assault the earth. This Mi-Go appears to be inspired by, rather than lifted from, the original Lovecraftian creature, since their unique feature in the game is to mimic human speech and other sounds in an attempt to lure people towards them.

== Origin of the word ==
It is possible that Lovecraft encountered the word ''migou'' in his readings. ''Migou'' is the [[Tibet]]an equivalent of the [[yeti]], an ape-like [[cryptid]] said to inhabit the high mountain ranges of that region.&lt;ref&gt;''Mi-Go'' is the compound word for "man-wild" (wild man; Wylie: mi rgod; Tib: མི་རྒོད་) in Tibetan and is pronounced ''me-gö''. (See Goldstein, pp. 251, 792, 794.)&lt;/ref&gt; While the Mi-Go of Lovecraft's mythos is completely unlike the migou of Tibetan stories, Lovecraft seems to equate the two, as can be seen in the following excerpt from "The Whisperer in Darkness":

{{quote|
It was of no use to demonstrate to such opponents that the Vermont myths differed but little in essence from those universal legends of natural personification which filled the ancient world with fauns and dryads and satyrs, suggested the kallikanzarai of modern Greece, and gave to wild Wales and Ireland their dark hints of strange, small, and terrible hidden races of troglodytes and burrowers. No use, either, to point out the even more startlingly similar belief of the Nepalese hill tribes in the dreaded Mi-Go or "Abominable Snow-Men" who lurk hideously amidst the ice and rock pinnacles of the Himalayan summits. When I brought up this evidence, my opponents turned it against me by claiming that it must imply some actual historicity for the ancient tales; that it must argue the real existence of some queer elder earth-race, driven to hiding after the advent and dominance of mankind, which might very conceivably have survived in reduced numbers to relatively recent times—or even to the present.

A '''monster''' is often a hideously grotesque [[animal]] or [[human]], or a [[Hybrid beasts in folklore|hybrid]] of both, whose appearance frightens and whose powers of destruction threaten the human world's social or moral order.

Animal monsters are outside the moral order, but sometimes have their origin in some human violation of the moral law (e.g. in the Greek myth, Minos does not sacrifice the white bull Poseidon sent him to the god, so as punishment Poseidon makes Minos' wife, Pasiphaë, fall in love with the bull, and she copulates with the beast, and gives birth to the man with a bull's head, [[Minotaur|the Minotaur]]). Human monsters are those who by birth were never fully human ([[Medusa]] and her sisters) or who through some supernatural or unnatural act lost their humanity ([[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[Frankenstein's_monster|Frankenstein's monster]]), and so who can no longer, or who never could, follow the moral law of human society.

Monsters pre-date written history, and the academic study of the particular cultural notions expressed in a society's ideas of monsters is known as ''monstrophy''.{{r|CallForPapers}}

Monsters have appeared in literature and in feature-length films. Well-known monsters in fiction include [[Count Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's monster]], [[werewolf|werewolves]], [[Mummy#Modern mummies|mummies]], and [[zombie]]s.

==Etymology==
[[File:Arminianism as five-headed monster.JPG|thumb|A polemical allegory presented as a five-headed monster, 1618]]''Monster'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''monstrum'', itself derived ultimately from the verb ''moneo'' ("to remind, warn, instruct, or foretell"), and denotes anything "strange or singular, contrary to the usual course of nature, by which the gods give notice of evil," "a strange, unnatural, hideous person, animal, or thing," or any "monstrous or unusual thing, circumstance, or adventure." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l_UsAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=latin+english+dictionary#v=onepage&amp;q=latin%20english%20dictionary The Rev. J.E. Riddle, ''A Complete English-Latin and Latin-English Dictionary'', London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1870, s.v. ''monstrum'', Latin-English part, p. 399].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural heritage==
In the words of Tina Marie Boyer, assistant professor of medieval German literature at [[Wake Forest University]], "monsters do not emerge out of a cultural void; they have a literary and cultural heritage".{{r|Boyer}}

In the religious context of ancient Greeks and Romans, monsters were seen as signs of "divine displeasure", and it was thought that birth defects were especially ominous, being "an unnatural event" or "a malfunctioning of nature".{{sfnp|Beagon|2002|p=127}}

Monsters are not necessarily abominations however. The Roman historian [[Suetonius]], for instance, describes a snake's absence of legs or a bird's ability to fly as monstrous, as both are "against nature".{{sfnp|Wardle|2006|p=330}} Nonetheless, the negative connotations of the word quickly established themselves, and by the playwright and philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s time, the word had extended into its philosophical meaning, "a visual and horrific revelation of the truth".{{sfnp|Staley|2010|pp=80, 96, 109, 113 et passim}}

In spite of this, mythological monsters such as the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] and [[Medusa]] are not natural beings, but divine entities. This seems to be a holdover from [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and other belief systems, in which the divisions between "spirit," "monster," and "god" were less evident.

==Monsters in fiction==

===Prose fiction===
The history of monsters in fiction is long, for example [[Grendel]] in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' is an archetypal monster, deformed, brutal, with enormous strength and raiding a human settlement nightly to slay and feed on his victims. The modern literary monster has its roots on examples such as the monster in [[Mary Shelley]]'s [[Frankenstein]] and the vampire in [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula]].

Monsters are a staple of [[fantasy fiction]], [[horror fiction]] or [[science fiction]] (where the monsters are often [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] in [[nature]]). There is also a burgeoning subgenre of [[erotic fiction]] involving monsters, [[monster erotica]].

===Film===

====Pre–World War II monster films====
[[File:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Hollywood's interpretation of Frankenstein's monster, played by [[Boris Karloff]]]]
During the age of [[silent film]]s, monsters tended to be human-sized, e.g. [[Frankenstein's monster]], the [[Golem]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]] and [[vampire]]s. The film ''[[Sigurd|Siegfried]]'' featured a [[dragon]] that consisted of [[Stop motion|stop-motion animated]] models, as in [[RKO]]'s ''King Kong'', the first giant [[Monster movie|monster film]] of the sound era.

[[Universal Studios]] specialized in monsters, with [[Bela Lugosi]]'s reprisal of his stage role, [[Dracula]], and [[Boris Karloff]] playing [[Frankenstein]]'s monster. The studio also made several lesser films, such as ''Man-Made Monster'', starring [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] as a carnival side-show worker who is turned into an electrically charged killer, able to dispatch victims merely by touching them, causing death by electrocution.

There was also a variant of Dr. Frankenstein, the mad surgeon Dr. Gogol (played by [[Peter Lorre]]), who transplanted hands that were reanimated with malevolent temperaments, in the film ''[[Mad Love (1935 film)|Mad Love]]''.


[[Werewolf|Werewolves]] were introduced in films during this period, and similar creatures were presented in ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]''. [[mummy|Mummies]] were cinematically depicted as fearsome monsters as well. As for giant creatures, the cliffhanger of the first episode of the 1936 ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[Serial (film)|serial]] did not use a costumed actor, instead using real-life [[lizard]]s to depict a pair of battling dragons via use of camera perspective. However, the cliffhanger of the ninth episode of the same serial had a man in a rubber suit play the Fire Dragon, which picks up a doll representing Flash in its claws. The cinematic monster cycle eventually wore thin, having a comedic turn in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948).

====Post–World War II monster films====
[[File:Gojira 1954 poster 3.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Original ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' film poster]]
In the [[Aftermath of World War II|post–World War II]] era, however, giant monsters returned to the screen with a vigor that has been causally linked to the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. One early example occurred in the American film ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'', which was about a [[dinosaur]] that attacked a lighthouse. Subsequently, there were [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] film depictions, ([[Godzilla]], [[Gamera]]), British depictions (''[[Gorgo (film)|Gorgo]]''), and even [[Cinema of Denmark|Danish]] depictions (''[[Reptilicus]]''), of giant monsters attacking cities. A recent depiction of a giant monster is depicted in [[J. J. Abrams]]'s ''[[Cloverfield]]'', which was released in theaters January 18, 2008. The intriguing proximity of other [[planet]]s brought the notion of extraterrestrial monsters to the big screen, some of which were huge in size (such as [[King Ghidorah]] and [[Gigan]]), while others were of a more human scale. During this period, the [[fish]]-man monster [[Gill-man]] was developed in the film series ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''.
[[File:Obake Karuta 4-12.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Card from the Japanese game [[Karuta|obake karuta]], c. early 19th century{{efn|Each card features a monster from [[Japanese mythology]] and a character from the [[hiragana]] syllabary.}}]]
Britain's [[Hammer Film Productions]] brought [[Color motion picture film|color]] to the monster movies in the late 1950s. Around this time, the earlier Universal films were usually shown on American television by independent stations (rather than network stations) by using announcers with strange personas, who gained legions of young fans. Although they have since changed considerably, movie monsters did not entirely disappear from the big screen as they did in the late 1940s.

Occasionally, monsters are depicted as friendly or misunderstood creatures. King Kong and Frankenstein's monster are two examples of misunderstood creatures. Frankenstein's monster is frequently depicted in this manner, in films such as ''[[Monster Squad]]'' and ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]''. The Hulk is an example of the "Monster as Hero" archetype. The theme of the "Friendly Monster" is pervasive in pop-culture. [[Chewbacca]], [[Elmo]], and [[Shrek]] are notable examples of friendly "monsters". The creatures of ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' scare children in order to create [[energy]] for running machinery, while the furry monsters of ''[[The Muppets]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]'' live in harmony with animals and humans alike. Japanese culture also commonly features monsters which are benevolent or likable, with the most famous examples being the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise and the pioneering anime ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''. The book series/webisodes/toy line of [[Monster High]] is another example.

===Games===
Monsters are commonly encountered in fantasy or role-playing games and video games as enemies for players to fight against. They may include [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s, [[legendary creature]]s, extra-dimensional entities or [[mutant|mutated]] versions of regular animals.

Especially in role-playing games, "monster" is a catch-all term for hostile characters that are fought by the player. [[Sentience|Sentient]] [[race (fantasy)|fictional races]] are usually not referred to as monsters. At other times, the term can carry a neutral connotation, such as in the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise, where it is used to refer to fictional creatures that resemble real-world animals/objects. Characters in games may refer to all animals as "monsters".

'''NEST''' is a [[simulation software]] for spiking neural network models, including large-scale neuronal networks. NEST was initially developed by Markus Diesmann and Marc-Oliver Gewaltig and is now developed and maintained by the NEST Initiative.

== Modeling philosophy ==

A NEST [[simulation]] tries to follow the logic of an [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] experiment that takes place inside a computer with the difference, that the [[Biological neural network|neural system]] to be investigated must be defined by the experimenter.

The neural system is defined by a possibly large number of [[Biological neuron model|neurons]] and their [[Synapse|connections]]. In a NEST network, different neuron and synapse models can coexist. Any two neurons can have multiple connections with different properties. Thus, the connectivity can in general not be described by a weight or [[Adjacency matrix|connectivity matrix]] but rather as an [[adjacency list]].

To manipulate or observe the network dynamics, the experimenter can define so-called devices which represent the various instruments (for measuring and stimulation) found in an experiment. These devices write their data either to [[Computer memory|memory]] or to file.

NEST is extensible and new models for neurons, synapses, and devices can be added.

==Example==
[[File:NEST raster.png|thumb|NEST raster]]

The following example simulates spiking activity in a sparse random network with recurrent excitation and inhibition&lt;ref&gt;Brunel, N. (2000). Dynamics of sparsely connected networks of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons. [http://www.springerlink.com/index/U446L5722LP03677.pdf Journal of computational neuroscience, 8(3), 183–208.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure shows the [[Action potential|spiking activity]] of 50 neurons as a [[raster plot]]. Time increases along the horizontal axis, neuron id increases along the vertical axis.  Each dot corresponds to a [[Action potential|spike]] of the respective neuron at a given time. The lower part of the figure shows a [[histogram]] with the mean firing-rate of the neurons.

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import nest
import nest.raster_plot

J_ex  = 0.1 # excitatory weight
J_in  = -0.5 # inhibitory weight
p_rate = 20000. # external Poisson rate

neuron_params= {"C_m": 1.0, "tau_m": 20.0, "t_ref": 2.0,
                "E_L": 0.0, "V_reset": 0.0, "V_m": 0.0, "V_th": 20.0}

# Set parameters of neurons and devices
nest.SetDefaults("iaf_psc_delta", neuron_params)
nest.SetDefaults("poisson_generator",{"rate": p_rate})
nest.SetDefaults("spike_detector",{"withtime": True, "withgid": True})

# Create neurons and devices
nodes_ex=nest.Create("iaf_psc_delta", 10000) 
nodes_in=nest.Create("iaf_psc_delta", 2500)
noise=nest.Create("poisson_generator")
espikes=nest.Create("spike_detector")

# Configure synapse models
nest.CopyModel("static_synapse","excitatory",{"weight":J_ex, "delay":1.5})
nest.CopyModel("static_synapse","inhibitory",{"weight":J_in, "delay":1.5})

# Connect the random net and instrument it with the devices
nest.Connect(nodes_ex, nodes_ex+nodes_in,  {"rule": 'fixed_indegree', "indegree": 1000}, "excitatory")
nest.Connect(nodes_in, nodes_ex+nodes_in,  {"rule": 'fixed_indegree', "indegree": 250}, "inhibitory")
nest.Connect(noise, nodes_ex+nodes_in, syn_spec="excitatory")
nest.Connect(nodes_ex[1:51], espikes)

# Simulate for 100. ms
nest.Simulate(100.)

# Plot results
nest.raster_plot.from_device(espikes, hist=True)
nest.raster_plot.show()
&lt;/source&gt;

==History==

NEST development was started in 1993 by Markus Diesmann and Marc-Oliver Gewaltig at the [[Ruhr University| Ruhr University Bochum]], [[Bochum]], Germany and the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in [[Rehovot]], [[Israel]]. At this time, the simulator was called SYNOD and simulations were defined in a stack based simulation language, called SLI.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7KXmIv6ROY Video documentary on NEST] by the German [[Bernstein Network]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the software changed its name from SYNOD to NEST. Until 2004, NEST was exclusively developed and used by the founding members of the NEST Initiative. The first public release appeared in summer 2004. Since then, NEST was released regularly, about once or twice per year.

Since 2007, NEST supports hybrid parallelism, using [[POSIX threads]] and [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]].&lt;ref name="dx" /&gt;

In 2008, the stack-based simulation language SLI was superseded by a modern [[Python (programming language)|Python]] interface, however, the old simulation language is still used internally.&lt;ref&gt;Eppler, J. M., Helias, M., Diesmann, M., Muller, E., &amp; Gewaltig, M.-O. (2008). PyNEST: a convenient interface to the NEST simulator. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, 2(January), 1–12. doi:10.3389/neuro.11.012.2008&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time, the simulator independent specification language [[PyNN (software)|PyNN]] was developed with support for NEST.&lt;ref&gt;A. Davison, D. Brüderle, J. Eppler, J. Kremkow, E. Muller, D. Pecevski, L. Perrinet and P. Yger, PyNN: a common interface for neuronal network simulators, Front. Neuroinf. 2:11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, the NEST Initiative changed the license from the proprietary NEST License to [[GPL|GNU GPL]] V2 or later.

== User interfaces ==
* NEST primary user interface is PyNEST, a  [[Python (programming language)|Python]] package that controls the NEST simulation kernel. PyNEST aims at easy usability and seamless interaction with  [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and its libraries.
* [[PyNN (software)|PyNN]] is a simulator independent language for neural simulations, which supports NEST as well as [[Brian (software)|BRIAN]], [[Neuron (software)|NEURON]], as well as neuromorphic hardware.
* NEST also maintains its own simulation language [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] (SLI), which understands a simple [[Stack-oriented programming language]] that is influenced by [[PostScript]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

'''Not Dead Yet''' (NDY) is a [[United States]] [[disability rights]] group that opposes [[assisted suicide]] and [[euthanasia]] for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1999-09-23/news/25487953_1_suicide-and-euthanasia-disability-rights-group-disabled-people |first=William R. |last=Macklin |title=Tiny Disability-rights Group Scores At Princeton Not Dead Yet, Built On Opposition To Assisted Suicide And Euthanasia, Gained Notice Protesting Against A Bioethicist. - Philly.com |publisher=Articles.philly.com |date=2001-04-20 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diane Coleman, JD, is the founder and president of this national group. Stephen Drake, a research analyst with NDY, is one of the group's chief spokespersons and contacts for press releases.

The group was founded on April 27, 1996. Its name comes from the film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', in which [[bubonic plague|plague]] victims are thrown into a cart and hauled off to be buried.  A man being given up as a corpse by his family protests that he is "not dead yet!"

In 2004 NDY protested the removal of [[Terri Schiavo]]'s feeding tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19752-2005Apr1.html |title=Schiavo Raised Profile of Disabled |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raggededgemagazine.com/focus/postschiavo0405.html |title=After Terri Schiavo |publisher=Raggededgemagazine.com |date=2005-04-02 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also protested the movie ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'', in which the injection of an overdose of [[epinephrine]] to euthanize a suicidal [[quadriplegic]] woman is depicted as a rational and compassionate act. The group has been highly critical of utilitarian philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] of [[Princeton University]].  Coleman has called Professor Singer "the most dangerous man on earth" and asserted that he was advocating genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Johann |last=Hari |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/peter-singer-some-people-are-more-equal-than-others-6166342.html |title=Peter Singer: Some people are more equal than others - Profiles - People |publisher=The Independent |date=2004-07-01 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 NDY organized protests against Singer's position that new-born babies with certain disabilities can morally be killed, which he sees as no different from abortion. The protesters called for Princeton University to dismiss Singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/16/peter-singer-princeton-bioethics-professor-faces-c/ |first=Jessica |last=Chasmar |title=Peter Singer, Princeton bioethics professor, faces calls for resignation over infanticide support |publisher=Washington Times |date=2015-06-16 |accessdate=2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hokusai Onryo.jpg|thumb|Onryō from the Kinsei-Kaidan-Shimoyonohoshi (近世怪談霜夜星)]]
In traditional beliefs of Japan and in literature, '''''onryō''''' ([[wiktionary:怨霊|怨霊]], literally "vengeful spirit", sometimes rendered "wrathful spirit")&lt;ref name="grappard"/&gt; refers to a ghost (''[[yūrei]]'') believed capable of causing harm in the world of the living, harming or killing enemies, or even causing natural disasters to exact [[Revenge|vengeance]] to redress the wrongs it received while alive then takes their spirits from their dying bodies.

The term overlaps somewhat with {{nihongo||御霊|[[goryō]]}}, except that in the cult of the ''goryō'', the acting agent need not necessarily be a wrathful spirit.&lt;ref name="grappard"/&gt;

==Origin==
While the origin of ''onryō'' is unclear, belief in their existence can be traced back to the 8th century and was based on the idea that powerful and enraged souls of the dead could influence or harm the living people. The earliest ''onryō'' cult that developed was around [[Prince Nagaya]] who died in 729;&lt;ref name="grappard"/&gt; and the first record of possession by the ''onryō'' spirit affecting the health is found in the chronicle ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'' (797), which states that "{{nihongo|[[Fujiwara Hirotsugu]]|[[:ja:藤原広嗣|藤原広嗣]]}}'s soul harmed [[Genbō]] to death" (Hirotsugu having died in a failed insurrection, named the "[[Fujiwara no Hirotsugu Rebellion]]", after failing to remove his rival, the priest Genbō, from power).&lt;ref&gt;For a source that identifies Hirotsugu as ''onryō'', see:{{Harvnb|Suzuki|2011|loc=135 (note 2 to Chapter 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A source that gives Hirotsugu as first example on record of "etiological possession" is {{Harvnb|McCullough|1973|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vengeance==
Traditionally in Japan, ''onryō'' driven by [[Revenge|vengeance]] were thought capable of causing not only their enemy's death, as in the case of Hirotsugu's vengeful spirit held responsible for killing the priest [[Genbō]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McCullough|first=William H.|title=Spirit Possession in the Heian Period|editor-last1=Ōta|editor-first1=Saburo (太田三郎)|editor-last2=Fukuda|editor-first2=Rikutaro (福田陸太郎)|journal=Studies on Japanese Culture (日本文化研究論集)|volume=1|year=1973|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLAdAQAAMAAJ}}; (Also printed in ''Nihon Bunka Kenkyū Kokusai Kaigi gijiroku'' (日本文化研究国際会議議事錄) ([https://books.google.com/books?id=RN9YAAAAMAAJ Volume 1, 1973], pp. 350- (p.356)&lt;/ref&gt;), but causing natural disasters such as [[earthquake]]s, [[fire]]s, [[storm]]s, [[drought]], [[famine]] and [[Pandemic|pestilence]],&lt;ref name="grappard"/&gt; as in the case of [[Prince Sawara]]'s spirit embittered against his brother, the [[Emperor Kanmu]].&lt;ref name="suzuki"&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Yui|title=Medicine Master Buddha: The Iconic Worship of Yakushi in Heian Japan|publisher=BRILL|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dgo7JV9vNCQC&amp;pg=PA29|pages=29–31|isbn=978-9004196018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common parlance, such vengeance exacted by supernatural beings or forces is termed {{nihongo||[[:ja:祟り|祟り]]|tatari}}.&lt;ref name="grappard"&gt;{{citation|last=Grappard|first=Allan G.|contribution=Religious practices|editor-last=Hall|editor-first=John Whitney|volume=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiTWWfoyuyAC&amp;pg=PA560|pages=559–|isbn=978-0521223539|title=The Cambridge History of Japan|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Emperor Kanmu]] had accused his brother Sawara of plotting (possibly falsely to remove him as rival to the throne), and the latter who was exiled died by fasting. The reason that the Emperor moved the capital to [[Nagaoka-kyō]] thence to [[Kyoto]] was an attempt to avoid the wrath of his brother's spirit, according to a number of scholars.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt; This not succeeding entirely, the emperor tried to lift the curse by appeasing his brother's ghost, by performing Buddhist rites to pay respect, and granting Prince Sawara the posthumous title of emperor.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt;

A well-known example of appeasement of the ''onryō'' spirit is the case of [[Sugawara no Michizane]], who had been politically disgraced and died in exile. Believed to cause the death of his calumniators in quick succession, as well as catastrophes (especially lightning damage), and the court tried to appease the wrathful spirit by restoring Michizane's old rank and position.&lt;ref name="grappard"/&gt; Michizane became deified in the cult of the [[Tenjin (kami)|Tenjin]], with [[Tenman-gū]] shrines erected around him.

===Examples===
Possibly the most famous ''onryō'' is Oiwa, from the ''[[Yotsuya Kaidan]]''. In this story the husband remains unharmed; however, he is the target of the ''onryō''’s vengeance. Oiwa's vengeance on him isn't physical retribution, but rather psychological torment.

Other examples include:

*'''''How a Man's Wife Became a [[Vengeful ghost|Vengeful Ghost]] and How Her Malignity Was Diverted by a Master of Divination'''''
:In this tale from the medieval collection, ''[[Konjaku Monogatarishū]]'', an abandoned wife is found dead with a full head of hair intact and the bones still attached. The husband, fearing retribution from her spirit, asks a {{Nihongo|diviner|[[:ja:陰陽師|陰陽師]]|onmyōji}} for aid. The husband must endure while grabbing her hair and riding astride her corpse. She complains of the heavy load and leaves the house to "go looking" (presumably for the husband), but after a day she gives up and returns, after which the diviner is able to complete her exorcism with an incantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=S.

(translator)|title=Ages ago; thirty-seven tales from the Konjaku monogatari collection|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1959|page=72|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nv-wAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One of the texts cited by Jones: {{citation|editor-last=Haga|editor-first=Yaichi (芳賀矢一)|chapter=卷第廿四/第20: 人妻成悪靈除其害陰陽師語 |work=攷証今昔物語集 (Kōshō konjaku monogatari shū)|volume=3 (下)|year=1921|page=106|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/945416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Of a Promise Broken'''''
:In this tale from the [[Izumo Province|Izumo]] area recorded by [[Lafcadio Hearn]], a [[samurai]] vows to his dying wife never to remarry.  He soon breaks the promise, and the ghost comes to first warn, then murder the young bride, ripping her head off. The watchmen who had been put to sleep chase down the apparition, and with a slash of the sword while reciting [[Buddhist]] prayer, destroys it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hearn|first=Lafcadio|chapter=Of a Promise Broken|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGEiAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15|pages=15–26|title=A Japanese miscellany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
Hisako (久子, "Eternal Child" or "Everlasting Child") from the third entry of the fighting game Killer Instinct, is an onryō who died while defending her village. She still haunts her old village and will take vengeance on anyone who desecrates it's ruins with her naginata. She has pale white skin, long black hair like most Onryo. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ultra-combo.com/characters/hisako/&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 2018 the asymetrical horror game, Dead By Daylight released The Spirit DLC. The Spirit is an onryō who returns from the dead after being brutally murdered by her Father.

==Physical appearance==
Traditionally,{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} ''onryō'' and other ''[[yūrei]]'' (ghosts) had no particular appearance. However, with the rising of popularity of [[Kabuki]] during the [[Edo period]], a specific [[costume]] was developed.

Highly visual in nature, and with a single actor often assuming various roles within a play, Kabuki developed a system of visual shorthand that allowed the audience to instantly clue in as to which character is on stage, as well as emphasize the emotions and expressions of the actor.

A ghost costume consisted of three main elements:
* White burial [[kimono]], {{nihongo||[[:ja:白装束|白装束]]|shiroshōzoku}} or {{nihongo||[[:ja:死に装束|死に装束]]|shinishōzoku}} 
*Wild, unkempt long black hair
*Face make-up consisting of white foundation (''[[oshiroi]]'') coupled with face paintings (''[[kumadori]]'') of {{nihongo|blue shadows|藍隈|aiguma|extra2="[[indigo]] fringe"}}, much like villains are depicted in kabuki make-up artistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=日本博学倶楽部|title=「通」になれる古典芸能を楽しむ本: 落語・歌舞伎から能・狂言まで|publisher=PHP研究所|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpY2LFHGK34C&amp;pg=PT57|page=57|isbn=978-4569665498}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Parker|first=Helen S.

The PCL is an atypical type of centriole because it does not have [[microtubules]], a defining feature of centrioles.&lt;ref name=pmid28094036&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.07.006 |pmid=28094036 |pmc=5245371 |title=Centriole Remodeling during Spermiogenesis in  Drosophila |journal=Current Biology |volume=26 |issue=23 |pages=3183–3189 |year=2016 |last1=Khire |first1=Atul |last2=Jo |first2=Kyoung H |last3=Kong |first3=Dong |last4=Akhshi |first4=Tara |last5=Blachon |first5=Stephanie |last6=Cekic |first6=Anthony R |last7=Hynek |first7=Sarah |last8=Ha |first8=Andrew |last9=Loncarek |first9=Jadranka |last10=Mennella |first10=Vito |last11=Avidor-Reiss |first11=Tomer }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the PCL is a type of centriole for several reasons. (1) the PCL formation is dependent upon the same [[genetic pathway]] that mediates the initiation of centriole formation.&lt;ref name=pmid19293139/&gt; (2) The PCL is composed of centriolar proteins.&lt;ref name=pmid19293139/&gt; (3) After [[fertilization]], the sperm PCL function like a centriole.

The PCL was discovered in flies.

'''''Psilotum''''' is a genus of [[fern]]-like [[vascular plant]]s, commonly known as '''whisk ferns'''. It is one of two [[Genus|genera]] in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Psilotaceae]], the other being ''[[Tmesipteris]]''. Plants in these two genera were once thought to be descended from the earliest surviving [[vascular plant]]s, but more recent phylogenies place them as basal ferns, as a sister group to [[Ophioglossales]].  They lack true roots and leaves, the stems being the organs containing conducting tissue. There are only two species in ''Psilotum'' and a hybrid between the two. They differ from those in ''Tmesipteris'' in having stems with many branches and a [[Sporangium#Synangium|synangium]] with three lobes rather than two.

==Description and life cycle==
Whisk ferns in the genus ''Psilotum'' lack true roots but are anchored by creeping [[rhizome]]s. The stems have many branches with paired [[enation]]s, which look like small leaves but have no [[vascular tissue]]. Above these enations there are synangia formed by the fusion of three [[Sporangium|sporangia]] and which produce the [[spore]]s. When mature, the synangia release yellow to whitish spores which develop into a [[gametophyte]] less than {{convert|2|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long. The gametophyte lives underground as a [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophyte]], sometimes in a [[mycorrhiza]]l association. When the gametophyte is mature, it produces both egg and sperm cells. The sperm cells swim using several [[Flagellum|flagella]] and when they reach an egg cell, unite with it to form the young [[sporophyte]]. A mature sporophyte may grow to a height of {{convert|30|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} or more but lacks true leaves. The stem has a core of thick-walled [[Stele (biology)#Protostele|protostele]] in its centre surrounded by an [[endodermis]] which regulates the flow of water and nutrients. The surface of the stem is covered with [[stoma]]ta which allow gas exchange with the surroundings.&lt;ref name="Fairley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fairley|first1=Alan|last2=Moore|first2=Philip|title=Native plants of the Sydney region : from Newcastle to Nowra and west to the Dividing Range|date=2010|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest, N.S.W.|isbn=9781741755718|page=16|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCMP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Psilotales|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/plants/pterophyta/psilotales.html|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RBGS"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Psilotum''|url=http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&amp;showsyn=&amp;dist=&amp;constat=&amp;lvl=gn&amp;name=Psilotum|publisher=Royal botanic Gardens Sydney: plantnet|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gametophyte of ''Psilotum'' is unusual in that it branches dichotomously, lives underground and possesses vascular tissue.&lt;ref name="Holloway"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holloway|first1=John E.|title=The Gametophyte, Embryo, and Young Rhizome of ''Psilotum triquetrum'' (Swartz)|journal=Annals of Botany|date=1939|volume=3|issue=2|pages=313–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nutrition of the gametophyte appears to be [[myco-heterotrophs|myco-heterotrophic]], assisted by [[endophyte|endophytic]] [[fungi]].&lt;ref name="Manton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manton|first1=Irene|title=A Note on the Cytology of Psilotum with Special Reference to Vascular Prothalli from Rangitoto Island|journal=Annals of Botany|date=1942|volume=6|issue=2|pages=283–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and naming==
The genus ''Psilotum'' was first formally described in 1801 by [[Olof Swartz]] and the description was published in ''Journal fur die Botanik (Schrader)''.&lt;ref name=APNI&gt;{{cite web|title=''Psilotum''|url=https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/508374|publisher=APNI|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sw."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swartz|first1=Olof|last2=Schrader|first2=Heinrich Adolph (ed.)|title=Genera et species Filicum|journal=Journal fur die Botanik (Schrader)|date=1801|volume=2|page=109|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433011408949;view=1up;seq=123|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the genus is from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''psilos'' meaning "bare", "smooth" or "bald"&lt;ref name="RWB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Roland Wilbur|title=The Composition of Scientific Words|date=1956|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|page =123}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the lack of the usual plant organs, such as leaves.&lt;ref name="NZPCN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Lange|first1=Peter James|title=''Psilotum nudum''|url=http://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.aspx?ID=2229|publisher=New Zealand Plant Conservation Network|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species and distribution==
There are two species, ''[[Psilotum nudum]]'' and ''[[Psilotum complanatum]]'', with a hybrid between them known, ''Psilotum'' × ''intermedium'' [[Warren H. Wagner|W. H. Wagner]].

The distribution of ''Psilotum'' is tropical and subtropical, in the [[New World]], [[Asia]], and the [[Pacific]], with a few isolated populations in south-west Europe. The highest latitudes known are in [[South Carolina]], [[Cádiz]] province in [[Spain]],&lt;ref name="Libro Rojo"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mma.es/portal/secciones/biodiversidad/inventarios/inb/flora_vascular/pdf/1066.pdf | work = [[Atlas y Libro Rojo de la Flora Vascular Amenazada de España]] | title = Psilotum nudum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and southern [[Japan]] for ''P. nudum''.  In the U.S., ''P. nudum'' is found from Florida to Texas, and ''P. complanatum'' in Hawaii.

==Relation to ferns==
''Psilotum'' superficially resembles certain extinct early vascular plants, such as the [[rhyniophyte]]s and the trimerophyte genus ''Psilophyton''. The unusual features of ''Psilotum'' that suggest an affinity with early vascular plants include dichotomously branching sporophytes, aerial stems arising from horizontal rhizomes, a simple vascular cylinder, homosporous and terminal [[eusporangiate fern|eusporangia]] and a lack of roots.&lt;ref name=GiffordFoster&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gifford |first1=Ernest |title=Morphology and Evolution of Vascular Plants, Third Edition|year=1989|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|location=New York|isbn=0716719460|author2=Adriance Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, no fossils of psilophytes are known to exist. A careful study of the morphology and anatomy suggests that whisk ferns are not closely related to rhyniophytes, and that the ancestral features present in living psilophytes represent a reduction from a more typical modern fern plant. Significant differences between ''Psilotum'' and the rhyniophytes and trimerophytes are that the development of its vascular strand is [[xylem#development|exarch]], while it is [[xylem#development|centrarch]] in rhyniophytes and trimerophytes.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=P.R.|last2=Hemsley|first2=P.R.|year=1992|title=Green plants, their origin and diversity|edition=second|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=0521646731}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sporangia of ''Psilotum'' are [[locule|trilocular]] synangia resulting from the fusion of three adjacent sporangia,&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; and these are borne laterally on the axes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2537">'''Pudendal anesthesia''', also known as a '''pudendal block''', or '''saddle block''', is a form of [[local anesthesia]] commonly used in the practice of [[obstetrics]] to relieve pain during the delivery of baby by [[forceps]]. The pudendal nerve block prevents fainting during forceps delivery which was common before pudendal nerve block use was available. The anesthesia is produced by blocking the [[pudendal nerve]]s near the [[ischial spine]] of the [[pelvis]].&lt;ref name=Maclean2011&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Shaw|editor1-first=Robert| last1 = Maclean | first1= Allan|last2=Reid|first2=Wendy | title = Gynaecology | chapter=40|publisher = Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier | location = Edinburgh New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-7020-3120-5 |pages= 599-612|postscript=; Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlClinical Case - Perineum &amp; External Genitalia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anatomy.med.umich.edu/reproductive_system/perineum_case.html|title=Clinical Case - Perineum &amp; External Genitalia|format=|work=|accessdate=2009-05-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227105212/http://anatomy.med.umich.edu/reproductive_system/perineum_case.html|archivedate=2009-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ischial spine separates the greater and lesser sciatic foramina at the exit of the bony pelvis. Pelvis in Latin means 'saucepan' and one can view the bony human pelvis as a saucepan, with circular/cylidrical walls, but without a base and a flailed upper rim, or wings to which the gluteal muscles (hip bone stabilisers) attach. The pelvic bony cylindrical walls also have a curve, which follows that of the curve of the [[sacrum]], the fused vertebral bones of the lower end of the spine.  

The pudendal block gets its name because a local anesthetic, such as [[lidocaine]] or [[chloroprocaine]], is injected into the pudendal canal where the pudendal nerve is located. This allows quick pain relief to the [[perineum]], [[vulva]], and [[vagina]]. A pudendal block is usually given in the second stage of labor just before delivery of the baby. It relieves pain around the vagina and rectum as the baby comes down the birth canal. It is also helpful just before an [[episiotomy]]. Lidocaine is usually preferred for a pudendal block because it has a longer duration than chloroprocaine which usually lasts less than one hour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/pudendalblock.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Queen of the Nile'''" is episode 143 of the [[American television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''. In this episode, a journalist becomes romantically involved with a dangerous, secretly centuries-old movie star.

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|Jordan Herrick, syndicated [[columnist]], whose work appears in more than a hundred newspapers. By nature a cynic, a disbeliever, caught for the moment by a lovely vision. He knows the vision he's seen is no dream; she is Pamela Morris, renowned movie star, whose name is a household word and whose face is known to millions. What Mr. Herrick does not know is that he has also just looked into the face—of the Twilight Zone.}}

==Plot==
[[Columnist]] Jordan Herrick visits actress Pamela Morris, a woman known for her beauty and vitality, for an interview. In Pamela's manor he notices a painting of her that is dated 1940. Pamela still looks just as she did in the painting. When questioned on this, she says the painter drew her when she was a child with a projection of what she would look like as an adult, and deflects questions about her age. Pamela and Jordan flirt during the interview and make dinner plans for that night. As Jordan is leaving, an old woman who Pamela introduced as her mother, Mrs. Draper, warns him to never come back. Mrs. Draper says Pamela is many centuries old and that she is actually Pamela's daughter.

During his date with Pamela, Jordan mentions what Mrs. Draper had said. Pamela claims Mrs. Draper is mentally ill, but after the date, Herrick calls his editor and asks him to research Pamela's first film, ''The Queen of the Nile''. The editor reveals that the film was a [[remake]] of a silent movie filmed on location in Egypt. Leading lady Constance Taylor was apparently killed in a cave-in near the end of the shooting. The editor compares photos of Constance and Pamela in the same role and says they look alike. Jordan asks the editor to dig up articles on every man Pamela has ever been involved with.

Jordan returns to the manor and confronts Pamela with his discovery. Pamela drugs Jordan's coffee and then places a [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetle]] on his unconscious body. The beetle drains his life until he has turned to dust. She then applies the scarab to her own chest.

The episode ends with another young and handsome columnist arriving to interview Pamela, starting the cycle once again. In the closing narration, it is hinted that Miss Morris is actually [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]], and that she has lived for more than 2,000 years.

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|Everyone knows Pamela Morris, the beautiful and eternally young movie star. Or does she have another name, even more famous, an Egyptian name from centuries past? It's best not to be too curious, lest you wind up like Jordan Herrick, a pile of dust and old clothing discarded in the endless eternity of the Twilight Zone.}}

==Production notes==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2017}}Apparently, in the original first-draft script, a handsome young policeman turns up at the end of the story, asking Pamela Morris as to the whereabouts of the now missing Jordan Herrick. She begins to flatter and flirt with the cop, setting him up to start the cycle all over again.

'''Respiratory failure''' results from inadequate [[gas exchange]] by the [[respiratory system]], meaning that the arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide or both cannot be kept at normal levels. A drop in the oxygen carried in blood is known as [[hypoxemia]]; a rise in arterial [[carbon dioxide]] levels is called [[hypercapnia]]. Respiratory failure is classified as either Type I or Type II, based on whether there is a high carbon dioxide level. The definition of respiratory failure in clinical trials usually includes increased respiratory rate, abnormal blood gases (hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both), and  evidence of increased work of breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tulaimat|first1=A|last2=Patel|first2=A|last3=Wisniewski|first3=M|last4=Gueret|first4=R|title=The validity and reliability of the clinical assessment of increased work of breathing in acutely ill patients.|journal=Journal of critical care|date=August 2016|volume=34|pages=111–5|pmid=27288621|doi=10.1016/j.jcrc.2016.04.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal [[partial pressure]] reference values are: oxygen [[Blood gas tension|Pa]][[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] more than {{convert|80|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}}, and carbon dioxide [[Blood gas tension|Pa]][[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] lesser than {{convert|45|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Cause==

Several types of condition can potentially result in respiratory failure:

*Conditions which reduce the [[ventilation (physiology)|flow of air]] into and out of the lungs, including physical obstruction by [[foreign bodies]] or [[mass effect (medicine)|masses]], and reduced breathing ability due to drugs or changes to the chest wall.
*Conditions which impair the lungs' blood supply. These include [[thromboembolism|thromboembolic conditions]] and conditions which reduce the output of the [[right heart]], such as [[right heart failure]] and some [[myocardial infarction|myocardial infarctions]].
*Conditions which limit the ability of the lung tissue to [[gas exchange|exchange]] oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the air within the lungs. Any disease which can damage the lung tissue can fit into this category. The most common causes are (in no particular order) [[lower respiratory tract infection|infections]], [[interstitial lung disease]], and [[pulmonary oedema]].

==Diagnosis==

===Type 1===
Type 1 respiratory failure is defined as a [[hypoxemia|low level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia)]] without an increased level of [[hypercapnia|carbon dioxide in the blood (hypercapnia)]], and indeed the P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be normal or low. It is typically caused by a ventilation/perfusion ([[V/Q]]) mismatch; the volume of air flowing in and out of the lungs is not matched with the flow of blood to the lungs. The basic defect in type 1 respiratory failure is failure of oxygenation characterized by:

:::{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || decreased (&lt; {{convert|60|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || normal or decreased (&lt;{{convert|50|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P&lt;sub&gt;A-a&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || increased
|}

This type of respiratory failure is caused by conditions that affect [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] such as:
* Low ambient oxygen (e.g. at high altitude)
* Ventilation-perfusion mismatch (parts of the lung receive oxygen but not enough blood to absorb it, e.g. [[pulmonary embolism]])
* Alveolar hypoventilation (decreased [[respiratory minute volume|minute volume]] due to reduced respiratory muscle activity, e.g. in acute [[neuromuscular disease]]); this form can also cause type 2 respiratory failure if severe
* Diffusion problem (oxygen cannot enter the capillaries due to parenchymal disease, e.g. in [[pneumonia]] or [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome|ARDS]])
* Shunt (oxygenated blood mixes with non-oxygenated blood from the venous system, e.g. [[Right-to-left shunt|right to left shunt]])

===Type 2===
Hypoxemia (PaO2 &lt;8kPa) with hypercapnia (PaCO2 &gt;6.0kPa).

The basic defect in type 2 respiratory failure is characterized by:

:::{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || decreased (&lt; {{convert|60|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || increased (&gt; {{convert|50|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P&lt;sub&gt;A-a&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || normal
|-
|pH || decreased
|}

Type 2 respiratory failure is caused by inadequate alveolar ventilation; both oxygen and carbon dioxide are affected.  Defined as the buildup of carbon dioxide levels (P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that has been generated by the body but cannot be eliminated. The underlying causes include:
* Increased airways resistance ([[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[asthma]], suffocation)
* Reduced breathing effort (drug effects, brain stem lesion, extreme obesity)
* A decrease in the area of the lung available for gas exchange (such as in [[chronic bronchitis]])
* Neuromuscular problems ([[Guillain–Barré syndrome]],&lt;ref name="Burt 475–479"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burt|first=Christiana C.|author2=Arrowsmith, Joseph E. |title=Respiratory failure|journal=Surgery (Oxford)|date=1 November 2009|volume=27|issue=11|pages=475–479|doi=10.1016/j.mpsur.2009.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[motor neuron disease]])
* Deformed (kyphoscoliosis), rigid ([[ankylosing spondylitis]]), or [[flail chest]].&lt;ref name="Burt 475–479"/&gt;

==Treatment==
[[Image:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|right|140 px|Mechanical ventilator]]
Treatment of the underlying cause is required. [[Endotracheal intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]] are required in cases of severe respiratory failure (PaO2 less than 50 mmHg). [[Respiratory stimulant]]s such as [[doxapram]] are rarely used, and if the respiratory failure resulted from an [[overdose]] of [[sedative]] drugs such as [[opioid]]s or [[benzodiazepines]], then the appropriate [[antidote]] ([[naloxone]] or [[flumazenil]], respectively) will be given.

There is tentative evidence that in those with respiratory failure identified before arrival in hospital, [[continuous positive airway pressure]] can be useful when started before conveying to hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bakke|first1=SA|last2=Botker|first2=MT|last3=Riddervold|first3=IS|last4=Kirkegaard|first4=H|last5=Christensen|first5=EF|title=Continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive ventilation in prehospital treatment of patients with acute respiratory failure: a systematic review of controlled studies.|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine|date=22 November 2014|volume=22|issue=1|pages=69|pmid=25416493|doi=10.1186/s13049-014-0069-8|pmc=4251922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''riderless horse''' (which may be [[caparison]]ed in ornamental and protective coverings, having a detailed protocol of their own) is a single horse, without a rider, and with boots reversed in the stirrups, which sometimes accompanies a [[funeral]] procession. The horse follows the [[Caisson (vehicle)|caisson]] carrying the [[coffin|casket]].&lt;ref name="USDofD"&gt;

[[File:Jousting horse, funeral procession of Archduke Albert VII of Austria.jpeg|thumb|Riderless [[jousting]] horse of [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]] in his funeral procession, 1623 (etching with hand coloring by [[Jacob Franquart]])]]
The custom is believed to date back to the time of [[Genghis Khan]], when a horse was sacrificed to serve the fallen warrior in the next world. The riderless horse later came to symbolize a warrior who would ride no more.&lt;ref name="cnn-riderless"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/05/23/arlington.riderless.horse/| title = Riderless horse adds poignancy to military burials| work = CNN.com| accessdate = 30 March 2014| date=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the riderless horse is part of the military honors given to an [[United States Army|Army]] or [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] officer who was a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] or above; this includes the [[President of the United States|President]], by virtue of having been the country's commander in chief and the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], having overseen the armed forces. [[Alexander Hamilton]], former Secretary of the Treasury (1789-1795) was the first American to be given the honor. Historian Ron Chernow noted that Hamilton's gray horse followed the casket "with the boots and spurs of its former rider reversed in the stirrups."&lt;ref name=Chernow&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chernow|first1=Ron|title=Alexander Hamilton|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-009-0|pages= 710–712}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Abraham Lincoln]] was the first president of the United States to be officially honored by the inclusion of the riderless horse in his funeral cortege,&lt;ref name="USDofD" /&gt; although a letter from [[George Washington's]] personal secretary recorded the president's horse was part of the president's funeral, carrying his saddle, pistols, and holsters.&lt;ref name="WHH"&gt;

Traditionally, simple black riding boots are reversed in the stirrups to represent a fallen commander looking back on his troops for the last time.

==Notable horses==

=== Old Bob ===
In 1865, Abraham Lincoln was honored by the inclusion of a riderless horse at his funeral. When Lincoln's funeral train reached [[Springfield, Illinois]], his horse, [[Old Bob]], who was draped in a black mourning blanket, followed the procession and led mourners to Lincoln's burial spot.&lt;ref name="bj-america"&gt;

[[Image:Roadside Memorial.JPG|thumb|Roadside memorial, [[Virginia]], United States]]
A '''roadside memorial''' is a marker that usually commemorates a site where a person died suddenly and unexpectedly, away from home.  Unlike a grave site headstone, which marks where a body is laid, the memorial marks the last place on earth where a person was alive&amp;nbsp;– although in the past travelers were, out of necessity, often buried where they fell.

Usually the memorial is created and maintained by family members or friends of the person who died. A common type of memorial is simply a bunch of flowers, real or plastic, taped to [[street furniture]] or a tree trunk. A handwritten message, personal mementos, etc. may be included. More sophisticated memorials may be a [[memorial cross]], [[ghost bike]], or a plaque with an inscription, decorated with flowers or wreaths.

Roadside memorials tend to be clustered along the busiest roadways and often times at intersections. This is evident when examining the clustering of tribute sites on a map such as this one showing how many sites are along US 30 in northern Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/|title=Roadside Tribute: A Site to Remember|last=|first=|date=|website=Roadside Tribute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning and message==
Roadside memorials are a statement of [[grief]] and [[love]] from the loved ones of the accident victim(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid|first= A.|year= 2015|title= Place, Meaning, and the Visual Argument of the Roadside Cross, Savannah Law Review| volume= 2|pages=265–300 |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2633661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But apart from their personal significance, these memorials also serve as a reminder and warning to other road users of the dangers of driving, and to encourage safer driving.&lt;ref&gt;Tay, R., Churchill, A. &amp; de Barros, A. 2011. Effect of roadside memorial on traffic flow, Accident Analysis and Prevention, vol. 43, pp.483–486&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tay, R. 2009. Drivers’ perceptions and reactions to roadside memorials, Accident Analysis and Prevention, vol. pp.41, 663–669&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s, the [[Arizona]] [[Highway patrol|State Highway Patrol]] began using white crosses to mark the site of fatal car accidents. This practice was continued by families of road-crash victims after it had been abandoned by the police{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. The [[ghost bike]] phenomenon, where an old bicycle is painted white and locked up at an accident site, serves the same purpose in relation to cycling casualties. Some tribute sites include elaborate displays to memorialize the personality of the person to whom the tribute site is dedicated, including action figures and lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/tribute-sites/united-states/california-1/searles-valley/tributes/superman-the-rock-searle-valley-trona/|title=Superman &amp; The Rock Searle Valley/Trona|last=|first=|date=|website=Roadside Tribute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, roadside memorials were personal memorials, but there is a modern trend toward public memorials of increasingly large size.  Typically little or no effort is made to make the memorials accommodate the natural beauty of the landscape and many roadside memorials, over time, lack proper maintenance.

The phenomenon of roadside memorials may be associated with another growing trend:  public outpouring of grief for celebrities. The death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], for example, precipitated an avalanche of flowers and wreaths at the [[Pont de l'Alma]] road tunnel in Paris, the site of her death, and at [[Kensington Palace]], her home in London.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} While car-crash victims are rarely so well known, something of the same sort of impulse to make a public display of emotion at the site of a tragedy may be partly responsible for the growing popularity of roadside memorials. The broad phenomenon of creating improvised and temporary memorials after traumatic death (accidents, murder, disasters etc.) has become popular since the 1980s. Because of their non-institutionalized character they are generically coined as grassroots memorials.&lt;ref&gt;''Grassroots Memorials: The Politics of Memorializing Traumatic Death'', eds Peter Jan Margry and Cristina Sánchez-Carretero (New York: Berghahn, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and practice==
Roadside memorials have been erected around the world for centuries. Their legality varies from country to country. A web site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/|title=Roadside Tribute: A Site to Remember|website=Roadside Tribute: Remembering Lost Loved Ones}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created in order to preserve in a more permanent manner the physical roadside tributes in a virtual manner. This helps to preserve in a longer term manner the original beauty of the tribute site that tends to degrade over time without regular maintenance. It also provides a means of creating a virtual tribute site for those who haven't yet built a physical memorial at the accident scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/about-us/|title=About Roadside Tribute|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The number of memorials erected in [[Australia]] since 1990 has increased considerably. In 2003, it was estimated that one in five road deaths were  memorialized at the site of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Ukraine===
[[File:Ukrainian roadside memorial.png|thumb|A roadside memorial in Ukraine]]
It is traditional in [[Ukraine]] to place a roadside memorial on the site of a deadly car or motorcycle crash. It is usually a [[cross]] or a small monument with a [[wreath]] of flowers. There are also usually fresh flowers regularly placed by the cross if the relatives of the person who died live close enough to look after the memorial. Sometimes Ukrainian roadside memorials can be more elaborate, including a small granite or marble gravestone and/or a picture of the loved one.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the practice of erecting roadside memorials has recently generated a media debate about the danger these memorials may pose to other road users and to people erecting them in unsafe places. This debate has been sparked by accounts of dangerous actions, such as when an adult crosses a main road with a child to place a tribute. Some jurisdictions already enforce local regulations, and police officials and local councilors have suggested that uniform rules be introduced across the country. For example, according to the [[BBC]], in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], memorials will only be allowed where it is deemed safe and appropriate, and they will be removed after three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4806870.stm | work=BBC News | title='Dangerous' road tributes concern | date=15 March 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread  of spontaneous roadside memorials to mark the site of fatal [[traffic accident]]s in the [[United States]] is a relatively new phenomenon. There is a gravestone-style memorial in Ellington, CT marking a child's death in 1812.  A typical memorial includes a cross (usually wooden), flowers, hand-painted signs, and, in the case of a child's death, [[stuffed animal]]s. 

The spread of roadside memorials in the United States has increased in recent decades as a result of large immigrant populations from Mexico entering the country {{Clarify|United States|date=July 2017}}. And while not limited to Mexican populations, roadside memorials are most common in areas with large Mexican populations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Formerly, in funerary processions where a group would proceed from a church to a graveyard carrying a coffin, the bearers would take a rest, or ''[[wikt:descanso|descanso]]'' in Spanish, and wherever they set the coffin down, a cross would be placed there in memory of the event. The modern practice of roadside shrines commemorate the last place a person was alive before receiving fatal injuries, even if they should actually die in a hospital after the crash.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/environment/environment_krqe_albuquerque_125_crews_protect_roadside_memorial_200903032140 |title=I25 crews protect roadside memorial |publisher=Krqe.com |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306024108/http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/environment/environment_krqe_albuquerque_125_crews_protect_roadside_memorial_200903032140 |archivedate=6 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[southwestern United States]], they are also common at historic [[paraje]]s on old [[long distance trail]]s, going back to the roots of the tradition, and also marked the graves of people who died while traveling.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} A descanso memorial may be decorated especially for the holidays, and for significant anniversaries in the person's life.  A descanso memorial for a child may be decorated with special toys, even toy vignettes of family life, and votive candles may be placed there on special nights.

In the United States, the legal situation varies from state to state.

In [[New Mexico]], Department of Transportation crews undertaking new construction are not required to protect them, but usually either avoid altering them, or otherwise place them as close to where they originally were as possible once construction has been completed as a courtesy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In [[California]], Streets and Highways Code Section 101.10 directs the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to place and maintain memorial signs along state highways that read “Please Don't Drink and Drive” followed by “In Memory of {victim's name}.” Caltrans places signs at the request of victims’ relatives when there is a fatality as a result of an alcohol or drug-impaired driver. The signs are to remain in place for a period of seven years. The department shall charge the requesting party a fee to cover the department’s cost in designing, constructing, placing, and maintaining that sign, and the department’s costs in administering this section.{{clarify|date=March 2014}}&lt;!--alongside state highways?--&gt;

The states of [[Colorado]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Wisconsin]] ban such memorials.

In the state of [[Delaware]], roadside memorials are illegal per the Clear Zone Act for safety reasons. As an alternative to roadside memorials, the Delaware Highway Memorial Garden located at the [[Smyrna Rest Area]] consists of a path with bricks bearing the names of people who died along roads in Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Programs and Services – Delaware Highway Memorial Garden|publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation|url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/mem_garden/index.shtml|accessdate=7 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311201759/http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/mem_garden/index.shtml|archivedate=11 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states impose specific requirements for roadside memorials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/local/article/0,2845,MCA_25340_4541992,00.html Commercial Appeal : Memphis News, Business, Homes, Jobs, Cars, &amp; Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319083455/http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/local/article/0,2845,MCA_25340_4541992,00.html |date=19 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.descansos.org/links.shtml#STATE_APPLICATIONS_AND_GUIDELINES__ |title=(see state by state requirements) |publisher=Descansos.org |date=8 September 2004 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121053/http://www.descansos.org/links.shtml#STATE_APPLICATIONS_AND_GUIDELINES__ |archivedate=5 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sasha''' and '''Zamani''' are two aspects of time as expressed in some Eastern and Central African cultures.{{Which|date=February 2012}}  Sasha are spirits known by someone still alive, while Zamani are spirits not known by anyone currently alive. Sasha are concerned with, and are expressed as, the present time, the recent past, and the near future; while Zamani is the limitless past. Potential time is the third part of the space-time continuum in African Thought. People must learn from the past to act wisely in the present to create a good future.

== Description ==
According to [[James Loewen]] in his book ''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me]]'':   ''The recently departed whose time overlapped with people still here are the Sasha, the living dead. They are not wholly dead, for they live on in the memories of the living ... when the last person knowing an ancestor dies, that ancestor leaves the Sasha for the Zamani, the dead.  As generalized ancestors, the Zamani are not forgotten but revered.''&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L.K. [http://www.bu.edu/prc/6months/6monthsessay.htm 6 Month Essay], Curator, Photographic Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt;  Loewen cites and paraphrases the explanation from ''African Religions and Philosophy'' by [[John Mbiti]]. Sasha and Zamani are not stages of ''death''. They are the two [[ontological]] stages (or dimensions) of ''history'' in [[Swahili culture]].

In Swahili, the two time dimensions are called sasa and zamani. Both have quality and quantity. People speak of them as big, small, little, short, long, etc. in relation to a particular event. Sasha refers to the events that have just taken place or are taking place now at the moment or are just about to take place in the near future. Sasha time can extend into the future for about six months or, at the most, one year. Zamani time overlaps sasha time to some extent in the present, but it also goes back very far into the past time. It absorbs, holds, and stores all the events that have ever occurred. It is more significant than sasha because it stretches endlessly back into the past. It includes the time of myth when all the stories of creation took place and when the great and famous heroes of the past performed their exploits. (Anderson 1986, Mbiti 1994.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zamani is not limited to what in English is called the past.… Zamani overlaps with Sasha and the two are not separable. Sasha feeds or disappears into Zamani. But before events become incorporated into the Zamani, they have to become realized or actualized within the Sasha dimension. When this has taken place, the events "move" backwards from the Sasha into the Zamani…. It is the final storehouse for all phenomena and events, the ocean of time in which everything becomes absorbed into a reality that is neither after nor before. 
John S. Mbiti, African Religions and Philosophy, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Heinemann, 1990), 22.

[[Mom Rajawongse]] '''Seni Pramoj''' ({{lang-th|หม่อมราชวงศ์เสนีย์ ปราโมช}}, {{RTGS|''Seni Pramot''}}, {{IPA-th|sěː.niː praː.môːt|IPA}}; 26 May 1905{{spaced ndash}}28 July 1997) was three times the [[List of Prime Ministers of Thailand|prime minister]] of [[Thailand]], a politician in the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]], lawyer, diplomat and [[professor]]. A descendant of the [[Chakri Dynasty|Thai royal family]], he was the great-grandson of [[Buddha Loetla Nabhalai|King Rama II]]. His final two terms as PM sandwiched the only term of his brother, [[Kukrit Pramoj]].

==Biography==
Born a son of Prince Khamrob and mother Daeng ([[Bunnag]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaiwaysmagazine.com/thai_article/2021_kukrit's_home/kukrits's_home.html An Impressive Day at M.R. Kukrit's Home]; [http://www.rootsweb.com/~thawgw/bibliography.html Thailand Bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt; he was educated at [[Trent College]] in [[Derbyshire]] before obtaining a BA second class honours degree in [[jurisprudence]] from [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. He continued his studies at [[Gray's Inn]], London, receiving first honours. After returning to Thailand he studied Thai Law, and following six months as a trainee at the Supreme Court, he started to work at the Justice Civil Court. Later, he was transferred to the Foreign Ministry and in 1940 was sent to the [[United States]] as Thai ambassador.

===Free Thai Movement===
{{main|Free Thai Movement}}
Japanese forces [[Japanese Invasion of Thailand|invaded]] Thailand early on the morning of 8 December 1941, shortly after the attack on the United States at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]]. The Prime Minister, Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]], ordered a ceasefire at noon, entering into an armistice that allowed the Japanese to use Thai military installations in their invasion of Malaya and Burma. On 21 December, a formal military alliance with Japan was concluded.

The Phibun government declared war on [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and the [[United States]] on 25 January 1942. Although the Thai ambassador in [[London]] delivered Thailand's declaration of war to the British administration, Seni refused to do so. Instead, he considered organising a resistance movement in the United States.

Following a late morning interview with Secretary [[Cordell Hull]] on 8 December, Seni returned to his legation to confer with his staff. The ambassador and his staff unanimously decided to cast their lot with the Allies. Late the same afternoon, he returned to the State Department to offer their services to the Allied cause. Blaming pro-Japanese elements for the early Thai surrender, he spoke to Hull of unfreezing Thai assets in the United States for further prosecution of the war and suggested that the Thais in the country might "organise and preserve a government of true patriotic, liberty-loving Thais while his government is in the clutches of Japan."

The State Department decided to act as if Seni continued to represent Thailand. This enabled him to tap into the frozen Thai assets. When asked to draw up a list of "reliable and influential Thai nationals known to be definitely patriotic and anti-Japanese" by the State Department (at the suggestion of [[John P. Davies]]), Seni named Regent [[Pridi Phanomyong]], politicians [[Khuang Aphaiwong]] and [[Wilat Osathanon]], and diplomats [[Phraya Sisena]] and [[Direk Jayanama]] as "reliables".

Seni advanced plans to mobilise Thai volunteers in support of the Allies. Beyond the legation staffers and their families, most other Thai residents were students enrolled at colleges and universities, including institutions such as [[Harvard]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and [[Cornell]]. Many chose to stay following the Thai declaration of war in January, refusing repatriation. Most, like Seni, saw their nation as a victim of Japanese aggression.

===Post-war years===
[[File:Seni11.jpg|thumb|left|Seni in 1964]]
Seni became prime minister on 17 September 1945, the day he returned to Bangkok. However, he found his position as the head of a cabinet packed with Pridi's loyalists quite uncomfortable. Northeastern populist politicians like [[Tiang Sirikhanth]] and Bangkok newcomers like [[Sanguan Tularaksa]] were not people the aristocratic Seni preferred to associate with. They, in turn, viewed Seni as an elitist who was entirely out of touch with Thailand's political realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Memorandum on Certain Aspects of Siamese Politics|author=Prince Suphasawatwongsanit Sawadiwat|publisher=Wanthani}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pridi continued to wield power behind the scenes as he had done during the Khuang government. The regent's looming presence and overarching authority rankled the proud, thin-skinned Seni, fuelling a personal animosity that would poison Thailand’s postwar politics.

The Pramoj brothers subsequently joined the newly formed Democrat Party in 1946, which was for the most part made up of royalists and conservative reactionaries. Seni would spend the next two years vigorously carrying out a personal campaign against Pridi. Earlier in the year he had called for an investigation of the use of the US$500,000 in Thai assets unfrozen by the US government that he had turned over to the OSS. Insinuating the money had been transferred to the senior statesman, he lamented that "most of the money had not been spent for what it was intended." An independent investigatory panel, however, found no mistake, concluding that the Free Thai had "performed remarkably well" and that the Thai people "owe a great deal to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thailand's Secret War|author=E. Bruce Reynolds|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome left the ex-prime minister looking extremely foolish.

Seni soon got his revenge, however. In the immediate aftermath of King Ananda Mahidol's death, Seni and his party launched relentless attacks against the government and accused Pridi of being responsible for the king's assassination, the implausibility of the charge notwithstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=United States Foreign Policy in Thailand's World War II Peace Settlements|author=Larry Allen Niksch|publisher=Georgetown University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1947 the Democrat Party cooperated with disgruntled army officers to oust the government of Thawan Thamrongnawasawat. As part of the deal, Seni was awarded a cabinet portfolio in Khuang's coup-installed cabinet.

On Tuesday, 14 June 1949, in a lecture delivered before the Siam Society, Seni pleaded, "[I] happen to belong to that peculiar species known as politicians who are in the incorrigible habit of attempting to accomplish the impossible." Word had gotten around that his brother and he had been "getting up a little English translation of some of King [[Mongkut]]'s public papers and private correspondence...without actually putting it to a final execution." He chooses to speak of the king in his capacity as a legislator, "because legislation is the field I am more closely familiar with than any other." Seni provides, "ample evidence to show that the King was the first and foremost democrat of our country," and quotes from an Act declaring an election whereby "any person, even though he be a slave, who is believed to be so sufficiently possessed of wisdom and restraint as to be able to give clear and satisfactory judgment in accordance with truth, justice and the law may be elected as judge." With regard to the 1944 semi-[[fiction]]alized [[biographical novel]] ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (novel)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'' and the 1946 Hollywood  [[Anna and the King of Siam (film)|film of the same title]], Seni quotes from Acts and judicial decisions that give the lie to the fiction.&lt;ref name="JSS_038_1d"&gt;{{cite journal

===The 1970s===
[[File:Seni Pramoj Eldon James.jpg|thumb|Seni Pramoj with Dr. Eldon R. James, Foreign Affairs Advisor to the Advisor to the Thailand government|left]]
Seni returned to his job as a lawyer, but remained active in the Democrat Party during the period of military rule. He served again briefly as prime minister from 15 February to 13 March 1975, when he was defeated and replaced by his younger brother, Rajawongse [[Kukrit Pramoj]]. However, Kukrit's government only lasted until 20 April 1976, when Seni regained the top political office.

Seni's final term was a time of crisis in the nation. A right-wing backlash against leftist student demonstrators culminated in the [[6 October 1976 Massacre|Thammasat University massacre]] on 6 October 1976,  the military forced him out of office and installed hard-line royalist [[Tanin Kraivixien]] as premier.

Seni decided to resign as the leader of the [[Democratic Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] and left politics permanently. He worked as a lawyer until his retirement.

The '''simple church''' is an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Christian Church|Christian]] movement that reinterprets the nature and practice of [[Church service|church]].

==Simple==
A simple church may meet anywhere with or without trained leaders, formal [[liturgy]], programs or structures.&lt;ref&gt;House2House Magazine Website, "[http://www.house2house.net/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=2 What Do We Mean By Simple Church] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927161450/http://www.house2house.net/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=2 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate relationship, discipleship (spiritual formation), multiplication, mobility, and member ownership, a simple church is usually a [[Cell group|small group]] of no more than 20-25 persons. Most Church "programs" privately meet during some days of the week and discuss troubles that they are having with their faith, and personal life. Church "programs" are virtually nonexistent and small group participation is essential. The process of moving from worship to small group, small group to mission work, and mission work to worship is a primary focus.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Authors Tony and Felicity Dale, founders of ''House2House Ministries'', have promoted the term "simple church" in their book "Simply Church".&lt;ref&gt;Dale, T. and Dale, F. (2000) ''Simply Church''. Karis Books, {{ISBN|0-9718040-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://metrosoul.org/whatwedo.shtml What We Do: Planting Simple Churches] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002242/http://metrosoul.org/whatwedo.shtml |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used interchangeably with other terms like organic church,&lt;ref&gt;Cole, N. (2005) ''Organic Church: Growing faith where life happens''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0-7879-8129-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; essential church, primitive church, bodylife, relational church, and micro-church.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Kreider, "[http://www.dcfi.org/House_Church_Sem_One_Day.htm House Churches &amp; Micro Churches]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" (Accessed September 29, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early twenty-first century a number of established Christian denominations and mission organizations have officially supported efforts to develop [[house church]] networks. These include the [[Free Methodist Church in Canada]], the [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel#North America|Foursquare Gospel Church of Canada]], the [[Evangelical Fellowship of Canada]], the [[Presbyterian Church in Canada]], Partners in Harvest, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], Dove Christian Fellowship International, DAWN Ministries (Discipling a Whole Nation), [[Youth With A Mission]] (YWAM), and [[Eternal Grace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arnold|first1=Lori|title=Displaced pastor finds grass is greener on the outside|url=http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Mar01%20/Art_displacedpastor.html|accessdate=May 1, 2017|agency=Christian Times|date=January 19, 2000|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.li/20061022140647/http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Mar01%20/Art_displacedpastor.html|archivedate=October 22, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and influences==
Many in the simple church movement point to the [[New Testament]], especially the [[Gospels]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], and the writings of the [[Apostle Paul]] for justification of their model (see [[House church#Scriptural basis|House Church, Scriptural Basis]]). Historically speaking, simple gatherings of Christians were the norm of [[Early Christianity]]. Between 100AD and 300AD, Christianity grew from 25,000 to 20 million people in the [[Roman Empire]]. In fact, much of the New Testament was written to people who met in house churches.&lt;ref&gt;The Forgotten Ways (Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Christian house churches were patterned after house [[synagogue]]s which were numerous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplechurchathome.com/Bible.html Simple Church at Home] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823041937/http://www.simplechurchathome.com/Bible.html |date=August 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians took a low-cost and easy-to-multiply model and adapted it to their new Christian context. In addition, the [[Eucharist|Communion]] service, sometimes called the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], was uniquely Christian (though modeled on the [[Passover]]). Since it did not apply to Jews and therefore did not fit in the Jewish synagogues, it had to be celebrated somewhere else. House churches were the natural place for communion to be shared. As time went on, Christians were banned from Jewish synagogues as persecution intensified (see [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism]]). Although house churches flourished in times of persecution, they were well-established before them.

In the West, simple church can be traced back to the house church movement. In North America and the UK particularly, the house church movement is often viewed as a development and logical extension of the 'Brethren' or [[Plymouth Brethren]] movement, where many individuals and assemblies have adopted new approaches to worship and governance, while others recognise a relationship to the [[Anabaptists]], [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], [[Mennonites]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Methodists]], and the much earlier [[Waldenses]] and [[Priscillianists]]. Another perspective sees the house church movement as a re-emergence of the movement of the [[Holy Spirit]] during the [[Jesus Movement]] of the 1970s in the USA or the worldwide [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic Renewal]] of the late 1960s and 1970s. Others see it as a return to a New Testament church [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationist]] paradigm and a restoration of God's eternal purpose and the natural expression of Christ on the earth, urging Christians to return from hierarchy and rank to practices described and encouraged in Scripture.

Simple church has also been influenced by overseas missions and the growth of [[church planting]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;See David Garrison, "Church Planting Movements" (International Missionary Board Southern Baptist Convention, 2004); and Rad Zdero, "The Global House Church Movement" (William Carey Library Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|0-87808-342-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Church planting movements are spontaneously growing church multiplication efforts.

The [[missional]] Movement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friendofmissional.org/ Friend of Missional]&lt;/ref&gt; has also influenced simple church.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Thoman, "[http://sojourner.typepad.com/house_church_blog/2004/03/house_church_ba.html House Church Basics Pt. 3: Missional Church] (Accessed September 29, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

SIMPLE-CHURCH IN THE U.K.
SimpleChurch movement has begun to emerge in the Unoted Kingdon. House Churches have existed for some years in places where traditional churches have closed, or not met the needs of evangelicals  (or charismatics). Due in some cases to the Church of England being perceived to have moved away from biblical doctrines.
A website promoting Simple Church in the U.K. is at simplechurch.org.uk

==Values==
As in any decentralized, spontaneous movement, a variety of values are expressed in simple church.  Due to the influence of some key groups and Acts 2:42-47, three overarching values have emerged in many circles. Adherents Paul Kaak (who began ministry in one of the largest and most systematized [[megachurch|mega-churches]] in [[United States|America]]) and Neil Cole originally articulated these values using the letters DNA. According to him:
* '''D - Divine Truth''': Truth is the foundation for everything.&lt;ref&gt;A recent variation refers to the "D" as "Divine Connection" and views the Word of God and prayer as two primary means of maintaining that connection with God. The DNA metaphor is thus extended to include four overarching values instead of only three.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
Adherents George Barna and Frank Viola's book ''Pagan Christianity'' points out a number of reforms that organic churches often advocate.
* The belief that modern [[clergy]] is a vestige of Roman [[pagan]] religion that was absent from the early church and is largely at odds with the true [[priesthood of all believers]]. The movement sees the institution of the clergy at odds with passages like Matthew 20, Matthew 23, 3rd John, and the message in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] regarding the deeds of the [[Nicolaism|Nicolaitans]] (Greek-literally those who triumph over the people). [[1 Corinthians]] 12-14 paints a picture of an every-member functioning church meeting entirely at odds with the modern religious service which is performed by professionals for an audience. However, some believe this view does not take into account the Jewish and synagogue based nature of the ekklesia, which explains the talk of elders and deacons found in the New Testament. In reply, many simple churches do recognize elders and deacons according to the biblical standards laid out in TImothy and Titus but believe these people emerge over time as their character becomes descriptive of these roles.  In an environment where people are free to express their gifts, such people can emerge. Also, being an [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] or [[deacon]] does not mean this person dominates the meeting. [[3 John]] rebukes [[Diotrephes]] the elder who had to be first and was dominating.  The simple church largely believes the idea that an elder or deacon is not a license for some to minister and others to be passive.
* Valuing the Lord's Supper occurring as a regular, recurring full meal celebration rather than a short religious ritual. The early integration of the home based ritual into the public synagogue-like meeting functioned to reduce the symbolic nature of the act to a private moment, replacing its symbolism of fellowship and dedication to the Lord. This was complete by the time of Constantine, when home based [[agape feast]]s were banned. However, this history does not in itself devalue the need for the larger synagogue-like meeting for prayer, ministry of the word and singing. Simple church adherents also enjoy occasional and even monthly larger gatherings that do this very thing, though they emphasize the smaller meeting of the ekklesia as the environment for spiritual growth.
* Organic churches tend to place less emphasis on the building or meeting place.  To this end, Neil Cole, an adherent of simple church, states that "buildings, budgets, and big shots," tend to do more to contain Christianity than allow it to spread.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, N. ''Organic Church''&lt;/ref&gt; However, this statement against larger sized churches does nothing to substantiate its claim.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Media and popular attention==
In the early twenty–first century the growth of the movement has had increased news media coverage:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/03/AR2006060300225.html|title = Going to Church by Staying at Home: Clergy-Less Living Room Services Seen as a Growing Trend|last = Chandler and Aryanpur|first = Michael Alison and Arianne|date = June 4, 2006|work = |accessdate = September 30, 2006|publisher = Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1146606640344&amp;call_pageid=968332188492&amp;col=968793972154&amp;t=TS_Home|title = Religion, but no church required|last = Laidlaw|first = Stuart|date = |work = |accessdate = September 30, 2006|publisher = Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1167737-1,00.html|title = There's No Pulpit Like Home|last = Van Biema and Healy|first = David and Rita|date = |work = |accessdate = September 30, 2006|publisher = Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many books have been written on the simple church movement, especially by insiders (see [[House church#Recommended Books|House Church, Recommended Books]]).  In the early twentyfirst century books began to appear by those studying the movement from a more objective view, including [[George Barna]]'s ''Revolution''.&lt;ref&gt;Barna, G. (2005). ''Revolution''. Tyndale House. {{ISBN|1-4143-1016-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barna says that "revolutionary" expressions such as simple church will soon account for one third of American spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Barna, G. (2005). ''Revolution''. Tyndale House. p. 49. {{ISBN|1-4143-1016-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visibility of the movement also increased due to national and regional gatherings of various kinds.  The largest of these is the Annual House Church Conference held in Dallas, USA and occasionally at other locations by House2House.

==Criticism==
How the simple church movement relates to constructing a [[theology]] and [[ecclesiology]] is the subject of much debate, especially with critics of the movement.

Several prominent voices have serious concerns about simple church.  For example, J. Lee Grady (Charisma Online Editor) says such a movement wants to "reinvent the church without its biblical structure and New Testament order — and without the necessary people who are anointed and appointed by God to lead it. To follow this defective thesis to its logical conclusion would require us to fire all pastors, close all seminaries and Bible colleges, padlock our sanctuaries and send everybody home..."&lt;ref&gt;J. Lee Grady, [http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/blogs/520-fire-in-my-bones/13063-barnas-dangerous-proposal Barna's Dangerous Proposal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302005942/http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/blogs/520-fire-in-my-bones/13063-barnas-dangerous-proposal |date=2012-03-02 }}" (Accessed September 30, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Grady and other critics worry that the simple church movement could encourage people to leave more traditional forms of church, which could lead to further collapse or decline of Christendom.

The '''spermatheca''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|s|p|ɚ|m|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|k|ə}} plural: '''spermathecae''' {{IPAc-en|s|p|ɚ|m|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|s|iː}}), also called '''receptaculum seminis''' (plural: '''receptacula seminis'''), is an [[organ (biology)|organ]] of the female reproductive tract in [[insect]]s, e.g. [[bee]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Tales V. Pascini, and Gustavo F. Martins. 2017. "The insect spermatheca: an overview".

JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY 261:1–17&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to receive and [[female sperm storage|store sperm]] from the male or, in the case of [[hermaphrodites]], the male component of the body. Spermathecae can sometimes be the site of [[fertilisation|fertilization]] when the [[oocyte]]s are sufficiently developed.&lt;ref&gt;Jan A. Pechenick. Biology of the Invertebrates. New York: McGraw Hill, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of animal have multiple spermathecae.  For example, certain species of earthworms have four pairs of spermathecae—one pair each in the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th segments. The spermathecae receive and store the spermatozoa of another earthworm during copulation.&lt;ref&gt;Jan A. Pechenik. Biology of the Invertebrates. New York: McGraw Hill, 2010, pg. 322&lt;/ref&gt; They are lined with [[epithelium]] and are variable in shape: some are thin, heavily coiled tubes, while others are vague outpocketings from the main reproductive tract. It is one of the many variations in sexual reproduction.

The nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' has two spermathecae, one at the end of each gonad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On the control of oocyte meiotic maturation and ovulation in Caenorhabditis elegans.|date = |journal = Dev.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1251">'''Telescoping generations''' can occur in [[parthenogenetic]] species, such as [[aphid]]s or other life forms that have the ability to reproduce without ovum fertilization. This occurrence is characterized by a [[viviparous]] female having a daughter growing inside her that is also parthenogenetically pregnant with a daughter cell.

This pattern of reproduction can also occur in certain [[mite]]s that are not parthenogenetic, e.g. ''[[Adactylidium]]'', in which the young hatch and mate within the mother, eating her from the inside and then escaping; in some species the males never escape, and in others they die shortly afterwards. However, the resulting inbreeding has consequences much like those of parthenogenesis, and the females are not actually pregnant on hatching but become pregnant before emerging into free living.

'''''The New Meditation Handbook: Meditations to Make Our Life Happy and Meaningful''''' ([[Tharpa Publications]] (2003) {{ISBN|978-0-9817277-1-4}}) is a guide to Buddhist philosophy and meditation techniques. It is a compilation of twenty-one concise meditations on [[Lamrim]], or the stages of the path to enlightenment, by Geshe [[Kelsang Gyatso]], a Buddhist teacher and author in the West.

''The New Meditation Handbook'' contains twenty-one meditations on [[Lamrim]] that are designed to be followed in a cycle, thus covering all of [[Buddha]]'s teachings every 21 days. The meditations are described as "actual methods to control our mind. Because everyone has different wishes and capacities, many different levels of meditation practice are given."&lt;ref&gt;''The New Meditation Handbook: Meditations to Make Our Life Happy and Meaningful'', p. 4, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2003) {{ISBN|978-0-9817277-1-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, a Tibetan monk, entered the monastery at the age of eight and has spent the past 30 years establishing Buddhist centers throughout the world. He provides 21 contemplative meditations to systematically guide a seeker to enlightenment according to Buddhist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?docId=1000027801 Booklist Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21 meditations are intended to give a concise overview of essential Buddhist teachings and philosophy with the purpose of increasing peace of mind, positivity, and spiritual wisdom. ''[[Foreword Reviews|Foreword Magazine]]'' says: "Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's words provide a stimulatingly peaceful perspective.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of The New Meditation Handbook |url=https://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/the-new-meditation-handbook/ |publisher=Foreword Reviews |accessdate=29 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkus Reviews called it "Clear, inspirational writing" &lt;ref&gt;Kirkus Reviews, UK&lt;/ref&gt; and Booklist says "''The New Meditation Handbook'' is a simple, sincere guide to Buddhist philosophy and meditation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Booklist, October 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Spirituality and Health Magazine'': "This manual provides a succinct and inspiring overview of the many ways in which Buddhism can be applied to the situations and activities of daily life." {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The book focuses on Buddha's teaching that all human beings have potential for spiritual growth by overcoming negative minds and increasing positive ones in daily life. Donna Seaman of Booklist suggests: "Geshe Kelsang has a unique gift for simultaneously addressing everyday difficulties--particularly in his useful and inspiring elucidation of how to control anger and practice patience--and bringing into focus the spiritual dimension in which they reverberate."&lt;ref&gt;''Booklist'', October 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The author is the founder of the [[New Kadampa Tradition]], which has 1100 Buddhist centers and groups worldwide.

'''USS ''Corvina'' (SS-226)''', a [[Gato class submarine|''Gato''-class submarine]], was the only ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the [[Cilus gilberti|corvina]], a saltwater fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USS Corvina|url=https://wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?30505|website=Wrecksite|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her keel was laid down by the [[Electric Boat]] Company of [[Groton, Connecticut]] on September 21, 1942. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on May 9, 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. LaRene P. Christie, wife of Rear Admiral [[Ralph Waldo Christie|Ralph. W. Christie]], commander of submarine operations in Fremantle, Australia), and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on August 6, 1943 with Commander Roderick S. Rooney ([[United States Naval Academy|Class]] of 1929) in command.

==Service record==

Clearing [[New London, Connecticut]], on September 18, 1943, ''Corvina '' arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] on October 14. She put out from [[Pearl Harbor]] on her maiden war patrol November 4, topped off her fuel tanks at [[Johnston Island]] two days later, and was never heard from again.

Her assignment had been a dangerous one: to patrol as closely as possible to the heavily guarded stronghold of [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and to intercept any Japanese [[sortie]] endangering the forthcoming American invasion of the [[Gilbert Islands]]. Japanese records report that [[Japanese submarine I-176|Japanese submarine ''I-176'']] launched three torpedoes at an enemy submarine south of Truk on November 16, claiming two hits which resulted in the explosion of the target.&lt;ref name=NDLibrary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/u/united-states-submarine-losses/corvina-ss-226.html|title=''Corvina'' (SS 226) |publisher=Navy Department Library |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her loss with her crew of 82 was announced March 14, 1944, making ''Corvina'' the only American submarine to be sunk by a Japanese submarine in the entire war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Japanese Submarine Force and World War II |last1=Boyd |first1=Carl |last2=Yoshida |first2=Akihiko |year=1995 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location= |isbn= |page=236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFJdpxXkIBoC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=USS+Corvina&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Av8174kgHl&amp;sig=Cig7m7lBnhhpfkausYwF2wWlxcE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UyffUvCfNc7joATfrICwBA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=USS%20Corvina&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The loss of the ''Corvina'' is referenced in the 1951 John Wayne film [[Operation Pacific]].  In the film, the fictitious ''Gato''-class sub USS ''Thunderfish'' makes an impromptu rendezvous with the ''Corvina'' after the ''Corvina'' had reported problems on Number 4 Main Engine.  The subs exchange engine parts and the captains also exchange films, John Wayne offering [[George Washington Slept Here]], and the ''Corvina's'' captain offering "a submarine picture", later revealed to be the 1943 film [[Destination Tokyo]].  Later, while the crew of the ''Thunderfish'' are watching [[Destination Tokyo]], John Wayne is shown trying to figure out torpedo explosions reported by the sub's sonar operator.  The following day, the ''Thunderfish'' comes across wreckage, and discovers the case containing [[George Washington Slept Here]], revealing that the ''Corvina'' had been sunk.  The ''Thunderfish's'' radar then reports a single contact, and the sub submerges.  John Wayne discovers "one I-type Jap submarine" while looking through the periscope.  The ''Thunderfish'' then engages, torpedoes, and sinks the Japanese sub, avenging the loss of the ''Corvina''.

The '''Undying Ones''' are a [[fictional character|fictional race]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. They are a race of humanoid [[List of Marvel Comics demons|demons]] from another [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|dimension]].

==Publication history==
The Undying Ones were first depicted as statues in ''[[Doctor Strange (comic book)|Doctor Strange]]'' #183 (November 1969), by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gene Colan]]. Their first actual appearance was in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' #22 (February 1970).

The Undying Ones subsequently appear in ''Incredible Hulk'' #126 (April 1970), ''Defenders'' #1-3 (August–December 1972), #18 (December 1974), #20 (February 1975), ''Incredible Hulk'' #269 (March 1982), and ''Doctor Strange'' #41 (May 1992).

The Undying Ones received an entry in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #12 (2006).

==Fictional history==
The Undying Ones once held great power over Earth but were forced to return to their own dimension over a millennium ago when their powers began to fade for unexplained reasons. Their powers having been renewed, the Undying Ones unsuccessfully attempted to invade Earth again in recent years under the leadership of the [[Nameless One (Marvel Comics)|Nameless One]].{{issue|date=October 2011}} The dimension of the Undying Ones has since been conquered by the creature known as the Slitherer or the [[Dark-Crawler]].{{issue|date=October 2011}}

The Undying Ones have come into conflict with [[Doctor Strange (comic book)|Doctor Strange]],{{issue|date=October 2011}} and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].{{issue|date=October 2011}}

The Undying Ones are led by the [[Nameless One (Marvel Comics)|Nameless One]]. The "Nameless One" appears to be a title that can be inherited from the previous holder.

During the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, the Undying Ones slip through the barriers that are weakened due to the fear and chaos that is occurring.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear Itself: The Deep'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay became the basis for a successful [[spoken word]] song released in 1999 by [[Baz Luhrmann]], "'''Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)'''", also known as "'''The Sunscreen Song'''".&lt;ref name="Sunscreen Song"&gt;"The Sunscreen Song (class of '99)" is used as an alternative title on [[:File:Everybody'sfreetowearsunscreen.jpg|the cover of the single]]; see also [https://www.amazon.com/Everybodys-Free-Quindon-Tarver/dp/B00000JHTT#productDescription the single's "Editorial Reviews" on Amazon], and [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/daily/march99/sunscreen0318.htm "The Cyber-Saga of the 'Sunscreen' Song"] by the ''Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; The song inspired numerous [[Parody|parodies]].

==''Chicago Tribune'' column==
[[Mary Schmich]]'s [[Column (periodical)|column]] "Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young" was published in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on June 1, 1997.&lt;ref name="Original Chicago Tribune article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column,0,4054576.column |title=Original published article |publisher=Chicago Tribune |author=Mary Schmich |date=1997-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the column's introduction Schmich presents the essay as the [[commencement speech]] she would give if she were asked to give one.

In the speech she insistently recommends the wearing of [[sunscreen]], and dispenses other advice and warnings which are intended to help people live a happier life and avoid common frustrations. She later explained that the initial inspiration for what advice to offer came from seeing a young woman [[sunbathing]], and hoping that she was wearing sunscreen, unlike what she herself did at that age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/daily/march99/sunscreen0318.htm |title=The Cyber-Saga of the 'Sunscreen' Song |publisher=Washington Post |author=Frank Ahrens |date=1999-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay soon became the subject of an [[urban legend]] which claimed it was an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] commencement speech given by author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. In reality, MIT's commencement speaker in 1997 was [[Kofi Annan]] and Vonnegut had never been a commencement speaker there.&lt;ref name="nytimes-vonnegut-quote" /&gt; Despite a follow-up article by Schmich on August 3, 1997,&lt;ref name="Follow-up Chicago Tribune article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-08-03/news/9708030176_1_mr-vonnegut-sunscreen-speech-speech-one-friday-afternoon |title=Follow-up article |publisher=Chicago Tribune |author=Mary Schmich |date=1997-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the story became so widespread that Vonnegut's lawyer began receiving requests to reprint the speech.&lt;ref name="nytimes-vonnegut-quote" /&gt; Vonnegut commented that he would have been proud had the words been his.&lt;ref name="nytimes-vonnegut-quote"&gt;{{Citation | last=Fisher | first=Ian | title=It's All the Talk of the Internet's Gossip Underground | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1997-08-06 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E2D71F3DF935A3575BC0A961958260&amp;sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmich published a short gift book adaptation of the essay, ''Wear Sunscreen: A Primer for Real Life'', in 1998. A tenth anniversary edition was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The essay was used in its entirety by Australian film director [[Baz Luhrmann]] on his 1998 album ''[[Something for Everybody (Baz Luhrmann album)|Something for Everybody]]'', as "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)". It was released in some territories in 1997, with the speech (including its opening words, "Ladies and Gentlemen of the Class of '97") completely intact. This version appeared in the [[Triple J Hottest 100]] of that year at number 16 in the countdown, and was released on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1997|subsequent CD]] in early 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100_08/history/1997.htm|title=history - triple j hottest 100 - 2008 - triple j|date=26 December 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also known as "The Sunscreen Song",&lt;ref name="Sunscreen Song" /&gt; it sampled Luhrmann's remixed version of the song "[[Everybody's Free (To Feel Good)]]" by [[Rozalla]], and opened with the words, "Ladies and Gentlemen of the Class of '99" (instead of "'97", as in the original column). It was later released as a [[Single (music)|single]] in 1999.

Luhrmann explained that Anton Monsted, [[Puretone|Josh Abrahams]], and he were working on the remix when Monsted received an email with the supposed Vonnegut speech. They decided to use it but were doubtful of getting through to Vonnegut for permission before their deadline, which was only one or two days away. While searching the Internet for contact information they came upon the "Sunscreen" authorship controversy and discovered that Schmich was the actual author. They emailed her and, with her permission, recorded the song the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodandvine.com/bazluhrmann/main.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021205041240/http://hollywoodandvine.com/bazluhrmann/main.html |title=Something for Everybody |publisher=Something for Everybody |date=2002-12-05 | archivedate = 2002-12-05 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song features a spoken-word track set over a mellow backing track. The "Wear Sunscreen" speech is narrated by Australian voice actor [[Lee Perry (voice actor)|Lee Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/name/nm1043022/ |title=Lee Perry (I) |publisher=Imdb.com |date=1959-12-16 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backing is the choral version of "Everybody's Free (To Feel Good)", a 1991 song by [[Rozalla]], used in Luhrmann's film ''[[William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet]]''. The chorus, also from "Everybody's Free", is sung by [[Quindon Tarver]].

The song was a top ten hit across Europe, but largely obscure in the US until Aaron Scofield, a producer in Phoenix, Arizona, edited the original 12" version into a segment of a syndicated radio show called ''Modern Mix''. This show played on many stations in the United States. In Portland, Oregon—where ''Modern Mix'' played on KNRK—listeners began requesting the track. KNRK program director Mark Hamilton edited the song for time and began playing it regularly. He distributed the song to other program directors that he networked with and the song exploded in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA84 |title=Baz Luhrmann Goes to the Top of the Class By Applying His Sunscreen |publisher=Billboard Magazine |date=1999-04-03| accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song reached number 24 on the [[Billboard Hot 100 Airplay]] in the United States; by the time it was released as a commercial single in the country, radio airplay had declined significantly, and only managed to peak at number 45 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. It also peaked at number one in the United Kingdom and Ireland, partly due to a media campaign by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio&amp;nbsp;One]] DJ [[Chris Moyles]].

There are four versions of the song: the original 7:09 minute mix from the album ''Baz Luhrmann Presents: Something for Everybody''; a 1999 single release which features a 5:05 minute edit that lacks both choruses; "Geographic's Factor 15+ Mix" that runs for 4:42 minutes; and a "2007 Mix" of the original 7:09 minute version released on the 10th Anniversary Edition of the ''William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet'' soundtrack on which the opening words are changed to "Ladies and gentlemen of the class of 2007".

There are two videos for the song: one which uses the 1999 5:05 minute single edit of the song (the version in which [[Quindon Tarver]] is not featured), directed and animated by [[Bill Barminski]]; and another using the 7:09 minute edit made by the Brazilian advertising agency DM9DDB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfq_A8nXMsQ|title=Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen) Bill Barminski's version|publisher=youtube|date=2007-05-24|accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfq_A8nXMsQ|title=Everybody's Free to Wear Sunscreen! DM9DDB's version|publisher=youtube|date=2006-12-12|accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song also appeared in Germany and was soon followed by a German version with the title "Sonnencreme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunscreen.de/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010122045300/http://www.sunscreen.de/ |title=everybody's free (to wear sunscreen) |publisher=Brainfusion |date=2001-01-22 | archivedate = 2001-01-22 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German translation is narrated by the German actor Dieter Brandecker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004WPV2 |title=Sonnencreme (Everybody's...)

A Russian adaptation of the song, recorded live by [[Silver Rain Radio]], was performed by Alex Dubas and Yolka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alex-dubas.livejournal.com/90854.html |script-title=ru:О пользе солнцезащитных кремов |language=Russian |publisher=Blog of Alex Dubas |date=2009-12-20 |accessdate=2011-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075358/http://alex-dubas.livejournal.com/90854.html |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2008 the song re-entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 72.

This version was released as a remix to Baz Luhrmann's 1999 version.  The remix was written by Mau Kilauea and dubbed as a "Tropical Remix" because of the choice of instrumentation.  The song was posted to Soundcloud on Mau Kilauea's page and reposted by Spinnin' Records.  The song became a first hit for Mau Kilauea.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Parodies==
The Baz Luhrmann song version inspired numerous [[Parody|parodies]]. [[John Safran]] released a song entitled "Not the Sunscreen Song" which peaked at #20 in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=John+Safran&amp;titel=Not+The+Sunscreen+Song&amp;cat=s |title=John Safran - Not The Sunscreen Song |publisher=australian-charts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American comedian [[Chris Rock]] enjoyed great success with his spoken word song "[[No Sex (In the Champagne Room)]]" which was in turn parodied on ''[[Mad TV]]'' as "Ain't No Blacks on the TV Screen" in the style of Rock's stand-up. The song was also parodied in an episode of ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' performed by [[Jiminy Cricket]]. The comedy group [[Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie]] also made a parody entitled "The Sunscreen Marketing Board". [[Jegsy Dodd]] and the Original Sinners' version, "Grumpy Old Men", was voted favourite track of 2005 by BBC Radio&amp;nbsp;1 listeners in their annual [[Festive&amp;nbsp;50]] poll.

[[Angelos Epithemiou]]'s live tour included a parody of the song titled "Don't Muck About".

A parody entitled "Mow Against The Grain" appears on the [[King of the Hill (soundtrack)|''King of the Hill'' soundtrack album]].

Another parody by comedian Simmi Areff was played on South African radio station [[East Coast Radio (South Africa)|East Coast Radio]] at the conclusion of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

Another parody was created in 1999 by London Capital Radio Breakfast Show host Chris Tarrant, who created a version called "wear slippers" which consisted of him reading an alternative version of the sunscreen lyrics and demonstrated his disdain for Baz Luhrmann's version.
