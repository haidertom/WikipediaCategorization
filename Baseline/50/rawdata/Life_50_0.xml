I've cried to their music. They've definitely changed my life, and saved me from a lot of stuff."&lt;ref name=Corrigan2018/&gt; Shake's recording experience with West in [[Wyoming]] for his ''Ye'' album impacted her thoughts about ''Yellow Girl''; she stated "I don't know if it's going to be called ''Yellow Girl''. I know the songs are definitely changing. The experience I had in Wyoming makes me want to make music on a different level."&lt;ref name=Corrigan2018/&gt;

'''Alastair Charles Ralphs''' (born May 22, 1977) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and former [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilder]], better known by his [[ring name]], '''A-1''' (alternatively spelled '''A1''' or '''A-One'''). He is best known for his appearances with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) from 2004 to 2007 as part of [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]].

==Early life==
Ralphs was born in [[Placentia Bay]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and relocated to [[Dunnville, Ontario|Dunnville]], [[Ontario]] at the age of five. He later moved to [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]] to attend the [[University of Windsor]].

==Professional wrestling career==

===Border City Wrestling (2001–2005)===
Alastair Ralphs was trained by [[Scott D'Amore]] in the Can-Am Wrestling School, and debuted in D'Amore's [[Border City Wrestling]] promotion in 2001. After spending three years as an [[job (professional wrestling)|undercard talent]], Ralphs became A-1, a cocky, arrogant [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], forming an alliance with [[Joseph Dorgan|Johnny Swinger]]. He defeated [[D'Lo Brown]] for the BCW Heavyweight Championship on December 12, 2004, in [[Belleville, Michigan]] at "[[A Night of Appreciation for Sabu]]".

On January 23, 2005, at New Year's Revolution, Ralphs interrupted the Hall of Fame induction ceremony, complaining that he was being overshadowed by older wrestlers. Scott D'Amore responded with a jibe aimed at Ralph's previous career as a [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilder]], leading to a brawl between Ralphs and D'Amore. Following a distraction from Jade, A-1 was able to powerbomb D'Amore through a table. Ralphs went on to retain the heavyweight title in a match with [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]], using Abyss's own chain to knock him unconscious.

Ralphs lost the BCW Heavyweight Championship to [[Bobby Roode]] on July 22, 2005. In the course of his reign as champion he faced well-known veterans such as [[Jim Neidhart]] and [[King Kong Bundy]].

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004–2007)===
On July 16, 2004, Ralphs appeared in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], losing to [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. He reappeared on March 13, 2005 as a member of [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]], replacing the injured [[Johnny Devine]] at [[Destination X (2005)|Destination X 2005]] and teaming with Bobby Roode, [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] and [[Petey Williams]] to face [[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]], [[James Storm]], [[Brian Gerard James|B.G. James]] and [[Konnan]]. He wrestled on [[TNA Impact!]] throughout April and May 2005, [[tag team|teaming]] with other members of Team Canada or accompanying them to the ring. At [[TNA Hard Justice|Hard Justice]] on May 15, Ralphs took part in the [[Gauntlet for the Gold]]. He entered at number six and was eliminated by [[Monty Sopp|The Outlaw]] and B.G. James. On the May 11, 2006, episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]'', [[Larry Zbyszko]] asked Team Canada coach [[Scott D'Amore]] for assistance in his feud with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]. D'Amore eventually agreed to help Zbyszko rid TNA of Raven, and nominated A-1 to face Raven in a match at [[TNA Sacrifice#2006|TNA Sacrifice 2006]] in May 2006, a match that A-1 lost. On the June 29, 2006, episode of ''Impact!'', TNA Management Director [[Jim Cornette]] disbanded Team Canada.

A-1 soon began wrestling sporadically, facing Ron Killings in the pre-show of the Hard Justice pay-per-view and against Eric Young at the No Surrender pay-per-view, losing both times. He also took part in the Kevin Nash Open Invitational X-Division Gauntlet Battle Royal at Bound For Glory, despite not being a part of the X-Division. He was eliminated by both [[Matt Bentley|Maverick Matt]] and [[Frankie Kazarian|Kazarian]].

A-1 was released by TNA in February 2007.

===Independent circuit (2007–present)===
Since leaving TNA, A-1 has wrestled on the independent circuit in Canada and the United States.

At [[Impact One Night Only]]: Canadian Clash in February 2018, A-1 returned to [[Impact Wrestling]] for the first time in over 11 years, unsuccessfully challenging [[Eli Drake]] for the [[Impact Global Championship]]. He returned to Impact Wrestling once again at the following month's One Night Only: March Breakdown PPV, where he teamed with [[Allie (wrestler)|Allie]] in a victory over [[Braxton Sutter]] and KC Spinelli. He is also currently a member of the [[Border City Wrestling]] roster.

'''A-Lin''' ({{zh|c=阿玲|p=Ā Líng}}), also known by her birth name '''Huang Li-ling''' and her [[Amis people|Amis]] name '''Lisang Pacidal Koyouan''', is an [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] [[Music of Taiwan|Taiwanese]] [[pop music|pop]] [[singer]], [[lyricist]], and occasional [[composer]] of [[Amis people|Amis]] descent.

==Career==
In 1999, when A-Lin was 16 years old and taught children to sing the hymn “[[Amazing Grace]]” after the [[921 earthquake]] in [[Nantou County]], she was discovered by her former agent. However, he was not available when she wanted to give him contact information. Fortunately, four years later, A-Lin met him again in a bar where she sang regularly. She was officially offered a singing contract.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woNRarO0ZZU Little Swallows Night 2011-11-25 pt.2/3 Dingdang A-Lin]&lt;/ref&gt;

A-Lin made her debut in the world of music at the end of 2006, achieving rapid commercial success. She has been called the next [[A-Mei]], who is an aboriginal singer of [[Puyuma people|Puyuma]] descent. She also got the nickname 天生歌姬, meaning "A Born Diva". A-Lin was often quoted as saying that A-Mei is highly influential to her music and often covers A-Mei's songs in music shows and concerts. A-Lin has won numerous music awards and is extremely popular within Mandarin-speaking world.

A-Lin has performed internationally and at a sold-out concert with [[Xiao Yu (singer)|Xiao Yu]] and [[Shin (singer)|Shin]] in 2012 at the [[Sydney Town Hall]]. It was her first visit to Sydney and people flew in from different cities just to see her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://corporate.valentlau.com.au/blog/a-lin-sydney-live-concert/ | title = Sydney Live Concert with Xiaoyu and Shin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, with [[Avex Taiwan]] exiting the market due to overall poor sales from the records, all singers under [[Avex]] like Huang Li-ling were allowed to terminate their contracts early.

After terminating her contract, A-Lin signed with her new label Sony Music. In December 2014, she released her first album after leaving Avex. This album was nominated for Best Mandarin Female Singer, making her fourth nomination without any win.

In 2015, she participated in the third season of [[I Am a Singer (Chinese TV series)|I Am a Singer]] and came in sixth on the finale held in March 2015. As a result, her singing ability was recognized by more people and provided a boost to her career.

==Style==
While A-Lin considers herself as an [[Contralto]], she has been noted to have an extremely wide vocal range closely identical to that of [[Amanda Seyfried]], as noted in many of her songs to have over two octaves or more, and in the concert in Auckland, New Zealand, she was suffering from illnesses that made her unable to hit her falsetto range.  She has also notably performed "Remember", by [[A-Mei]], in [[infantile speech]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZzouYGKGjE A-Lin's "Remember" in infantile speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
A-Lin is the youngest in her family, her parents are [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s and love music.
A-Lin's older sister is Taiwanese model Lea Huang,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y66wKo3Mow A-Lin's sister appeared in her autograph session]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=506240312729213 Lea Huang on Facebook - Lea &amp; A-Lin - Someone Like You (by Adele)]&lt;/ref&gt; who herself entered the Super Star competition in Taiwan in July 2013 as an aspiring singer in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_jpXNEu0dE Lea Huang-Remember (by A-Mei）]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, after A-Lin entered I Am A Singer, Lea became a contestant for ‘The most beautiful harmonies’ (最美和聲). They also have an older brother, and A-Lin's cousin-in-law is her fitness coach and also a guitarist.  A-Lin was extremely popular as a student and the confidence she gained from this led to her decision to compete in a 'Singing Strength Elite Rivalry Competition' [歌唱實力精英角逐比賽]. She chose the hit song 'At least you are still there' [至少還有你], by [[Sandy Lam]], and the competition allowed A-Lin to believe she had a future as a professional singer. In reference to talent shows being readily accessible to young people these days, A-Lin commented, "I am impressed that there is now a ''[[Million Star]]''-type of singing platform, which allows both everyone who enjoys singing and those who are talented singers a tough but realistic chance - an accomplished dream." They also have a brother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWRI9Swjpos A-Lin released the third album "In the past, in the future" and received their good wishes from relatives and friends VCR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=def2XWeRiXg SS Little Swallows Night 2013-01-14 A-Lin、Lea and her mother part 1 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1 July 2007, A-Lin married [[Huang Kan-lin]], a well-known Taiwanese baseball player. They have a daughter, Huang Qiaoyu. (A-Lin said: "At the first time Huang Kan-lin requested a song "How Do I Live" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr4kbVNB5rk Live LeAnn Rimes - How Do I Live]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[LeAnn Rimes]] in her Tainan Pub Session.  However, at that time because of his poor English, he wrote “Good Do A-Lin " on a piece of paper and then spelled the song in homophonic Mandarin. The implication was that he wanted to chase after A-Lin because of her rich lips.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXCpR6_OUU0 Little Swallow Night 2011-11-25 pt.1/3 Dingdang A-Lin ]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Huang Kan-lin proposed to A-Lin successfully by a new recorded song " 愛情問怎麼走 (How Love Will Go)".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vORYmdlbJjM I love Heisehui-A Taiwanese variety show_1_(2007 Jul 5)]&lt;/ref&gt;)

      <comment>Beatrice Han-Pile in "Nietzsche and Amor Fati" (EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY) cites "for all its importance, there is very little material on amor fati in Nietzsche’s work. All in all, I was able to identify only seven passages, four in the published work, one in the Will to Power, one in the Nachlass and one in Nietzsche’s correspondence."</comment>

{{italic title}}
'''''Amor fati''''' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "love of fate") is a [[Latin]] phrase that may be translated as "love of fate" or "love of one's fate".  It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including [[suffering]] and [[grief|loss]], as good or, at the very least, necessary, in that they are among the facts of one's life and existence, so they are always necessarily there whether one likes them or not. Moreover, ''amor fati'' is characterized by an acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one's life.&lt;ref name="ds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amor Fati: The Formula for Human Greatness|url=https://dailystoic.com/amor-fati-love-of-fate/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This acceptance does not necessarily preclude an attempt at change or improvement, but rather, it can be seen to be along the lines of what [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] apparently means by the concept of "[[Eternal recurrence#Friedrich Nietzsche|eternal recurrence]]": a sense of contentment with one's life and an acceptance of it, such that one could live exactly the same life, in all its minute details, over and over for all eternity.

==Concept==
The concept of ''amor fati'' has been linked to [[Epictetus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus]]'' Ch. VIII: "Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy."—as quoted in [[Pierre Hadot]] (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dLVyyDE-vQC&amp;redir_esc=y The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius]'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been linked to [[Meditations|the writings]] of [[Marcus Aurelius]],&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' IV.23: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All that is in accord with you is in accord with me, O World! Nothing which occurs at the right time for you comes too soon or too late for me. All that your seasons produce, O Nature, is fruit for me. It is from you that all things come: all things are within you, and all things move toward you." — as quoted in [[Hadot]] (1998), p. 143.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  who did not himself use the words (he wrote in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], not Latin).&lt;ref name="rg"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview with the Master: Robert Greene on Stoicism|url=https://dailystoic.com/robert-greene-interview/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is used in a few of Nietzsche's writings and is representative of the general outlook on life that he articulates in section 276 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. ''Amor fati'': let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. ''Looking away'' shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is important to note that Nietzsche in this context refers to the "Yes-sayer", not in a political or social sense, but as a person who is capable of uncompromising acceptance of reality ''per se''.

Quotation from "Why I Am So Clever" in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', section 10:&lt;ref&gt;''Basic Writings of Nietzsche''. trans. and ed. by Walter Kaufmann (1967), p. 714.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My formula for greatness in a human being is ''amor fati'': that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity.  Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it&amp;mdash;all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary&amp;mdash;but ''love'' it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore, Nietzsche's spirit of acceptance occurs in the context of his radical embrace of suffering.  For to love that which is necessary, demands not only that we love the bad along with the good, but that we view the two as inextricably linked.  In section 3 of the preface of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', he writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Leiter|first=Brian|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit….I doubt that such pain makes us ‘better’; but I know that it makes us more profound.    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''birthday effect''' (sometimes called the '''birthday blues''', especially when referring specifically to [[suicide]]) is a statistical phenomenon where an individual's likelihood of death appears to increase on or close to their [[birthday]]. The birthday effect has been seen in studies of general populations in [[England and Wales]],&lt;ref name="E&amp;W"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Relationship between month of birth and month of death in the elderly|first1=M|last1=Anderson|journal=British Journal of Preventive &amp; Social Medicine|year=1975|volume=29|issue=3|pages=151–156|pmc=478908|pmid=1191883}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref name="Swiss1992"&gt;{{cite journal|title=[Mortality and birthdays]|first1=J|last1=Bovet|first2=J|last2=Spagnoli|first3=C|last3=Sudan|journal=Sozial-und Praventivmedizin|year=1997|volume=42|issue=3|pages=151–161|pmid=9334087|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swiss2008"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Death has a preference for birthdays—an analysis of death time series|first1=Vladeta|last1=Ajdacic-Gross|display-authors=etal|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|year=2012|volume=22|issue=8|pages=603–606|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104727971200110X|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2012.04.016|pmid=22658822}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref name="Ukraine"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Variation of mortality rate during the individual annual cycle|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9087987|first1=Alexander|last1=Vaiserman|first2=Pavel|last2=Grigoryev|first3=Irina|last3=Belaya|first4=Vladimir|last4=Voitenko|journal=Biogerontology|year=2003|volume=4|issue=4|pages=221–225|doi=10.1023/A:1025168932058}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="California"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Birthday: Lifeline or Deadline?|first1=David|last1=Phillips|first2=Camilla|last2=Van Voorhees|first3=Todd|last3=Ruth|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=1992|volume=54|issue=5|pages=532–542|url=http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/1992/09000/The_birthday__lifeline_or_deadline__.1.aspx|doi=10.1097/00006842-199209000-00001|citeseerx=10.1.1.103.5726}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A not so happy day after all: Excess death rates on birthdays in the U.S|first1=Pablo|last1=Peña|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2015|volume=126|pages=59–66|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614008120|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.12.014|pmid=25528555}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in smaller populations such as [[Major League Baseball]] players.&lt;ref name="MLB"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mortality Salience of Birthdays on Day of Death in the Major Leagues|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Death Studies|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=175–184|doi=10.1080/07481180802138936|pmid=19143110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies do not consistently show this effect; some studies find that men's and women's mortality rates diverge in the run-up to the birthday,&lt;ref name="California"/&gt; while others find no [[statistical significance|significant]] gender effect.&lt;ref name="Austria"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Longevity and month of birth: Evidence from Austria and Denmark|first1=Gabrielle|last1=Doblhammer|journal=Demographic Research|year=1999|volume=1|issue=3|url=http://www.demographic-research.org/Volumes/Vol1/3/default.htm|doi=10.4054/DemRes.1999.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Germany"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deaths and major biographical events: a study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009|first1=Daniel|last1=Medenwald|first2=Oliver|last2=Kuss|journal=BMJ Open|year=2014|volume=4|issue=4|url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/4/e004423.long|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004423|pmid=24694623|pmc=3987729|pages=e004423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested mechanisms for the effect include alcohol consumption, psychological stress relating to the birthday, increased suicide risk, terminally ill patients attempting to hold on until their birthday, an increased [[mortality salience]], or a physiological cycle that causes the body to weaken annually. It has also been suggested that it may be a statistical artifact, perhaps as a result of anomalies in reporting, but the birthday effect has also been seen in studies that control for known reporting anomalies.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;

==Studies==
[[File:GabbyHartnettGoudeycard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gabby Hartnett]] is one of the statistically unusual number of [[MLB]] players to have died on his birthday.&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;]]
With the introduction of statistical software that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies have been carried out to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale study used the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as [[seasonality]] in deaths, elective surgery, and people born on [[February 29]], there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did not peak on the birthday, but close to it. This effect was consistent across age and race cohorts.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

A similar study among 12,275,033 Swiss found the highest mortality on the actual birthday (17% greater than the expected value), and the effect was largest for those over 80;&lt;ref name="Swiss1992"/&gt; another study on Swiss data found a 13.8% excess and was able to link this to specific causes: [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]] (predominant in women) and suicides and accidents (predominant in men), as well as an increase in cancer deaths.&lt;ref name="Swiss2008"/&gt; Among 25 million Americans who died between 1998 and 2011, 6.7% more people than expected die on their birthday, and the effect was most pronounced at weekends and among the young – among 20 to 29 year olds, the excess was over 25%.&lt;ref name="USA"/&gt; An even greater excess was found in the population of Kiev, where between 1990 and 2000 there were 44.4% more deaths than expected among men on their birthdays and 36.2% more than expected among women.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt; Smaller biographical studies have also shown a birthday effect within subpopulations, such as among Major League Baseball (MLB) players&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt; and people with entries in the ''Encyclopedia of American History''.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

Focusing on suicide deaths alone, large studies have found evidence for a peak in suicides on or just after a birthday in [[Denmark]]&lt;ref name="Denmark"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Postponed Suicide Death? Suicides around Birthdays and Major Public Holidays|first1=Gert|last1=Jessen|first2=Børge|last2=Jensen|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|year=1999|volume=29|issue=3|pages=272–283|doi=10.1111/j.1943-278X.1999.tb00302.x|doi-broken-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hungary]],&lt;ref name="Hungary"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Birthday on the Fluctuation of Suicides in Hungary (1970–2002)|first1=Tamás|last1=Zonda|first2=Károly|last2=Bozsonyi|first3=Előd|last3=Veres|first4=Zoltán|last4=Kmetty|journal=Review of Sociology|year=2010|volume=20|issue=2|pages=96–105|url=http://www.szociologia.hu/dynamic/revsoc_2010_2_96_105_bozsonyi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not in [[Bavaria]]&lt;ref name="Bavaria"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The myth of the birthday blues: a population-based study about the association between birthday and suicide|first1=Udo|last1=Reulbach|first2=Teresa|last2=Biermann|first3=Katrin|last3=Markovic|first4=Johannes|last4=Kornhuber|first5=Stefan|last5=Bleich|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|year=2007|volume=48|issue=6|pages=554–557|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X07000867|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2007.06.006|pmid=17954141}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="Bavaria"/&gt;

However, other studies have not found such a correlation. A study using the populations of Denmark and [[Austria]] (a total of 2,052,680 deaths over the time period) found that although people's life span tended to correlate with their month of birth, there was no consistent birthday effect, and people born in autumn or winter were more likely to die in the months further from their birthday.&lt;ref name="Austria"/&gt; A study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009 found no evidence of a birthday effect, although it did find a related Christmas effect.&lt;ref name="Germany"/&gt; A small study by [[Leonard Zusne]] found birthday effects among both male and female cohorts, where women were more likely to die immediately before a birthday and men more likely to die immediately after, but that when averaged together there was no birthday effect among the population as a whole.&lt;ref name="Zusne"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Some Factors Affecting the Birthday-Deathday Phenomenon|first1=Leonard|last1=Zusne|journal=Omega: Journal of Death and Dying|year=1987|volume=17|issue=1|pages=9–26|url=http://ome.sagepub.com/content/17/1/9.short|doi=10.2190/RR4D-4W0L-5QAK-X4YX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same was found for a study of mortality data in England and Wales, where there was a statistically significant birthday effect among each subgroup (men and women; never married, married, divorced and widowed) but [[Simpson's paradox|it was not seen in the population as a whole]].&lt;ref name="E&amp;W"/&gt;

==Possible explanations==

===External causes===
Birthday celebrations are often associated with large increases in alcohol consumption. [[Binge drinking]] can [[Alcohol and health|increase an individual's risk of death]] through [[alcohol poisoning]], accidents and [[drunk driving]], as well as by exacerbating existing conditions and increasing suicide risk.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hungary"/&gt; In the USA where the drinking age is 21, there is a very large mortality rate excess on the 21st birthday and the day immediately following, almost entirely attributable to an increase in accidents.&lt;ref name="alcohol"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Mortality: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from the Minimum Drinking Age|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date=1 January 2009|volume=1|issue=1)|pages=164–182|first1=Christopher|last1=Carpenter|first2=Carlos|last2=Dobkin|doi=10.1257/app.1.1.164|pmid=20351794|pmc=2846371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alcoholappendix"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Mortality: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from the Minimum Drinking Age (Web Appendix A and B)|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date=1 January 2009|first1=Christopher|last1=Carpenter|first2=Carlos|last2=Dobkin|url=https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/articles-attachments/aej/app/app/2007-0089_app.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychosomatic and psychological===
{{see also|Mortality salience}}
Two mutually contradictory explanations have been put forward that rely on [[psychosomatic]] effects. On the one hand, a birthday provides a fixed date to focus on, allowing the terminally ill to hold on until the day itself. On the other hand, a birthday also reminds the individual of mortality and offers an occasion to look back on life.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/22/news/birthdays-a-matter-of-life-and-death.html|first1=Sandra|last1=Blakeslee|title=Birthdays: a Matter Of Life and Death|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 September 1992|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[terror management theory]], this causes stress which can accelerate death. The uneven mortality rate distribution between men and women, and between more and less successful baseball players, suggests that both may play a role in the birthday effect: people who have focused on the [[public sphere]] of life (for example, [[career]]-driven people or professional athletes) might be reminded that their glory days have passed, while those who lived more in the [[private sphere]] (such as stay-at-home parents and amateur sports players) are more aware of what they will lose in death and try to hold on.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Related is the "broken promise effect", whereby a person suffering [[suicidal ideation]] will wait until a birthday or other significant event to see whether their circumstances will improve.&lt;ref name="Hungary"/&gt;

The psychosomatic/psychological model would also explain the similar increase in cancer deaths around holidays such as [[Christmas]],&lt;ref name="Germany"/&gt; and is supported by the fact that these appear to be dependent on culture – there is a [[Passover]] effect among the Jewish community (which moves [[Passover#Date and duration|with the festival itself]]), and a [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] effect among the Chinese.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

===Physiological===
It has been suggested that, like the 24-hour [[circadian rhythm]], the body also has a yearly "circannual" [[biological rhythm]]. Vaiserman et al. have suggested that the climatic conditions at birth act as a [[zeitgeber]] that triggers internal stress and increases the chance of death.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt;

===Statistical===
It is possible when processing [[death certificate]]s to confuse the date of birth and date of death fields, which would increase the apparent number of certificates in which these coincide.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt; Additionally, where the exact date is not known, the 1st and 15th of the month are often used as placeholders.&lt;ref name="Heaping"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heaping in Anniversary Reaction Studies: A Cautionary Note|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Omega: Journal of Death and Dying|year=2006|volume=54|issue=1|pages=59–65|url=http://ome.sagepub.com/content/54/1/59.short|doi=10.2190/V752-6773-1KMW-3334}}&lt;/ref&gt; These will cause an excess of births and deaths recorded on these dates. However studies also find changes in the mortality rate in the days immediately before and after (which are unlikely to be caused by data processing anomalies), which suggests that statistical artifacts alone cannot explain the birthday effect.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

[[Image:Chirality with hands.svg|200px|thumb|Two enantiomers of a generic [[amino acid]] that is '''chiral''']]

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|iː}} is a property of [[asymmetry]] important in several branches of science. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|χειρ}} (''kheir''), "hand," a familiar chiral object.

An object or a system is ''chiral'' if it is distinguishable from its [[mirror image]]; that is, it cannot be [[wikt:superposed|superposed]] onto it.  Conversely, a mirror image of an ''achiral'' object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object. A chiral object and its mirror image are called ''enantiomorphs'' (Greek, "opposite forms") or, when referring to molecules, ''[[enantiomers]]''. A non-chiral object is called ''achiral'' (sometimes also ''amphichiral'') and can be superposed on its mirror image. If the object is non-chiral and is imagined as being colored blue and its mirror image is imagined as colored yellow, then by a series of rotations and translations the two can be superposed, producing green, with none of the original colors remaining.

The term was first used by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] in 1893 in the second [[Robert Boyle Lecture]] at the [[Oxford University Junior Scientific Club]] which was published in 1894:

{{quote|I call any geometrical figure, or group of points, 'chiral', and say that it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Molecular Tactics of a Crystal |author=Sir William Thomson Lord Kelvin | year=1894 | publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] | url=https://archive.org/details/moleculartactic00kelvgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human [[hand]]s are perhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes.&lt;ref name="OCATUA"&gt;Georges Henry Wagnière, ''On Chirality and the Universal Asymmetry: Reflections on Image and Mirror Image'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand. In mathematics, ''chirality'' is the property of a figure that is not identical to its mirror image.

==Mathematics==

{{main|Chirality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone.  For example, a right shoe is different from a left shoe, and clockwise is different from anticlockwise. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition.

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called achiral or amphichiral.

The [[helix]] (and by extension a spun string, a screw, a propeller, etc.) and [[Möbius strip]] are chiral two-dimensional objects in three-dimensional ambient space. The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space.

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves, glasses (where two lenses differ in prescription), and shoes. A similar notion of chirality is considered in [[knot theory]], as explained below.

Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the [[right-hand rule]].

===Geometry===
In [[geometry]] a figure is achiral if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry.
In two dimensions, every figure that possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry.
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[plane of symmetry]] or a center of symmetry is achiral. There are, however, achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry.
In terms of [[point groups]], all chiral figures lack an improper axis of rotation (S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). This means that they cannot contain a center of inversion (i) or a mirror plane (σ). Only figures with a point group designation of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, T, O, or I can be chiral.

===Knot theory===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called chiral. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

{{main|Chirality (physics)}}

In physics, chirality may be found in the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a particle, where the handedness of the object is determined by the direction in which the particle spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/nov/lookingfortherig591|title=Looking for the Right Hand - DiscoverMagazine.com|author=|date=|website=discovermagazine.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicity]], which is the projection of the spin along the linear momentum of a subatomic particle, chirality is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon like spin. Although both can have left-handed or right-handed properties, only in the massless case do they have a simple relation.&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/06/19/helicity-chirality-mass-and-the-higgs/|title=Quantum Diaries|author=|date=|website=www.quantumdiaries.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for a massless particle the helicity is the same as the chirality while for an antiparticle they have opposite sign.

The ''handedness'' in both chirality and helicity relate to the rotation of a particle while it proceeds in linear motion with reference to the human hands. The thumb of the hand points towards the direction of linear motion whilst the fingers curl into the palm, representing the direction of rotation of the particle (i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise). Depending on the linear and rotational motion, the particle can either be defined by left-handedness (ex. translating leftwards and rotating counterclockwise) or right-handedness (ex. translating in the right direction and rotating clockwise).&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"/&gt; A symmetry transformation between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Invariance under parity by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called ''chiral symmetry''.

===Electromagnetism===

{{main|Chirality (electromagnetism)}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic]] wave [[Wave propagation|propagation]] as [[handedness]] is wave [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and described in terms of [[Circular dichroism|helicity]] (occurs as a helix). Polarization of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is the property that describes the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], i.e., the [[periodic function|time-varying]], direction ([[Euclidean vector|vector]]), and [[amplitude]] of the [[electric field]] vector. For a depiction, see the adjacent image.

{{main|Chirality (chemistry)}}

A ''chiral molecule'' is a type of [[molecule]] that has a non-superposable [[mirror image]]. The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon atom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chiral" in general is used to describe the object that is non-superposable on its mirror image.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called [[enantiomer]]s or optical [[isomer]]s. Pairs of enantiomers are often designated as "[[right-handed|right-]]", "left-handed" or if it has no bias achiral. As polarized light passes through a chiral molecule, the plane of polarization, when viewed along the axis toward the source, will be rotated in a clockwise (to the right) or anticlockwise (to the left). A right handed rotation is dextrorotary (d); that to the left is levorotary (l). The d- and l-isomers are the same compound but are called [[enantiomers]]. An equimolar mixture of the two optical isomers will produce no net rotation of polarized light as it passes through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Raymond|title=Chemistry|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-394-32983-X|page=660|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left handed molecules have l- prefixed to their names; d- is prefixed to right handed molecules.

Molecular chirality is of interest because of its application to [[stereochemistry]] in [[inorganic chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[supramolecular chemistry]].

More recent developments in chiral chemistry include the development of chiral inorganic nanoparticles that may have the similar tetrahedral geometry as chiral centers associated with sp3 carbon atoms traditionally associated with chiral compounds, but at larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moloney|first=Mícheál P.|last2=Gun'ko|first2=Yurii K.|last3=Kelly|first3=John M.|date=2007-09-26|title=Chiral highly luminescent CdS quantum dots|url=https://doi.org/10.1039/b704636g|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|volume=0|issue=38|doi=10.1039/b704636g|issn=1364-548X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaaff|first=T.

==Biology==
{{See also|Homochirality}}

All of the known life-forms show specific chiral properties in chemical structures as well as macroscopic anatomy, development and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Wende|last2=Ernst|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Palotas|first3=Krisztian|last4=Zhang|first4=Yuyang|last5=Bruyer|first5=Emilie|last6=Peng|first6=Lingqing|last7=Greber|first7=Thomas|last8=Hofer|first8=Werner A.|last9=Scott|first9=Lawrence T.|date=2016-02-08|title=Microscopic origin of chiral shape induction in achiral crystals|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2449|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=En|volume=8|issue=4|pages=326–330|doi=10.1038/nchem.2449|issn=1755-4330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any specific organism or evolutionarily related set thereof, individual compounds, organs, or behavior are found in the same single enantiomorphic form. Deviation (having the opposite form) could be found in a small number of chemical compounds, or certain organ or behavior but that variation strictly depends upon the genetic make up of the organism. From chemical level (molecular scale), biological systems show extreme stereospecificity in synthesis, uptake, sensing, metabolic processing. A living system usually deals with two enantiomers of same compound in a drastically different way.

In biology, homochirality is a common property of [[Amino acid#Isomerism|amino acids]] and [[Monosaccharide#Open-chain stereoisomers|carbohydrates]]. The chiral [[Proteinogenic amino acid|protein-making amino acids]], which are translated through the ribosome from genetic coding, occur in the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; form. However, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are also found in nature. The monosaccharides (carbohydrate-units) are commonly found in &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-configuration. DNA double helix is chiral (as any kind of [[Helix#Types|helix]] is chiral), and [[B-DNA|B-form of DNA]] shows a right-handed turn.

Sometimes, when two enantiomers of a compound found in organisms, they significantly differ in their taste, smell and other biological actions. For example, (+)-Limonene found in orange (causing its smell), and (–)-Limonene found in Lemons (causing its smell), show different smells&lt;ref&gt;Solomon and Fryhles organic chemistry, Ed 10, Wiley (Students edition), Chapter 5 (Stereochemistry), Section 5.5 More about biological significance of chirality&lt;/ref&gt; due to different biochemical interactions at human nose.

Also, for artificial compounds, including medicines, in case of chiral drugs, the two enantiomers sometimes show remarkable difference in effect of their biological actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanganyado|first=Edmond|last2=Lu|first2=Zhijiang|last3=Fu|first3=Qiuguo|last4=Schlenk|first4=Daniel|last5=Gan|first5=Jay|date=2017|title=Chiral pharmaceuticals: A review on their environmental occurrence and fate processes|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0043135417306565|journal=Water Research|volume=124|pages=527–542|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2017.08.003|issn=0043-1354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darvon ([[Dextropropoxyphene]]) is a painkiller, whereas its enantiomer, Novrad ([[Levopropoxyphene]]) is an anti-cough agent.

Macroscopic example of Chirality is found in plant kingdom, animal kingdom and all other groups of organism. A simple example is the coiling direction of any climber plants. It may be one of two possible type of helix.

[[File:Neptunea - links&amp;rechts gewonden.jpg|thumb|200px|Shells of two different species of sea snail: on the left is the normally sinistral (left-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea angulata]]'', on the right is the normally dextral (right-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea despecta]]'']]
In anatomy, chirality is found in the imperfect mirror image symmetry of many kinds of animal bodies. Organisms such as [[gastropod]]s exhibit chirality in their coiled shells, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance. Over 90% of gastropod species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schilthuizen | first1 = M. | last2 = Davison | first2 = A. | year = 2005 | title = The convoluted evolution of snail chirality | url = | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | volume = 92 | issue = 11| pages = 504–515 | doi =  10.1007/s00114-05-0045-2| bibcode = 2005NW.....92..504S }}&lt;/ref&gt; have ''dextral'' (right-handed) shells in their coiling, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always ''sinistral'' (left-handed). A very few species (for example ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm|title=Amphidromus perversus (Linnaeus, 1758)|author=|date=|website=www.jaxshells.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) show an equal mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals.

In humans, chirality (also referred to as ''handedness'' or ''laterality'') is an attribute of humans defined by their unequal distribution of [[fine motor skill]] between the left and right [[hands]]. An individual who is more [[Dexterity|dexterous]] with the right hand is called ''[[right-handed]]'', and one who is more skilled with the left is said to be ''[[left-handed]]''. Chirality is also seen in the study of [[facial asymmetry]].

In flatfish, the [[Summer flounder]] or fluke are left-eyed, while [[halibut]] are right-eyed.

'''''Code of the Lifemaker''''' is a 1983 novel by British [[science fiction]] [[author]] [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]].  [[NASA]]'s [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19830007077.pdf Advanced Automation for Space Missions] was the direct inspiration for this novel detailing [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] between [[Earth]] explorers and the Taloids, [[clanking replicator]]s who have [[colonization|colonized]] [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

A sequel titled ''[[The Immortality Option]]'' was published in 1995.

==Plot summary==

About 1,000,000 B.C., an unidentified alien race sent out robotic factories to many worlds in their part of the galaxy to prepare for future settlement.  One of those factory ships suffers severe  radiation damage from a near-miss by a [[supernova]] and goes off course, drifting in space for a hundred thousand years before landing on the Saturnian moon Titan. Due to a malfunction in its database, it begins producing imperfect copies that begin to [[evolution|evolve]] on their own.

Almost all of them have reverence for their mythical creator, a being they call the "Lifemaker".

Early in the 21st century, the North Atlantic Space Organization (combining NASA and [[NATO]]) dispatched the ''Orion'' with a cover story of [[terraforming]] [[Mars]] for human habitation.  Karl Zambendorf, a [[con artist]] who is present on this expedition to verify [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]] over interplanetary distances, prematurely learns that the ''Orion'' and its crew of researchers is headed for Titan, where the discovery of the Taloids has been kept need-to-know on Earth.

When the ''Orion'' arrives, the first landing party sets down in a freethinking state where Thirg, a Taloid who was cast out of his home state Kroaxia, has fled. They are mistaken for the Lifemaker because they have come from the sky, which the Taloids cannot see out of due to Titan's atmosphere. But Thirg becomes more discerning as he and the humans begin to understand more of each other's speech. Thirg's brother Groork has come from Kroaxia to apprehend him, but Zambendorf intercepts him and sends him back to Kroaxia as a [[prophet]].

Zambendorf learned that NASO plans to exploit Titan's natural resources and use the Taloids to build the factories they need, reducing them to [[slavery|slaves]]. The NASO business administrators on the ''Orion'' are already in agreement with the Kroaxian government to use human (the Taloids call humans "Lumians" because they glow brightly in their infrared vision) weapons to conquer Titan, believing the Kroaxian leadership buttressed by priests will be the easiest to control. Zambendorf, in his unanticipated role as Messenger for the Lifemaker, has given Groork guidelines akin to the [[Ten Commandments]] for his people to prevent a war from starting. "All Taloids are brothers" and "No Taloid is to enslave or be a slave" does not sit well with the ruling establishment of Kroaxia, and Groork is saved by the ''Orion'' crew not working for NASO.  There will be use of Titan's resources, but the partnership between humans and Taloids will be one of equals.

[[Romanticism]] grew largely out of an attempt to understand not just inert nature, but also vital nature. Romantic works in the realm of art and [[medicine|Romantic medicine]] were a response to the general failure of the application of method of inertial science to reveal the foundational laws and operant principles of vital nature. German romantic science and medicine sought to understand the nature of the life principle identified by John Hunter as distinct from matter itself via [[Blumenbach|Johan Friedrich Blumenbach]]'s ''Bildungstrieb'' and [[Hahnemann|Romantic medicine]]'s ''Lebenskraft'', as well as Röschlaub's development of the [[Brunonian|Brunonian system of medicine]] system of John Brown, in his ''excitation theory'' of life (German:''Erregbarkeit theorie''), working also with  Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'', the work of [[Goethe]] regarding morphology, and the first dynamic conception of physiology of [[Richard Saumarez]]. But it is in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] that we find the question of life and vital nature most intensely and comprehensively examined, particularly in his '''''Hints towards the Formation of a more Comprehensive Theory of Life'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (1818), providing the foundation for [[Romanticism and epistemology|Romantic philosophy]], science and medicine.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levere|first1=Trevor H.|title=Coleridge and the Sciences|journal=CUP Archive|date=June 28, 1990|pages=295–306|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=Owen+Barfield+Hints+Towards+a+More+Comprehensive+Theory+of+Life&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Owen%20Barfield%20Hints%20Towards%20a%20More%20Comprehensive%20Theory%20of%20Life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is key to understanding the relationship of Romantic literature and science.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Male|first1=Roy R.

== Background ==
The Enlightenment had developed a philosophy and science supported by formidable twin pillars: the first the Cartesian split of mind and matter, the second Newtonian physics, with its conquest of inert nature, both of which focused the mind's gaze on things or objects. For Cartesian philosophy, life existed on the side of matter, not mind; and for the physical sciences, the method that had been so productive for revealing the secrets of inert nature, should be equally productive in examining vital nature. The initial attempt to seek the cause and principle of life in matter was challenged by John Hunter, who held that the principle of life was not to be found nor confined within matter, but existed independently of matter itself, and informed or animated it, that is, he implied, it was the unifying or antecedent cause of the things or what Aristotelean philosophy termed ''natura naturata'' (the outer appearances of nature).
 
This reduction of the question of life to matter, and the corollary, that the method of the inertial sciences was the way to understand the very phenomenon of life, that is, its very nature and essence as a power (''natura naturans''), not as manifestations through sense-perceptible appearances (''natura naturata''), also reduced the individual to a material-mechanical 'thing' and seemed to render human freedom an untenable concept. It was this that Romanticism challenged, seeking instead to find an approach to the essence of nature as being also vital not simply inert, through a systematic method involving not just physics, but physiology (living functions). For Coleridge, quantitative analysis was anti-realist and needed to be grounded in qualitative analysis ('-ologies') (as was the case with Goethe's approach).&lt;ref name=Dyssebeia&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Metaphors In Coleridge's Theory of Life|url=http://dyssebeia.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/two-metaphors-in-coleridges-theory-of-life/|website=Dyssebeia|publisher=[[Wordpress]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the same time, the Romantics had to deal with the idealistic view that life was a 'somewhat' outside of things, such that the things themselves lost any real existence, a stream coming through Hume and Kant, and also infusing the German natural philosophical stream, German idealism, and in particular ''naturphilosophie'', eventuating scientifically in the doctrine of 'vitalism'. For the Romantics, life is independent of and antecedent to nature, but also infused and suspended in nature, not apart from it, As David Bohm expresses it in more modern terms "In nature nothing remains constant…everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is…at the foundation of the possibility of our understanding nature in a rational way."&lt;ref name=Bohm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bohm|first1=David|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|location=1957|page=1|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=nweG_wrUHuAC&amp;q=foundation#v=snippet&amp;q=foundation&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And as Coleridge explained, 'this antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each union, it has since the time of Bacon and Kepler been customary to call a law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|location=Middletown, CT|page=44, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as law, "we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=45, fn 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coleridge’s theory of life ==

Coleridge's was the dominant mind on many issues involving the philosophy and science in his time, as John Stuart Mill acknowledged, along with others since who have studied the history of Romanticism.

:The name of Coleridge is one of the few English names of our time which are likely to be oftener pronounced, and to become symbolical of more important things, in proportion as the inward workings of the age manifest themselves more and more in outward facts.&lt;ref name=Mill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mill|first1=John Stuart|title=Collected Works of John Stuart Mill|edition=Vol. 10|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=241&amp;chapter=21494&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

For Coleridge, as for many of his romantic contemporaries, the idea that matter itself can begat life only dealt with the various changes in the arrangement of particles and did not explain life itself as a principle or power that lay behind the material manifestations, ''natura naturans'' or "the productive power suspended and, as it were, quenched in the product" Until this were addressed, according to Coleridge, "we have not yet attained to a science of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This productive power is above sense experience, but not above nature herself, that is, supersensible, but not supernatural, and, thus, not 'occult' as was the case with vitalism. Vitalism failed to distinguish between spirit and nature, and then within nature, between the visible appearances and the invisible, yet very real and not simply hypothesized notion, essence or motivating principle (''natura naturans''). Even Newton spoke of things invisible in themselves (though not in their manifestations), such as force, though Comte, the thorough materialist, complained of the use of such terms as the 'force of gravity' as being relics of animism.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matter was not a 'datum' or thing in and of itself, but rather a product or effect, and for Coleridge, looking at life in its broadest sense, it was the product of a polarity of forces and energies, but derived from a unity which is itself a power, not an abstract or nominal concept, that is Life, and this polar nature of forces within the power of Life is the very law or 'Idea' (in the Platonic sense) of Creation.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"/&gt;

== Life as polarity/function/motion ==

For Coleridge the essence of the universe is motion and motion is driven by a dynamic polarity of forces that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestations. This polarity is the very dynamic that acts throughout all of nature, including into the more particular form of 'life biological', as well as of mind and consciousness.
 
:The tendency having been ascertained, what is its most general law? I answer—polarity, or the essential dualism of Nature, arising out of its productive unity, and still tending to reaffirm it, either as equilibrium, indifference, or identity.&lt;ref name="Theory of Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Hints Towards a More Comprehensive Theory of Life|date=1848|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=AXcNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge+theory+of+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vGNTVLG8E8OogwSsvoCgDw&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And this polarity is dynamic, that is real, though not visible, and not simply logical or abstract. Thus, the polarity results in manifestations that are real, as the opposite powers are not contradictory, but counteracting and inter-penetrating.

:...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and in the process of our own self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Biographia Literaria|date=1834|publisher=Leavitt, Lord &amp; Company|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=QHdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=coleridge+biographia+literaria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2RTVMaCA4aeNtPPgMAN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biographia%20literaria&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing—a self-subsistent hypostasis—but an act and process...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

And in that sense Coleridge re-phrases the question "What is Life?" to "What is not Life that really is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dynamic polar essence of nature in all its functions and manifestations is a universal law in the order of the law of gravity and other physical laws of inert nature. And, critically, this dynamic polarity of constituent powers of life at all levels is not outside or above nature, but is within nature (''natura naturans''), not as a part of the visible product, but as the ulterior natural functions that produce such products or things.

:a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function…

:The first product of its energy is the thing itself… Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=34, fn 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is these functions that provided the bridge being sought by Romantic science and medicine, in particular by Andreas Röschlaub and the [[Brunonian system|Brunonian system of medicine]], between the inertial science of inert nature (physics) and the vital science of vital nature (physiology) and its therapeutic application or physic (the domain of the physician).

=== Romanticism and vitalism ===

Coleridge was influenced by German philosophy, in particular Kant, Fichte and Schelling (Naturphilosophie), as well as the physiology of Blumenbach and the dynamic excitation theory of life of the Brunonian system. He sought a path that was neither the mystical tendency of the earlier vitalists nor the materialistic reductionist approach to natural science, but a dynamic one.

:What Coleridge was after was definitely not animism or naive vitalism based on vital substance, or mechanical philosophy based on material substance. He was trying to find a general law...that explicates its self-regulating internal power.&lt;ref name=Hawk&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawk|first1=Byron|title=A Counter-history of Composition: Toward Methodologies of Complexity|date=2007|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=dnHFgu43x1oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=Coleridge%27s+theory+of+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UljAqrEoxP&amp;sig=ojuS_BPEC--PNpfZVQ15yb1PUIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tfpTVODlMsebNpTGgsgE&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Coleridge%27s%20theory%20of%20life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's challenge was to describe something that was dynamic neither in mystical terms not materialistic ones, but via analogy, drawing from the examples of inertial science. As one writer explains, he uses the examples of electricity, magnetism and gravity not because they are like life, but because they offer a way of understanding powers, forces and energies, which lie at the heart of life. And using these analogies, Coleridge seeks to demonstrate that life is not a material force, but a product of relations amongst forces. Life is not linear and static, but dynamic process of self-regulation and [[emergence|Emergent evolution]] that results in increasing complexity and individuation.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt; This spiral, upward movement (cf. Goethe's ideas) creates a force for organization that unifies, and is most intense and powerful in that which is most complex and most individual - the self-regulating, enlightened, developed individual mind. But at the same time, this process of life increases interdependence (like the law of comparative advantage in economics) and associational powers of the mind. Thus, he is not talking about an isolated, individual subjective mind, but about the evolution of a higher level of consciousness and thought at the core of the process of life.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt;

== Life and liberty ==

And the direction of this motion is towards increasing individuation, that is the creation of specific, individual units of things. At the same time, given the dynamic polarity of the world, there must always be an equal and opposite tendency, in this case, that of connection. So, a given of our experience is that man is both an individual, tending in each life and in history generally to greater and greater individualization, and a social creature seeking interaction and connection. It is the dynamic interplay between the individuation and connecting forces that leads to higher and higher individuation.
 
:By Life I everywhere mean the true Idea of Life,… the tendency to individuation… [which] cannot be conceived without the opposite tendency to connect, even as the centrifugal power supposes the centripetal, or as the two opposite poles constitute each other, and are the constituent acts of one and the same power in the magnet…. Again, if the tendency be at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment, the individuation itself must be a tendency to the ultimate production of the highest and most comprehensive individuality. This must be the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object, or by whatever other word we may designate that something which bears to a final cause the same relation that Nature herself bears to the Supreme Intelligence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Creative life and vital nature ==

Coleridge makes a further distinction between mathematics and life, the latter being productive or creative, that is, living, and the former ideal. Thus, the mathematical approach that works so well with inert nature, is not suitable for vital nature.

:In its productive power, of which the product is the only measure, consists its incompatibility with mathematical calculus. For the full applicability of an abstract science ceases, the moment reality begins.

:This productive or generative power of life exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but the forces are not extinguished in the product - they take on a different role, namely that of functions. Thus, the very nature of the “given” is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts. 
The counteraction then of the two assumed forces does not depend on their meeting from opposite directions; the power which acts in them is indestructible; it is therefore inexhaustibly re-ebullient; and as something must be the result of these two forces, both alike infinite, and both alike indestructible; and as rest or neutralization cannot be this result; no other conception is possible, but that the product must be a tertium aliquid, [a third thing] or finite generation. Consequently this conception is necessary. Now this tertium aliquid can be no other than an inter-penetration of the counteracting powers, partaking of both… Consequently the 'constituent powers', that have given rise to a body, may then reappear in it as its function: "a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function...the first product of its energy is the thing itself: ''ipsa se posuit et iam facta est ens positum''. Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body...The vital functions are consequents of the ''Vis Vitae Principium Vitale'', and presuppose the Organs, as the Functionaries.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Life, that is, the essential polarity in unity (multeity in unity) in Coleridge’s sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form.

:But as little can we conceive the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. (BL)
To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Life and matter ==

This dynamic polarity that is Life is expressed at different levels. At its most basic it is Space-Time, with its product - motion. The interplay of both gives us either a line or a circle, and then there are different degrees possible within a given form or “predominance” of forces. Geometry is not conceivable except as the dynamic interplay of space (periphery) and time (point). Space, time and motion are also geometrically represented by width, length (breadth) and depth. And this correspondence is repeated throughout the scale of Life.

:We have been thus full and express on this subject, because these simple ideas of time, space, and motion, of length, breadth, and depth, are not only the simplest and universal, but the necessary symbols of all philosophic construction. They will be found the primary factors and elementary forms of every calculus and of every diagram in the algebra and geometry of a scientific physiology. Accordingly, we shall recognise the same forms under other names; but at each return more specific and intense; and the whole process repeated with ascending gradations of reality, exempli gratiâ: Time + space = motion; Tm + space = line + breadth = depth; depth + motion = force; Lf + Bf = Df; LDf + BDf = attraction + repulsion = gravitation; and so on, even till they pass into outward phenomena, and form the intermediate link between productive powers and fixed products in light, heat, and electricity.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Matter, then, is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power. It is also the mass of a given body.
 
:If we pass to the construction of matter, we find it as the product, or tertium aliquid, of antagonist powers of repulsion and attraction. Remove these powers, and the conception of matter vanishes into space—conceive repulsion only, and you have the same result. For infinite repulsion, uncounteracted and alone, is tantamount to infinite, dimensionless diffusion, and this again to infinite weakness; viz., to space. Conceive attraction alone, and as an infinite contraction, its product amounts to the absolute point, viz., to time. Conceive the synthesis of both, and you have matter as a fluxional antecedent, which, in the very act of formation, passes into body by its gravity, and yet in all bodies it still remains as their mass...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Coleridge’s understanding of life is contrasted with the materialist view which is essentially reduced to defining life as that which is the opposite of not-life, or that which resists death, that is, that which is life.

:By an easy logic, each of the two divisions has been made to define the others by a mere assertion of their assumed contrariety. The theorist has explained Y+X by informing us that it is the opposite of Y-X: and if we ask, what then is Y-X, we are told that it is the opposite of Y+X! A reciprocation of good services....I turn to a work by the eminent French physiologist, Bichat, where I find this definition: Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted....that is, that life consists in being able to live!...as if four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together than the words life, death, function, and resistance.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Cognition and life ==

The problem for Coleridge and the Romantics was that the intellect, 'left to itself' as Bacon stated, was capable of apprehending only the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) and not the inmost, living functions (natura naturans) giving rise to these forms. Thus, effects can only be 'explained' in terms of other effects, not causes. It takes a different capacity to 'see' these living functions, which is an imaginative activity. For Coleridge, there is an innate, primitive or 'primary' imagination that configures invisibly sense-experience into perception, but a rational perception, that is, one raised into consciousness and awareness and then rationally presentable, requires a higher level, what he termed 'secondary imagination', which is able to connect with the thing being experienced, penetrate to its essence in terms of the living dynamics upholding its outer form, and then present the phenomena as and within its natural law, and further, using reason, develop the various principles of its operation.

This cognitive capacity involved what Coleridge termed the 'inmost sense' or what Goethe termed the '''Gemüt'''. It also involved the reactivation of the old Greek noetic capacity, and the ability to 'see' or produce the theory (Greek ''theoria'' from the verb 'to see') dynamic polarities, or natural Laws, the dynamic transcendent (foundational) entities that Plato termed 'Ideas' (''eidos'').

Since ''natura naturata'' is sustained by ''natura naturans'', and the creative power of ''natura naturans'' is one of a kind with the human mind, itself creative, then there must be a correspondence or connection between the mind and the things we perceive, such that we can overcome the apparent separation between the object and the representation in the mind of the object that came to bedevil Enlightenment thought (Hume, Kant). As one commentator noted "to speak at all of the unity of intelligence and nature is of course flatly to contradict Descartes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and evolution ==

For Coleridge the power of life lies in every seed as a potential to be unfolded as a result of interaction with the environment (heat, light, air, moisture, etc.), an insight which allowed him to see in the Brunonian system a dynamic polarity in excitation theory.
 
Coleridge also saw that there was a progressive movement through time and space of life or the law of polarity, from the level of physics (space and time) and the mineral or inert nature (law of gravity, operating through forces of attraction and repulsion), up to man, with his law of resonance in terms of his innate desire to be himself (force of individuation) and to also connect with like-minded (force of connection), as Goethe expressed in his novel ''Elective Affinities'' (''Wahlverwandschaften'') as well as in his own life's experience.
 
Evolution occurred because the original polarity of creation, the very 'Law of Creation', itself gives birth to subsequent polarities, as each pole is itself a unity that can be further polarized (what Wilhelm Reich later termed 'orgonomic functionalism' and what at the biological level constitutes physiology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insight that would later be taken up by the concept of emergent evolution, including the emergence of mind and consciousness.

:the productive power, or ''vis naturans'', which in the sensible world, or n''atura naturata'', is what we mean by the word, nature, when we speak of the same as an agent, is essentially one (that is, of one kind) with the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And that this is so, is also an intimate and shared experience of all humans, as is set out in Reid's Common Sense philosophy. As Coleridge states

:but for the confidence which we place in the assertions of our reason and our conscience, we could have no certainty of the reality and actual outness of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That nature evolves towards a purpose, and that is the unfolding of the human mind and consciousness in all its levels and degrees, is not teleological but a function of the very nature of the law of polarity or creation itself, namely that of increasing individuation of an original unity, what Coleridge termed 'multeity in unity'. As he states, "without assigning to nature as nature, a conscious purpose" we must still "distinguish her agency from a blind and lifeless mechanism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While man contains and is subject to the various laws of nature, man as a self-conscious being is also the summa of a process of creation leading to greater mind and consciousness, that is, a creative capacity of imagination. Instead of being a creature of circumstance, man is the creator of them, or at least has that potential.
 
:Naked and helpless cometh man into the world. Such has been the complaint from eldest time; but we complain of our chief privilege, our ornament, and the connate mark of our sovereignty. Porphyrigeniti summus! …Henceforth he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=29, fn 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''death-positive movement''' is a [[Social movement|social]] and [[Philosophical movement|philosophical]] movement that encourages people to speak openly about death, dying, and corpses. The movement seeks to eliminate the silence around death-related topics, decrease anxiety surrounding death, and encourages more diversity in [[End-of-life care|end of life care]] options available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.talkdeath.com/death-positive-movement/|title=What is the Death Positive Movement?|date=2015-06-09|work=TalkDeath|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The word death positivity was popularized{{Dubious|date=March 2018}} by [[Caitlin Doughty]] as a play on the term [[Sex-positive movement|sex positivity]]. However, the ideas behind the movement have existed much longer. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/resources/death-positive-movement|title=Death Positive Movement - The Order of the Good Death|work=The Order of the Good Death|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Order of the Good Death]] website lists the beliefs of the death-positive movement as being that cultural censorship of death and dying does more harm than good, that open discussions about death should be accepted as a natural human curiosity, that families should have full rights to care for the bodies of their loved ones without intervention from funeral businesses, and that end of life care should be diversified and performed in ways that cause less damage to the environment than our current practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/death-positive|title=Death Positive|last=|first=|date=|website=The Order of the Good Death|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also strongly encourages participants to speak to their families about their own end of life wishes, even if they are young and healthy and is critical of the commercialized funeral industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/27/caitlin-doughty-death-positivity|title=Welcome the reaper: Caitlin Doughty and the 'death-positivity' movement|last=Kelly|first=Kim|date=2017-10-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also encourages people to express their feelings about death through art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/death-positivity-movement/slide/2|title=5 Stunning Pieces Of Art That Prove Death Doesn't Have To Be Sad|date=2018-02-08|work=Women's Health|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''death threat''' is a [[threat]], often made [[Anonymity|anonymously]], by one person or a group of people to kill another person or group of people. These threats are often designed to [[intimidate]] victims in order to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] their behaviour, and thus a death threat can be a form of [[coercion]]. For example, a death threat could be used to dissuade a public figure from pursuing a criminal investigation or an advocacy campaign.

In most jurisdictions, death threats are a serious type of [[criminal offence]]. Death threats are often covered by coercion statutes. For instance, the coercion statute in [[Alaska]] says:
{{quote|text=A person commits the crime of coercion if the person compels another to engage in conduct from which there is a legal right to abstain or abstain from conduct in which there is a legal right to engage, by means of instilling in the person who is compelled a fear that, if the demand is not complied with, the person who makes the demand or another may inflict physical injury on anyone....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touchngo.com/lglcntr/akstats/Statutes/Title11/Chapter41/Section530.htm Alaska Statute 11.41.530(a)(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Methods==
A death threat can be communicated via a wide range of media, among these letters, [[newspaper]] publications, [[telephone call]]s, [[blog|internet blogs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6499095.stm ''Blog death threats spark debate''] [[BBC News]] retrieved September 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[e-mail]]. If the threat is made against a political figure, it can also be considered [[treason]]. If a threat is against a non-living location that frequently contains living individuals (e.g. a building), it could be a [[Terrorism|terrorist threat]]. Sometimes, death threats are part of a wider campaign of abuse targeting a person or a group of people (see [[terrorism]], [[mass murder]]).

==Against a head of state==
In some [[Monarchy|monarchies]] and [[republic]]s, both democratic and authoritarian, threatening to kill the [[head of state]] and/or [[head of government]] (such as the [[sovereign]], [[Threatening the President of the United States|president]], or [[prime minister]]), is considered a crime, for which punishments vary. The United States law provides for up to five years in prison for threatening any type of [[threatening government officials of the United States|government official]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 18 U.S. Code § 871 - Threats against President and successors to the Presidency {{!}} US Law {{!}} LII / Legal Information Institute|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/871|website = www.law.cornell.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], under the [[Treason Felony Act 1848]], it is illegal to attempt to kill or deprive the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] of his/her throne; this offense was originally punished with [[penal transportation]], and then was changed to the [[death penalty]], and currently the penalty is [[life imprisonment]].

==Osman warning, letter or notice==
Named after a high-profile case, ''[[Osman v United Kingdom]]'', these are warnings of death threat or high risk of murder that are issued by British police or legal authorities to the possible victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/2157509/Dads-death-threat-warning.html |title=Dad's death threat warning  |work=[[The Scottish Sun]] |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used when there is intelligence of the threat, but there is not enough evidence to justify the police arresting the potential murderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published on Friday 13 June 2008 17:49 |url=http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/bed-news/Beds-is-one-of-nations.4185282.jp |title=Beds is one of nation's 'death-threat capitals' - News |publisher=Bedford Today |date=2008-06-13 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philip Doddridge.jpg|thumb|Philip Doddridge's portrait and his [[Coat of arms]]. The motto in the Coat of arms is ''Dum vivimus vivamus''.]]
'''''Dum vivimus vivamus''''' is a Latin phrase that means "While we live, let us live."&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=dum vivimus, vivamus |publisher=Dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dum+vivimus,+vivamus |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dum%20vivimus%20vivamus |title=dum vivimus vivamus |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often taken to be an [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] declaration.&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com"/&gt;

This Latin phrase was the motto of [[Philip Doddridge]]'s coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3XUBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=Philip+Doddridge+motto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eAOjny8yzK&amp;sig=EHwcBZjUaKHHH4TLQA7Tq5FbYqs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ILpxVYr8MMOuswHUkIGoAQ&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgK Orton, Job, Memoirs of the Life, Character and Writings of the Late Reverend Philip Doddridge, p. 145.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
It serves as the motto for [[Porcellian Club]] at Harvard. [[Emily Dickinson]] used the line in a whimsical [[valentine's Day|valentine]] written to William Howland in 1852 and subsequently published in the ''[[Springfield Daily Republican]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=odjIKZKYHJQC&amp;pg=PA350&amp;lpg=PA350&amp;dq=Emily+Dickinson+dum+vivimus+vivamus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z4rwLe0osd&amp;sig=21vPd8Dmltmq6hs3pGzWNIVLCf8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U8FxVZnaK8aqsgHEhYHgBg&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg Benson Sewall, Richard, The Life of Emily Dickinson, Volumes 1-2, p. 450.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
''[[Sic transit gloria mundi]]
 ''[[Against Idleness and Mischief|How doth the busy bee]],
''Dum vivimus vivamus,
 ''I stay my enemy!
&lt;/poem&gt;

It was also the motto inscribed on the sword of "Oscar" Gordon, the protagonist of [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1963 book "[[Glory Road]]". And it is the motto of The Knights of Momus, a New Orleans Carnival organization.

'''Essentialism''' is the view that every [[entity]] has a set of attributes that are necessary to its [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Richard L.|title=Some Remarks on Essentialism|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|year=1968|volume=65|issue=20|pages=615–626|jstor=2024315|doi=10.2307/2024315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Western thought [[Platonic idealism|Plato's idealism]] held that all things have such an "essence"—an [[Theory of Forms|"idea" or "form"]]. In [[Categories (Aristotle)|''Categories'']], Aristotle similarly proposed that all objects have a [[Substance theory|substance]] that, as [[George Lakoff]] put it "make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not ''that'' kind of thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Janicki|2003|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contrary view—[[non-essentialism]]—denies the need to posit such an "essence'".

Essentialism has been controversial from its beginning. Plato, in the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides Dialogue]]'', depicts Socrates questioning the notion, suggesting that if we accept the idea that every beautiful thing or just action partakes of an essence to be beautiful or just, we must also accept the "existence of separate essences for hair, mud, and dirt" .&lt;ref name="platostanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-parmenides/|title=Plato's Parmenides|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biology and other natural sciences, essentialism provided the rationale for [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] at least until the time of [[Charles Darwin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ereshefsky|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the role and importance of essentialism in biology is still a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hull|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[gender studies]] the essentialist idea that men and women are fundamentally different continues to be a matter of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Women and Men|publisher=Basic Books|year=1992|isbn=978-0465047925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"&gt;Suzanne Kelly, Gowri Parameswaran, and Nancy Schniedewind, ''Women: Images &amp; Realities: A Multicultural Anthology'', 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
An ''[[essence]]'' characterizes a [[substance theory|substance]] or a [[Substantial form|form]], in the sense of the forms and ideas in [[Platonic idealism]]. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal, is and present in every possible world. Classical [[humanism]] has an essentialist conception of the human, in its endorsement of the notion of an eternal and unchangeable [[human nature]]. This has been criticized by [[Kierkegaard]], [[Marx]], [[Heidegger]], [[Sartre]], and many other [[Existentialism|existential]] and [[Historical materialism|materialist]] thinkers.

In [[Plato]]'s philosophy (in particular, the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and the ''[[Philebus]]''), things were said to come into being by the action of a [[demiurge]] who works to form [[substance theory|chaos]] into ordered entities. Many definitions of ''essence'' hark back to the ancient Greek [[hylomorphic]] understanding of the formation of the things. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artefact produced by a craftsperson. The craftsperson requires ''hyle'' (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in her own mind, according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (''morphe''). Aristotle was the first to use the terms ''hyle'' and ''morphe''. According to [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|his explanation]], all entities have two aspects: "matter" and "form". It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity—its [[quiddity]] or "whatness" (i.e., its "what it is").

Plato was one of the first essentialists, postulating the concept of ideal forms—an [[abstract entity]] of which individual objects are mere facsimiles. To give an example: the ideal form of a circle is a perfect circle, something that is physically impossible to make manifest; yet the circles we draw and observe clearly have some ''idea'' in common—the ideal form. Plato proposed that these ideas are eternal and vastly superior to their manifestations, and that we understand these manifestations in the material world by comparing and relating them to their respective ideal form. Plato's forms are regarded as patriarchs to essentialist dogma simply because they are a case of what is intrinsic and a-contextual of objects—the abstract properties that makes them what they are. (For more on forms, read [[Plato's allegory of the cave|Plato's parable of the cave]].)

[[Karl Popper]] splits the ambiguous term ''[[Philosophical realism|realism]]'' into ''essentialism'' and ''realism''. He uses ''essentialism'' whenever he means the opposite of [[nominalism]], and ''realism'' only as opposed to [[idealism]]. Popper himself is a realist as opposed to an idealist, but a methodological nominalist as opposed to an essentialist. For example, statements like "a puppy is a young dog" should be read from right to left, as an answer to "What shall we call a young dog"; never from left to right as an answer to "What is a puppy?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysical essentialism===
Essentialism, in its broadest sense, is any philosophy that acknowledges the primacy of ''essence''. Unlike [[existentialism]], which posits "being" as the fundamental reality, the essentialist [[wikt:ontology|ontology]] must be approached from a metaphysical perspective. Empirical knowledge is developed from experience of a relational universe whose components and attributes are defined and measured in terms of intellectually constructed laws. Thus, for the scientist, reality is explored as an evolutionary system of diverse entities, the order of which is determined by the principle of causality.

[[Plato]] believed that the universe was perfect and that its observed imperfections came from man's limited perception of it. For Plato, there were two realities: the "essential" or ideal and the "perceived". [[Aristotle]] (384–322 B.C.) applied the term ''essence'' to that which things in a category have in common and without which they cannot be members of that category (for example, ''rationality'' is the essence of man; without rationality a creature cannot be a man). In his critique of Aristotle's philosophy, [[Bertrand Russell]] said that his concept of essence transferred to metaphysics what was only a verbal convenience and that it confused the properties of language with the properties of the world. In fact, a thing's "essence" consisted in those defining properties without which we could not use the ''name'' for it.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concept of essence was "hopelessly muddled" it became part of every philosophy until modern times.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt;

The Egyptian-born philosopher [[Plotinus]] (204–270 CE) brought [[idealism]] to the [[Roman Empire]] as [[Neoplatonism]], and with it the concept that not only do all existents emanate from a "primary essence" but that the mind plays an active role in shaping or ordering the objects of perception, rather than passively receiving empirical data.

Despite the metaphysical basis for the term, academics in science, [[aesthetics]], [[heuristics]], [[psychology]], and gender-based sociological studies have advanced their causes under the banner of essentialism. Possibly the clearest definition for this philosophy was offered by gay/lesbian rights advocate [[Diana Fuss]], who wrote: "Essentialism is most commonly understood as a belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the 'whatness' of a given entity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fuss|2013|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysical essentialism stands diametrically opposed to existential realism in that finite existence is only differentiated appearance, whereas "ultimate reality" is held to be absolute essence.

Among contemporary essentialists, what all existing things have in common is ''the power to exist'', which defines their "uncreated" Essence.&lt;ref&gt;Levina, Tatiana (Moscow 2013) Realism in Metaphysics: Analytic Questions and Continental Answers (p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==
In 2010, an article by [[Gerald B. Folland]] in the ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'' stated, "It is a truth universally acknowledged that almost all mathematicians are Platonists, at least when they are actually doing mathematics …" This refers to their implicit embrace of essentialism, which he finds revealed in mathematicians peculiar use of language. Whereas physicists define [[Lie algebra]] as a rule they can apply to facts, mathematicians define it as an essence of a structure, independent of any circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/201009/rtx100901121p.pdf Gerald B. Folland, October 2010, Notices of the AMS, p. 1121 "Speaking with the Natives: Reﬂections on Mathematical Communication"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==
[[File:Toronto Maple Leafs bild.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] attempts to explain why people will pay more in an auction for the clothing of celebrities if the clothing is unwashed. He believes the answer to this and many other questions is that people cannot help but think of objects as containing a sort of "essence" that can be influenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_the_origins_of_pleasure.html Paul Bloom, July 2011 Ted talk, "The Origins of Pleasure"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There is a difference between metaphysical essentialism (see above) and psychological essentialism, the latter referring not to an actual claim about the world but a claim about a way of representing entities in cognitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medin|first=D. L.|title=Conceptes and conceptual structure|journal=American Psychologist|year=1989|volume=44|issue=12|pages=1469–1481|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.44.12.1469}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Medin, 1989). Influential in this area is [[Susan Gelman]], who has outlined many domains in which children and adults construe classes of entities, particularly biological entities, in essentialist terms—i.e., as if they had an immutable underlying essence which can be used to predict unobserved similarities between members of that class.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gelman, S. ''The essential child: Origins of essentialism in everyday thought''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toosi|first=N. R.|author2=Ambady, N.|title=Ratings of essentialism for eight religious identities|journal=International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1080/10508619.2011.532441|pmid=21572550|pmc=3093246}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Toosi &amp; Ambady, 2011). This causal relationship is unidirectional; an observable feature of an entity does not define the underlying essence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dar-Nimrod|first=I.|author2=Heine, S. J.|title=Genetic essentialism: On the deceptive determinism of DNA|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2011|volume=137|issue=5|pages=800–818|doi=10.1037/a0021860|pmid=21142350|pmc=3394457}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, 2011).

===In developmental psychology===
Essentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly [[developmental psychology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gelman|first=S. A.|author2=Kremer, K. E.|title=Understanding natural causes: Children's explanations of how objects and their properties originate|journal=Child Development|year=1991|volume=62|issue=2|pages=396–414|doi=10.2307/1131012|pmid=2055130|jstor=1131012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelman and Kremer (1991) studied the extent to which children from 4–7 years old demonstrate essentialism. Children were able to identify the cause of behaviour in living and non-living objects. Children understood that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Participants could correctly describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects as a result of an adult influencing the object's actions. This is a biological way of representing essential features in cognitions. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rangel|first=U.|author2=Keller, J.|title=Essentialism goes social: Belief in social determinism as a component of psychological essentialism|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=6|pages=1056–1078|doi=10.1037/a0022401|pmid=21319911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rangel and Keller, 2011).
Younger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in [[cognitive development]]. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demoulin|first=Stéphanie|last2=Leyens |first2=Jacques-Philippe |last3=Yzerbyt |first3=Vincent|title=Lay Theories of Essentialism |journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|year=2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=25–42|doi=10.1177/1368430206059856}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Demoulin, Leyens &amp; Yzerbyt, 2006).

There are four key criteria which constitute essentialist thinking. The first facet is the aforementioned individual causal mechanisms (del Rio &amp; Strasser, 2011). The second is innate potential: the assumption that an object will fulfill its predetermined course of development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanovsky|first=M.|title=Essentialism and folksociology: Ethnicity again|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=241–281|doi=10.1163/156853707X208503|citeseerx=10.1.1.411.7247}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kanovsky, 2007). According to this criterion, essences predict developments in entities that will occur throughout its lifespan. The third is immutability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holtz|first=P.|author2=Wagner, W.|title=Essentialism and attribution of monstrosity in racist discourse: Right-wing internet postings about africans and jews|journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=19|issue=6|pages=411–425|doi=10.1002/casp.1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Holtz &amp; Wagner, 2009). Despite altering the superficial appearance of an object it does not remove its essence. Observable changes in features of an entity are not salient enough to alter its essential characteristics. The fourth is inductive potential&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birnbaum|first=D.|author2=Deeb, I. |author3=Segall, G. |author4=Ben-Eliyahu, A. |author5=Diesendruck, G. |title=The development of social essentialism: The case of Israeli children's inferences about Jews and Arabs |journal=Child Development |year=2010 |volume=81|issue=3|pages=757–777|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624-2010.01432.x|pmid=20573103|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Birnbaum, Deeb, Segall, Ben-Aliyahu &amp; Diesendruck, 2010). This suggests that entities may share common features but are essentially different. However similar two beings may be, their characteristics will be at most analogous, differing most importantly in essences.

The implications of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals have been found to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=T. A.|author2=Hornsey, M. J. |author3=Postmes, T. |title=Shifting ground: The variable use of essentialism in contexts of inclusion and exclusion|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=48|issue=1|pages=35–59|doi=10.1348/014466607X270287|pmid=18171502}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Morton, Hornsey &amp; Postmes, 2009). This may be due to an over-extension of an essential-biological mode of thinking stemming from cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Medin | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Atran | first2 = S. | year = 2004 | title = The native mind: biological categorization and reasoning in development and across cultures | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.111.4.960 | pmid = 15482069 | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 111 | issue = 4| pages = 960-83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] of Yale University has stated that "one of the most exciting ideas in cognitive science is the theory that people have a default assumption that things, people and events have invisible essences that make them what they are. Experimental psychologists have argued that essentialism underlies our understanding of the physical and social worlds, and developmental and cross-cultural psychologists have proposed that it is instinctive and universal. We are natural-born essentialists."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom. P. (2010) Why we like what we like. ''Observer''. 23 (8), 3 [http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2010/october-10/why-we-like-what-we-like.html online link].&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars suggest that the categorical nature of essentialist thinking predicts the use of stereotypes and can be targeted in the application of stereotype prevention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastian|first=B.|author2=Haslam, N.|title=Psychological essentialism and stereotype endorsement|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=2|pages=228–235|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Bastian &amp; Haslam, 2006).

==In ethics==
Classical essentialists claim that some things are wrong in an absolute sense. For example murder breaks a universal, objective and natural moral law and not merely an advantageous, socially or ethically constructed one.

Many modern essentialists claim that right and wrong are moral boundaries that are individually constructed; in other words, things that are ethically right or wrong are actions that the individual deems to be beneficial or harmful, respectively.

==In biology==

One possibility is that before [[evolution]] was developed as a [[scientific theory]], there existed an essentialist view of [[biology]] that posited all species to be unchanging throughout time. The historian Mary P. Winsor has argued that biologists such as [[Louis Agassiz]] in the 19th century believed that taxa such as species and genus were fixed, reflecting the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowler |first1=Peter J. |title=Evolution. The History of an Idea |date=1989 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-06386-0 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[creation-evolution controversy|religious opponents of evolution]] continue to maintain this view of biology.

Recent work by historians of [[systematics|systematic biology]] has, however, cast doubt upon this view of pre-Darwinian thinkers. Winsor, Ron Amundson and Staffan Müller-Wille have each argued that in fact the usual suspects (such as [[Linnaeus]] and the Ideal Morphologists) were very far from being essentialists, and it appears that the so-called "essentialism story" (or "myth") in biology is a result of conflating the views expressed by philosophers from [[Aristotle]] onwards through to [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[William Whewell]] in the immediately pre-Darwinian period, using biological examples, with the use of terms in biology like species.&lt;ref&gt;Amundson, R. (2005) ''The changing rule of the embryo in evolutionary biology: structure and synthesis'', New York, Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-80699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Müller-Wille | first1=Staffan | year=2007 | title=Collection and collation: theory and practice of Linnaean botany | journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences | volume=38 | issue=3| pages=541–562 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2007.06.010| pmid=17893064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Winsor | first1=M.

== Gender essentialism ==
{{main|Gender essentialism}}

In [[feminist theory]] and [[gender studies]], '''gender essentialism''' is the attribution of a fixed essence to women. Women's essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These ideas of femininity are usually biologized and are often preoccupied with psychological characteristics, such as nurturance, empathy, support, and non-competitiveness, etc. Feminist theorist [[Elizabeth Grosz]] states in her 1995 publication ''Space, time and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies'' that essentialism "entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women's essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change—it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization."&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Grosz|first1 = Elizabeth|title =Space, Time, and Perversion: Essays on the Politics of Bodies |date = 1995|publisher = Routledge|location = New York|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Space_Time_and_Perversion.html?id=Htf7y-rcVFwC |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 March 2017|isbn = 9780415911375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender essentialism is pervasive in popular culture, as illustrated by the #1 ''New York Times'' best seller ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus'', HarperCollins, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; but this essentialism is routinely critiqued in introductory women studies textbooks such as ''Women: Images &amp; Realities''.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"/&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, some feminist writers have put forward essentialist theories about gender and science. [[Evelyn Fox Keller]],&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Fox Keller, ''Reflections on Gender and Science'', Yale University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Harding]],
&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Harding, ''The Science Question in Feminism'', Cornell University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nancy Tuana]]
&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Tuana, ''The Less Noble Sex'', Indiana University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the modern scientific enterprise is inherently patriarchal and incompatible with women's nature.  Other feminist scholars, such as [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "A historian looks at gender and science," ''International Journal of Science Education'', vol. 9 (1987), p. 399-407.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenore Blum]],&lt;ref&gt;Lenore Blum, "AWM's first twenty years: The presidents' perspectives," in Bettye Anne Case and Anne M. Leggett, eds., ''Complexities: Women in Mathematics'', Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Gray (scholar)|Mary Gray]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Gray, "Gender and mathematics: Mythology and Misogyny," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Beth Ruskai,&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Ruskai, "Why women are discouraged from becoming scientists," ''The Scientist'', March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram&lt;ref&gt;Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram, "Introduction," ''Uneasy Careers and Intimate Lives: Women in Science, 1789-1979'', Rutgers University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized those theories for ignoring the diverse nature of scientific research and the tremendous variation in women's experiences in different cultures and historical periods.

== In historiography ==
Essentialism in history as a field of study entails discerning and listing essential cultural characteristics of a particular nation or culture, in the belief that a people or culture can be understood in this way. Sometimes such essentialism leads to claims of a praiseworthy national or cultural identity, or to its opposite, the condemnation of a culture based on presumed essential characteristics. [[Herodotus]], for example, claims that Egyptian culture is essentially feminized and possesses a "softness" which has made Egypt easy to conquer.&lt;ref&gt;DeLapp 177.&lt;/ref&gt; To what extent Herodotus was an essentialist is a matter of debate; he is also credited with not essentializing the concept of the Athenian identity,&lt;ref&gt;Lape 149-52.&lt;/ref&gt; or differences between the Greeks and the Persians that are the subject of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentialism had been operative in [[colonialism]] as well as in critiques of colonialism.

[[Postcolonialism|Post-colonial]] theorists such as [[Edward Said]] insisted that essentialism was the "defining mode" of "Western" historiography and ethnography until the nineteenth century and even after, according to [[Touraj Atabaki]], manifesting itself in the historiography of the Middle East and Central Asia as [[Eurocentrism]], over-generalization, and reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians reject essentialism because it "dehistoricizes the process of social and cultural changes" and tends to see non-Western societies as historically unchanging; in India this led to the anti-essentialist (even anti-historiographical) school of [[Subaltern Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo showing a boy jumping into a body of water. It is widely believed that humans make decisions (e.g. jumping in the water) based on free will.]]

'''Free will''' is the ability to [[Choice|choose]] between different possible courses of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;Omoregie, J. (2015).
 Freewill: The degree of freedom within. UK: Author House | {{ISBN|9781504987516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, Edward C. (1910). ''The Monist'', Vol. 20. Open Court. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free will is closely linked to the concepts of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[praise]], [[Culpability|guilt]], [[sin]], and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/area.12339|title = Demonic geographies| journal=Area| volume=49| issue=4| pages=503–509|year = 2017|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014.

Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C.

Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, ''had'' one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one ''could'' have done otherwise without physical impediment. Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

The underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions, and if so, what sort of control, and to what extent. These questions predate the early Greek [[Stoicism|stoics]] (for example, [[Chrysippus]]), and some modern philosophers lament the lack of progress over all these centuries.&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;

It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained to operate perfectly by [[physical law]].&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2–29 |author=Max Velmans |title=How Could Conscious Experiences Affect Brains? |url=http://cogprints.org/2750/ |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either [[causal closure]] or [[physical determinism]] ([[nomological determinism]]) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).

The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the ''problem of free will'' or sometimes referred to as the ''dilemma of determinism''.&lt;ref name=WJames&gt;{{cite book |title=The Will to believe, and other essays in popular philosophy |author=William James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2Tw28d-85wC&amp;pg=PA145 |pages=145 ''ff'' |chapter=The dilemma of determinism |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma leads to a [[morality|moral]] dilemma as well: the question of how to assign [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for actions if they are caused entirely by past events.&lt;ref name=Bargh&gt;

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003). "Can Conscious Experience affect brain Activity?", ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 10, nr. 12, pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt; Yet even with [[indeterminism|physical indeterminism]], arguments have been made against libertarianism in that it is difficult to assign ''Origination'' (responsibility for "free" indeterministic choices).

Free will here is predominately treated with respect to [[physical determinism]] in the strict sense of [[nomological determinism]], although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments /&gt; For example, logical and [[theological determinism|theological]] determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of [[destiny]] and [[fate]], and [[biological determinism|biological]], [[cultural determinism|cultural]] and [[psychological determinism|psychological]] determinism feed the development of compatibilist models. Separate classes of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]] may even be formed to represent these.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Zagzebski |first=Linda |editor=Edward N.

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|A [[domino effect|domino's movement]] is [[Determinism|determined]] completely by laws of physics.]]
[[Alexander Rosenberg|Alex Rosenberg]] makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; "If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Determinism#Quantum mechanics and classical physics|Physical determinism]] is currently disputed by prominent [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of [[quantum mechanics]], and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic [[indeterminism]] in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1"/&gt; The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested,&lt;ref name="Bohr"/&gt; even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–47 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main|Hard determinism}}
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy4.svg|thumb|A simplified [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and determinism.]]

Determinism can be divided into causal, logical and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="Parkinson2012"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=G. H. R. Parkinson|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqbJnEYKpW4C|accessdate=26 December 2012|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-00323-0|title=determinism|pages=891–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding to each of these different meanings, there arises a different problem for free will.&lt;ref name="Viv"&gt;Vihvelin, Kadri, "Arguments for Incompatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2003 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2003/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt; Hard determinism is the claim that [[determinism]] is true, and that it is [[incompatibilism|incompatible with free will]], so free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:
;[[Causal determinism]]: The idea that everything is caused by prior conditions, making it impossible for anything else to happen.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility /&gt; In its most common form, [[nomological determinism|nomological (or scientific) determinism]], future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]]. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;
The view of ''scientific determinism'' goes back to [[Pierre Simon Laplace|Laplace]]: "We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state." For further discussion see {{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia. N–Z, Indeks, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA197 |pages= 197 ''ff'' |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2006 |chapter=Determinism |isbn=0415939275 |editors=Sahotra Sarkar, Jessica Pfeifer, Justin Garson |author=John T Roberts}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Logical determinism]]: The notion that all [[proposition]]s, whether about the past, present or future, are either true or false. The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how choices can be free, given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present.&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt;
;[[Theological determinism]]: The idea that the future is already determined, either by a [[creator deity]] decreeing or [[omniscience|knowing]] its outcome in advance.&lt;ref name = "FischerGod1989"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''.

London: Luzac &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how our actions can be free if there is a being who has determined them for us in advance, or if they are already set in time.

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Suggestions have been made that hard determinism need not maintain strict determinism, where something near to, like that informally known as [[determinism|adequate determinism]], is perhaps more relevant.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

====Metaphysical libertarianism====
{{Main|Libertarianism (metaphysics)}}
[[File:FreewillConceptsBasedUponPhilosophyOfMindCausationViews.svg|thumb|Various definitions of free will that have been proposed for Metaphysical Libertarianism (agent/substance causal,&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories/&gt; centered accounts,&lt;ref name="Kane2005" /&gt; and efforts of will theory&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt;), along with examples of other common free will positions (Compatibilism,&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"/&gt; Hard Determinism,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and Hard Incompatibilism&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt;). Red circles represent mental states; blue circles represent physical states; arrows describe causal interaction.]]

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Centred accounts'' propose that for any given decision between two possibilities, the strength of reason will be considered for each option, yet there is still a probability the weaker candidate will be chosen.&lt;ref name=Kane2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BRiQgAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514970-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Balaguer1999&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark Balaguer |title=Libertarianism as a Scientifically Reputable View |journal= Philosophical Studies |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=189–211 |year=1999 |doi=10.1023/a:1004218827363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nozick1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nozick|title=Philosophical Explanations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4zH86WogYwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-66479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorabji1980&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Sorabji|title=Necessity, Cause, and Blame: Perspectives on Aristotle's Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8tmAAAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1980|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=978-0-7156-1549-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Inwagen1983&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Van Inwagen|title=An Essay on Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of1sJaUSdcYC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1983|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-824924-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiggins1973&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Honderich|title=Essays on Freedom of Action:Towards a Reasonable Libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qY9AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1973|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7100-7392-1|pages=33–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Searle2001&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality.&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indeterminism|Indeterministic]] physical models (particularly those involving [[quantum indeterminacy]]) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable,&lt;ref name=quantum&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |chapter=Libertarianism |author= Kane, Robert|page=9 |quote=It would seem that undetermined events in the brain or body would occur ''spontaneously'' and would be more likely to ''undermine'' our freedom rather than ''enhance'' it. |isbn=1405134860 |year=2007 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the [[neuroscience of free will]]. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality.&lt;ref name=Bohr1&gt;{{cite web |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Atomic Theory and the Fundamental Principles underlying the Description of Nature; ''Based on a lecture to the Scandinavian Meeting of Natural Scientists and published in Danish in Fysisk Tidsskrift in 1929.

It is also required that the agent's causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events. A number of problems have been identified with this view. Firstly, it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by ''luck'' (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.

::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====

[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H.

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N.

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}
{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T. (1651) ''Leviathan'' [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html#a_2025807 Chapter XXI.: "Of the liberty of subjects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122711/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }} (1968 edition). London: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In articulating this crucial proviso, [[David Hume]] writes, "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains."&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' Section VIII.: "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html#a_606067 Of liberty and necessity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122708/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }}" (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason. Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing&amp;nbsp;– the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages=487 ''ff'' |editor1=Ezequiel Morsella |editor2=John A.

{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages= 487 ''ff'' |editors=Ezequiel Morsella, John A.

Our findings suggest that the traditional folk notions of willpower and character strength have some legitimate basis in genuine phenomena.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza. (1998). ''Responsibility and Control: An Essay on Moral Responsibility''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001). "Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False and the Real Problem" in ''The Free Will Handbook'', edited by Robert Kane of the University of Texas. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as an illusion====
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|Spinoza thought that there is no free will.]]
:"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." [[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Ethics''&lt;ref name=Spinoza&gt;{{cite book |author= Benedict de Spinoza |year=2008 |chapter= Part III: On the origin and nature of the emotions; Postulates (Proposition II, Note) |editor= R.H.M.

David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely "verbal" issue. He suggested that it might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. Second edition. 1993. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] claimed that phenomena have no free will but the will as [[Noumena|noumenon]], is free.]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience.

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes....

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]). His view has been associated with both compatibilism and libertarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 2| issue = 2| page = 74| last = Staley| first = Kevin M.| title = Aquinas: Compatibilist or Libertarian| journal = The Saint Anselm Journal| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2005| url = http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151221073832/http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| archivedate = 2015-12-21| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hartung| first = Christopher| title = Thomas Aquinas on Free Will| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = May 2013| publisher = University of Delaware| url = http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/12979}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

Furthermore, there are always external constraints on the range of options we can meaningfully try to undertake. As the presence or absence of these conditions and constraints are not (usually) our responsibility, it is plausible that the central loci of our responsibility are our choices, or "willings".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will enters as follows: Free will is an "appetitive power", that is, not a cognitive power of intellect (the term "appetite" from Aquinas's definition "includes all forms of internal inclination").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01656a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Appetite |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that judgment "concludes and terminates counsel. Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the acceptation of the appetite [that is, the free-will]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1083.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Free-will (Prima Pars, Q. 83) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;

The free will problem – real or illusory |isbn=9780199733392 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.&lt;ref name=Libet&gt;

The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.&lt;ref name=Strother&gt;{{cite journal|title=The conscious experience of action and intention |author1=Lars Strother |author2=Sukhvinder Singh Obhi |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=198 |year=2009 |pages=535–39 |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1946-7 |url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |issue=4 |pmid=19641911 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217013640/http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosenbaum&gt;A brief discussion of possible interpretation of these results is found in {{cite book |title=Human Motor Control |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsFmds_ACBwC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86 |isbn=0123742269 |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |author=David A. Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. ''The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will''. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian G.

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.].

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]].

This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as [[proprioception]]), leading to attendant [[hallucination]]s and [[delusions of control]].&lt;ref name=frith&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00052-1 | last1 = Frith | first1 = CD | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = DM | title = Explaining the symptoms of schizophrenia: abnormalities in the awareness of action | journal = Brain Research.

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect. Of course, explaining to subjects exactly what the experimenter wants them to experience can bring its own problems–...instructions to attend to a particular internally generated experience can easily alter both the timing and the content of that experience and even whether or not it is consciously experienced at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.1083}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| pmid = 21149703| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson. A., (1994). ''Free Will and Determinism (FAD) scale''. Unpublished manuscript, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found that people consider acts more "free" when they involve a person opposing external forces, planning, or making random actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, T.F., R.F. Baumeister, F.D. Fincham, T.E. Joiner, N.M. Lambert, A.R. Mele, and D.M. Tice. 2008. Guilty, free, and wise. Belief in free will promotes learning from negative emotions. Manuscript in preparation.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the last behaviour, "random" actions, may not be possible; when participants attempt to perform tasks in a random manner (such as generating random numbers), their behaviour betrays many patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Hillel, M. 2007. Randomness is too important to trust to chance. Presented at the 2007 Summer Institute in Informed Patient Choice, Dartmouth Medical School, NH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wagenaar | first1 = W.

Taking into account all these personal variables existing in the debates over free will, Manuel Vargas has generally assumed that in fact “there is nearly always an unremarked upon elephant that lurks in rooms where philosophers discuss free will”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Manuel|date=2004|title=Libertarianism and Skepticism about Free Will|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=403–426|doi=10.5840/philtopics2004321/210|issn=0276-2080}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he particularly pointed to the role of (i)religion in motivating and sustaining various accounts of free will. As he put,&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that we would learn that a disproportionate number—perhaps even most—libertarians are religious and, especially, Christian. I suspect we would also learn that the overwhelming majority of compatibilists are atheist or agnostic. (I do not have a guess about the religious predilections of the various stripes of skeptical incompatibilists.) Even so, it may not be obvious why the religious beliefs of particular philosophers should matter. We could think that the arguments of the various partisans in free will debates should be judged on their merits, irrespective of whether or not they have religious motivation. However, systematically ignoring the role of religion can remove important considerations from view, considerations that affect how we think about, argue, and evaluate the various philosophical possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, by a detailed analysis of the writings and work of Arthur Eddington and Arthur Holy Compton in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and 1930s, one analysis clearly revealed not only a strong intrinsic religious motivation and specific conservative worldview concerns behind their own work on free will, but also similar personal, political and ideological factors, only of the opposite sign, in their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of 'Quantum Free Will': A Socio-Historical Analysis|volume=6|date=2018|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|series=Historical-Analytical Studies on Nature, Mind and Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J.

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

Baumeister and colleagues also note that volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of [[counterfactual thinking]].&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alquist, J.L., M. Daly, T. Stillman, and R.F. Baumeister, (2009). [Belief in determinism decreases counterfactual thinking].

Roese. 2008. The functional theory of counterfactual thinking. Personality and Social Psychology 12: 168–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results we would expect from increasing people's belief in fatalism.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Humanism}}
{{contains Hebrew text}}

'''Humanism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[ethics|ethical]] stance that emphasizes the value and [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] of [[Human|human beings]], individually and collectively, and generally prefers [[critical thinking]] and [[evidence]] ([[rationalism]] and  [[empiricism]]) over acceptance of [[dogma]] or [[superstition]]. The meaning of the term ''humanism'' has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it.&lt;ref name="What 2004"&gt;[[Nicolas Walter]]'s ''Humanism{{spaced ndash}}What's in the Word'' (London: [[Rationalist Press Association]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-301-97001-7}}) gives an account of the evolution of the meaning of the word ''humanism'' from the point of view of a modern [[secular humanist]]. A similar perspective, but somewhat less polemical, appears in [[Richard Norman]]'s ''On Humanism (Thinking in Action)'' (London: Routledge: 2004). For a historical and [[philological]]ly oriented view, see Vito Giustiniani's "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 46: 2 (April–June 1985): 167–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by theologian [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer|Friedrich Niethammer]] at the beginning of the [[19th century]] to refer to a system of education based on the study of classical literature ("classical humanism"). Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human [[freedom]] and progress. It views humans as solely responsible for the promotion and development of individuals and emphasizes a concern for man in relation to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, “Developing the Spirit of Patriotism and Humanism in Children for Peace and Harmony”, ''Children At Risk: Issues and Challenges'', Jesudason Jeyaraj (Ed.), Bangalore: CFCD/ISPCK, 2009, p.474&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, humanist movements are typically [[secular humanism|non-religious movements]] aligned with [[secularism]], and today humanism typically refers to a [[nontheism|nontheistic]] [[life stance]] centred on human agency and looking to [[science]] rather than [[revelation]] from a [[supernatural]] source to understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 2002 ''[[Amsterdam Declaration]]'' &lt;http://iheu.org/humanism/the-amsterdam-declaration/&gt; issued by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==

The word "humanism" is ultimately derived from the Latin concept ''[[humanitas]]''.  It entered English in the nineteenth century. However, historians agree that the concept predates the label invented to describe it, encompassing the various meanings ascribed to ''humanitas'', which included both benevolence toward one's fellow humans and the values imparted by ''bonae litterae'' or humane learning (literally "good letters").

In the second century AD, a Latin grammarian, [[Aulus Gellius]] (c.{{nbsp}}125{{snds}}c.{{nbsp}}180), complained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who have spoken Latin and have used the language correctly do not give to the word ''humanitas'' the meaning which it is commonly thought to have, namely, what the Greeks call φιλανθρωπία ([[philanthropy]]), signifying a kind of friendly spirit and good-feeling towards all men without distinction; but they gave to ''humanitas'' the force of the Greek παιδεία ([[paideia]]); that is, what we call ''eruditionem institutionemque in bonas artes'', or "education and training in the [[liberal arts]]". Those who earnestly desire and seek after these are most highly humanized. For the desire to pursue of that kind of knowledge, and the training given by it, has been granted to humanity alone of all the animals, and for that reason it is termed ''humanitas'', or "humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/13*.html Aulus Gellius], ''Attic Nights'', XIII: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gellius says that in his day ''humanitas'' is commonly used as a synonym for [[philanthropy]]{{snds}}or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human beings. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call "humane" or "polite" learning, or the Greek equivalent [[Paideia]]. Yet in seeking to restrict the meaning of ''humanitas'' to literary education this way, Gellius was not advocating a retreat from political engagement into some ivory tower, though it might look like that to us. He himself was involved in public affairs. According to legal historian Richard Bauman, Gellius was a judge as well as a grammarian and was an active participant the great contemporary debate on harsh punishments that accompanied the legal reforms of [[Antoninus Pius]] (one these reforms,  for example, was that a prisoner was not to be treated as guilty before being tried). "By assigning pride of place to Paideia in his comment on the etymology of ''humanitas'', Gellius implies that the trained mind is best equipped to handle the problems troubling society."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge Classical Monographs [1999]), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gellius's writings fell into obscurity during the Middle Ages, but during the Italian Renaissance, Gellius became a favorite author. Teachers and scholars of Greek and Latin grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and poetry were called and called themselves "humanists".&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Nicholas |title=The Origins of Humanism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=1–2 |quote=The term ''umanista'' was used, in fifteenth century Italian academic jargon to describe a teacher or student of classical literature including that of grammar and rhetoric. The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with a similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford-renaissance"&gt;''Humanissime vir'', "most humane man", was the usual Latin way to address scholars. (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 168.)&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars, however, point out that [[Cicero]] (106{{snds}}43{{nbsp}}BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term ''humanitas'', in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;There was a time when men wandered about in the manner of wild beasts. They conducted their affairs without the least guidance of reason but instead relied on bodily strength. There was no divine religion and the understanding of social duty was in no way cultivated. No one recognized the value inherent in an equitable code of law.(Cicero, ''De Inventione'', I. I: 2, quoted in Quentin Skinner, ''Visions of Politics, Volume 2:  Renaissance Virtues'' [Cambridge University Press, 2002], p. 54.)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''humanitas'' included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, ''humanism'', which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to a method of study and debate involving an accepted group of authors and a careful and accurate use of language.&lt;ref&gt;A noted authority on the subject, [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], identified Renaissance humanism as a cultural and literary movement, which in its substance was not philosophical but which had important philosophical implications and consequences." "I have been unable to discover in the humanist literature any common philosophical doctrine," he wrote, "except a belief in the value of man and the humanities and in the revival of ancient learning." (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought: The Classic, Scholastic, and Humanist Strains'' [New York, Harper and Row, 1961], p. 9). As the late Jacques Barzun has written:&lt;blockquote&gt;The path between the onset of the good letters and the modern humanist as freethinker or simply as scholar is circuitous but unbroken. If we look for what is common to the Humanists over the centuries we find two things: a body of accepted authors and a method of carrying on study and debate. The two go together with the belief that the best guides to the good life are [[Reason]] and [[Nature]]. (Jacques Barzun, ''From Dawn to Decadence :500 years of Western Cultural Life'' [New York: HarperCollins, 2000], p. 45)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], and soon after, in Germany (by the [[Left Hegelians]]), ''humanism'' began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind, without attention to the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] or  [[supernatural]]. The designation [[Religious Humanism]] refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is similar to [[Protestantism]], although centered on human needs, interests, and abilities rather than the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genesis of a Humanist Manifesto | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/edwin_wilson/manifesto/ch2.html | accessdate=14 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglophone world, such modern, organized forms of humanism, which are rooted in the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with [[Classics|classical learning]] and the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]].

The first ''[[Humanist Manifesto I|Humanist Manifesto]]'' was issued by a conference held at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Who_We_Are/About_Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |title=Text of Humanist Manifesto I |publisher=Americanhumanist.org |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107221355/http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |archivedate=7 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories included the philosopher [[John Dewey]], but the majority were ministers (chiefly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]) and [[Academic theology|theologians]]. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses [[reason]], [[ethics]], and [[social justice|social and economic justice]], and they called for science to replace [[Dogma#In religion|dogma]] and the [[supernatural]] as the basis of [[morality]] and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Although a distinction has often been drawn between secular and religious humanism, the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and similar organizations prefer to describe their life stance without qualification as 'Humanism'. See Nicolas Walter,  ''Humanism: What's in the Word?'' (London: RPA/BHA/Secular Society Ltd, 1937), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanism is Eight Letters, No More|url=http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more|authors=Harold Blackham, Levi Fragell, Corliss Lamont, Harry Stopes-Roe,  Rob Tielman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Isola di Utopia Moro.jpg|thumb|An ideal society as conceived by Renaissance humanist Saint [[Thomas More]] in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'']]

In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]] coined the term ''Humanismus'' to describe the new [[Classics|classical curriculum]] he planned to offer in German secondary schools,&lt;ref&gt;Niethammer's book was entitled ''Der Streit des Philanthropinismus und des Humanismus in der Theorie des Erziehungs-Unterrichts unsrer Zeit'' (''The Dispute between Philanthropinism and Humanism in the Educational Theory of our Time''), which directly echoes Aulus Gellius's distinction between "philanthropy" and humane learning. Neithammer and other distinguished members of the movement they called "Neo-Humanism" (who included [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]), felt that the curriculum imposed under Napoleon's occupation of Germany had been excessively oriented toward the practical and vocational. They wished to encourage individuals to practice life-long self cultivation and reflection, based on a study of the artistic, philosophical, and cultural masterpieces of (primarily) Greek civilization.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1836 the word "humanism" had been absorbed into the English language in this sense. The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856, when German historian and philologist [[Georg Voigt]] used ''humanism'' to describe [[Renaissance humanism]], the movement that flourished in the Italian [[Renaissance]] to revive classical learning, a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations, especially Italy.&lt;ref name="See 1877"&gt;As J. A. Symonds remarked, "the word humanism has a German sound and is in fact modern" (See ''The Renaissance in Italy'' Vol. 2:71 n, 1877). Vito Giustiniani writes that in the German-speaking world "Humanist" while keeping its specific meaning (as scholar of Classical literature) "gave birth to further derivatives, such as ''humanistisch'' for those schools which later were to be called ''humanistische Gymnasien'', with Latin and Greek as the main subjects of teaching (1784). Finally, ''Humanismus'' was introduced to denote 'classical education in general' (1808) and still later for the epoch and the achievements of the Italian humanists of the fifteenth century (1841). This is to say that 'humanism' for 'classical learning' appeared first in Germany, where it was once and for all sanctioned in this meaning by Georg Voigt (1859)". (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 172.)&lt;/ref&gt;

But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of "The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing".&lt;ref&gt;"''L'amour général de l'humanité ... vertu qui n'a point de nom parmi nous et que nous oserions appeler 'humanisme', puisqu'enfin il est temps de créer un mot pour une chose si belle et nécessaire''"; from the review ''Ephémérides du citoyen ou Bibliothèque raisonée des sciences morales et politiques'', Chapter 16 (Dec, 17, 1765): 247, quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175, note 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots "philanthropic" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the [[French Revolution]], the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ''[[philosophes]]'' such as [[Rousseau]], was violently attacked by influential religious and political [[Conservatism|conservatives]], such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]], as a deification or idolatry of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Although Rousseau himself devoutly believed in a personal God, his book, ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'', does attempt to demonstrate that atheists can be virtuous. It was publicly burned. During the Revolution, [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] instituted a cult of the Supreme Being along lines suggested by Rousseau. In the 19th-century French positivist philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) founded a "religion of humanity", whose calendar and catechism echoed the former Revolutionary cult. See [[Comtism]]&lt;/ref&gt; Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' records the use of the word "humanism" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the "mere humanity" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Deists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to [[circle the wagons]] and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist [[Proudhon]] (best known for declaring that "[[property is theft]]") used the word "humanism" to describe a "''culte, déification de l’humanité''" ("worship,  deification of humanity") and [[Ernest Renan]] in ''L’avenir de la science: pensées de 1848'' ("The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848") (1848–49), states: "It is my deep conviction that pure ''humanism'' will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity{{mdash}}all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value."&lt;ref&gt;''"Ma conviction intime est que la religion de l'avenir sera le pur'' humanisme, ''c’est-à-dire le culte de tout ce qui est de l'homme, la vie entière santifiée et éléve a une valeur moral"''. quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, the word "humanism" as a philosophy centred on humankind (as opposed to institutionalised religion) was also being used in Germany by the [[Left Hegelians]], [[Arnold Ruge]], and [[Karl Marx]], who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the German government. There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms:&lt;ref name="What 2004"/&gt; philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists.

===Predecessors===

====Ancient South Asia====

Human-centered philosophy that rejected the supernatural may also be found circa 1500 BCE in the [[Cārvāka|Lokayata]] system of Indian philosophy. [[Nasadiya Sukta]], a passage in the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], contains one of the first recorded assertions of agnosticism.
In the 6th-century BCE, [[Gautama Buddha]] expressed, in [[Pali literature]] a skeptical attitude toward the supernatural:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesson 1: A brief history of humanist thought|url=http://humanisteducation.com/class.html?module_id=1&amp;page=1|work= Introduction to Humanism: A Primer on the History, Philosophy, and Goals of Humanism|publisher=The Continuum of Humanist Education|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since neither soul, nor aught belonging to soul, can really and truly exist, the view which holds that this I who am 'world', who am 'soul', shall hereafter live permanent, persisting, unchanging, yea abide eternally: is not this utterly and entirely a foolish doctrine?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the [[Gathas]] of [[Zarathustra]], composed between 1,000{{nbsp}}BCE{{snds}}600{{nbsp}}BCE&lt;ref&gt;"Principles of Integral Science of Religion", By Georg Schmid, p. 109, 'As an Example: Yasna 32:8', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Greater Iran]]. Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings, dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from [[Ahura Mazda]] (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening [[Deism|deistic]] god or [[Great Architect of the Universe]] was combined with a unique eschatology and ethical system which implied that each person is held morally responsible in the afterlife, for their choices they freely made in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Behavior and Good Thinking|url=http://www.zarathushtra.com/z/article/dgm/vol1.htm#volume1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This importance placed upon thought, action and personal responsibility, and the concept of a non-intervening creator, was a source of inspiration to a number of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] humanist thinkers in Europe such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]].

====Ancient Greece====
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}

6th-century [[BCE]] [[pre-Socratic]] Greek philosophers [[Thales of Miletus]] and [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] were the first in the region to attempt to explain the world in terms of human reason rather than myth and tradition, thus can be said to be the first Greek humanists. Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe. These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm. [[Anaxagoras]] brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens. [[Pericles]], the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras. Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include [[Protagoras]] (like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles), known for his famous dictum "man is the measure of all things" and [[Democritus]], who proposed that matter was composed of atoms. Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers, principally [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. The historian [[Thucydides]], noted for his scientific and rational approach to history, is also much admired by later humanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Potter |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Francis Potter |title=Humanism A new Religion |pages=64–69 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1930}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BCE, [[Epicurus]] became known for his concise phrasing of the [[problem of evil]], lack of belief in the afterlife, and human-centred approaches to achieving [[eudaimonia]]. He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule.

====Medieval Islam====
{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy}}

Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued humanistic, [[Rationalism|rational]] and scientific [[discourse]]s in their search for knowledge, meaning and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. A wide range of Islamic writings on love, poetry, history and [[philosophical theology]] show that medieval Islamic thought was open to the humanistic ideas of [[individualism]], occasional [[secularism]], [[skepticism]], and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, another reason the Islamic world flourished during the Middle Ages was an early emphasis on [[freedom of speech]], as summarised by al-Hashimi (a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]]) in the following letter to one of the religious opponents he was attempting to [[Religious conversion|convert]] through [[reason]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |first=I.

According to George Makdisi, certain aspects of [[Renaissance humanism]] has its roots in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], including the "art of ''[[Dictation (exercise)|dictation]]'', called in Latin, ''[[ars dictaminis]]''", and "the humanist attitude toward [[classical language]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Makdisi |first=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |date=April–June 1989 |pages=175–82 |doi=10.2307/604423 |publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 109, No. 2 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |jstor=604423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}

[[File:Ritratto di francesco petrarca, altichiero, 1376 circa, padova.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Petrarch]] painted in 1376]]

Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern]] period. The 19th-century German historian [[Georg Voigt]] (1827–91) identified [[Petrarch]] as the first Renaissance humanist. [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] agrees that Petrarch was "the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness". According to Petrarch, what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors. For Petrarch and [[Boccaccio]], the greatest master was [[Cicero]], whose prose became the model for both learned (Latin) and vernacular (Italian) prose.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once the language was mastered grammatically it could be used to attain the second stage, eloquence or rhetoric. This art of persuasion [Cicero had held] was not art for its own sake, but the acquisition of the capacity to persuade others – all men and women – to lead the good life. As Petrarch put it, 'it is better to will the good than to know the truth'. Rhetoric thus led to and embraced philosophy. [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c.{{nbsp}}1369–1444), the outstanding scholar of the new generation, insisted that it was Petrarch who "opened the way for us to show how to acquire learning", but it was in Bruni's time that the word ''umanista'' first came into use, and its subjects of study were listed as five: grammar, rhetoric, poetry, moral philosophy, and history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |pages=32–34 and 37 |isbn=0-679-64086-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Salutati.jpg|thumb|Coluccio Salutati, Chancellor of Florence and disciple of Petrarch (1331–1406)]]

The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). One of Petrarch's followers, [[Coluccio Salutati]] (1331–1406) was made chancellor of [[Florence]], "whose interests he defended with his literary skill. The Visconti of Milan claimed that Salutati’s pen had done more damage than 'thirty squadrons of Florentine cavalry'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gianfrancesco Poggio Bracciolini - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459), an early Renaissance humanist, book collector, and reformer of script, who served as papal secretary&lt;ref&gt;Following an old engraving; from Alfred Gudeman, ''Imagines philologorum: 160 bildnisse...'' ("Portraits of Philologists, 160 prints"), (Leipzig/Berlin) 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Contrary to a still widely held interpretation that originated in Voigt's celebrated contemporary, [[Jacob Burckhardt]],&lt;ref&gt;The influence of Jacob Burckhardt's classic masterpiece of cultural history, [[The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy]] (1860) on subsequent Renaissance historiography is traced in Wallace K. Ferguson's ''The Renaissance in Historical Thought: Five Centuries of Historical Interpretation'' (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; and which was adopted wholeheartedly – especially by modern thinkers calling themselves "humanists" – &lt;ref&gt;For example the ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,'' adhering to the tenacious 19th-century narrative of the Renaissance as a complete break with the past established in 1860 by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], describes the liberating effects of the re-discovery of classical writings this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, one felt no weight of the supernatural pressing on the human mind, demanding homage and allegiance. Humanity{{mdash}}with all its distinct capabilities, talents, worries, problems, possibilities{{mdash}}was the centre of interest. It has been said that medieval thinkers philosophised on their knees, but, bolstered by the new studies, they dared to stand up and to rise to full stature.{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia="The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Second Edition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; most specialists today do not characterise Renaissance humanism as a philosophical movement, nor in any way as anti-Christian or even anti-clerical. A modern historian has this to say:

{{quote|text=Humanism was not an ideological programme but a body of literary knowledge and linguistic skill based on the "revival of good letters", which was a revival of a late-antique philology and grammar, This is how the word "humanist" was understood by contemporaries, and if scholars would agree to accept the word in this sense rather than in the sense in which it was used in the nineteenth century we might be spared a good deal of useless argument. That humanism had profound social and even political consequences of the life of Italian courts is not to be doubted. But the idea that as a movement it was in some way inimical to the Church, or to the conservative social order in general is one that has been put forward for a century and more without any substantial proof being offered.&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;The nineteenth-century historian Jacob Burckhardt, in his classic work, ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', noted as a "curious fact" that some men of the new culture were "men of the strictest piety, or even ascetics". If he had meditated more deeply on the meaning of the careers of such humanists as Abrogio Traversari (1386–1439), the General of the Camaldolese Order, perhaps he would not have gone on to describe humanism in unqualified terms as "pagan", and thus helped precipitate a century of infertile debate about the possible existence of something called "Christian humanism" which ought to be opposed to "pagan humanism".|author=Peter Partner|source=''Renaissance Rome, Portrait of a Society 1500–1559'' (University of California Press 1979) pp. 14–15.}}

The ''umanisti'' criticised what they considered the barbarous Latin of the universities, but the revival of the humanities largely did not conflict with the teaching of traditional university subjects, which went on as before.&lt;ref&gt;

"The term ''umanista'' was associated with the revival of the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'' "which included ''grammatica'', ''rhetorica'', poetics, ''historia'', and ''philosophia moralis'', as these terms were understood. Unlike the liberal arts of the eighteenth century, they did not include the visual arts, music, dancing or gardening. The humanities also failed to include the disciplines that were the chief subjects of instruction at the universities during the Later Middle Ages and throughout the Renaissance, such as theology, jurisprudence, and medicine, and the philosophical disciplines other than ethics, such as logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics. In other words, humanism does not represent, as often believed, the sum total of Renaissance thought and learning, but only a well-defined sector of it. Humanism has its proper domain or home territory in the humanities, whereas all other areas of learning, including philosophy (apart from ethics), followed their own course, largely determined by their medieval tradition and by their steady transformation through new observations, problems, or theories. These disciplines were affected by humanism mainly from the outside and in an indirect way, though often quite strongly". ([[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113–14, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' [1990].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor did the humanists view themselves as in conflict with Christianity. Some, like Salutati, were the Chancellors of Italian cities, but the majority (including Petrarch) were ordained as priests, and many worked as senior officials of the Papal court. Humanist Renaissance popes [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]], [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]], and [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] wrote books and amassed huge libraries.&lt;ref&gt;See their respective entries in Sir John Hale's ''Concise Encyclopaedia of the Italian Renaissance'' (Oxford University Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], in fact, there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity, including the writings of the Church fathers, the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels, and in some cases even the Jewish [[Kabbalah]], would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement.&lt;ref&gt;To later generations, the Dutch humanist, [[Desiderius Erasmus]], epitomised this reconciling tendency). According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "[[European Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers remembered Erasmus (not quite accurately) as a precursor of modern intellectual freedom and a foe of both Protestant and Catholic dogmatism". [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/erasmus/. Erasmus himself was not much interested in the Kabbalah, but several other humanists were, notably Pico della Mirandola]. See [[Christian Kabbalah]].)&lt;/ref&gt; With this end in view, Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bergin |first1=Thomas |last2=Speake |first2=Jennifer |title=The Encyclopedia of the Renaissance |year=1987 |publisher=Facts On File Publications |location=Oxford |pages=216–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Only thirteen of Pico della Mirandola's nine hundred theses were thought theologically objectionable by the papal commission that examined them.... [This] suggests that, in spite of his publicly expressed contempt in his ''Apologia'' for their intellectual inadequacies, the Curial authorities hardly saw these theses as the work of a dangerous theological modernist like Luther or Calvin. Unorthodox though they were, most of the issues raised in them had been the subject of theological dispute for centuries and the commission ... condemned him not for innovations but for 'reviving several of the errors of gentile philosophers which are already disproved and obsolete'". Davies (1997), p 103.&lt;/ref&gt; One humanist, the [[Greek Orthodox]] Platonist [[Gemistus Pletho]] (1355–1452), based in [[Mystras]], Greece (but in contact with humanists in Florence, Venice, and Rome) taught a Christianised version of pagan [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Popkin]] (editor), ''The Columbia History of Western Philosophy'' (1998), pp. 293, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Back to the sources====

[[File:Quentin Massys- Erasmus of Rotterdam.JPG|thumb|Portrait of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]

The humanists' close study of [[Latin]] literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods. By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ''[[ad fontes]]'', or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning, seeking out manuscripts of [[Patristic]] literature as well as pagan authors. In 1439, while employed in [[Naples]] at the court of [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] (at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States) the humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] used stylistic textual analysis, now called [[philology]], to prove that the [[Donation of Constantine]], which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery.&lt;ref&gt;More than 100 years earlier, Dante in the [[Divine Comedy]] (c. 1308–1321) had pinpointed the Donation of Constantine (which he accepted as genuine) as a great mistake and the cause of all the political and religious problems of Italy, including the corruption of the Church. Although Dante had thunderously attacked the idea that the Church could have temporal as well as spiritual powers, it remained to Valla to conclusively prove that the legal justification for such powers was spurious.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way. Instead, after the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Hermeticism]], hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches, and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically, it was a humanist scholar, [[Isaac Casaubon]], in the 17th century, who would use philology to show that the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] was not of great antiquity, as had been asserted in the 4th century by [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Lactantius]], but dated from the Christian era. See Anthony Grafton, ''Defenders of the Text: The Traditions of Scholarship in an Age of Science, 1450–1800'' (Harvard University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts, not only of Plato and Aristotle, but also of the Christian Gospels, previously unavailable in the Latin West.

After 1517, when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available, the Dutch humanist [[Erasmus]], who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of [[Aldus Manutius]], began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla, comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter. Erasmus, along with the French humanist [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]], began issuing new translations, laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Henceforth Renaissance humanism, particularly in the German North, became concerned with religion, while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists, studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith. After the Reformation, critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called [[Higher criticism]] of the 19th-century German [[Tübingen school]].

====Consequences====

The ''ad fontes'' principle also had many applications. The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as [[Epicureanism]], and [[Neoplatonism]], whose Pagan wisdom the humanists, like the Church fathers of old, tended, at least initially, to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion|volume=F-N|page=1733|publisher=Corpus Publications|year=1979|isbn=0-9602572-1-7}} "Renaissance humanists rejoiced in the mutual compatibility of much ancient philosophy and Christian truths", M. A. Screech, ''Laughter at the Foot of the Cross'' (1997), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The line from a drama of [[Terence]], ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto'' (or with ''nil'' for ''nihil''), meaning "I am a human being, I think nothing human alien to me",&lt;ref&gt;''Homo'' in Latin specifically means "human being", in contrast to ''vir'', "man", and ''mulier'', "woman": Annabel Robinson, ''The Life and Work of Jane Ellen Harrison'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 206; Tore Janson, ''A Natural History of Latin'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 281; Timothy J. Moore, ''Roman Theatre'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 62 (note to the line in Terence); as a "watchword" for humanists, ''Humanism and the Humanities in the Twenty-First Century'', edited by William S. Haney and Peter Malekin (Associated University Presses, 2001), p. 171; similar ''homo sum'' declaration by Seneca, James Ker, ''The Deaths of Seneca'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine, gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude. The statement, in a play modeled or borrowed from a (now lost) Greek comedy by Menander, may have originated in a lighthearted vein{{snds}}as a comic rationale for an old man's meddling{{snds}}but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning, by Cicero and Saint Augustine, to name a few, and most notably by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Richard Bauman writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto.'', I am a human being: and I deem nothing pertaining to humanity is foreign to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words of the comic playwright P.{{nbsp}}Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond. Terence, an African and a former slave, was well placed to preach the message of universalism, of the essential unity of the human race, that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks, but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality. The influence of Terence's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated. Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is one short rule that should regulate human relationships. All that you see, both divine and human, is one. We are parts of the same great body. Nature created us from the same source and to the same end. She imbued us with mutual affection and sociability, she taught us to be fair and just, to suffer injury rather than to inflict it. She bid us extend our hands to all in need of help. Let that well-known line be in our heart and on our lips: ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto''." &lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science (see the [[history of science in the Renaissance]]). This was despite what [[A. C. Crombie]] (viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress) calls "a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity", in which Platonism stood in opposition to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] concentration on the observable properties of the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Crombie]], ''Historians and the Scientific Revolution'', p. 456 in ''Science, Art and Nature in Medieval and Modern Thought'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.

Just as artist and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]]{{snds}}partaking of the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' though not himself a humanist{{snds}}advocated study of human [[anatomy]], nature, and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art, so Spanish-born humanist [[Juan Luis Vives]] (c. 1493–1540) advocated observation, craft, and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities, helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gottlieb |first=Anthony |title=The Dream of Reason: a history of western philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=410–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to [[natural philosophy]], based on [[empiricism|empirical]] observations and experimentation of the physical universe, making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alleby |first=Brad |title=Humanism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Religion |volume=1 |edition=2nd |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |year=2003 |pages=426–28 |isbn=0-02-865705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in education that the humanists' program had the most lasting results, their curriculum and methods:

&lt;blockquote&gt;were followed everywhere, serving as models for the Protestant Reformers as well as the Jesuits. The humanistic school, animated by the idea that the study of classical languages and literature provided valuable information and intellectual discipline as well as moral standards and a civilised taste for future rulers, leaders, and professionals of its society, flourished without interruption, through many significant changes, until our own century, surviving many religious, political and social revolutions. It has but recently been replaced, though not yet completely, by other more practical and less demanding forms of education.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeller, "Humanism" in ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===From Renaissance to modern humanism===

Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith (see [[Christian Humanism]]). They inveighed against the abuses of the Church, but not against the Church itself, much less against religion. For them, the word [[Secularism#Overview|"secular"]] carried no connotations of disbelief{{snds}}that would come later, in the nineteenth century. In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery. Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own (although Petrarch himself was in [[Minor Orders]] and was employed by the Church all his life). He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue, inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer. By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base,&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the methods of the humanists, combined with their eloquence, would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet it was from the Renaissance that modern Secular Humanism grew, with the development of an important split between reason and religion. This occurred as the church's complacent authority was exposed in two vital areas. In science, Galileo's support of the Copernican revolution upset the church's adherence to the theories of Aristotle, exposing them as false. In theology, the Dutch scholar Erasmus with his new Greek text showed that the Roman Catholic adherence to Jerome's Vulgate was frequently in error. A tiny wedge was thus forced between reason and authority, as both of them were then understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Os Guinness]], ''The Dust of Death: A Critique of the Establishment and the Counter Culture and the Proposal for a Third Way'' (Intervarsity Press, 1973) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For some, this meant turning back to the Bible as the source of authority instead of the Catholic Church, for others it was a split from theism altogether. This was the main divisive line between the Reformation and the Renaissance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with the same basic problems, supported the same science based on reason and empirical research, but had a different set of presuppositions (theistic versus naturalistic).&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"/&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===

The phrase the "religion of humanity" is sometimes attributed to American [[Founding Father]] [[Thomas Paine]], though as yet unattested in his surviving writings. According to Tony Davies: &lt;blockquote&gt;Paine called himself a ''theophilanthropist'', a word combining the Greek for "God", "love", and "humanity", and indicating that while he believed in the existence of a creating intelligence in the universe, he entirely rejected the claims made by and for all existing religious doctrines, especially their miraculous, transcendental and salvationist pretensions. The Parisian "Society of Theophilanthropy" which he sponsored, is described by his biographer as "a forerunner of the ethical and humanist societies that proliferated later" ... [Paine's book] the trenchantly witty ''Age of Reason'' (1793) ... pours scorn on the supernatural pretensions of scripture, combining Voltairean mockery with Paine's own style of taproom ridicule to expose the absurdity of a theology built on a collection of incoherent Levantine folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) pp.{{nbsp}}26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davies identifies Paine's '' [[The Age of Reason]]'' as "the link between the two major narratives of what [[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;In [[The Postmodern Condition|La Condition postmoderne]]&lt;/ref&gt; calls the narrative of legitimation": the rationalism of the 18th-century ''[[Philosophes]]'' and the radical, historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the [[Hegelian]]s [[David Friedrich Strauss]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. "The first is political, largely French in inspiration, and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty'. The second is philosophical, German, seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge, and stresses ''understanding'' rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation. The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond, and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homo homini deus est'' ("The human being  is a god to humanity" or "god is nothing [other than] the human being to himself"), Feuerbach had written.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian novelist Mary Ann Evans, known to the world as [[George Eliot]], translated Strauss's ''Das Leben Jesu'' (''"The Life of Jesus"'', 1846) and Ludwig Feuerbach's ''Das Wesen Christianismus'' ("The Essence of Christianity"). She wrote to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the fellowship between man and man which has been the principle of development, social and moral, is not dependent on conceptions of what is not man ... the idea of God, so far as it has been a high spiritual influence, is the ideal of goodness entirely human (i.e., an exaltation of the human).&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliot and her circle, who included her companion [[George Henry Lewes]] (the biographer of [[Goethe]]) and the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] and social theorist [[Harriet Martineau]], were much influenced by the positivism of [[Auguste Comte]], whom Martineau had translated. Comte had proposed an atheistic ''culte'' founded on human principles{{snds}}a secular [[Religion of Humanity]] (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organised around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)". According to Davies (pp. 28–29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to "''vivre pour altrui''" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]"),&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and [[Matthew Arnold]] to [[Thomas Hardy]].

The British Humanistic Religious Association was formed as one of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered Humanist organisations in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership, and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Morain |first1=Lloyd |last2=Morain |first2=Mary |title=Humanism as the Next Step |publisher=Humanist Press |year=2007 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=109 |url=http://aha-files.s3.amazonaws.com/63/226/Hum_as_the_Next_Step.pdf |isbn=978-0931779091 |lccn=97-74611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1877, the word was used pejoratively, apparently for the first time in America, to describe [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]]. Adler, however, did not embrace the term, and instead coined the name "[[Ethical Culture]]" for his new movement {{snds}}a movement which still exists in the now Humanist-affiliated New York Society for Ethical Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysec.org/sitemap/about-ethical-culture/history/ |title=History: New York Society for Ethical Culture |accessdate=6 March 2009 |year=2008 |publisher=New York Society for Ethical Culture }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ethical Culture Leaders wrote: "Today, the historic identification, Ethical Culture, and the modern description, Ethical Humanism, are used interchangeably."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical Culture |publisher=American Ethical Union |url=http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf |accessdate=23 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226081725/http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf|archive-date=26 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active in the early 1920s, [[F.C.S. Schiller]] labelled his work "humanism" but for Schiller the term referred to the [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophy he shared with [[William James]]. In 1929, [[Charles Francis Potter]] founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included [[Julian Huxley]], [[John Dewey]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Thomas Mann]]. Potter was a minister from the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] tradition and in 1930 he and his wife, Clara Cook Potter, published ''Humanism: A New Religion''. Throughout the 1930s, Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as, [[women’s rights]], access to [[birth control]], "civil divorce laws", and an end to capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stringer-Hye |first=Richard |title=Charles Francis Potter |work=Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Historical Society |url=http://wWorldWarII5.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charlesfrancispotter.html |accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond B. Bragg]], the associate editor of ''The New Humanist'', sought to consolidate the input of [[Leon Milton Birkhead]], [[Charles Francis Potter]], and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference. Bragg asked [[Roy Wood Sellars]] to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' in 1933. Potter's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism, the latter declaring a new religion by saying, "any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age. To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present." It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion.

In 1941, the [[American Humanist Association]] was organised. Noted members of The AHA included [[Isaac Asimov]], who was the president from 1985 until his death in 1992, and writer [[Kurt Vonnegut]], who followed as honorary president until his death in 2007. [[Gore Vidal]] became honorary president in 2009. [[Robert Buckman]] was the head of the association in Canada, and is now an honorary president.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

After World War II, three prominent Humanists became the first directors of major divisions of the United Nations: [[Julian Huxley]] of [[UNESCO]], [[Brock Chisholm]] of the [[World Health Organization]], and [[John Boyd-Orr]] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html American Humanist Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020812090133/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |date=12 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[American Humanist Association]], along with other groups representing agnostics, atheists, and other freethinkers, joined to create the [[Secular Coalition for America]] which advocates in Washington, D.C., for [[separation of church and state]] and nationally for the greater acceptance of nontheistic Americans. The Executive Director of Secular Coalition for America is Larry T. Decker.

====Renaissance humanists====
{{main|Renaissance humanism}}

"Renaissance humanism" is the name later given to a tradition of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors, book collectors, educators, and writers, who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as ''umanisti''{{snds}}"humanists".&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries, and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education, which was then dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and logic. [[Scholasticism]] focused on preparing men to be doctors, lawyers or professional theologians, and was taught from approved textbooks in logic, natural philosophy, medicine, law and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; There were important centres of humanism at [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].

Humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it. They sought to create a citizenry (frequently including women) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the [[Middle Ages]], not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group. (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' [New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965], p. 178.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; See also Kristeller's ''Renaissance Thought I'', "Humanism and Scholasticism In the Italian Renaissance", ''Byzantion'' 17 (1944–45):  346–74. Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; As a program to revive the cultural{{snds}}and particularly the literary{{snds}}legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity, Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] or [[Erasmus]] as is still sometimes popularly believed.&lt;ref&gt;Vito Giustiniani gives as an example of an out-dated, but still pervasive view, that of Corliss Lamont, who described Renaissance Humanism as, "first and foremost a revolt against the otherworldliness of mediaeval Christianity, a turning away from preoccupation with personal immortality to make the best of life in this world. Renaissance writers like Rabelais and Erasmus gave eloquent voice to this new joy of living and to the sheer exuberance of existence. For the Renaissance the ideal human being was no longer the ascetic monk, but a new type – the universal man  the many-sided personality delighting in every kind of this-earthly achievements. The great Italian artists, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, typified this ideal." (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism": 192.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Happyman.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.25|The Humanist "happy human" logo]]

Secular humanism is a comprehensive [[life stance]] or [[world view]] which embraces human [[reason]], [[metaphysical naturalism]], [[altruism|altruistic]] [[morality]] and [[distributive justice]], and consciously rejects [[supernatural]] claims, [[ethical monotheism|theistic]] [[faith]] and [[religiosity]], [[pseudoscience]], and [[superstition]].&lt;ref name="americanhumanist"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edwords |first=Fred |title=What Is Humanism? |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/What_is_Humanism |year=1989 |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=19 August 2009 |quote=Secular Humanism is an outgrowth of eighteenth century enlightenment rationalism and nineteenth century freethought... Secular and Religious Humanists both share the same worldview and the same basic principles... From the standpoint of philosophy alone, there is no difference between the two.

I, New York: Oxford University Press 2013, ch. 6 (pp. 115{{ndash}}48)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humaniststudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of humanism (subsection)|publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies|url=http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |accessdate=16 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118050402/http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html|archive-date=18 January 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as Humanism (with a capital H and no [[grammatical modifier|qualifying]] adjective).

The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] ([[IHEU]]) is the world union of 117 Humanist, rationalist, [[irreligious]], [[atheistic]], [[Brights movement|Bright]], [[secular]], [[Ethical movement|Ethical Culture]], and [[freethought]] organisations in 38 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iheu.org/story/humanist-movement-hits-new-high-membership |title=Humanist movement hits new high in membership. |publisher=iheu.org |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Happy Human]]" is the official symbol of the IHEU as well as being regarded as a universally recognised symbol for secular humanism.

According to the IHEU's bylaw 5.1:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/bylaws |title=IHEU's Bylaws |accessdate=5 July 2008 |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the [[natural and legal rights|right]] and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not [[theism|theistic]], and it does not accept [[supernatural]] views of reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Religious humanists====
{{main|Religious humanism}}
"Religious humanists" are non-superstitious people who nevertheless see ethical humanism as their religion, and who seek to integrate (secular) humanist ethical philosophy with congregational [[ritual]]s centred on human needs, interests, and abilities. Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of "humanism" until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history. A unified [[Ethical Culture]] movement was first founded in 1876; its founder, [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]] was a former member of the [[Free Religious Association]], and conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions. Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern. Nowadays religious humanists in the United States are represented by organisations such as the [[American Ethical Union]], and will simply describe themselves as "ethical humanists" or "humanists". Secular humanists and religious humanists organise together as part of larger national and international groupings, and differentiate themselves primarily in their attitude to the promotion of humanist thinking.

Earlier attempts at inventing a secular religious tradition informed the Ethical Culture movement. The [[Cult of Reason]] ({{lang-fr|Culte de la Raison}}) was a religion based on [[deism]] devised during the [[French Revolution]] by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]] and their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=War, Terror, and Resistance | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap7c.html | accessdate=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] was turned into a "[[Temple of Reason]]" and for a time [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]] replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.&lt;ref name="Herrick"&gt;James A. Herrick, "The Making of the New Spirituality", InterVarsity Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-8308-3279-3}}, p. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, [[Auguste Comte]], the Father of Sociology, founded [[Positivism]], a "religion of humanity".&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"&gt;{{cite web | title=Humanism as the Next Step | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html | accessdate=25 June 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614195856/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |archivedate = 14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"/&gt;

The distinction between so-called "ethical" humanists and "secular" humanists is most pronounced in the United States, although it is becoming less so over time. The philosophical distinction is not reflected at all in Canada, Latin America, Africa, or Asia, or most of Europe. In the UK, where the humanist movement was strongly influenced by Americans in the 19th century, the leading "ethical societies" and "ethical churches" evolved into secular humanist charities (e.g. the British Ethical Union became the British Humanist Association and later [[Humanists UK]]). In Scandinavian countries, "Human-etik" or "[[:no:humanetikk|humanetikk]]" (roughly synonymous with ethical humanism) is a popular strand within humanism, originating from the works of Danish philosopher [[Harald Høffding]]. The Norwegian Humanist Association belongs to this tendency, known as [[Human-Etisk Forbund]] (literally "Human-Ethical League"). Over time, the emphasis on ''human-etisk'' has become less pronounced, and today HEF promotes both "humanisme" and "human-etisk". In Sweden, the main Swedish humanist group [[Humanisterna]] ("Humanists") began as a "human-ethical association", like the Norwegian humanists, before adopting the more prevalent secular humanist model popular in most of Europe. Today the distinction in Europe is mostly superficial.

The modern Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai International practices what has been called "Nichiren Humanism", based on txhe Lotus Sutra's focus on self-development and altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seagar |first1=Richard |title=Buddhism In America |date=2012 |publisher=Columbia Uniiversity Press |isbn=978-0-231-15973-9 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns. Early 20th century critics such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[T.&amp;nbsp;E. Hulme]], and [[T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot]] considered humanism to be sentimental "slop" (Hulme){{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--double check please--&gt; or "an old bitch gone in the teeth" (Pound).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] critics who are self-described [[antihumanism|anti-humanists]], such as [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Michel Foucault]], have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal [[human nature]], which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. "Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal", suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls "a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, philosopher [[Kate Soper]]&lt;ref&gt;in ''Humanism and Anti-humanism (Problems of Modern European Thought)'' (La Salle, Illinois: Open Court Press, 1986, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, anti-humanism thus frequently "secretes a humanist rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Humanism'' (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics "humanist anti-humanists". Critics of antihumanism, most notably [[Jürgen Habermas]], counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas accepts some criticisms leveled at traditional humanism but believes that humanism must be rethought and revised rather than simply abandoned.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like the German philosopher [[Heidegger]] considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German "race" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists.&lt;ref&gt;"The antihhumanist Humanism of Heidegger and the humanist antihumanism of Foucault and Althusser" (Davies [1997]), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century "it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them". For "it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason". Yet, he continues, "it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1997), pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern humanists, such as [[Corliss Lamont]] or [[Carl Sagan]], hold that humanity must seek for truth through reason and the best observable evidence and endorse [[scientific skepticism]] and the [[scientific method]]. However, they stipulate that decisions about right and wrong must be based on the individual and common good, with no consideration given to metaphysical or supernatural beings. The idea is to engage with what is human.&lt;ref&gt;"Conscience, the sense of right and wrong and the insistent call of one's better, more idealistic, more social-minded self, is a social product. Feelings of right and wrong that at first have their locus within the family gradually develop into a pattern for the tribe or city, then spread to the larger unit of the nation, and finally from the nation to humanity as a whole. Humanism sees no need for resorting to supernatural explanations, or sanctions at any point in the ethical process" ({{Cite book |last=Lamont |first=Corliss |authorlink=Corliss Lamont |title=The Philosophy of Humanism, Eighth Edition |pages=252–53 |publisher=Humanist Press: Amherst, New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-931779-07-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making life better for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite book |last=Kurtz |first=Paul |title=Humanist manifesto 2000 : a call for a new planetary humanism |year=2000 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=157392783X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a better place for those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] cautioned: "The prophecy of [[Francis Bacon]] has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts".&lt;ref&gt;''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, [1925] 1997) p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentientist philosophers criticise humanism for focusing too strongly, sometimes even exclusively, on the human species. They propose [[Sentientism]] as an extension of humanism that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings - those capable of experiencing. Sentient beings include humans and most non-human animals and could potentially include artificial or alien intelligences.

== Humanistic psychology ==
{{main|Humanistic psychology}}

Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic theory and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[Behaviorism]]. The approach emphasizes an individual's inherent drive towards [[self-actualization]] and creativity.  Psychologists [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Abraham Maslow]] introduced a positive, humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s. Other sources include the philosophies of [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11302">'''In vitro spermatogenesis''' is the process of creating male [[gamete]]s ([[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]) outside of the body in a culture system. The process could be useful for fertility preservation, infertility treatment and may further develop the understanding of [[spermatogenesis]] at the cellular and molecular level.  

Spermatogenesis is a highly complex process and artificially rebuilding it ''[[in vitro]]'' is challenging.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} These include creating a similar microenvironment to that of the testis as well as supporting endocrine and paracrine signalling, and ensuring survival of the somatic and germ cells from [[spermatogonial stem cell]]s (SSCs) to mature spermatozoa.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reuter|first=Karin|last2=Schlatt|first2=Stefan|last3=Ehmcke|first3=Jens|last4=Wistuba|first4=Joachim|date=2012-10-01|title=Fact or fiction:  In vitro spermatogenesis|journal=Spermatogenesis|volume=2|issue=4|pages=245–252|doi=10.4161/spmg.21983|issn=2156-5554|pmc=3521746|pmid=23248765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different methods of culturing can be used in the process such as isolated [[cell culture]]s, fragment cultures and [[3D cell culture|3D cultures]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Culture techniques ==
=== Isolated cell cultures ===
Cell cultures can include either monocultures, where one cell population is cultured, or co-culturing systems, where several cells lines (must be at least two) can be cultured together.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galdon|first=Guillermo|last2=Atala|first2=Anthony|last3=Sadri-Ardekani|first3=Hooman|date=2016-04-23|title=In Vitro Spermatogenesis: How Far from Clinical Application?|journal=Current Urology Reports|language=en|volume=17|issue=7|pages=49|doi=10.1007/s11934-016-0605-3|pmid=27107595|issn=1527-2737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells are initially isolated for culture by enzymatically digesting the testis tissue to separate out the different cells types for culture.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The process of isolating cells can lead to cell damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Damien|last2=Anand-Ivell|first2=Ravinder|last3=Danner|first3=Sandra|last4=Ivell|first4=Richard|date=2012-01-01|title=Models of in vitro spermatogenesis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341244/|journal=Spermatogenesis|volume=2|issue=1|pages=32–43|doi=10.4161/spmg.19383|issn=2156-5554|pmc=3341244|pmid=22553488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of monoculture is that the effect of different influences on one specific cell population of cells can be investigated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Co-culture allows for the interactions between cell populations to be observed and experimented on, which is seen as an advantage over the monoculture model.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Isolated cell culture, specifically co-culture of testis tissue, has been a useful technique for examining the influences of specific factors such as hormones or different feeder cells on the progression of spermatogenesis ''in vitro''.{{Cit|date=October 2018}} For example, factors such as temperature, feeder cell influence and the role of [[testosterone]] and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) have all been investigated using isolated cell culture techniques.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Studies have concluded that different factors can influence the culture of germ cells e.g. media, growth factors, hormones and temperature. For example, when culturing immortalized mouse germ cells at temperatures of 35, 37 and 29℃, these cells proliferate most rapidly at the highest temperature and least rapidly at the lowest but there were varying levels of differentiation. At the highest temperature no differentiation were detected, some was seen at 37℃ and some early [[spermatid]]s appearing at 32℃.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Investigations of appropriate feeder cells concluded that a variety of cells could encourage development of germ cells such as [[Sertoli cell]]s, [[Leydig cell]]s and [[peritubular myoid cell]]s but the most essential is Sertoli cells, but Leydig and peritubular myoid cells both contribute to the microenvironment that encourage stem cells to remain [[pluripotent]] and self renew in the testis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibtisham|first=Fahar|last2=Wu|first2=Jiang|last3=Xiao|first3=Mei|last4=An|first4=Lilong|last5=Banker|first5=Zachary|last6=Nawab|first6=Aamir|last7=Zhao|first7=Yi|last8=Li|first8=Guanghui|date=2017-09-12|title=Progress and future prospect of in vitro spermatogenesis|journal=Oncotarget|volume=8|issue=39|pages=66709–66727|doi=10.18632/oncotarget.19640|issn=1949-2553|pmc=5630449|pmid=29029549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testes fragment cultures ===
[[File:Testis Organ Culture Vs Cell Culture.jpg|thumb|375x375px|This image shows the difference in process between organ culture and cell culture.]]
In fragment cultures, the testis is removed and fragments of tissue are cultured in supplemental media containing different growth factors to induce spermatogenesis and form functional gametes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The development of this culture technique has taken place mainly with the use of animal models e.g. mice or rat testis tissue.

The advantage of using this method is that it maintains the natural spatial arrangement of the [[seminiferous tubule]]s. However, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] is a recurring problem in these cultures where the low oxygen supply hinders the development and maturation of spermatids (significantly more in adult than immature testis tissues).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other challenges with this type of culture include maintaining the structure of the seminiferous tubules which makes it more difficult for longer-term cell cultures as the tissue structures can flatten out making it hard to work with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To resolve some of these issues, 3D cultures can be used.

In 2012, mature spermatozoa capable of fertilization was isolated from ''in vitro'' culture of immature mouse testis tissue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Hye-Won|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Miles F.|date=2012-10-01|title=In vitro spermatogenesis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3521745/|journal=Spermatogenesis|volume=2|issue=4|pages=238–244|doi=10.4161/spmg.22069|issn=2156-5554|pmc=3521745|pmid=23248764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3D cultures ===
3D cultures use sponge, models or scaffolds that resemble the elements of the [[extracellular matrix]] to achieve a more natural spatial structure of the seminiferous tubules and to better represent the tissues and the interaction between different cell types in an ''[[ex vivo]]'' experiment. Different components of the extracellular matrix such as collagen, agar and calcium alginate are commonly used to form the gel or scaffold which can provide oxygen and nutrients.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; To propagate 3D cultures, testicular cell cultures are imbedded into the porous sponge/scaffold and allowed to colonise the structure which can then survive for several weeks to allow [[Spermatogonium|spermatogonia]] to differentiate and mature into spermatozoa.

In addition, shaking 3D cultures during the seeding process allows for an increased oxygen supply which helps overcome the issue of hypoxia and so improves the lifespan of cells.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In contrast to monocultures, fragment/3D cultures are able to establish ''in vitro'' conditions that can somewhat resemble the testicular microenvironment to allow a more accurate study of the testicular physiology and its associations with the ''in vitro'' development of sperm cells.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Future implications ==

=== Scientific ===
The ability to recapitulate spermatogenesis ''In vitro'' provides a unique opportunity to study this biological process through oftentimes cheaper and faster method of research than ''in vivo'' work. Observation is often easier ''in vitro'', as the targeted cells are mostly isolated and immobile. Another significant advantage of ''in vitro'' research is the ease with which environmental factors can be changed and monitored. There are also techniques which are not practical or feasible ''in vivo'' which can now be explored.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''In vitro'' work is not without its own challenges. For example, one loses the natural structure provided by the ''in vivo'' tissue, and thus cell connections which could be important to the function of the tissue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Clinical ===
While rodent spermatogenesis is not identical to its human counterpart, especially due to the high evolution rate of the male reproductive tract, these techniques are a solid starting point for future human applications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Various categories of infertile men may benefit from advances in these techniques, especially those with a lack of viable gamete production. These men cannot benefit, for example, from sperm extraction techniques, and currently have little to no options for producing genetic descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fattahi|first=Amir|last2=Latifi|first2=Zeinab|last3=Ghasemnejad|first3=Tohid|last4=Nejabati|first4=Hamid Reza|last5=Nouri|first5=Mohammad|date=July 2017|title=Insights into in vitro spermatogenesis in mammals: Past, present, future|journal=Molecular Reproduction and Development|volume=84|issue=7|pages=560–575|doi=10.1002/mrd.22819|issn=1098-2795|pmid=28436137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, males who have undergone chemo/radiotherapy prepubertally may benefit from ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis. These people did not have the option to [[Cryopreservation|cryopreserve]] viable sperm before their procedure, and thus the ability to generate genetically descended sperm later in life is invaluable. Possible methods that could be applied (to this and other groups) are induction of spermatogenesis in testis samples taken prepubertally, or, if these samples are not available/viable, new methods that manipulate stem cell differentiation could produce SSCs ‘from scratch’, using [[adult stem cell]] samples.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An alternative method is to graft preserved tissue back onto adult cancer survivors, however this comes with operational risks, as well as a risk of reintroducing malignant cells. Even if using this method however, ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis advances would allow for sample expansion and observation to better ensure quality and quantity of graft tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In those with healthy or preserved SSCs but without a cellular environment to support them, ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis could be used following transplant of the SSCs into healthy donor tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another group that could be helped by ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis are those with any form of genetic impediment to sperm production. Those with no viable SSC development are an obvious target, but also those with varying levels of spermatogenic arrest; previously their underdeveloped germ cells have been injected into oocytes, however this has a success rate of only 3% in humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Finally, ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis using animal or human cells can be used to assess the effects and toxicity of drugs before ''in vivo'' testing.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Ancient moral intellectualism==
In the view of [[Socrates]] (c. 470 – 399 BC), intellectualism allows that “one will do what is right or best just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best”; that [[virtue]] is a purely intellectual matter, since virtue and [[knowledge]] are familial relatives, which a person accrues and improves with dedication to [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} (Definition and note on Socrates)&lt;/ref&gt; So defined, [[Socratic intellectualism]] became a key philosophic doctrine of [[Stoicism]]. The apparent, problematic consequences of this view are “Socratic paradoxes”, such as the view that there is no [[weakness of will]] — that no one knowingly does, or seeks to do, evil (moral wrong); that anyone who does, or seeks to do, moral wrong does so involuntarily; and that virtue is knowledge, that there are not many virtues, but that all virtues are one.

Contemporary philosophers dispute that Socrates’s conceptions of knowing truth, and of ethical conduct, can be equated with modern, post–[[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] conceptions of knowledge and of rational intellectualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No one errs willingly: the meaning of socratic intellectualism | author=Heda Segvic | url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924226-7.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930151328/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924226-7.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, [[Michel Foucault]] demonstrated, with detailed historical study, that in [[Classical Antiquity]] (800 BC – AD 1000), “knowing the truth” is akin to “spiritual knowledge”, in the contemporarily understanding of the concept. Hence, without exclusively concerning the rational intellect, spiritual knowledge is integral to the broader principle of “caring for the self”.

Typically, such care of the self-involved specific [[ascetic]] exercises meant to ensure that not only was knowledge of truth memorized, but learned, and then integrated to the self, in the course of transforming oneself into a [[Value (ethics)|good]] person. Therefore, to understand truth meant “intellectual knowledge” requiring one’s integration to the (universal) truth, and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentically]] living it in one’s speech, heart, and conduct. Achieving that difficult task required continual care of the self, but also meant being someone who embodies truth, and so can readily practice the [[Rhetoric|Classical]]-era rhetorical device of [[parrhesia]]: “to speak candidly, and to ask forgiveness for so speaking”; and, by extension, practice the [[Morality|moral]] obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.&lt;ref&gt;Gros, Frederic (ed.)(2005) ''Michel Foucault: The Hermeneutics of the Subject'', Lectures at the College de France 1981–1982. Picador: New York&lt;/ref&gt; This ancient, Socratic moral philosophic perspective contradicts the contemporary understanding of truth and knowledge as [[Reason|rational]] undertakings.

==Medieval theological intellectualism&lt;!--'Medieval theological intellectualism' redirects here; linked from 'Averroes', 'Thomas Aquinas', and 'Meister Eckhart'--&gt;==
'''Medieval theological intellectualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a doctrine of divine action, wherein the faculty of [[intellect]] precedes, and is superior to, the faculty of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] (''voluntas intellectum sequitur''). As such, Intellectualism is contrasted with [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]], which proposes the Will as superior to the intellect, and to the emotions; hence, the stance that “according to intellectualism, choices of the Will result from that which the intellect recognizes as good; the will, itself, is determined. For voluntarism, by contrast, it is the Will which identifies which objects are good, and the Will, itself, is indetermined”.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/v/voluntar.htm | title = Voluntarism| publisher = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that philosophical perspective and historical context, the Spanish [[Islam|Muslim]] polymath [[Averroës]] (1126–1198) in the 12th century, the Italian Christian theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), and the German Christian theologian [[Meister Eckhart]] (1260–1327) in the 13th century, are recognised intellectualists.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Hackett, ''A Companion to Meister Eckhart'', BRILL, 2012, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juhamatti Tapio Aaltonen''' (born 4 June 1985) is a Finnish professional [[ice hockey]] [[Winger (ice hockey)|winger]], who currently plays for [[Skellefteå AIK]] of the [[Swedish Hockey League]]. Known for his skill and skating speed, Aaltonen was drafted by the [[St. Louis Blues]] as the 248th selection overall in the [[2003 NHL Entry Draft]].

==Playing career==
Aaltonen started his professional career with [[Oulun Kärpät]], playing with the team from 2002 to 2009 winning [[Kanada-malja|Finnish championship]] twice. After the years he spent with Kärpät, Aaltonen moved to [[Lahti]] to play for [[Pelicans (ice hockey)|Pelicans]], where he played his breakthrough year scoring 28 goals and 49 points in 58 games in regular season. He signed a five-year contract with Pelicans, but the contract also gave Aaltonen a possibility to play in other leagues.

This option in his contract was exercised on 15 June 2010, when he was loaned from the Pelicans to Russian club, [[Metallurg Magnitogorsk]] of the KHL.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/csl.php?tid=5027 | title = Magnitogorsk Metallurg's 2010-11 Roster | publisher = ''hockeydb.com'' | date = 2015-10-02 | accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaltonen was an integral part of Metallurg's offense in his two seasons in the KHL before he opted to sign with Swedish club, Rögle BK of the then [[Swedish Hockey League|Elitserien]] on 15 October 2012. He made his debut in Sweden two-days later and in the [[2012-13 Elitserien season|2012–13]] season, contributed with 31 points in 42 regular season games.

After a season's long return with his original Finnish club, Kärpät, Aaltonen signed for his third Finnish team, and only KHL participant, Jokerit on 1 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://www.jokerit.com/aaltonen-liittyy-joukkueeseen | title = Aaltonen agrees to contract with Jokerit | publisher = ''[[Jokerit]]'' | date = 2014-08-01 | accessdate = 2014-08-01 | language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Jokerit he had a season with [[Helsinki IFK]] in [[Liiga]] moving to SHL and Rögle for 2017-18.

Following the season [[2009-10 SM-liiga season|2009–10]] season, he was selected to join the [[Finland men's national ice hockey team]] and he played at the [[2010 IIHF World Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=IIHF|title=IIHF Media Guide &amp; Record Book 2011|year=2010 |publisher=Moydart Press |page= 317|isbn= 978-0-9867964-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the World Championship in [[2011 IIHF World Championship]]. He also played in the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|2014 Winter Olympics]], scoring the game-tying goal against Russia in the quarterfinal and went on to win bronze.

== Butterfingers ==
The Butterfinger series revolves around the hilarious escapades of thirteen-year-old Amar Kishen, a class VIII student of the fictitious Green Park Higher Secondary School. Amar’s slip-grip methods and his clumsy antics earned him the nickname Butterfingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/interview-with-khyrunnisa-a-on-clean-bowled-butterfingers/article7350130.ece|title=For the kid within|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfingers, named after Khyrunnisa’s son, Amar, first appeared in 2006 in [[Tinkle]], a popular fortnightly Indian children's magazine, as a regular comic-strip character. The illustrations were by Abhijeet Kini, the Mumbai based illustrator and graphic artist.

The popular Butterfingers series, published by Puffin, began with the novel, ''Howzzat Butterfingers!'' , In 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/All-about-Butterfingers/article16191991.ece|title=All about Butterfingers|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This humorous cricket-based book was followed in 2012 by ''Goal, Butterfingers!''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/packing-a-punch/article7976594.ece|title=Packing a punch|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' a rollicking football-based adventure novel which also includes a socially relevant environmental theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yentha.com/news/view/4/LITERATURE-Author-Profile-Khyrunnisa-A|title=LITERATURE: Author Profile - Khyrunnisa A - Trivandrum News {{!}} Yentha.com|last=yentha.com|website=www.yentha.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third in the series, ''‘Clean Bowled, Butterfingers!'' was published in 2015 and is another cricket-based novel with a hilariously farcical plot in which Amar and his friends invent a variation of cricket called ‘Crack It’ when the school’s cricket gear gets stolen. This game, played without cricket bats and balls, has its own absurd rules and generates immense fun.

''The Misadventures of Butterfingers'', the fourth book in the series, came out in 2016 and is a collection of short stories. It was followed by another collection of delightful short stories'', Run! It’s Butterfingers Again!''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/go-butter-go/article18387112.ece|title=Go, Butter, go!|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/thumbs-up-for-indian-writing/article18476520.ece|title=Thumbs up for Indian writing|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2017.

The books have received praise from different quarters. The late [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi|Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi]], former Indian cricket captain and legend, wrote of ''Howzzat Butterfingers!'': ‘What great fun! It brings back memories of my prep school days.’ The ace cricketer [[V. V. S. Laxman|V.V.S. Laxman]] described ''Clean Bowled Butterfingers'' as an ‘exuberant mix of school, cricket and fun.’ [[Shashi Tharoor]], writer, MP and diplomat, complimented Khyrunnisa ‘not just for creating Butterfingers, but for enriching Indian writing with world-class children’s literature.’

== Film ==
On television as a young child, he started appearing uncredited at the age of 8 in films such as ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1952) and ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt; He quickly moved to featured status by the end of that year.

He showed talent as the kidnapped Indian "Red Chief" in a segment of the film ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]'' (1952) and another kidnap victim as the son of scientist [[Gene Barry]] in ''[[The Atomic City]]'' (1952).

In 1953, he co-starred in the [[John Wayne]] [[Western (genre)|western]] classic ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'' (1953) as the [[curious]] [[blond]] son of homesteader [[Geraldine Page]].&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

He also appeared in other film styles such as the ''[[film noir]]'' thriller ''[[Jeopardy (film)|Jeopardy]]'' (1953) with [[Barbara Stanwyck]], the horse opera drama ''Arena'' (1953) with [[Gig Young]], and the comedies ''[[Mister Scoutmaster]]'' (1953) with [[Clifton Webb]] and ''[[Ricochet Romance]]'' (1954) with [[Marjorie Main]].

== Television ==
In 1953-54, Aaker was among the many child actors who auditioned for the role of "Jeff Miller" on the original 1954 ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'' series, which later aired as ''Jeff's Collie''. That role went to [[Tommy Rettig]]. Two weeks later, Aaker won the role of "Rusty" on ''The Adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin'', co-starring [[James Brown (Rin Tin Tin)|James Brown]] (1920–1992) as [[Lieutenant]] Ripley "Rip" Masters.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt; Aaker and Rettig were friends, and both shows were popular with audiences. The two actors and the two star dogs appeared together in a photograph used on the cover of the July 2, 1955 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''.{{r|rtt|page1=236}}

== Later years ==
Aaker told a newspaper reporter that when he reached the age of 21, he was paid a $10,000 lump sum by the studio that produced ''Rin Tin Tin'' "and he spent the rest of the '60s traveling around the world 'as sort of a flower child.'"&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rin Tin Tin's friend is now a carpenter|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/85252305/?terms=%22Lee%2BAaker%22|work=Southern Illinoisan|date=November 15, 1976|location=Illinois, Carbondale|page=18|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 30, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to find work as an adult actor, Aaker got involved as a producer and later worked as a carpenter.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In the late 1960s, Aaker was married to Sharon Ann Hamilton for two years.&lt;ref name=xcs/&gt; He has resided in [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]], [[California]], for many years and is a special-needs ski instructor.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2005, Aaker won the [[Golden Boot Awards|Golden Boot Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Golden Boot Awards|url=http://www.b-westerns.com/goldboot.htm|website=The Old Corral|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as  ''Kids of the West''.

'''Leonard Hayflick''' (born 20 May 1928) is a [[Professor]] of [[Anatomy]] at the [[UCSF School of Medicine]], and was Professor of Medical [[Microbiology]] at [[Stanford University]] School of Medicine. He is a past president of the [[Gerontological Society of America]] and was a founding member of the council of the [[National Institute on Aging]] (NIA). The recipient of a number of research prizes and awards, including the 1991 Sandoz Prize for Gerontological Research, he has studied the [[senescence|aging process]] for more than fifty years. He is known for discovering that normal human [[Cell (biology)|cells]] divide for a limited number of times ''in vitro''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hayflick L | title=The limited in vitro lifetime of human diploid cell strains | journal=Experimental Cell Research | volume=37 | year=1965 | pages=614–636 | pmid=14315085 | doi=10.1016/0014-4827(65)90211-9 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (refuting the contention by [[Alexis Carrel]] that normal body cells are [[biological immortality|immortal]]). This is known as the [[Hayflick limit]]. His discoveries overturned a 60-year old dogma that all cultured cells are immortal. Hayflick demonstrated that normal cells have a memory and can remember at what doubling level they have reached. He demonstrated that his normal human cell strains were free from contaminating viruses. His cell strain [[WI-38]] soon replaced primary monkey kidney cells and became the substrate for the production of most of the world's human virus vaccines. Hayflick discovered that the etiological agent of primary [[atypical pneumonia]] (also called "walking pneumonia") was not a virus as previously believed. He was the first to cultivate the causative organism called a [[mycoplasma]], the smallest free-living organism, which Hayflick isolated on a unique culture medium that bears his name. He named the organism ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]''.

In 1959, Hayflick developed the first inverted microscope for use in [[cell culture]] research. To this day, all inverted microscopes used in cell culture laboratories worldwide are descended from this prototype. His microscope was accessioned by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 2009.

Hayflick developed the first practical method for producing powdered cell culture media in 1965. This method is now used worldwide for the production of many tons of powdered media annually for use in research laboratories and commercial production facilities. The technique is not patented and Hayflick receives no remuneration from this invention. 

Hayflick is the author of the book, ''How and Why We Age'', published in August 1994 by [[Ballantine Books]], [[New York City|NYC]] and available since 1996 as a paperback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hayflick | first = Leonard | title = How and Why We Age | edition= Reprint | publisher = [[Ballantine Books]] | date = January 23, 1996 | isbn = 0-345-40155-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This book has been translated into nine languages and is published in [[Brazil]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], and [[Spain]]. It was a selection of the [[Book of the Month Club]] and has sold over 50,000 copies worldwide.

Hayflick and his associates have vehemently condemned "anti-aging medicine" and criticized organizations such as the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[S.

== Biography ==
Leonard Hayflick was born 20 May 1928 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1956. After receiving a post-doctoral fellowship for study at the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] under the tutelage of the renowned cell culturist Prof. Charles M. Pomerat, he returned to Philadelphia, where he spent ten years as an Associate Member of the [[Wistar Institute]] and two years as an Assistant Professor of Research Medicine at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

In 1968, Hayflick was appointed Professor of Medical Microbiology at the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]], [[Stanford, California]].  Hayflick resigned from Stanford in 1976 in protest to the behavior of a few of its administrators who were later shown to have wrongly accepted the beliefs of an NIH accountant who was unable to understand the unique concept of title to a self-duplicating biological system. Hayflick sued the NIH, who later agreed that the issue was in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayflick|first1=Leonard|title=Errors in the "Vaccine Race" Book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323666095_Errors_in_The_Vaccine_Race_book|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WebofS" /&gt; The behavior of Stanford and the NIH was later condemned by 85 prominent biologists who viewed him as having been "exonerated" by subsequent events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strehler|first1=B|last2=Abraham|first2=S|display-authors=1|title=Hayflick-NIH Settlement|journal=Science|date=15 Jan 1982|volume=215|issue=4530|pages=240-242|doi=10.1126/science.215.4530.240-b|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/215/4530/240.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip M. Boffey, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/19/science/the-fall-and-rise-of-leonard-hayflick-biologist-whose-fight-with-us.html "The Fall and Rise of Leonard Hayflick,"] New York Times (January 19, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 he moved to the [[University of Florida]], Gainesville, where he became Director of the Center for Gerontological Studies and Professor of Zoology in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and Professor of Microbiology and Immunology in the College of Medicine.

In 1988, Hayflick joined the faculty of the University of California, San Francisco, where he is currently Professor of Anatomy.  Hayflick is a member of numerous national and international scientific and public boards of directors and committees.  He is now, or has been, on the Editorial Boards of more than ten professional journals. Hayflick was Editor-in-Chief of the international journal “Experimental Gerontology” for 13 years.

He is a member of twenty scientific and professional societies in which he has held several high offices including President of the Gerontological Society of America from 1982 to 1983. He was a founding member of the Council of the National Institute on Aging, NIH and Chairman of its Executive Committee. He was a consultant to the National Cancer Institute and the [[World Health Organization]], and is now a member of several scientific advisory boards.  He was Chairman of the Scientific Review Board of the American Federation for Aging Research where he was also a vice president and a Member of the Board of Directors. He was also recruited by [[Michael D. West]], founder of [[Geron Corporation|Geron]] ({{NASDAQ|GERN}}) and current CEO of [[BioTime]], to join the company's Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board, on which he served from 1991-2000. Hayflick was also a consultant at [[Genentech]] from a year after its founding and for the next 25 years. He developed their technology for growing animal cells in fermentation tanks in which most of their products were produced.

Hayflick is one of several prominent biologists featured in the 1995 science [[documentary]] [[Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times]].

== Research ==
Hayflick is known for his research in [[cell biology]], virus vaccine development, and [[mycoplasma|mycoplasmology]]. In 1962 he discovered that, contrary to the prevailing belief at the time, cultured normal human and animal cells have a limited capacity for replication.  This discovery, known as the [[Hayflick limit]], overturned a long-held belief bolstered by [[Alexis Carrel]]'s work in the early 20th century that claimed that normal cells would proliferate continuously in culture. Hayflick found that only cancer cells are immortal and that normal cells have a mechanism for remembering at what replication level they are at. He interpreted his finding that normal cells are mortal to be an indication of aging at the cellular level. Hayflick demonstrated for the first time that mortal (normal) and immortal (malignant) mammalian cells existed.

Hayflick developed the first normal human [[diploid]] cell strains for studies on human aging and for research use throughout the world. Prior to his seminal research, all cultured cell lines were immortal and [[aneuploid]]. One of these new cell strains, developed by Hayflick and his colleague Paul Moorehead at the [[Wistar Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], called [[WI-38]], has become the most widely used and highly characterized normal human cell population in the world. Hayflick had found that his normal cell strain WI-38 was capable of growing all of the then known human viruses. He hypothesized that because WI-38 was free from contaminating viruses, it could replace the then widely used primary monkey kidney cells, which contained several dangerous contaminating viruses. Indeed, WI-38 became used worldwide for human virus vaccine manufacture, to the benefit of billions of people.&lt;ref name="The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olshansky|first1=S.J.|last2=Hayflick|first2=L|title=The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity|journal=AIMS Public Health|date=2 March 2017|volume=4|issue=2|pages=127-138|doi=10.3934/publichealth.2017.2.127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayflick produced the first oral [[polio]] vaccine ever made on his normal human cell strain WI-38. WI-38 is now used for the production of all of the Rubella Virus vaccine used in the Western Hemisphere. WI-38, or new diploid cell strains, are used today for the manufacture of most human virus [[vaccine]]s produced throughout the world including those for [[poliomyelitis]], rubella, rubeola, varicella, mumps, rabies, adenoviruses and hepatitis A. Over one billion vaccinees have received vaccines produced on WI-38 or foreign versions of Hayflick's original WI-38.&lt;ref name="The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity" /&gt;

Hayflick is also known for his discovery of the cause of primary atypical pneumonia (“[[walking pneumonia]]”) in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chanock|first1=RM|last2=Hayflick|first2=L|last3=Barile|first3=MF|title=Growth on artificial medium of an agent associated with atypical pneumonia and its identification as a PPLO.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=15 January 1962|volume=48|pages=41-9|pmid=13878126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etiological agent was first thought to be a virus, but Hayflick showed that it was, in fact, a [[mycoplasma]], a member of the smallest free-living class of microorganisms.  The etiological agent was named by him as ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'', and was first grown by Hayflick on a medium he developed and that bears his name. It is now used worldwide for mycoplasma isolation and research.

Hayflick is the recipient of more than twenty-five major awards including the $20,000 Brookdale Award and the Kleemeier Award from the Gerontological Society of America, the Biomedical Sciences and Aging Award from the University of Southern California, The Karl August Forster Lectureship of the Academy of Sciences and Literature and the University of Mainz, Germany, the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation Research Recognition Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for In Vitro Biology, the Sandoz Prize from the [[International Association of Gerontology]], and the Presidential Award from [[The International Organization for Mycoplasmology]]. Hayflick, together with Paul Moorhead, were awarded the prestigious [[John Scott Award]] in 2014. This is the oldest scientific award in the United States, established in 1823 in honor of Benjamin Franklin.

In the mid-1990s, Hayflick was recruited by [[Geron Corporation|Geron]] founder [[Michael D. West]] to join the company's Scientific Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geron Corporation 10K 1996|url= http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/ageing/1996-May/002331.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Hayflick was elected Academician and Foreign Member of the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1998 he was elected corresponding member of the Société de Biologie of France. In 1999, he was presented with the van Weezel Award by the European Society for Animal Cell Technology and the [[Lord Cohen Medal|Lord Cohen of Birkenhead Medal]] by the [[British Society for Research on Ageing]]. The [[American Aging Association]] established an Annual Hayflick Lectureship in 1997. A second Annual Hayflick Lecture was established by the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] in 2000. Hayflick was the recipient of the 2001, $10,000 Life Extension Prize and Laureate Diploma from the Regenerative Medicine Secretariat for his "...discovery of the finite replicative capacity of normal human diploid cells..." A third Annual Hayflick Lecture was established at the [[Friedrich Schiller University]] in 2013.

Hayflick is a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], an Honorary Member of the Tissue Culture Association and, according to the Institute of Scientific Information, is one of the most cited contemporary scientists in the world in the fields of biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, enzymology, genetics and molecular biology. Hayflick is the author of over 275 scientific papers, book chapters and edited books of which four papers are among the 100 most cited scientific papers of the two million papers published in the basic biomedical sciences from 1961 to 1978.

The [[inverted microscope]] that Hayflick modified for use in his tissue culture and mycoplasma work and on which all other such microscopes have been modeled has been acquired by the [[National Museum of American History|Smithsonian National Museum of American History]].

'''Life extension''' is the idea of extending the human [[life expectancy|lifespan]], either modestly &amp;ndash; through improvements in medicine &amp;ndash; or dramatically by increasing the [[maximum lifespan]] beyond its generally settled limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name=turner&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner BS |title=Can We Live Forever? A Sociological and Moral Inquiry |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2009 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to achieve such dramatic changes, however, does not currently exist.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;

Some researchers in this area, and "life extensionists", "immortalists" or "longevists" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]], [[stem cell]]s, [[regenerative medicine]], [[molecular]] repair, [[gene therapy]], pharmaceuticals, and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] replacement (such as with artificial organs or [[xenotransplantation]]s) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|agerasia}}&lt;/ref&gt;) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition. The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by [[bioethicist]]s.

The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50&amp;nbsp;billion of revenue a year in 2009.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt; The use of such products has not been proven to be effective or safe.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holliday&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9170-6 |pmid=18726707 |title=The extreme arrogance of anti-aging medicine |journal=Biogerontology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=223–8 |year=2008 |last1=Holliday |first1=Robin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"/&gt;&lt;ref name= EMBOSENS/&gt;

==Average and maximum lifespan==
{{Main|Senescence}}
During the process of [[aging]], an organism accumulates damage to its [[macromolecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[biological tissue|tissues]], and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. Specifically, aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by "genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2013 | title = The hallmarks of aging | journal = Cell | volume = 153 | issue = 6| pages = 1194–1217 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039 | pmid = 23746838 | pmc = 3836174 | author1 = López-Otín | first1 = C | last2 = Blasco | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Partridge | first3 = L | last4 = Serrano | first4 = M | last5 = Kroemer | first5 = G }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxidation]] damage to cellular contents caused by [[free radicals]] is believed to contribute to aging as well.&lt;ref name="Halliwell B 2007"&gt;Halliwell B, Gutteridge JMC (2007). Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, USA, {{ISBN|019856869X}}, {{ISBN|978-0198568698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1383772 | volume=275 | issue=3–6 | title=Oxidative and other DNA damages as the basis of aging: a review | date=September 1992 | pages=305–15 | doi=10.1016/0921-8734(92)90034-M | journal=Mutation Research/DNAging| author1=Holmes | first1=G. E. | last2=Bernstein | first2=C | last3=Bernstein | first3=H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest a human has ever been proven to live is 122 years, the case of [[Jeanne Calment]] who was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a [[wildtype]] [[mouse]], commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years.&lt;ref name="Mouse Genome Informatics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/other/mouse_facts1.shtml|title=Mouse Facts|publisher=informatics.jax.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of [[DNA repair]], [[antioxidant]] defenses, [[energy metabolism]], [[proteostasis]] maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as [[autophagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senescence.info/causes_of_aging.html|title=What Causes Aging? Damage-Based Theories of Aging|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average lifespan in a population is lowered by [[infant mortality|infant]] and [[child mortality]], which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age-related [[chronic disease]] such as [[cancer]] or [[cardiovascular disease]] play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, [[vaccinations]], good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]].

[[Maximum lifespan]] is determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as [[nematode]]s, fruit flies, and mice include [[caloric restriction]], [[gene manipulation]], and administration of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Aging biology: a new frontier for drug discovery | journal = Expert Opin Drug Discov | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 217–229 | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2012.660144 | pmid = 22468953 | author1 = Verdaguer | first1 = E | last2 = Junyent | first2 = F | last3 = Folch | first3 = J | last4 = Beas-Zarate | first4 = C | last5 = Auladell | first5 = C | last6 = Pallàs | first6 = M | last7 = Camins | first7 = A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = The evolution of late life | journal = Ageing Res Rev. | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 14–32 | doi = 10.1016/j.arr.2005.06.003 | pmid = 16085467 | author1 = Rauser | first1 = C.

==Strategies ==
{{See also|Ageing#Prevention and reversal}}

===Diets and supplements===
Much life extension research focuses on nutrition—[[diet (nutrition)|diets]] or [[dietary supplement|supplements]]— although there is little evidence that they have an effect. The many diets promoted by anti-aging advocates are often contradictory. {{original research inline|date=January 2015}}

In some studies [[calorie restriction]] has been shown to extend the life of mice, yeast, and rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=redmanCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Metabolic and behavioral compensations in response to caloric restriction: implications for the maintenance of weight loss | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 2| page = e4377 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004377 | pmid=19198647 | pmc=2634841 | author=[[Leanne Redman|Redman LM]], Heilbronn LK, Martin CK, de Jonge L, Williamson DA, Delany JP, Ravussin E| bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4377R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=source6&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holloszy JO|author2= Fontana L | year = 2007 | title = Caloric restriction in humans | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 42 | issue = 8| pages = 709–12 | doi=10.1016/j.exger.2007.03.009 | pmid=17482403 | pmc=2020845}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent study did not find calorie restriction to improve survival in rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=mattisonCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Impact of caloric restriction on health and survival in rhesus monkeys from the NIA study | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7415| pages = 318–321 | doi=10.1038/nature11432 | pmid=22932268 | pmc=3832985 | author=Mattison JA, Roth GS, Beasley TM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2012Natur.489..318M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans the long-term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown.&lt;ref name='Spindler, 2010'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spindler |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Future of Aging |pages=367–438 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3999-6_12 |chapter=Biological Effects of Calorie Restriction: Implications for Modification of Human Aging |isbn=978-90-481-3998-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[free-radical theory]] of [[aging]] suggests that [[antioxidant]] supplements might extend human life. However, evidence suggest that [[beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] supplements and high doses of vitamin&amp;nbsp;E increase mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bjelakovic, Goran|author2= Nikolova, Dimitrinka|author3= Lotte Gluud, Lise|author4= Simonetti Rosa G.|author5= Gluud Christian | year = 2007 | title = Mortality in Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for Primary and Secondary Prevention, a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 8| pages = 842–857 | doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 | pmid=17327526}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resveratrol]] is a [[Sir2|sirtuin]] stimulant that has been shown to extend life in animal models, but the effect of resveratrol on lifespan in humans is unclear as of 2011.&lt;ref name=Fer2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernández AF|author2= Fraga MF | title = The effects of the dietary polyphenol resveratrol on human healthy aging and lifespan | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 870–4 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21613817 | doi = 10.4161/epi.6.7.16499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hormone treatment===
The anti-aging industry offers several [[hormone therapies]]. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers and a lack of proven effect. For example, the [[American Medical Association]] has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{Cite news |first=Bruce |last=Japsen |date=15 June 2009 |title=AMA report questions science behind using hormones as anti-aging treatment |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-15/news/0906140132_1_anti-aging-hormones-ama-council |work=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[growth hormone]] (GH) decreases with age, the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies. There are mixed reports that GH or [[IGF-1]] modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative.&lt;ref name=AgingMaleRev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sattler FR | title = Growth hormone in the aging male | journal = Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–55 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 24054930 | doi = 10.1016/j.beem.2013.05.003 | quote = In animal models, alterations in GH/IGF-1 signaling with reductions in these somatotrophs appear to increase life span. &amp;nbsp;... Administration of IGF-1Eb (mechanogrowth factor) stimulates proliferation of myoblasts and induces muscle hypertrophy. Increases in GH and IGF-1 during adolescence are beneficial for brain and cardiovascular function during the aging process and GH administration during adolescence is vasoprotective and increases life-span.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;... Studies relating GH and IGF-1 status to longevity provide inconsistent evidence as to whether decreased (somatopause) or high levels (e.g. acromegaly) of these hormones are beneficial or detrimental to longevity.&amp;nbsp;... It is difficult to reconcile the largely protective effects of GH/IGF-1 deficiency on longevity in animals with the inconsistent or deleterious effects of low levels or declining GH/IGF-1 during human aging.| pmc = 3940699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history, from the Sumerian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the Egyptian [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Smith medical papyrus]], all the way through the [[Taoists]], [[Ayurveda]] practitioners, [[alchemists]], [[hygienist]]s such as [[Luigi Cornaro]], Johann Cohausen and [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], and philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[René Descartes]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and Nicolas [[Condorcet]]. However, the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, to the so-called "[[fin-de-siècle]]" (end of the century) period, denoted as an "end of an epoch" and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism, entailing the pursuit of life extension (or life-extensionism). Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist [[Elie Metchnikoff]] (1845-1916) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris, and [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] (1817-1894) -- the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Ilia|title=A History of Life-Extensionism in the Twentieth Century|date=2014|publisher=Longevity History|isbn=1500818577|url=http://www.longevityhistory.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He cites [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life, noting Bacon's novel ''[[New Atlantis]]'', wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691), founding member of the [[Royal Society]], also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension, according to Hughes, and proposed such experiments as "to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young". Biologist [[Alexis Carrel]] (1873–1944) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with [[Cell (biology)|cells]], says Hughes.&lt;ref name="HughesTranshumanism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=James|author-link=James Hughes (sociologist)|title=Leadership in Science and Technology: A Reference Handbook|date=October 20, 2011|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=1452266522|page=587|chapter=Transhumanism|editor1-last=Bainbridge|editor1-first=William|editor1-link=William Sims Bainbridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the [[American Aging Association]] was formed under the impetus of [[Denham Harman]], originator of the [[free radical theory]] of [[aging]]. Harman wanted an organization of [[biogerontologist]]s that was devoted to research and to the sharing of information among scientists interested in extending human lifespan.

In 1976, futurists Joel Kurtzman and Philip Gordon wrote ''No More Dying. The Conquest Of Aging And The Extension Of Human Life'', ({{ISBN|0-440-36247-4}}) the first popular book on research to extend human lifespan. Subsequently, Kurtzman was invited to testify before the House Select Committee on Aging, chaired by [[Claude Pepper]] of Florida, to discuss the impact of life extension on the Social Security system.

[[Saul Kent]] published ''The Life Extension Revolution'' ({{ISBN|0-688-03580-9}}) in 1980 and created a [[nutraceutical]] firm called the [[Life Extension Foundation]], a non-profit organization that promotes dietary supplements. The Life Extension Foundation publishes a periodical called ''Life Extension Magazine''. The 1982 bestselling book ''[[Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach]]'' ({{ISBN|0-446-51229-X}}) by [[Durk Pearson]] and [[Sandy Shaw (writer)|Sandy Shaw]] further popularized the phrase "life extension".

Regulatory and legal struggles between the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the Life Extension Foundation included seizure of merchandise and court action. In 1991, [[Saul Kent]] and Bill Faloon, the principals of the Foundation, were jailed. The LEF accused the FDA of perpetrating a "Holocaust" and "seeking gestapo-like power" through its regulation of drugs and marketing claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ty |last=Clevenger |date=Summer 2000 |title=Internet pharmacies: cyberspace versus the regulatory state |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |journal=Journal of Law and Health |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918191534/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |archivedate=18 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] published "The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging," by [[Michael D. West]]. West emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=West, Michael D. |title=The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZnuAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0-385-50928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern life extensionists include writer [[Gennady Stolyarov II|Gennady Stolyarov]], who insists that death is "the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology";&lt;ref name="stolyarov"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Stolyarov|first1 = Gennady|title = Death is Wrong|date = November 25, 2013|publisher = Rational Argumentator Press|isbn = 978-0615932040|url = http://rationalargumentator.com/Death_is_Wrong_Second_Edition_Full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[Zoltan Istvan]], who proposes that the "transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else";&lt;ref name="istvan"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Istvan|first1=Zoltan|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/the-three-laws-of-transhu_b_5853596.html |title=The Morality of Artificial Intelligence and the Three Laws of Transhumanism |publisher=Huffington Post |date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; futurist [[George Dvorsky]], who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved;&lt;ref name=aja&gt;{{cite web|title=Futurist: 'I will reap benefits of life extension'|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/fault-lines/articles/2015/5/7/futurist-itll-start-to-become-ridiculous-not-to-talk-about-curing-aging.html|website=Al Jazeera America|date=May 7, 2015|quote=To Dvorsky, aging is a problem that’s desperately in need of solving.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording artist [[Steve Aoki]], who has been called "one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension".&lt;ref name=tez&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tez|first1=Riva Melissa|title=Steve Aoki, Dan Bilzerian, a giraffe and the search for eternal life|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/steve-aoki-dan-bilzerian-a-giraffe-and-the-search-for-eternal-life|website=i-D|publisher=VICE|date=May 11, 2015|quote=Unknown to most, Steve is both an undeniable champion of life expansion as well as one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension.

But today, because of ageing, it does not have limitless scope.' [...] Set up by the Steve Aoki Charitable Fund, the profits from the Dan Bilzerian party went to life extension research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===

In 1991, the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M) was formed. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] recognizes neither anti-aging medicine nor the A4M's professional standing.&lt;ref name="NYTPoison"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alex |last= Kuczynski |date=12 April 1998 |title=Anti-Aging Potion Or Poison? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/style/anti-aging-potion-or-poison.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Aubrey de Grey]] and [[David Gobel]] formed the [[Methuselah Foundation]], which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects. In 2009, de Grey and several others founded the [[SENS Research Foundation]], a California-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sens.org/files/pdf/2011_Research_Report.pdf research report 2011]. Sens Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Google]] announced [[Calico (company)|Calico]], a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/tech/innovation/google-calico-aging-death/|title=How Google's Calico aims to fight aging and 'solve death'|author=Arion McNicoll, Arion |date=3 October 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by [[Arthur D.

Barron]], [[David Botstein]], and [[Cynthia Kenyon]]. In 2014, biologist [[Craig Venter]] founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy. They received funding with the goal of compiling a comprehensive human genotype, microbiome, and phenotype database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/human-longevity-inc-hli-launched-to-promote-healthy-aging-using-advances-in-genomics-and-stem-cell-therapies-248379091.html|title=Human Longevity Inc.

Aside from private initiatives, aging research is being conducted in university laboratories, and includes universities such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. University researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/05/health/young-blood-mice-aging/|title=Young blood makes old mice more youthful|author=Landau, Elizabeth |date=5 May 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/gdf11-protein-aging-mice-harvard/31929/ "Harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process"].

==Ethics and politics ==
Politics relevant to the substances of life extension pertain mostly to communications and availability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;!--Need some clarification here. The title implies the discussion is on the politics/ethics of all life extension practices, not just marketing of pharma/surgery--&gt;

In the [[United States]], product claims on food and drug labels are strictly regulated. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] ([[freedom of speech]]) protects third-party publishers' rights to distribute fact, opinion and speculation on life extension practices. Manufacturers and suppliers also provide informational publications, but because they market the substances, they are subject to monitoring and enforcement by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), which polices claims by marketers. What constitutes the difference between truthful and false claims is hotly debated and is a central controversy in this arena.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}&lt;!--This is just the opening paragraph, describing the political arena and stage of conflict. More to follow.--&gt;

===Scientific controversy===
Some critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example, [[Leonard Hayflick]], who determined that [[fibroblast]]s are limited to around 50&amp;nbsp;cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of [[entropy]]. Hayflick and fellow [[biogerontologist]]s [[S. Jay Olshansky|Jay Olshansky]] and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging [[dietary supplement|supplements]].&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Position statement on human aging |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=B292–7 |date=1 August 2002 |pmid=12145354 |doi=10.1093/gerona/57.8.B292|author1=Olshansky |first1=S. J. |last2=Hayflick |first2=L |last3=Carnes |first3=B. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This may be a good place to link into the broader social debate on life extension ethics. Hayflick is not the only one to object to the portrayal/treatment of aging as a disease. Many doctors, social scientists, feminists, etc. do too--&gt;

===Consumer motivations ===
Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. When product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 | title = Feedback Information and Consumer Motivation.

===Political parties===
Though many scientists state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging |publisher=Imminst.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that life extension and radical life extension are possible, there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension. There are political forces staying for and against life extension. By 2012, in Russia, the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, the Longevity political parties started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies, and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension, and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php |title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science |publisher=Fightaging.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon Valley===
Some tech innovators and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti-aging research. This includes [[Larry Ellison]] (founder of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]), [[Peter Thiel]] (former [[Paypal]] CEO),&lt;ref&gt;Veritas Forum Q&amp;A with Peter Thiel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQHrJvwnOzo&amp;list=PLCNNepS_4NcyOSlUdWOcTUCeUbK8nuywQ&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Page]] (co-founder of [[Google]]), and [[Peter Diamandis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/silicon-valleys-quest-to-live-forever&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Leon Kass]] (chairman of the US [[President's Council on Bioethics]] from 2001 to 2005) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] problems would make life extension unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Smith |date=3 December 2002 |title=Killing Immortality |url=http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040607195722/http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archivedate=7 June 2004 |publisher=Betterhumans |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states his opposition to life extension with the words:
{{Quote|"simply to covet a prolonged life span for ourselves is both a sign and a cause of our failure to open ourselves to procreation and to any higher purpose ... [The] desire to prolong youthfulness is not only a childish desire to eat one's life and keep it; it is also an expression of a childish and [[narcissistic]] wish incompatible with devotion to posterity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Leon |last=Kass |authorlink= Leon Kass |year=1985 |title=Toward a more natural science: biology and human affairs |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-02-918340-3 |oclc=11677465 |page= 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Harris, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues that as long as life is worth living, according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2007) ''Enhancing Evolution: The ethical case for making better people''. Princeton University Press, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanist]] [[philosopher]] [[Nick Bostrom]] has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"&gt;{{Cite news |first=John |last=Sutherland |date=9 May 2006 |title=The ideas interview: Nick Bostrom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/09/academicexperts.genetics |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 17 July 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an extended metaphor entitled "The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant", Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Bostrom, N |title=The fable of the dragon tyrant |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=273–7 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15863685 |pmc=1734155 |doi= 10.1136/jme.2004.009035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overpopulation concerns===

Controversy about life extension is due to fear of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and possible effects on society.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2005/02/superlongevity-without-overpopulation-1.php|title=Superlongevity Without Overpopulation|work=Fight Aging!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogerontologist [[Aubrey De Grey]] counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate [[menopause]], allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus ''decreasing'' the yearly population growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-ethics-of-anti-aging-by-peter-singer|title=Peter Singer on Should We Live to 1,000? – Project Syndicate|work=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the philosopher and futurist [[Max More]] argues that, given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling, superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"/&gt;

===Opinion polls===

A Spring 2013 [[Pew Research]] poll in the United States found that 38% of Americans would want life extension treatments, and 56% would reject it. However, it also found that 68% believed most people would want it and that only 4% consider an "ideal lifespan" to be more than 120 years. The median "ideal lifespan" was 91 years of age and the majority of the public (63%) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. 41% of Americans believed that radical life extension (RLE) would be good for society, while 51% said they believed it would be bad for society.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; One possibility for why 56% of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude, and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Magalhães JP | year = 2014 | title = The scientific quest for lasting youth: prospects for curing aging | journal = Rejuvenation Res | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 458–67 | doi = 10.1089/rej.2014.1580 | pmid = 25132068 | pmc = 4203147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated,&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/|title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans’ Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension|date=6 August 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some variation exists between religious denominations.

==Aging as a disease==
Mainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. [[David Sinclair (biologist)|David Sinclair]] says: "I&amp;nbsp;don't see aging as a disease, but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hayden EC | year = 2007 | title = A new angle on 'old' | journal = Nature | volume = 450 | issue = 7170| pages = 603–603 | doi = 10.1038/450603a | pmid=18046373| bibcode = 2007Natur.450..603H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not.&lt;ref&gt;Hamerman D. (2007) ''Geriatric Bioscience: The link between aging &amp; disease''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody, director of academic affairs for [[AARP]], notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depend on a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moody HR|title=Who's afraid of life extension?|journal= Generations|volume=25|issue= 4 |year=2002|pages= 33–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Gems, assistant director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing, argues that aging should be viewed as a disease.&lt;ref name=Gems1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Aging: To Treat, or Not to Treat? The possibility of treating aging is not just an idle fantasy | journal = American Scientist | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 278–80 | doi = 10.1511/2011.91.278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the universality of aging, David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that [[Basenji]] are not dogs because they do not bark.&lt;ref name=Gems2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Tragedy and delight: the ethics of decelerated ageing | journal = Philos Trans R Soc B | volume = 366 | issue = 1561| pages = 108–112 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0288| pmc = 3001315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the universality of aging he calls it a "special sort of disease". Robert M. Perlman, coined the terms "aging syndrome" and "disease complex" in 1954 to describe aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Perlman RM | year = 1954 | title = The aging syndrome | journal = J Am Geriatr Soc | volume = 2 | pages = 123–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. One view is, this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.&lt;ref name=Gems2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 15197284| year = 2004| author1 = Mehlman| first1 = M.

==Research==
Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues, reversal of harmful epigenetic changes, or the enhancement of enzyme [[telomerase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rando TA|author2= Chang HY|authorlink2=Howard Y.

Research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through [[genetic engineering]] and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and [[caloric restriction]].&lt;ref name=Shmookle&gt;{{cite journal | date = 2009 | title = Extreme-longevity mutations orchestrate silencing of multiple signaling pathways| journal = Biochim Biophys Acta | volume = 1790 | issue = 10| pages = 1075–83 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.05.011 | pmid = 19465083 | pmc=2885961| author1 = Shmookler Reis| first1 = R. J.| last2 = Bharill| first2 = P| last3 = Tazearslan| first3 = C| last4 = Ayyadevara| first4 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 review of longevity research noted: "Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a "life-extension factor" that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology."&lt;ref name=Shmookle/&gt;

===Anti-aging drugs===

There are a number of chemicals intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Childs et al. (2015). [http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v21/n12/full/nm.4000.html Cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease: from mechanisms to therapy] Nature Medicine {{doi|10.1038/nm.4000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of research is related to the observed effects of a [[calorie restriction]] (CR) diet, which has been shown to extend lifespan in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last2 = Shanmuganayagam| first1 = M. | first2 = D.| last1 = Anderson| title = Caloric restriction and aging: studies in mice and monkeys| last3 = Weindruch | first3 = R.| journal = Toxicologic pathology| volume = 37| issue = 1| pages = 47–51| year = 2009| pmid = 19075044| doi = 10.1177/0192623308329476| pmc = 3734859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that research, there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a caloric restriction diet, which are known as [[Caloric restriction mimetic]] drugs.  Some drugs that are already approved for other uses have been studied for possible longevity effects on laboratory animals because of a possible CR-mimic effect; they include [[rapamycin]],&lt;ref name=source25&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Rapamycin fed late in life extends lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice | journal = Nature | volume = 460 |pages = 392–5 | doi=10.1038/nature08221 | pmid=19587680 | pmc=2786175 | author=Harrison DE, Strong R, Sharp ZD, ''et al.''| bibcode=2009Natur.460..392H }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[metformin]] and other [[geroprotector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2005 | title = Identification of Potential Caloric Restriction Mimetics by Microarray Profiling | journal = Physiological Genomics | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 343–50 | pmid = 16189280 | doi=10.1152/physiolgenomics.00069.2005 | author=Dhahbi JM, Mote PL, Fahy GM, Spindler SR}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MitoQ]], [[resveratrol]] and [[pterostilbene]] are [[dietary supplements]] that have also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Kaeberlein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaeberlein|first=Matt|title=Resveratrol, pterostilbene and rapamycin:are they anti-aging drugs?|journal=BioEssays|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=96–99|doi=10.1002/bies.200900171|pmid=20091754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Low Dose of Dietary Resveratrol Partially Mimics Caloric Restriction and Retards Aging Parameters in Mice | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 3| issue = 6| pages = e2264| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002264 | pmid=18523577 | pmc=2386967 | year=2008 | author=Barger JL, Kayo T, Vann JM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2264B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23691264 | doi=10.1155/2013/575482 | volume=2013 | title=A review of pterostilbene antioxidant activity and disease modification | pmc=3649683 | year=2013 | journal=Oxid Med Cell Longev | page=575482 | author=McCormack D, McFadden D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attempts to create anti-aging drugs have taken different research paths. One notable direction of research has been research into the possibility of using the enzyme [[telomerase]] in order to counter the process of [[telomere shortening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Telomeres and Telomerase Basic Science Implications for Aging | journal = American Geriatrics Society | volume = 49 | issue = 8| pages = 1105–1109 | doi = 10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49217.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are potential dangers in this, since some research has also linked telomerase to cancer and to tumor growth and formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0147| pmid = 16179494| title = Telomerase and Cancer: Kirk A.

===Nanotechnology===
Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated [[Cell (biology)|cell]] repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular [[computers]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical [[nanomachines]] (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Cloning and body part replacement===
Some life extensionists suggest that [[therapeutic cloning]] and [[stem cell]] research could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as [[reproductive cloning]]) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Donald |last=Melanson |date=April 22, 2008 |title=DoD establishes institute tasked with regrowing body parts |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/04/22/dod-establishes-institute-tasked-with-regrowing-body-parts/ |publisher=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to [[transplant rejection|rejection]] and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Roxanne |last=Khamsi |date=April 4, 2006 |title=Bio-engineered bladders successful in patients |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8939-bioengineered-bladders-successful-in-patients.html |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.

The use of human [[stem cells]], particularly [[embryonic stem cells]], is controversial. Opponents' objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Christine |last=White |date=19 August 2005 |title=Umbilical stem cell breakthrough |url=http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720054316/http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |archivedate=20 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversies over cloning are similar, except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to [[reproductive cloning]]. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies, lacking consciousness, for eventual brain transplantation.

===Cyborgs===
{{Main|Cyborg}}
Replacement of biological (susceptible to diseases) organs with mechanical ones could extend life. This is the goal of the [[2045 Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;David Segal for the New York Times. 1 June 2013 [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/dmitry-itskov-and-the-avatar-quest.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 This Man Is Not a Cyborg. Yet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryonics===
{{Main|Cryonics}}
For cryonicists (advocates of [[cryopreservation]]), storing the body at low temperatures after death may provide an "ambulance" into a future in which advanced medical technologies may allow resuscitation and repair. They speculate [[cryogenic]] temperatures will minimize changes in biological tissue for many years, giving the medical community ample time to cure all disease, rejuvenate the aged and repair any damage that is caused by the [[cryopreservation]] process.

Many cryonicists do not believe that [[legal death]] is "[[Medical definition of death|real death]]" because stoppage of [[heart rate|heartbeat]] and [[breath]]ing—the usual medical criteria for legal death—occur before biological death of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Even at room [[temperature]], cells may take hours to die and days to [[decompose]]. Although [[neurological]] damage occurs within 4–6 minutes of cardiac arrest, the irreversible [[neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] processes do not manifest for hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Neuronal necrosis after middle cerebral artery occlusion in Wistar rats progresses at different time intervals in the caudoputamen and the cortex |journal=Stroke |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=636–42; discussion 643 |date=1995 |pmid=7709411 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.26.4.636 |author=Garcia JH, Liu KF, Ho KL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryonicists {{who|date=July 2017}}state that rapid cooling and [[heart|cardio]]-[[lung|pulmonary]] support applied immediately after certification of death can preserve [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] for long-term preservation at [[cryogenic]] [[temperature]]s. People, particularly children, have survived up to an hour without heartbeat after submersion in ice water. In one case, full recovery was reported after 45 minutes underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Full recovery after 45 min accidental submersion |journal=Intensive Care Medicine |volume=28 |issue=4 |page=524 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11967613 |doi=10.1007/s00134-002-1245-2 |author=Perk L, Borger van de Burg F, Berendsen HH, van't Wout JW}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate rapid preservation of cells and tissue, cryonics "standby teams" are available to wait by the bedside of patients who are to be cryopreserved to apply cooling and cardio-pulmonary support as soon as possible after declaration of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/standby.html |title=Comprehensive Member Standby |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[mammal]] has been successfully cryopreserved and brought back to life, with the exception of [[embryo cryopreservation|frozen human embryos]]. Resuscitation of a postembryonic human from [[cryonics]] is not possible with current science. Some scientists still support the idea based on their expectations of the [[technological singularity|capabilities of future science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imminst.org/cryonics_letter/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Cryonics |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html |title=Advances in Cryonics |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategies for engineered negligible senescence===
{{Main|Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|Genetics of aging}}
Another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of [[stem cell]]s and [[tissue engineering]], [[telomere]]-lengthening machinery, [[allotopic expression]] of [[mitochondrial]] proteins, targeted ablation of cells, [[immunotherapy|immunotherapeutic]] clearance, and novel [[lysosome|lysosomal]] [[hydrolases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Aubrey |last=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |author2=Michael Rae |title=[[Ending Aging|Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime]] |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2007 |location=[[New York City]] |isbn= 978-0-312-36706-0 |oclc=132583222}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic editing===
{{Main|Genome editing}}
[[Genome editing]], in which [[nucleic acid]] polymers are delivered as a [[Biologic medical product|drug]] and are either [[gene expression|expressed]] as proteins, interfere with the expression of proteins, or correct genetic mutations, has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Neuroendocrinology of Aging: The Potential of Gene Therapy as an Interventive Strategy |journal=Gerontology |date=2001-01-08 |first=Rodolfo G. |last=Goya |author2=Federico Bolognani |author3=Claudia B.

A large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, and mice. As of 2013, the longest extension of life caused by a single gene manipulation was roughly 50% in mice and 10-fold in [[nematode]] worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks1155| pmid = 23193293| pmc = 3531213| title = Human Ageing Genomic Resources: Integrated databases and tools for the biology and genetics of ageing| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| volume = 41| issue = Database issue| pages = D1027–33| year = 2012| last1 = Tacutu | first1 = R.| last2 = Craig | first2 = T.| last3 = Budovsky | first3 = A.| last4 = Wuttke | first4 = D.| last5 = Lehmann | first5 = G.| last6 = Taranukha | first6 = D.| last7 = Costa | first7 = J.| last8 = Fraifeld | first8 = V.

===Fooling genes===
In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] describes an approach to life-extension that involves "fooling genes" into thinking the body is young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | pages = 41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to [[Peter Medawar]]. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on, and we should be able to do so by "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind uploading===
{{Main|Mind uploading}}
One hypothetical future strategy that, as some suggest,{{who|date=July 2017}} "eliminates" the complications related to a physical body, involves the copying or transferring (e.g. by progressively replacing neurons with transistors) of a conscious mind from a biological brain to a non-biological computer system or computational device. The basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail, and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Anders|last=Sandberg| author1-link=Anders Sandberg|first2=Nick|last2=Boström| author2-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap|quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.''|url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2013|series= Technical Report #2008‐3|year=2008| publisher = Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not an exact copy of one's mind constitutes actual life extension is matter of debate.

===Young blood injection===

The '''life sciences''' or '''biological sciences''' comprise the [[branches of science]] that involve the scientific study of [[life]] and [[organism]]s – such as [[microorganism]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s including [[human being]]s. 

Life science is one of the two major branches of [[natural science]], the other being [[physical Science|physical science]], which is concerned with non-living matter. 

By definition, [[biology]] is the [[natural science]] that studies life and living organisms, with the other life sciences being its sub-disciplines. 

Some life sciences focus on a specific type of organism. For example, [[zoology]] is the study of [[animals]], while [[botany]] is the study of plants. Other life sciences focus on aspects common to all or many life forms, such as [[anatomy]] and [[genetics]]. Some focus on the micro scale (e.g. [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]]) other on larger scales (e.g. [[Cell biology|cytology]], [[immunology]], [[ethology]], [[ecology]]). Another major, branch of life sciences involves understanding the [[mind]]{{spaced ndash}}[[neuroscience]].

Life sciences discoveries are helpful in improving the quality and standard of life, and have applications in health, agriculture, medicine, and the pharmaceutical and food science industries.

==Basic life science branches==
{{Main|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}

[[Biology]] &amp;ndash; burst and eclectic field, composed of many branches and sub-disciplines. However, despite the complexity and the broad scope of the science, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into a single, coherent field. Here are some of biology's major branches:
* [[Anatomy]] – study of form and function, in plants, animals, and other organisms, or specifically in humans
* [[Astrobiology]] – the study of the formation and presence of life in the universe
* [[Biochemistry]] – study of the chemical reactions required for life to exist and function, usually a focus on the cellular level

*[[Bioinformatics]] &amp;ndash; developing of methods or software tools for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data to generate useful biological knowledge

* [[Biolinguistics]] – study of the biology and evolution of language
*[[Biological Anthropology|Biological anthropology]] – the study of humans, non-human primates, and hominids. Also known as physical anthropology

Biomaterials science encompasses elements of [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[tissue engineering]] and [[materials science]].
* [[Biomedical science]] &amp;ndash; healthcare science, also known as biomedical science, is a set of [[applied science]]s applying portions of [[natural science]] or [[formal science]], or both, to develop knowledge, interventions, or technology of use in [[healthcare]] or [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_091137?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dID=181510&amp;Rendition=Web |title=The Future of the Healthcare Science Workforce.

* [[Biopolymer]] &amp;ndash; [[polymer]]s produced by living organisms; in other words, they are polymeric [[biomolecule]]s. Since they are [[polymer]]s, biopolymers contain [[monomeric]] units that are covalently bonded to form larger structures. There are three main classes of biopolymers, classified according to the monomeric units used and the structure of the biopolymer formed: [[polynucleotide]]s ([[RNA]] and [[DNA]]), which are long polymers composed of 13 or more [[nucleotide]] [[monomers]]; [[polypeptides]], which are short polymers of amino acids; and [[polysaccharides]], which are often linear bonded polymeric carbohydrate structures.&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, A.K., et al., ''Natural Fibers, Biopolymers, and Biocomposites'' (CRC Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandra, R., and Rustgi, R., "Biodegradable Polymers", Progress in Polymer Science, Vol. 23, p. 1273 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, M.A., et al., "Biological Materials: Structure &amp; Mechanical Properties", Progress in Materials Science, Vol. 53, p. 1 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, A., et al., "Smart Polymers: Physical Forms &amp; Bioengineering Applications", Progress in Polymer Science, Vol. 32, p.1205 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Longevity escape velocity''' (sometimes referred to as '''Actuarial escape velocity'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/03/actuarial-escap.html singularity2050.com/2008/03/actuarial-escap.html]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a term used in the [[Anti-aging movement|life extension movement]].  It is a hypothetical situation in which [[life expectancy]] is being extended longer than the time that is passing.  For example, in a given year in which longevity escape velocity would be maintained, technological advances would increase life expectancy more than the year that just went by.

Life expectancy increases slightly every year as treatment strategies and technologies improve. At present, more than one year of research is required for each additional year of expected life. Longevity escape velocity occurs when this ratio reverses, so that life expectancy increases faster than one year per one year of research, as long as that rate of advance is sustainable.&lt;ref name=mattersnow&gt;{{Citation

}}'''''Man after Man: An Anthropology of the Future''''' is a 1990 [[speculative evolution]] book written by Scottish geologist [[Dougal Dixon]] and illustrated by Philip Hood. The book also features a foreword by [[Brian Aldiss]]. ''Man After Man'' explores a hypothetical future path of [[human evolution]] set from 200 years in the future to 5 million years in the future, with several future human species [[Evolution|evolving]] through [[genetic engineering]] and natural means through the course of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Man After Man|last=Dixon|first=Dougal|publisher=Blandford Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0713720716|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Man after Man'' is Dixon's third work on speculative evolution, following ''[[After Man]]'' (1981), which explored the animals of a hypothetical world 50 million years in the future where humanity had gone extinct, and ''[[The New Dinosaurs]]'' (1988), which explored the animals of a world where the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] never occurred. Unlike the previous two books, which were written much like [[Field guide|field guides]] and explored factual natural processes through fictional examples and worlds, the focus of ''Man after Man'' lies much on the individual perspectives of future human individuals of various species, mainly focused on how they perceive the changing climate, which they are specifically engineered to be adapted to, around themselves.

==Plot summary==
200 years hence (the year 2190 A.D.) [[climate change]] has changed the face of the planet. With rising sea levels swallowing coastal cities and the environmental impact of overpopulation becoming apparent in a lack of resources, [[Societal collapse|civilization is slowly collapsing]], with a few selected humans escaping [[Earth]] to [[Space colonization|colonize space]]. To effectively construct great starships, governments have engineered new human species to aid in gathering resources underwater - the aquamorph (''Homo aquaticus''), with [[Gill|gills]] instead of lungs - and species to aid in construction in the [[vacuum]] of space - the vacuumorph (''Homo caelestis''). 

300 years hence, the [[anatomically modern humans]] that stayed behind on Earth have split into The Hitek (''Homo sapiens machinadiumentum''), almost totally dependent on [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] technology, [[Human enhancement|augmenting]] and keeping their bodies alive way past their natural lifespans, and their handlers (still ''Homo sapiens sapiens''). Though the older genetically engineered species in space and underwater have become extinct as a result of fulfilling their purpose and being sterile, a new species of fertile underwater human, the Aquatics (''Piscanthropus submarinus'') are created as a final project by the genetic engineering facilities before they are shut down.

500 years hence, the Hitek pursue to construct genetically altered humans to sustainably occupy niches in the ecologically recovering world. These new species include the [[Plain|plains]]-dweller (''Homo campis fabricatus'') designed to live on open grasslands with the adaptations of a large herbivorous mammal, the [[forest]]-dweller (''Homo silvis fabricatus'') created to live in [[rainforests]], the [[tundra]]-dweller (''Homo glacis fabricatus'') adapted to a [[polar climate]] and the [[Temperate Woodland|temperate woodland]]-dweller (''Homo virgultis fabricatus''), superficially similar to the ancient [[Australopithecine|australopithecines]]. Genetic material used to make these species is derived from the Andlas, anatomically modern humans who mostly live as farmers and fishermen (the word "Andlas" being speech corruption of "Handlers"). 

1000 years hence, some Hitek choose to abandon their "mechanical cradles" in favor of artificially created organs and "biological cradles", becoming a new species known as the Tics (''Homo sapiens accessiomembrum''). Both the Hitek and the Tics artificially manufacture food products to sustain themselves, relying on [[Solar energy|solar]] and [[marine energy]] harvesting to fuel their processing facilities. A [[magnetic reversal]] results in the failure of the navigation, communication and energy harvesting technologies that the Hitek and Tics rely on, causing their extinction. The magnetic reversal also impacts the farming, animal husbandry and hunting of the Andlas, leading to their (and by extension ''Homo sapiens'' as a whole) extinction. The disaster leaves the genetically engineered animal-like species as the sole living human descendants.

As a result of the extinction of ''Homo sapiens'', these humans can no longer be genetically tweaked and altered in labs and instead they begin to evolve through [[natural selection]] and other natural evolutionary processes, resulting in many new and diverse forms over the course of several millions of years. These new species range from the memory people (''Homo mensproavadorum'') that through their genes can [[Genetic memory (psychology)|recall memories of previous generations]], [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] humans (symbionts) consisting of a symbiont carrier (''Baiulus moderatorum'') providing movement and protection against the cold and a hunter symbiont (''Moderator baiuli''), colonial and [[Beehive|hive]]-building humans with a single reproductive parent (socials, ''Alvearanthropus desertus''), [[Parasitism|parasitic]] humans (''Nananthropus parasitus'') attaching themselves with sharp teeth and claws to the flesh of their [[Host (biology)|hosts]] (''Penarius pinguis''), [[goblin]]-like fishing humans (fish-eaters, ''Piscator longidigitus''), [[ant]]-eating humans (ant-men, ''Formifossor angustus'') and saber-toothed predatory humans (spiketooths, ''Acudens ferox''). 

After five million years of uninterrupted evolution, the spacefaring descendants of those humans that escaped into space return to the planet. No longer recognizing the planet as their home world and bearing little resemblance to their original ancestors after five millions of years of genetic engineering, the spacefarers dramatically [[Xenoforming|xenoform]] Earth and cover it in vast domed alien cities. The spacefarers wear pressurized suits and use [[Cyborg|cyborg-technology]] to fuse the bodies of the few human species they find useful on the planet with air tanks and respiration systems. Genetic engineering is used to modify the human descendants on Earth into giant building humans ("engineered pack-animals") and tiny humans working intricate machinery to aid in city construction and maintenance. Genetically modified species are also created for other purposes, such as [[antelope]]-like humans that serve as mounts and grotesque massive humans whose flesh is processed and consumed as food. As with the civilization of modern man and the Hitek before, this new era of civilization eventually falls apart, the spacefarers leaving Earth in ruins after consuming all the resources the planet had to offer. All terrestrial life on the planet perishes as the atmosphere is almost emptied of oxygen, leaving most of the human descendants extinct. Only a [[deep sea]] descendant of the aquatics, ''Piscanthropus profundus'', survives the [[extinction event]] and continues to evolve, expressing curiosity in what lies above the water.

== Development ==
Dixon's previous [[speculative evolution]] book projects, ''[[After Man]]'' (1981) and ''[[The New Dinosaurs]]'' (1988), used fictional examples to examplify real-life factual natural processes. ''After Man'' focused on the processes within evolution and projected them into a hypothetical future scenario set 50 million years after the extinction of mankind, where various hypothetical future animal species were used to explain the concepts within evolution. ''The New Dinosaurs'', meanwhile, had a focus on the science of [[zoogeography]], using fictional species in a world where the [[Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] never happened to explain the process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite interview|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/of-after-man-the-new-dinosaurs-and-greenworld-an-interview-with-dougal-dixon/|title=Of After Man, The New Dinosaurs and Greenworld: an interview with Dougal Dixon|last=Naish|first=Darren|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, ''Man After Man'' was intended to be a project where fictional examples would be used to explain factual processes, like the previous books. The original idea involved mankind avoiding catastrophes such as [[overpopulation]] and [[Mass Starvation|mass starvation]] by inventing [[time travel]] and moving 50 million years into the future to re-establish civilization. This original ''Man After Man'' would have been set in the same world as ''After Man'' and would have focused on man-made catastrophes destroying the ecosystem established in the previous book. Dixon was reluctant to be involved in the final version of the project, which instead focused on changing climate conditions through the eyes of future human species engineered to adapt to them,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview|url=http://www.ough.gr/index.php?mod=articles&amp;op=view&amp;id=562&amp;lang=en|title=An interview with Dougal Dixon - OUGH.gr|website=OUGH.gr|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has in subsequent interviews referred to it as a "disaster of a project".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The original ''Man After Man'' concept, mankind destroying an established ecosystem, was later used by Dixon for another project where mankind colonized an alien planet with a complex and unique ecosystem. This project, published as the book ''Greenworld'' in 2010 (though so far only released in [[Japan]]) follows human colonization of the planet Greenworld over the course of a thousand years, showing how mankind affects its ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">'''Mortality displacement''' denotes a temporary increase in the [[mortality rate]] (number of deaths) in a given population, also known as '''excess mortality''' or '''excess mortality rate'''. It is usually attributable to environmental phenomena such as [[heat wave]]s, [[wikt:cold snap|cold spell]]s, [[epidemic]]s and [[pandemic]]s, especially [[influenza pandemic]]s, [[famine]] or [[war]].

During heat waves, for instance, there are often additional deaths observed in the population, affecting especially older adults and those who are sick.  After some periods with excess mortality, however, there has also been observed a decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks.  Such short-term forward shift in mortality rate is also referred to as '''harvesting effect'''.  The subsequent, compensatory reduction in mortality suggests that the heat wave had affected especially those whose health is already so compromised that they "would have died in the short term anyway".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240305/ The Impact of Heat Waves and Cold Spells on Mortality Rates in the Dutch Population]'' Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 109, Number 5, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Death march]]es can also lead to a significant mortality displacement, such as in the [[Trail of Tears]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], and the [[Bataan death march]], wherein the oldest, weakest, and sickest died first.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The early modern age saw various economic changes as well as several significant diseases that have affected the mortality rates. Data collection during this time was not consistent or broadly recorded and there have been efforts to reconstruct plausible statistics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laqueur|first=Thomas|title=The Work of the Dead: A Cultural History of Mortal Remains|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|volume=72|issue=4|pages=504–506|doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrx024|issn=0022-5045|via=|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates vary on geographic location, social environment, and cultural values.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There were also gender differences in the mortality rates, leading to an excess mortality rate in urban areas and in the female population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Derosas|first=Renzo|title=Life Under Pressure: Mortality And Living Standards In Europe And Asia, 1700-1900|date=|url=|work=Infant and Child Mortality|volume=|pages=327–398, 431–440|publisher=|isbn=|access-date=2018-07-24|last2=Breschi|first2=Marco|last3=Fornasin|first3=Alessio|last4=Manfredini|first4=Matteo|last5=Munno|first5=Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main cause of death was [[stillbirth]], which could be attributed to, but not limited to, maternal infections, birth complications, and congenital anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/epidemiology/stillbirth/en/|title=Stillbirths|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another contributing factor to the mortality rate was food insecurity and shortages as well as unemployment, both of which varied per region.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Post|first=John D.|date=1990|title=The Mortality Crises of the Early 1770s and European Demographic Trends|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=21|issue=1|pages=29|doi=10.2307/204917|issn=0022-1953|jstor=204917}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final factor was violence, which occurred mainly due to [[Structural violence|structural]] or systemic violence; however, violence since the 12th century has been steadily falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Campbell|first=Roderick Campbell|title=Toward a Deep History of Violence and Civilization|url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=2084655|work=Violence and Civilization: Studies of Social Violence in History and Prehistory|volume=|pages=1–22|publisher=|isbn=9781782976202|access-date=2018-07-25|date=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Steven Pinker on the myth of violence|last=Pinker|first=Steven|date=2007|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|doi = 10.1037/e597002010-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Collection ==
Data from the early modern age was not accurately or consistently collected. However, there have been a number of studies and reconstructed statistics from this era, particularly on children and women. There has not been any empirical research published and the only information has been theoretical as there has been insufficient data and sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was also common for many statistics to go unreported; this is especially true regarding unmarried women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Models and theoretic equations need to take into account "social, economic, cultural, geographical, and even climatological variables" in order to accurately reflect the statistics of the time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Gender differences ==
One study, the Eurasia Project, has shown that boys, especially those under one year, had a higher mortality rate during childhood than girls, but the mortality rate for men and women were about equal. It has also been shown that there is a higher male mortality than female mortality rate during the time of famine. Male mortality has also been linked to "economic modernization and urbanization ... especially for cardiovascular disease".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Women faced increased mortality during childbirth as pregnancy and childbirth compromised the mother's immune system, with the most common causes of death being [[Postpartum infections|puerperal fever]], [[Pre-eclampsia|toxemia]], and [[Postpartum bleeding|hemorrhage]]. These dangers suggest an association to the excess female mortality, especially considering that women had to compete more for resources as they had no property rights and had a lower ranking in the household hierarchy. The average age of childbearing differed between Asia and Europe with an average difference of five years, which would affect cross-cultural data collection. Children born to mothers 35 years or older had a higher risk of mortality than children born to younger mothers. linking a mother's health and a child's survival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Female infants and children often had a higher mortality rate, especially in times of food insecurity, compared to male infants and children. However, a maternal presence worked as a protective factor for children. regardless of age or gender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Economics ==
Food insecurity and shortages were common throughout this time period and were matched with the high food prices and high unemployment rate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is shown through the differences in mortality rates between the lower and upper class, with poor infants being up to two times more likely to die than their wealthier counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 17th century Europe, it was common that at least one in five children from the same family would die before the age of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21375348|title=Making sex : body and gender from the Greeks to Freud|last=Walter.|first=Laqueur, Thomas|date=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674543492|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=21375348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this high rate, it was common for there to be a large amount of children in one family so that there would be a higher rate of survival. Especially among poorer families, having multiple children was common in order to ensure there would be children to contribute to the family later on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the early modern era, house calls were common. If the patient was female, the doctor, commonly an upper class male, would typically be summoned by a male family member who wound remain throughout the examination. The physician and male family member would then discuss the diagnosis and treatment plan without the female's input. This practice reinforced and perpetuated social hierarchies and patriarchal values.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Furth|first=Charlotte|date=1999-03-05|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|journal=Isis|volume=93|issue=3|pages=479–480|doi=10.1086/374084|isbn=9780520208292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and diseases ==

Food shortages and insecurity were leading concerns in the 18th century, especially in Europe, and these were exacerbated by reduced harvests yields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Disease was another leading cause of death, with rats and fleas being the common carriers of disease, specifically plagues, during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html|title=FAQ {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]] was a plague that affected much of the world, originating in Asia and spreading to Europe through diseased fleas and rats. This epidemic has been reported to have been the cause of death for approximately "60% of the European population".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the end of the 19th century, there was a plague, known as the [[Third plague pandemic|Modern Plague]], that started in China and spread to different cities through ports, reportedly causing roughly ten million deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/history/index.html|title=History {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|date=2018-05-31|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plague affected Asia, the Americas, and Africa and lasted into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There were also epidemics that occurred locally and did not spread to national levels, notably in 18th century England.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These local epidemics included fevers, dysentery, smallpox, starvation, typhoid fever, under-nutrition, cholera, malaria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

By the end of the era, [[disease]] and [[malnutrition]] were no longer the main leading causes of death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3015">'''Oocyte selection''' is a procedure that is performed prior to [[in vitro fertilization]], in order to use [[oocytes]] with maximal chances of resulting in pregnancy. In contrast, [[embryo selection]] takes place ''after'' fertilization.

==Techniques==
Chromosomal evaluation may be performed. Embryos from rescued in vitro-matured [[metaphase II]] (IVM-MII) oocytes show significantly higher fertilization rates and more blastomeres per embryo compared with those from arrested [[metaphase I]] (MI) oocytes (58.5% vs. 43.9% and 5.7 vs. 5.0, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Strassburger D, Goldstein A, Friedler S, etal |title=The cytogenetic constitution of embryos derived from immature (metaphase I) oocytes obtained after ovarian hyperstimulation |journal=Fertil.

Also, morphological features of the oocyte that can be obtained by standard [[light microscopy|light]] or [[polarized light microscopy]]. However, there is no clear tendency in recent publications to a general increase in predictive value of morphological features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq029| last1 = Rienzi | first1 = L. | last2 = Vajta | first2 = G. | last3 = Ubaldi | first3 = F. | title = Predictive value of oocyte morphology in human IVF: a systematic review of the literature | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–45 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20639518 | pmc = 3001337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested techniques include ''[[zona pellucida]] imaging'', which can detect differences in [[birefringence]] between eggs, which is a predictor of [[embryo compaction|compaction]], [[blastulation]] and pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ebner T, Balaban B, Moser M, etal |title=Automatic user-independent zona pellucida imaging at the oocyte stage allows for the prediction of preimplantation development |journal=Fertil.

[[Image:Indian family in Brazil posed in front of hut.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|Humans traditionally lived in family-based social structures and artificial shelters.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}]]
'''Personal life''' is the course of an [[personhood|individual]]'s life, especially when viewed as the sum of personal choices contributing to one's [[identity (social science)|personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Baker| first1 = Maureen| title = Choices and Constraints in Family Life| edition = 2| location = Don Mills, Ontario| publisher = Oxford University Press| publication-date = 2010| page = 1| isbn = 978-0-19-543159-9| quote = In this book, I argue that intimate relationships are certainly influenced by our personal preferences but to a large extent our 'choices' are shaped by family circumstances and events in the wider society [...] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient past, most people's time was limited by the need to meet necessities such as food and shelter and there was not much [[leisure time]]. People identified with their [[social role]] in their community, and engaged in [[job]]s based on necessity rather than personal choice. [[Privacy]] in such communities was rare.

The modern conception of personal life is an offshoot of modern Western society. A modern person tends to distinguish one's work from one's personal life. It is a person's choices and preferences outside work that define personal life, including one's choice of hobbies, cultural interests, manner of dress, and so on. In particular, what activities one engages in during leisure-time defines a person's personal life. For instance, a typical American has about five hours of leisure time per day, more than half of which is spent on watching TV.

People in Western countries, such as the [[United States]], tend to value privacy. Privacy includes both [[information privacy]] and decisional privacy; people expect to be left alone with respect to intimate details of their life and they expect to be free from undue control by others.

In the past, before modern [[technology]] largely alleviated issues of economic [[scarcity]] in industrialised countries, most people spent a large portion of their time attempting to provide their basic survival needs, including water, food, and protection from the weather.&lt;ref name="Van Loon"&gt;{{cite book|last= Van Loon|first=Hendrik|title= The Story of Mankind|year= 1921|publisher= Boni and Liveright, Inc.|location= New York|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/VanStor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans needed [[survival skills]] for the sake of both themselves and their community; food needed to be harvested and shelters needed to be maintained.&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gupta |first=Anil K. |title=Origin of agriculture and domestication of plants and animals linked to early Holocene climate amelioration |journal=Current Science |date=10 July 2004 |volume=87 |issue=1 |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul102004/54.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031122606/http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul102004/54.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 October 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was little [[privacy]] in a community, and people identified one another according to their social role.&lt;ref name=Barnard&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=Alan J.|title= Hunter-gatherers in history, archaeology and anthropology|year=2004|publisher= Berg Publishers|isbn= 978-1-85973-825-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Labour (economics)|Jobs]] were assigned out of necessity rather than personal choice.&lt;ref name=ERA&gt;{{cite web|title=Why did anthropologists get interested in peasants?|url= http://era.anthropology.ac.uk/Era_Resources/Era/Peasants/intro2.html|work= Experience Rich Anthropology|publisher= University of Kent at Canterbury|accessdate= 26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, individuals in many [[ancient culture]]s primarily viewed their [[self-existence]] under the aspect of a larger social whole, often one with [[mythological]] underpinnings which placed the individual in relation to the [[cosmos]].&lt;ref name=Percy&gt;{{cite book|last=Percy|first=Walker|title= Lost in the cosmos: the last self-help book|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-25399-8|authorlink= Walker Percy}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in such cultures found their identity not through their individual [[choice]]s—indeed, they may not have been able to conceive a choice which was purely individual.

For example, the continents of Africa and Asia are still largely mired in [[poverty]] and [[third-world]] conditions, without technology, secure shelter, or reliable food sources. In such places, the concepts of a "personal life", "[[self-actualization]]", "personal fulfillment", or "[[privacy]]" are often unaffordable luxuries.&lt;ref name=Maslow&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1037/h0054346|last= Maslow|first= A.

The English philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632-1704) figures among the pioneers in discussing the concept of [[individual rights]]. In the 17th century he promoted the natural rights of the individual to [[right to life|life]], [[liberty]], and [[property]], and included the [[pursuit of happiness]] as one of the individual's goals.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Like democratic materialism, democratic individualism led to the death of civic life and opened the door to any despotic power that would assume responsibility for shared interests. [...] We need to recognize that Toqueville [..] treated the United States as something of an exception. He had described the American republic as shielded from the worst effects of democratic materialism; in his analysis, it was also insulated from individualism.

This [[9 to 5]] paradigm regards work and [[recreation]] as distinct; one is either on the job or not, and the transition is abrupt. Employees have certain hours they are bound to work, and work during recreational time is rare. This may{{original research inline|date= August 2016}} reflect the continuing specialization of jobs and the demand for increased efficiency, both at work and at home. The common phrase "Work hard, play hard" illustrates this mindset. There is a growing{{quantify|date= August 2016}} trend, however, toward living more holistically and minimizing such rigid distinctions between work and play, in order to achieve an "appropriate" [[work–life balance]].{{citation needed|date= August 2016}}

The way in which individuals make use of their spare time also plays an important role in defining their personal lives. In general, leisure activities can be categorised as either passive, in cases when no real effort is required, or active, when substantial physical or mental energy is needed.&lt;ref name=Stebbins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stebbins|first=Robert A.|title=Choice and Experiential Definitions of Leisure|journal=LSA Newsletter|date=November 2002|volume=63|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~stebbins/reflections1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive activities include watching [[television]], listening to [[music]], watching sports activities or going to the [[movie theatre|cinema]]. The individual simply relaxes without any special effort.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Active activities may be more or less intensive ranging from [[walking]], through [[jogging]] and [[cycling]] to sports such as [[tennis]] or [[football]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11746">In biology, '''polyspermy''' describes an [[Ovum|egg]] that has been [[Fertilisation|fertilized]] by more than one [[Spermatozoon|sperm]].  [[Ploidy|Diploid]] organisms normally contain two copies of each [[chromosome]], one from each parent.  The cell resulting from polyspermy, on the other hand, contains three or more copies of each chromosome—one from the egg and one each from multiple sperm.  Usually, the result is an inviable [[zygote]]. This may occur because sperm are too efficient at reaching and fertilizing eggs due to the selective pressures of [[sperm competition]]. Such a situation is often deleterious to the female: in other words, the [[male-male competition]] among sperm spills over to create [[sexual conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnqvist, G. &amp; Rowe, L. (2005) ''Sexual conflict''. Princeton University Press, Princeton {{ISBN|0-691-12217-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicken and zebra finch eggs require multiple sperm==
In the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1818/20151682 |title=Polyspermy in birds: sperm numbers and embryo survival}}&lt;/ref&gt; as reported in the New York Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/science/bird-eggs-are-fertilized-by-more-than-one-sperm.html |title=Bird Eggs are fertilized by more than one sperm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Nicola Hemmings, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sheffield, and one of the study’s authors, reported that eggs of zebra finches and chickens require multiple sperm, from 10 to hundreds of sperm, to penetrate the egg to ensure successful fertilization and growth of the bird embryo.

== Physiological polyspermy ==
Physiological polyspermy happens when the egg normally accepts more than one sperm but only one of the multiple sperm will actually fuse its nucleus with the nucleus of the egg. Physiological polyspermy is present in some species of vertebrates and invertebrates. Some species utilize physiological polyspermy as the proper mechanism for developing their offspring. Some of these animals include birds, [[ctenophora]], reptiles and amphibians, just to name a few. Some vertebrates that are both [[amniote]] or anamniote. For example, [[urodele amphibians]], [[cartilaginous fish]], birds and reptiles, undergo physiological polyspermy because of the [[internal fertilization]] of their yolky eggs. Sperm triggers [[egg activation]] by the induction of free calcium ion concentration in the cytoplasm of the egg. This induction plays a very critical role in both physiological polyspermy and monomeric polyspermy species. The rise in calcium causes activation of the egg. The egg will then be altered on both a biochemical and morphological level.&lt;ref&gt;Iwao, Y. (2012). Egg activation in physiological polyspermy. Reproduction, 144(1), 11-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In mammals as well as sea urchins, the sudden rise in calcium concentration occurs because of the influx of calcium ions within the egg. These calcium ions are responsible for the [[cortical granule]] reaction, and are also stored in the egg's endoplasmic reticulum.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert SF. Developmental Biology. 6th edition. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer Associates; 2000. Gamete Fusion and the Prevention of Polyspermy. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10033/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Physiological Polyspermy.png|thumb|During Physiological Polyspermy, the egg accepts multiple sperms but only allows one sperm to fuse its nucleus with the egg's nucleus.]] 

Unlike physiological polyspermy, monospermic fertilization deals with the analysis of the egg calcium waves, as this is the typical reproduction process in all species. Species that undergo physiological polyspermy have [[polypoidy]]-preventing mechanisms that act inside the egg. This is quite different from the normal polyspermy block on the outside of the egg.&lt;ref&gt;Grandin, N. A. T. H. A. L. I. E., &amp; Charbonneau, M. I. C. H. E. L. (1992). Intracellular free Ca2+ changes during physiological polyspermy in amphibian eggs. Development, 114(3), 617-624.&lt;/ref&gt; However, polyspermy is impossible in human reproduction. The decline in the numbers of sperm that swim to the oviduct is one of two ways that prevents polyspermy in humans. The other mechanism is the blocking of sperm in the fertilized egg.&lt;ref&gt;Mio, Y., Iwata, K., Yumoto, K., Kai, Y., Sargant, H. C., Mizoguchi, C., … Nishikori, K. (2012). Possible mechanism of polyspermy block in human oocytes observed by time-lapse cinematography. Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics, 29(9), 951–956. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-012-9815-x&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Developmental Biology Interactive, if an egg becomes fertilized by multiple sperm, the embryo will then gain various paternal centrioles. When this happens, there is a struggle for extra chromosomes. This competition causes disarrayment in [[cleavage furrow]] formation and the consequence is death of the [[zygote]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.devbio.biology.gatech.edu/?page_id=519&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fast block of polyspermy==
The eggs of [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] organisms are [[adaptation|adapted]] to avoid this situation.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard, W. G. 1996. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A0kcDzAlYy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Female Control: Sexual Selection by Cryptic Female Choice]''. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt; The defenses are particularly well characterized in the [[sea urchin]], which responds to the acceptance of one sperm by inhibiting the successful penetration of the egg by subsequent sperm.  Similar defenses exist in other [[eukaryotes]].

The prevention of polyspermy in sea urchins depends on a change in the electrical [[charge (physics)|charge]] across the surface of the egg, which is caused by the fusion of the first sperm with the egg.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, LA.. 1976. Fast block to polyspermy in sea urchin eggs is electrically mediated. ''Nature" '''261''':68-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfertilized sea urchin eggs have a negative charge inside, but the charge becomes positive upon fertilization.  When sea urchin sperm encounter an egg with a positive charge, sperm-egg fusion is blocked.  Thus, after the first sperm contacts the egg and causes the change, subsequent sperms are prevented from fusing.  This "electrical polyspermy block" is thought to result because a positively charged molecule in the sperm surface [[membrane (biology)|membrane]] is repelled by the positive charge at the egg surface.&lt;ref&gt;Iwao, Y., Jaffe, L.A. 1989. Evidence that the voltage-dependent component in the fertilization process is contributed by the sperm. ''Developmental Biology''. '''134''':446-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical polyspermy blocks operate in many animal species, including [[frog]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[marine worm]]s, but not in the several [[mammal]]s that have been studied ([[hamster]], [[rabbit]], [[mouse]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, L. A.,  M. Gould. 1985. Polyspermy-preventing mechanisms. In C. B. Metz &amp; A. Monroy (editors) Biology of Fertilization. Academic, New York. pp. 223-250.&lt;/ref&gt;  In species without an electrical block, polyspermy is usually prevented by secretion of materials that establish a mechanical barrier to polyspermy.  Animals such as sea urchins have a two-step polyspermy prevention [[evolutionary game theory|strategy]], with the fast, but transient, electrical block superseded after the first minute or so by a more slowly developing permanent mechanical block.  It is thought that electrical blocks evolved in those species where a very fast block to polyspermy is needed, due to the presence of many sperm arriving simultaneously at the egg surface, as occurs in animals such as sea urchins.  In sea urchins, fertilization occurs externally in the ocean, such that hundreds of sperm can encounter the egg within several seconds.

==Slow block of polyspermy==
In mammals, in which fertilization occurs internally, fewer sperm reach the fertilization site in the [[oviduct]]. This may be the result of the female genital tract being adapted to minimize the number of sperm reaching the egg.&lt;ref&gt;Braden, A. W. H. 1953. Distribution of sperms in the genital tract of the female rabbit after coitus. ''Australian Journal of Biological Sciences'' '''6''':693-705.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, polyspermy preventing mechanisms are essential in mammals; a secretion reaction, the "[[cortical reaction]]" modifies the extracellular coat of the egg (the [[zona pellucida]]), and additional mechanisms that are not well understood modify the egg's plasma membrane.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, A.J, Evans, J.P. 2006. Mammalian membrane block to polyspermy: new insights into how mammalian eggs prevent fertilisation by multiple sperm. "Reprod Fertil Dev." '''18''':53-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The zona pellucida is modified by serine proteases that are released from the cortical granules. The proteases destroy the protein link between the cell membrane and the vitelline envelope, remove any receptors that other sperm have bound to, and help to form the fertilization envelope from the cortical granules.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|title=Developmental Biology, 10th ed.|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. Publishers|location=Sunderland, MA USA|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cortical reaction occurs due to calcium oscillations inside the oocyte. What triggers such oscillations is PLC-zeta, a phospholipase unique to sperm that is very sensitive to calcium concentrations. When the first spermatozoa gets inside the oocyte, it brings in PLC-zeta, that is activated by oocyte's basal calcium concentrations, initiates formation of IP3 and causes calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum stores, generating the oscillations in calcium concentration that will activate the oocyte and block polyspermy.&lt;ref&gt;Miao, YL &amp; Williams CJ. 2012. Calcium signaling in mammalian egg activation and embryo development: the influence of subcellular localization. Molecular Reproduction &amp; Development 79:742-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary advantage==
Female defenses select for ever more aggressive male sperm however, leading to an [[evolutionary arms race]]. On the one hand, polyspermy creates inviable zygotes and lowers female fitness, but on the other, defenses may prevent fertilization altogether. This leads to a delicate compromise between the two, and has been suggested as one possible cause for the relatively high [[infertility]] rates seen in mammalian species.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, E. H., G. Arnqvist, T. E. Pitcher. 2002. The evolution of infertility: Does hatching rate in birds coevolve with female polyandry? ''Journal of Evolutionary Biology''. '''15''':702-709.&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, polyspermy is allowed to happen resulting in more than one sperm entering the egg creating viable offspring without detrimental effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snook|first=Rhonda R.|last2=Hosken|first2=David J.|last3=Karr|first3=Timothy L.|date=2011-12-01|title=The biology and evolution of polyspermy: insights from cellular and functional studies of sperm and centrosomal behavior in the fertilized egg|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/142/6/779|journal=Reproduction|language=en|volume=142|issue=6|pages=779–792|doi=10.1530/REP-11-0255|issn=1470-1626|pmid=21964827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''(b)''' The reproduction probability peaks early in life at sexual maturity and then steadily decreases as an individual ages, with the remaining share of the population decreasing with age as they enter the selection shadow.]]
The '''selection shadow''' is a concept involved with the [[Senescence#Evolutionary theories|evolutionary theories of ageing]] that states that [[selection pressures]] on an individual decrease as an individual ages and passes [[sexual maturity]], resulting in a "shadow" of time where [[selective fitness]] is not considered. Over generations, this results in maladaptive mutations that accumulate later in life due to aging being non-adaptive toward reproductive fitness.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; The concept was first worked out by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Peter Medawar]] in the 1940s, with Medawar creating the first [[graphical model]].&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-evolution-of-aging-23651151 |title=The Evolution of Aging |last1=Fabian |first1=Daniel |last2=Flatt |first2=Thomas |date=2011 |website=[[Scitable]] |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
The model developed by Medawar states that due to the dangerous conditions and pressures from the environment, including predators and diseases, most individuals in the wild die not long after sexual maturity. Therefore, there is a low probability for individuals to survive to an advanced age and suffer the effects related to [[aging]]. In conjunction with this, the effects of natural selection decrease as age increases, so that later individual performance is ignored by selection forces.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; This results in beneficial [[mutations]] not being selected for if they only have a positive result later in life, along with later in life deleterious mutations not being selected against. Due to the fitness of an individual not being affected once it is past its reproductive prime, later mutations and effects are considered to be in the "shadow" of selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flatt |first=Thomas |last2=Schmidt |first2=Paul S. |date=July 18, 2009 |title=Integrating evolutionary and molecular genetics of aging |url=http://i122server.vu-wien.ac.at/pop/Flatt_website/FlattSchmidt09.pdf |journal=[[Biochimica et Biophysica Acta]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=1790 |issue=10 |pages=951–962 |doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.07.010 |accessdate=May 20, 2014|pmc=2972575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept would later be adapted into Medawar's 1952 [[Evolution of ageing#Mutation accumulation|mutation accumulation hypothesis]], which was itself expanded upon by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his 1957 [[antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;

A classical requirement and [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]] of the model is that the number of individuals within a population that live to reach [[senescence]] must be small in number. If this is not true for a population, then the effects of old age will not be under a selection shadow and instead affect adaptation and evolution of the population as a whole. At the same time, however, this requirement has been challenged by increasing evidence of senescence being more common in wild populations than previously expected, especially among birds and mammals, while the effects of the selection shadow remain present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turbill |first=Christopher |last2=Ruf |first2=Thomas |date=August 6, 2010 |title=Senescence Is More Important in the Natural Lives of Long- Than Short-Lived Mammals |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |publisher=[[Public Library of Science]] |volume=5 |issue=8 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0012019 |pmid=20700508 |pmc=2917356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some scientists, however, have criticized the idea of aging being non-adaptive, instead adopting the theory of "[[Death by Design]]". This theory follows the work of [[August Weismann]], which states that aging specifically evolved as an [[adaptation]], and disagrees with Medawar's model as a perceived oversimplification of the impact older organisms have on evolution. It is also claimed that older organisms have a higher reproductive capacity due to being better fit in order to reach their age, rather than their capacity being equal as in Medawar's calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lachowicz |first=Miroslaw |last2=Miękisz |first2=Jacek |date=April 20, 2009 |title=From Genetics to Mathematics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7n18NlBYSoC&amp;dq |location=[[Singapore]] |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |page=39 |isbn=9812837256 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sequential hermaphroditism''' (called '''dichogamy''' in [[botany]]) is a type of [[hermaphroditism]] that occurs in many [[fish]], [[gastropod]]s, and plants. Sequential hermaphroditism occurs when the individual changes sex at some point in its life. 

In animals, the different types of change are male to female ('''protandry'''), female to male ('''protogyny'''),&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt; female to hermaphrodite ('''protogynous hermaphroditism'''), and male to hermaphrodite ('''protandrous hermaphroditism'''). Those that change gonadal sex can have both female and male germ cells in the [[gonad]]s or can change from one complete gonadal type to the other during their last life stage.&lt;ref name='carauth'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Freshwater cichlid ''Crenicara punctulata'' is a protogynous sequential hermaphrodite | journal=Copeia | year=2000 | first=L. L. | last=Carruth | volume=2000 | pages=71–82 | doi=10.1643/0045-8511(2000)2000[0071:fccpia]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In plants, individual flowers are called dichogamous if their function has the two sexes separated in time, although the plant as a whole may have functionally male and functionally female flowers open at any one moment. A flower is protogynous if its function is first female, then male, and protandrous if its function is male then female. It used to be thought that this reduced [[inbreeding]], but it may be a more general mechanism for reducing pollen-pistil interference.

===Protandry===
[[File:Anemone purple anemonefish.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ocellaris clownfish]], ''Amphiprion ocellaris'', a protandrous animal species]]

Protandrous hermaphrodites are animals that are born male and at some point in their lifespan change sex to female. Protandrous animals include [[Amphiprioninae|clownfish]]. Clownfish have a very structured society. In the ''[[Amphiprioninae#Taxonomy|Amphiprion]] percula'' species, there are zero to four individuals excluded from breeding and a breeding pair living in a [[sea anemone]]. [[Dominance hierarchy|Dominance]] is based on size, the female being the largest and the male being the second largest. The rest of the group is made up of progressively smaller non-breeders, which have no functioning gonads.&lt;ref name='Buston p'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Territory inheritance in clownfish | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=2004 | first=P. M | last=Buston | volume=271 | pages=s252-s254| id=| pmc=1810038 | pmid=15252999 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0156}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the female dies, the male gains weight and becomes the female for that group. The largest non-breeding fish then sexually matures and becomes the male of the group.&lt;ref name='Buston'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Does the Presence of Non-Breeders Enhance the Fitness of Breeders ? An Experimental Analysis in the Clown Anemonefish ''Amphiprion percula'' | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | year=2004 | first=P. | last=Buston | volume=57 | pages=23–31| id=| doi=10.1007/s00265-004-0833-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other protandrous fishes can be found in the classes [[clupeiformes]], [[siluriformes]], [[stomiiformes]], and within the perciform families [[pomacentridae]] and [[sparidae]]. Since these groups are distantly related and have many intermediate relatives that are not protandrous, it strongly suggests that protandry evolved multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avise|first1=J. C.|last2=Mank|first2=J. E.|title=Evolutionary Perspectives on Hermaphroditism in Fishes|journal=Sexual Development|date=2009|volume=3|issue=2–3|pages=152–163|doi=10.1159/000223079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of protandrous animals include:
* The [[ctenophore]] ''[[Coeloplana]] gonoctena''. In this organism the females are bigger than the males and are only found during the summer. In contrast males are found year-round.
* The flatworms ''[[Hymanella]] retenuova'' and ''[[Paravortex]] cardii''.
* ''[[Laevapex fuscus]]'', a [[gastropod]], is described as being functionally protandric. The [[sperm]] matures in late winter and early spring, the eggs mature in early summer, and [[copulation]] occurs only in June. This shows that males cannot reproduce until the females appear, thus why they are considered to be functionally protandric.&lt;ref name='Policansky'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Sex change in plants and animals | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | year=1982 | first=D. | last=Policansky | volume=13 | pages=471–495 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.002351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Russell-Hunter, W.

* ''[[Speyeria mormonia]]'', or the Mormon Fritillary, is a butterfly species exhibiting protandry.  In its case, functional protandry refers to the emergence of male adults 2–3 weeks before female adults.&lt;ref&gt;Sculley, Colleen E., and Carol L. Boggs.

===Protogyny===
[[File:Thalassoma lunare 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Moon wrasse]], ''Thalassoma lunare'', a protogynous animal species]]

Protogynous hermaphrodites are animals that are born female and at some point in their lifespan change sex to male. As the animal ages, based on internal or external triggers, it shifts sex to become a male animal. Male [[fecundity]] increases greatly with age, unlike female.

Protogyny is the most common form of hermaphroditism in fish in nature.&lt;ref name='Avise'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evolutionary Perspectives on Hermaphroditism in Fishes | journal=Sexual Development | year=2009 | first=JC | last=Avise |author2=JE Mank  | volume=3 | pages=152–163| id=| doi=10.1159/000223079}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 75% of the 500 known sequentially hermaphroditic fish species are protogynous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pauly|first1=Daniel|title=Darwin's Fishes: An Encyclopedia of Ichthyology, Ecology, and Evolution|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139451819|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTDa0fM4vQIC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pandian|first=TJ|title=Genetic Sex Differentiation in Fish|year=2012|publisher=Science Publishers|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common model organisms for this type of sequential hermaphroditism are [[wrasses]]. They are one of the largest families of coral reef fish and belong to the family Labridae. Wrasses are found around the world in all marine habitats and tend to bury themselves in sand at night or when they feel threatened.&lt;ref name='Animal Planet'&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animal.discovery.com/guides/fish/marine/wrasseintro.html | title=Animal Planet :: Fish Guide -- Wrasse | accessdate=2011-03-28 | publisher=PetEducation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In wrasses, the larger of the two fish is the male, while the smaller is the female. In most cases, females and immature have a uniform color while the male has the terminal bicolored phase.&lt;ref name='Warner R'/&gt; Large males hold territories and try to pair spawn while small to mid-size initial-phase males live with females and group [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].&lt;ref name='Adreani'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mating system and reproductive biology of a temperate wrasse, ''Halichoeres semicinctus'' | journal=Copeia | year=2008 | first=M. S. | last=Adreani |author2=Allen, L. G. | pages=467–475 | doi=10.1643/cp-06-265 | volume=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, both the initial and terminal phase males can breed; however, they differ in the way they do it.

In the [[California sheephead]] (''Semicossyphus pulcher''), a type of wrasse, when the female changes to male, the ovaries degenerate and spermatogenic crypts appear in the gonads. The general structure of the gonads remains ovarian after the transformation and the sperm is transported through a series of ducts on the periphery of the gonad and [[oviduct]]. Here sex change is age-dependent. For example, the California sheephead stays a female for four years before changing sex.&lt;ref name='Warner R'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The reproductive biology of the Protogynous hermaphrodite Pimelometopon Pulchrum (Pisces: Labridae). | journal=Fishery Bulletin | year=1975 | first=R.R | last=Warner | volume=73 | pages=261–283| id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thalassoma bifasciatum|Blue-headed wrasse]] begin life as males or females, but females can change sex and function as males. Young females and males start with a distinct coloration known as the "Initial Phase" before progressing into the "Terminal Phase" coloration, which has a change in intensity of color, stripes, and bars. Initial Phase males have larger [[testes]] than larger, terminal phase males, which enables the initial phase males to produce a large amount of sperm. This strategy is able to compete with that of the larger male, who is able to guard his own harem.

''[[Botryllus schlosseri]]'', a colonial [[tunicate]], is a protogynous hermaphrodite. In a colony, eggs are released about two days before the peak of sperm emission.&lt;ref name="pmid25044771"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gasparini F |author2=Manni L. |author3=Cima F. |author4=Zaniolo G |author5=Burighel P |author6=Caicci F |author7=Franchi N |author8=Schiavon F |author9=Rigon F |author10=Campagna D |author11=Ballarin L |title=Sexual and asexual reproduction in the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri |journal=Genesis |volume= 53|issue= |pages= 105–20| date=July  2014 |pmid=25044771 |doi=10.1002/dvg.22802 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although self-fertilization is avoided and cross-fertilization favored by this strategy, self-fertilization is still possible. Self-fertilized eggs develop with a substantially higher frequency of anomalies during cleavage than cross-fertilized eggs (23% vs. 1.6%).&lt;ref name="pmid25044771" /&gt;  Also a significantly lower percentage of larvae derived from self-fertilized eggs metamorphose, and the growth of the colonies derived from their metamorphosis is significantly lower.  These findings suggest that self-fertilization gives rise to inbreeding depression associated with developmental deficits that are likely caused by expression of deleterious recessive mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bernstein | first1=H. | last2=Hopf | first2=F.

===Ultimate causes===

The [[proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate cause]] of a biological phenomenon concerns why that phenomenon makes organisms better adapted to their environment, and thus why evolution by natural selection has produced that phenomenon. This is in contrast to proximate causes, which concern the molecular and physiological mechanisms that produce the phenomenon. A number of ultimate causes of hermaphroditism have been proposed, of which two are most relevant to sequential hermaphroditism.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The evolution of hermaphroditism among animals | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | year=1969 | first=Michael T. |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin | last=Ghiselin | volume=44 | pages=189–208| id=| pmid=4901396 | issue=2 | doi=10.1086/406066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'size-advantage model' states that individuals of a given sex reproduce more effectively if they are a certain size or age. To create selection for sequential hermaphroditism, small individuals must have higher reproductive fitness as one sex and larger individuals must have higher reproductive fitness as the opposite sex. For example, eggs are larger than sperm, thus larger individuals are able to make more eggs, so individuals could maximize their reproductive potential by beginning life as male and then turning female upon achieving a certain size.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequential hermaphroditism can also protect against inbreeding in populations of organisms that have low enough motility and/or are sparsely distributed enough that there is a considerable risk of siblings encountering each other after reaching sexual maturity, and interbreeding. If siblings are all the same or similar ages, and if they all begin life as one sex and then transition to the other sex at about the same age, then siblings are highly likely to be the same sex at any given time. This should dramatically reduce the likelihood of inbreeding. Both protandry and protogyny are known to help prevent inbreeding in plants,{{cn|date=October 2018}} and many examples of sequential hermaphroditism attributable to inbreeding prevention have been identified in a wide variety of animals.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[ectotherms]] body size and female fecundity are positively correlated.&lt;ref name='Warner'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Adaptive Significance of Sequential Hermaphroditism in Animals. | journal=The American Naturalist | year=1975 | first=R. R. | last=Warner | volume=109 | pages=61–82| id=| doi=10.1086/282974}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the size-advantage model. Kazancioglu and Alonzo (2010) performed the first comparative analysis of sex change in [[Labridae]]. Their analysis supports the size-advantage model and suggest that sequential hermaphroditism is correlated to the size-advantage. They determined that [[dioecy]] was less likely to occur when the size advantage is stronger than other advantages&lt;ref name='Alonzo'&gt;{{cite journal | title=A comparative analysis of sex change in Labridae supports the size advantage hypothesis | journal=Evolution; international journal of organic evolution | year=2010 | first=E | last=Kazancioğlu |author2=SH Alonzo  | volume=64 | pages=2254–64| id=| pmid=20394662 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01016.x | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warner suggests that selection for protandry may occur in populations where female fecundity is augmented with age and individuals mate randomly. Selection for protogyny may occur where there are traits in the population that depress male fecundity at early ages (territoriality, mate selection or inexperience) and when female fecundity is decreased with age, the latter seems to be rare in the field.&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt; An example of territoriality favoring protogyny occurs when there is a need to protect their habitat and being a large male is advantageous for this purpose. In the mating aspect, a large male has a higher chance of mating, while this has no effect on the female mating fitness.&lt;ref name='Alonzo'/&gt; Thus, he suggests that female fecundity has more impact on sequential hermaphroditism than the age structures of the population.&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt;

The size-advantage model predicts that sex change would only be absent if the relationship between size/age with reproductive potential is identical in both sexes. With this prediction one would assume that hermaphroditism is very common, but this is not the case. Sequential hermaphroditism is very rare and according to scientists this is due to some cost that decreases fitness in sex changers as opposed to those who don’t change sex. Some of the hypotheses proposed for the dearth of hermaphrodites are the energetic cost of sex change, genetic and/or physiological barriers to sex change, and sex-specific mortality rates.&lt;ref name='Warner' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Charnov'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Size Advantage May Not Always Favor Sex Change | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | year=1986 | first=E | last=Charnov | volume=119 | pages=283–285| id=| pmid= | doi= 10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80141-2| issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Munday'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The energetic cost of protogynous versus protandrous sex change in the bi-directional sex changing fish Gobiodon histrio | journal=Marine Biology | year=2002 | first=P | last=Munday|author2=BW Molony  | volume=141 | pages=429–446| id=| pmid= | doi= 10.1007/s00227-002-0904-8| issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Kazanciglu and Alonzo found that dioecy was only favored when the cost of changing sex was very large. This indicates that the cost of sex change does not explain the rarity of sequential hermaphroditism by itself.&lt;ref name='Kazancioğlu'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Costs of changing sex do not explain why sequential hermaphroditism is rare | journal=The American Naturalist | year=2009 | first=E | last=Kazancioğlu |author2=SH Alonzo  | volume=173 | pages=327–36| id=| pmid=19199519 | doi=10.1086/596539 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proximate causes===

Many studies have focused on the proximate causes of sequential hermaphroditism. The role of [[aromatase]] has been widely studied in this area. Aromatase is an [[enzyme]] that controls the [[androgen]]/[[estrogen]] ratio in animals by catalyzing the conversion of [[testosterone]] into [[oestradiol]], which is irreversible. It has been discovered that the aromatase pathway mediates sex change in both directions.&lt;ref name='Kroon'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aromatase pathway mediates sex change in each direction. | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=2005 | first=F. J. | last=Kroon |author2= Munday, P. L. |author3=Westcott, D. |author4=Hobbs, J.-P. |author5=Liley, N.

One such study was performed by Kobayashi et al. In their study they tested the role of estrogens in male three-spot wrasses (''Halichoeres trimaculatus''). They discovered that fish treated with aromatase inhibitors showed decreased gonodal weight, plasma estrogen level and spermatogonial proliferation in the testis as well as increased androgen levels. Their results suggest that estrogens are important in the regulation of [[spermatogenesis]] in this protogynous hermaphrodite.&lt;ref name='Kobayashi'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Role of estrogen in spermatogenesis in initial phase males of the three-spot wrasse (''Halichoeres trimaculatus''): wffect of aromatase inhibitor on the testis. | journal=Developmental Dynamics | year=2011 | first=y | last=Kobayashi |author2=Nozu R |author3=Nakamura M.  | volume=240 | pages=116–121| id=| url=https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78650344417&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=847189402b2dcdb18259e2dc89206111 | accessdate=2011-04-27 | doi=10.1002/dvdy.22507 | pmid=21117145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic consequences===

Sequential hermaphrodites almost always have a sex ratio biased towards the birth sex, and consequently experience significantly more reproductive success after switching sexes. In theory, this should decrease [[genetic diversity]] and [[effective population size]] (Ne). However, a study of two ecologically similar [[Cheimerius|santer sea bream]] ([[gonochoric]]) and [[Chrysoblephus puniceus|slinger sea bream]] (protogynous) in South African waters found that genetic diversities were similar in the two species, and while Ne was lower in the instant for the sex-changer, they were similar over a relatively short time horizion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coscia |first1=I. |last2=Chopelet|first2=J. |last3=Waples|first3=R.

=== Flowering plants ===
[[File:Aeonium protandry.jpg|thumb|Protandrous flowers of ''[[Aeonium undulatum]]'']]
In the context of the [[plant sexuality]] of flowering plants (angiosperms), there are two forms of dichogamy: '''''protogyny'''''&amp;mdash;female function precedes male function&amp;mdash;and '''''protandry'''''&amp;mdash;male function precedes female function.

Historically, dichogamy has been regarded as a mechanism for reducing [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref name=Darwin1862&gt;{{cite book |author=Darwin, Charles |title=On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilized by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing |publisher=John Murray |location=London |year=1862 |url=http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin3/orchids/orchids_fm.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215011429/http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin3/orchids/orchids_fm.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a survey of the angiosperms found that [[self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]] (SI) plants, which are incapable of inbreeding, were as likely to be dichogamous as were self-compatible (SC) plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2445372 |author=Bertin, R.I. |title=Incidence of monoecy and dichogamy in relation to self-fertilization in angiosperms |journal=Am. J. Bot. |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=557–60 |year=1993 |jstor=2445372}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding led to a reinterpretation of dichogamy as a more general mechanism for reducing the impact of [[pollen]]-[[Carpel|pistil]] interference on pollen import and export.&lt;ref name=LloydWebb1986&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lloyd, D. G., Webb, C. J. |title=The avoidance of interference between the presentation of pollen and  stigmas in angiosperms: I. Dichogamy |journal=New Zeal. J.

Unlike the [[inbreeding avoidance]] hypothesis, which focused on female function, this interference-avoidance hypothesis considers both reproductive functions.

In many hermaphroditic species, the close physical proximity of [[anthers]] and  [[Carpel|stigma]] makes interference unavoidable, either within a  [[flower]] or between  flowers on an  [[inflorescence]]. Within-flower interference, which occurs when either the  pistil interrupts pollen removal or the  anthers prevent pollen deposition, can result in autonomous or facilitated self-pollination.&lt;ref name=LloydSchoen1992&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/297040 |author=Lloyd, D.

This results in [[geitonogamy|geitonogamous]] pollination, the transfer of pollen between flowers of the same individual.&lt;ref name=deJong1993&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(93)90239-L |author=de Jong, T.

Evol. |volume=8 |pages=321–25 |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LloydSchoen1992/&gt; In contrast to within-flower interference, geitonogamy necessarily involves the same processes as outcrossing: pollinator attraction, reward provisioning, and pollen removal. Therefore, between-flower interference not only carries the cost of self-fertilization ([[inbreeding depression]]&lt;ref name=Schemske1980&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2408218 |author=Schemske, D.W. |title=Evolution of floral display in the orchid ''Brassavola nodosa'' |journal=Evolution |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=489–91 |year=1980 |jstor=2408218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.18.110187.001321 |author=Charlesworth, D.; Charlesworth, B. |title=Inbreeding Depression and its Evolutionary Consequences |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=18 |pages=237–68 |year=1987 |jstor=2097132}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but also reduces the amount of pollen available for export (so-called "pollen discounting"&lt;ref name="Harder, L.

Because pollen discounting diminishes outcross siring success, interference avoidance may be an important evolutionary force in floral biology.&lt;ref name="Harder, L. D.; Wilson, W.

Protandry may be particularly relevant to this compromise, because it often results in an  inflorescence structure with female phase flowers positioned below male phase flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02856676 |author1=Bertin, R.

These effects of protandry on between-flower interference may decouple the benefits of large inflorescences from the consequences of geitonogamy and pollen discounting. Such a decoupling would provide a significant reproductive advantage through increased pollinator visitation and siring success.

Harder et al. (2000) demonstrated experimentally that dichogamy both reduced rates of self-fertilization and enhanced outcross siring success through reductions in geitonogamy and pollen discounting, respectively.&lt;ref name=Harderetal2000/&gt; Routley &amp; Husband (2003) examined the influence of inflorescence size on this siring advantage and found a bimodal distribution with increased siring success with both small and large display sizes.&lt;ref name=RoutleyHusband2003&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Routley, M.

The length of stigmatic receptivity plays a key role in regulating the isolation of the male and female stages in dichogamous plants, and stigmatic receptivity can be influenced by both temperature and humidity.&lt;ref name=Lora&gt;{{cite journal | title=Stigmatic receptivity in a dichogamous early-divergent angiosperm species, ''Annona cherimola'' (Annonaceae): Influence of temperature and humidity. | journal=American Journal of Botany | year=2011 | first=J. | last=Lora |author2=Herrero, M. |author3=Hormaza, J.

'''Stem-cell therapy''' is the use of [[stem cells]] to treat or prevent a disease or condition.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |authors=Mahla RS| title = Stem cells application in regenerative medicine and disease threpeutics | journal = International Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 2016 | issue = 7 | pages = 1–24 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27516776 | doi = 10.1155/2016/6940283 | pmc=4969512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bone marrow transplant]] is the most widely used stem-cell therapy, but some therapies derived from [[umbilical cord blood]] are also in use. Research is underway to develop various sources for stem cells, as well as to apply stem-cell treatments for [[neurodegenerative diseases]] and conditions such as [[diabetes]] and [[heart disease]], among others.

Stem-cell therapy has become controversial following developments such as the ability of scientists to isolate and culture [[embryonic stem cells]], to create stem cells using [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] and their use of techniques to create [[induced pluripotent stem cells]]. This controversy is often related to [[abortion debate|abortion politics]] and to [[human cloning]]. Additionally, efforts to market treatments based on transplant of stored umbilical [[cord blood]] have been controversial.

==Medical uses==
{{Further|Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation}}
For over 30 years, [[bone marrow]] has been used to treat people with cancer with conditions such as [[leukaemia]] and [[lymphoma]]; this is the only form of stem-cell therapy that is widely practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Murnaghan for Explore Stem Cells. Updated: 16 December 2013 [http://www.explorestemcells.co.uk/WhyPerformStemCellTransplant.html Why Perform a Stem Cell Transplant?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/bone-marrow-transplant Bone Marrow Transplantation and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation] In National Cancer Institute Fact Sheet web site. Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010. Cited 24 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18721775"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Karanes C, Nelson GO, Chitphakdithai P, Agura E, Ballen KK, Bolan CD, Porter DL, Uberti JP, King RJ, Confer DL | title=Twenty years of unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation for adult recipients facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program | journal=Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation | volume=14 | issue=9 Suppl | year=2008 | pages=8–15 | doi= 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.06.006 | pmid=18721775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[chemotherapy]], most growing cells are killed by the [[cytotoxic]] agents. These agents, however, cannot discriminate between the leukaemia or neoplastic cells, and the [[Hematopoiesis|hematopoietic stem cells]] within the bone marrow. It is this side effect of conventional chemotherapy strategies that the stem-cell transplant attempts to reverse; a donor's healthy bone marrow reintroduces functional stem cells to replace the cells lost in the host's body during treatment. The transplanted cells also generate an immune response that helps to kill off the cancer cells; this process can go too far, however, leading to [[graft vs host disease]], the most serious side effect of this treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malard F, Mohty M | year = 2014 | title = New Insight for the Diagnosis of Gastrointestinal Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease | journal = Mediators Inflamm | volume = 2014 | issue = | page = 701013 | doi = 10.1155/2014/701013 | pmid = 24733964 | pmc=3964897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another stem-cell therapy called [[Prochymal]], was conditionally approved in Canada in 2012 for the management of acute graft-vs-host disease in children who are unresponsive to steroids.&lt;ref name=mnt&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/245704.php |title=Prochymal – First Stem Cell Drug Approved |date=22 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[Cell therapy#Allogeneic Cell Therapy|allogenic stem therapy]] based on [[mesenchymal stem cells]] (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow of adult donors. MSCs are purified from the marrow, cultured and packaged, with up to 10,000 doses derived from a single donor. The doses are stored frozen until needed.&lt;ref name=NYT2012&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/health/a-stem-cell-based-drug-gets-approval-in-canada.html |title=A Stem-Cell-Based Drug Gets Approval in Canada |date=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA has approved five hematopoietic stem-cell products derived from umbilical cord blood, for the treatment of blood and immunological diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rosemann A | date = Dec 2014 | title = Why regenerative stem cell medicine progresses slower than expected | url = | journal = J Cell Biochem | volume = 115 | issue = 12| pages = 2073–76 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.24894 | pmid = 25079695 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[European Medicines Agency]] recommended approval of [[limbal stem cell]]s for people with severe limbal stem cell deficiency due to burns in the eye.&lt;ref name="ema"&gt;{{Cite web | title = First stem-cell therapy recommended for approval in EU | author = European Medicines Agency | date = | accessdate = 12 December 2014 | url = http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2014/12/news_detail_002239.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
[[File:Stem cell treatments.svg|thumb|Diseases and conditions where stem cell treatment is promising or emerging.]]
Stem cells are being studied for a number of reasons. The molecules and [[exosome (vesicle)|exosome]]s released from stem cells are also being studied in an effort to make medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maguire|first1=G|title=Therapeutics from Adult Stem Cells and the Hype Curve.|journal=ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters|date=12 May 2016|volume=7|issue=5|pages=441–43|pmid=27190588|doi=10.1021/acsmedchemlett.6b00125|pmc=4867479}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine soluble factors]] produced by stem cells, known as the [[stem cell secretome]], has been found to be the predominant mechanism by which stem cell-based therapies mediate their effects in [[Degenerative disease|degenerative]], [[Autoimmune disease|auto-immune]] and [[Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases|inflammatory]] diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teixeira|first=Fábio G.|last2=Carvalho|first2=Miguel M.|last3=Sousa|first3=Nuno|last4=Salgado|first4=António J.|date=2013-10-01|title=Mesenchymal stem cells secretome: a new paradigm for central nervous system regeneration?|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|language=en|volume=70|issue=20|pages=3871–3882|doi=10.1007/s00018-013-1290-8|pmid=23456256|issn=1420-682X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthy adult brains contain [[neural stem cell]]s which divide to maintain general stem-cell numbers, or become [[progenitor cells]]. In healthy adult laboratory animals, progenitor cells migrate within the brain and function primarily to maintain neuron populations for [[olfaction]] (the sense of smell). Pharmacological activation of [[endogenous]] neural stem cells has been reported to induce [[neuroprotection]] and behavioral recovery in adult rat models of neurological disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Androutsellis-Theotokis A, Leker RR, Soldner F, etal |title=Notch signalling regulates stem cell numbers in vitro and in vivo |journal=Nature |volume=442 |issue=7104 |pages=823–26 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16799564 |doi=10.1038/nature04940 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Androutsellis-Theotokis A, Rueger MA, Park DM, etal |title=Targeting neural precursors in the adult brain rescues injured dopamine neurons |journal=Proc.

====Criticisms====

In 2013, studies of autologous bone marrow stem cells on ventricular function were found to contain "hundreds" of discrepancies.&lt;ref name="Dusseldorf Stem Cell Mystery"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Darrel P|title=Autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell therapy in heart disease: Discrepancies and contradictions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527313008012|journal=Int J Cardiol|accessdate=6 July 2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.04.152|pmid=23830344|volume=168|issue=4|date=Oct 2013|pages=3381–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics report that of 48 reports there seemed to be just five underlying trials, and that in many cases whether they were randomized or merely observational accepter-versus-rejecter, was contradictory between reports of the same trial. One pair of reports of identical baseline characteristics and final results, was presented in two publications as, respectively, a 578 patient randomized trial and as a 391 subject observational study. Other reports required (impossible) negative standard deviations in subsets of people, or contained fractional subjects, negative NYHA classes. Overall there were many more people published as having receiving stem cells in trials, than the number of stem cells processed in the hospital's laboratory during that time. A university investigation, closed in 2012 without reporting, was reopened in July 2013.&lt;ref name="Strauer SZ"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berndt|first=Christina|title=A minefield of contradictions|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/vorwuerfe-gegen-stammzellforscher-ein-minenfeld-von-widerspruechen-1.1713007|publisher=Suddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=6 July 2013|newspaper=Sueddeutsche.de|date=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blood-cell formation====
The specificity of the human immune-cell repertoire is what allows the human body to defend itself from rapidly adapting antigens. However, the immune system is vulnerable to degradation upon the pathogenesis of disease, and because of the critical role that it plays in overall defense, its degradation is often fatal to the organism as a whole. Diseases of hematopoietic cells are diagnosed and classified via a subspecialty of pathology known as [[hematopathology]]. The specificity of the immune cells is what allows recognition of foreign antigens, causing further challenges in the treatment of immune disease. Identical matches between donor and recipient must be made for successful transplantation treatments, but matches are uncommon, even between first-degree relatives. Research using both hematopoietic adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells has provided insight into the possible mechanisms and methods of treatment for many of these ailments.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Fully mature human [[red blood cells]] may be generated ''[[ex vivo]]'' by [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s (HSCs), which are precursors of red blood cells. In this process, HSCs are grown together with [[stromal cell]]s, creating an environment that mimics the conditions of bone marrow, the natural site of red-blood-cell growth. [[Erythropoietin]], a [[growth factor]], is added, coaxing the stem cells to complete terminal differentiation into red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giarratana MC, Kobari L, Lapillonne H, etal |title=Ex vivo generation of fully mature human red blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells |journal=Nat.

====Regrowing teeth====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dentistry]] --&gt;
In 2004, scientists at [[King's College London]] discovered a way to cultivate a complete tooth in mice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=P8&amp;targetRule=10&amp;xml=%2Fconnected%2F2004%2F02%2F17%2Fecntee15.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | accessdate=24 May 2010 | first=Graeme | last=Archer | title=Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were able to grow bioengineered teeth stand-alone in the laboratory. Researchers are confident that the [[tooth regeneration]] technology can be used to grow live teeth in people.	

In theory, stem cells taken from the patient could be coaxed in the lab turning into a tooth bud which, when implanted in the gums, will give rise to a new tooth, and would be expected to be grown in a time over three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anglin|first1=Ian|title=Scientists Grow Teeth Using Stem Cells|url=http://singularityhub.com/2013/08/26/scientists-grow-teeth-using-stem-cells-harvested-from-urine/|website=SingularityHUB|accessdate=31 July 2014|date=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will fuse with the jawbone and release chemicals that encourage nerves and blood vessels to connect with it.

In an adult, wounded tissue is most often replaced by [[Granulation tissue|scar tissue]], which is characterized in the skin by disorganized collagen structure, loss of hair follicles and irregular vascular structure. In the case of wounded fetal tissue, however, wounded tissue is replaced with normal tissue through the activity of stem cells.&lt;ref name="Gurtner"/&gt; A possible method for tissue regeneration in adults is to place adult stem cell "seeds" inside a tissue bed "soil" in a wound bed and allow the stem cells to stimulate differentiation in the tissue bed cells. This method elicits a regenerative response more similar to fetal wound-healing than adult scar tissue formation.&lt;ref name=Gurtner&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.med.58.082405.095329 |vauthors=Gurtner GC, Callaghan MJ, Longaker MT | year = 2007 | title = Progress and potential for regenerative medicine | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Med. | volume = 58 | issue = 1| pages = 299–312 | pmid = 17076602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are still investigating different aspects of the "soil" tissue that are conducive to regeneration.&lt;ref name=Gurtner/&gt;

==== Infertility ====
Culture of [[human embryonic stem cell]]s in mitotically inactivated porcine ovarian fibroblasts (POF) causes differentiation into [[germ cell]]s (precursor cells of oocytes and spermatozoa), as evidenced by [[gene expression]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richards M, Fong CY, Bongso A |title=Comparative evaluation of different in vitro systems that stimulate germ cell differentiation in human embryonic stem cells |journal=Fertil.

Human embryonic stem cells have been stimulated to form [[Spermatozoon]]-like cells, yet still slightly damaged or malformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ledford H |title=Sperm-like cells made from human embryonic stem cells |journal=Nature News |date=7 July 2009 |doi=10.1038/news.2009.646 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/070709/full/news.2009.646.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509035545/http://www.nature.com/news/2009/070709/full/news.2009.646.html |archivedate=9 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It could potentially treat [[azoospermia]].

In 2012, oogonial stem cells were isolated from adult mouse and human ovaries and demonstrated to be capable of forming mature oocytes.&lt;ref name="pmid22366948"&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=YAR|author2=Woods DC |author3=Takai Y |author4=Ishihara O |author5=Seki H |author6=Tilly JL. |title=Oocyte formation by mitotically active germ cells purified from ovaries of reproductive-age women|journal=Nature Medicine|year=2012|volume=18|issue=3|pages=413–21|doi=10.1038/nm.2669|pmid=22366948|pmc=3296965}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells have the potential to treat infertility.

====HIV/AIDS====

Destruction of the immune system by the HIV is driven by the loss of CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. Viral entry into CD4+ cells is mediated by the interaction with a cellular chemokine receptor, the most common of which are [[CCR5]] and [[CXCR4]]. Because subsequent viral replication requires cellular gene expression processes, activated CD4+ cells are the primary targets of productive HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allers|first1=Kristinia|last2=Hütter|first2=Gero|last3=Hofmann|first3=Jörg|last4=Loddenkemper|first4=Chrtoph|last5=Rieger|first5=Kathrin|last6=Thiel|first6=Eckhard|last7=Schneider|first7=Thomas|title=Evidence for the cure of HIV infection by CCR5Δ32/Δ32 stem cell transplantation|journal=Blood|date=14 July 2014|volume=117|issue=10|pages=2791–99|doi=10.1182/blood-2010-09-309591|pmid=21148083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently scientists have been investigating an alternative approach to treating HIV-1/AIDS, based on the creation of a disease-resistant immune system through transplantation of autologous, gene-modified (HIV-1-resistant) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (GM-HSPC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiGiusto|first1=David|last2=Stan|first2=Rodica|last3=Krishnan|first3=Amrita|last4=Li|first4=Haitang|last5=Rossi|first5=John|last6=Zaia|first6=John|title=Development of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Based Gene Therapy for HIV-1 Infection: Considerations for Proof of Concept Studies and Translation to Standard Medical Practice|journal=Viruses|date=22 November 2013|volume=2013|issue=5|pages=2898–919|doi=10.3390/v5112898|pmid=24284880|pmc=3856421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Clinical trials ====

===Regenerative treatment models===
Stem cells are thought to mediate repair via five primary mechanisms: 1) providing an anti-inflammatory effect, 2) homing to damaged tissues and recruiting other cells, such as [[endothelial progenitor cell]]s, that are necessary for tissue growth, 3) supporting tissue remodeling over scar formation, 4) inhibiting [[apoptosis]], and 5) differentiating into bone, cartilage, tendon, and ligament tissue.&lt;ref name=Richardson07&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richardson LE, Dudhia J, Clegg PD, Smith R |title=Stem cells in veterinary medicine – attempts at regenerating equine tendon after injury |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=409–16 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17692415 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2007.07.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167-7799(07)00188-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Csaki C, Matis U, Mobasheri A, Ye H, Shakibaei M |title=Chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and adipogenesis of canine mesenchymal stem cells: a biochemical, morphological and ultrastructural study |journal=Histochem.

To further enrich blood supply to the damaged areas, and consequently promote tissue regeneration, platelet-rich plasma could be used in conjunction with stem cell transplantation.&lt;ref name="kane" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yamada" /&gt; The efficacy of some stem cell populations may also be affected by the method of delivery; for instance, to regenerate bone, stem cells are often introduced in a scaffold where they produce the minerals necessary for generation of functional bone.&lt;ref name="kane" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yamada"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada Y, Ueda M, Naiki T, Takahashi M, Hata K, Nagasaka T |title=Autogenous injectable bone for regeneration with mesenchymal stem cells and platelet-rich plasma: tissue-engineered bone regeneration |journal=Tissue Eng. |volume=10 |issue=5–6 |pages=955–64 |year=2004 |pmid=15265313 |doi=10.1089/1076327041348284}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singec07&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singec I, Jandial R, Crain A, Nikkhah G, Snyder EY |title=The leading edge of stem cell therapeutics |journal=Annu.

Stem cells have also been shown to have a low immunogenicity due to the relatively low number of MHC molecules found on their surface. In addition, they have been found to secrete chemokines that alter the immune response and promote tolerance of the new tissue. This allows for [[allogeneic]] treatments to be performed without a high rejection risk.&lt;ref name=orthoa&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brehm W, Burk J, Delling U, Gittel C, Ribitsch I |title=Stem cell-based tissue engineering in veterinary orthopaedics |journal=Cell Tissue Res. |volume=347 |issue=3 |pages=677–88 |year=2012 |pmid=22287044 |doi=10.1007/s00441-011-1316-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug discovery and biomedical research===
The ability to grow up functional adult tissues indefinitely in culture through [[Directed differentiation]] creates new opportunities for drug research. Researchers are able to grow up differentiated cell lines and then test new drugs on each cell type to examine possible interactions ''in vitro'' before performing ''in vivo'' studies. This is critical in the development of drugs for use in veterinary research because of the possibilities of species specific interactions. The hope is that having these cell lines available for research use will reduce the need for research animals used because effects on human tissue ''in vitro'' will provide insight not normally known before the animal testing phase.&lt;ref name=reviewa /&gt;

:With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), treatments being explored and created for the used in endangered low production animals possible. Rather than needing to harvest embryos or eggs, which are limited, the researchers can remove mesenchymal stem cells with greater ease and greatly reducing the danger to the animal due to noninvasive techniques. This allows the limited eggs to be put to use for reproductive purposes only.&lt;ref name=reviewa /&gt;

===Conservation===
Stem cells are being explored for use in conservation efforts. Spermatogonial stem cells have been harvested from a rat and placed into a mouse host and fully mature sperm were produced with the ability to produce viable offspring. Currently research is underway to find suitable hosts for the introduction of donor spermatogonial stem cells. If this becomes a viable option for conservationists, sperm can be produced from high genetic quality individuals who die before reaching sexual maturity, preserving a line that would otherwise be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=I.

===Sources for stem cells===
Most stem cells intended for regenerative therapy are generally isolated either from the patient's [[bone marrow]] or from [[adipose tissue]].&lt;ref name="yamada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zachos" /&gt; Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into the cells that make up bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, as well as muscle, neural and other progenitor tissues, they have been the main type of stem cells studied in the treatment of diseases affecting these tissues.&lt;ref name=Awad99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nathan S, Das De S, Thambyah A, Fen C, Goh J, Lee EH |title=Cell-based therapy in the repair of osteochondral defects: a novel use for adipose tissue |journal=Tissue Eng. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=733–44 |date=August 2003 |pmid=13678450 |doi=10.1089/107632703768247412}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of stem cells transplanted into damaged tissue may alter efficacy of treatment. Accordingly, stem cells derived from bone marrow aspirates, for instance, are cultured in specialized laboratories for expansion to millions of cells.&lt;ref name="yamada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zachos" /&gt; Although adipose-derived tissue also requires processing prior to use, the culturing methodology for adipose-derived stem cells is not as extensive as that for bone marrow-derived cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fraser JK, Wulur I, Alfonso Z, Hedrick MH |title=Fat tissue: an underappreciated source of stem cells for biotechnology |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=150–54 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16488036 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.01.010 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167-7799(06)00028-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nakagami06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakagami H, Morishita R, Maeda K, Kikuchi Y, Ogihara T, Kaneda Y |title=Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells as a novel option for regenerative cell therapy |journal=J.

:There has been more recent interest in the use of extra embryonic mesenchymal stem cells.

====Embryonic stem cell lines====
{{Main|Stem-cell controversy}}
There is widespread controversy over the use of human [[embryonic stem cell]]s. This controversy primarily targets the techniques used to derive new embryonic [[stem cell line]]s, which often requires the destruction of the [[blastocyst]]. Opposition to the use of human embryonic stem cells in research is often based on philosophical, moral, or religious objections.&lt;ref name="Mlsna"&gt;

====Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)====

Scientists have reported that MSCs when transfused immediately within few hours post thawing may show reduced function or show decreased efficacy in treating diseases as compared to those MSCs which are in log phase of cell growth(fresh), so cryopreserved MSCs should be brought back into log phase of cell growth in invitro culture before these are administered for clinical trials or experimental therapies, re-culturing of MSCs will help in recovering from the shock the cells get during freezing and thawing.

===Hard-tissue repair===
Bone has a unique and well documented natural healing process that normally is sufficient to repair fractures and other common injuries. Misaligned breaks due to severe trauma, as well as treatments like tumor resections of bone cancer, are prone to improper healing if left to the natural process alone. Scaffolds composed of natural and artificial components are seeded with mesenchymal stem cells and placed in the defect. Within four weeks of placing the scaffold, newly formed bone begins to integrate with the old bone and within 32 weeks, full union is achieved.&lt;ref name=reviewz&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Ribitsch I, Burk J, Delling U, Geißler C, Gittel C, Jülke H, Brehm W|title=Basic Science and Clinical Application of Stem Cells in Veterinary Medicine|year=2010|pages=219–63|doi=10.1007/10_2010_66|pmid=20309674|journal=Bioreactor Systems for Tissue Engineering II|volume=123|isbn=978-3-642-16050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies are necessary to fully characterize the use of cell-based therapeutics for treatment of bone fractures.

Stem cells have been used to treat degenerative bone diseases. The normally recommended treatment for dogs that have Legg–Calve–Perthes disease is to remove the head of the femur after the degeneration has progressed. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells have been injected directly in to the head of the femur, with success not only in bone regeneration, but also in pain reduction.&lt;ref name=reviewz /&gt;

Because of the general positive healing capabilities of stem cells, they have gained interest for the treatment of cutaneous wounds. This is important interest for those with reduced healing capabilities, like diabetics and those undergoing chemotherapy. In one trial, stem cells were isolated from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord. These cells were injected directly into the wounds. Within a week, full re-epithelialization of the wounds had occurred, compared to minor re-epithelialization in the control wounds. This showed the capabilities of mesenchymal stem cells in the repair of epidermal tissues.&lt;ref name="goat"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Azari O, Babaei H, Derakhshanfar A, Nematollahi-Mahani SN, Poursahebi R, Moshrefi M |title=Effects of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells isolated from Wharton's jelly of caprine umbilical cord on cutaneous wound healing; histopathological evaluation |journal=Vet.

Soft-palate defects in horses are caused by a failure of the embryo to fully close at the midline during embryogenesis. These are often not found until after they have become worse because of the difficulty in visualizing the entire soft palate. This lack of visualization is thought to also contribute to the low success rate in surgical intervention to repair the defect. As a result, the horse often has to be euthanized. Recently, the use of mesenchymal stem cells has been added to the conventional treatments. After the surgeon has sutured the palate closed, autologous mesenchymal cells are injected into the soft palate. The stem cells were found to be integrated into the healing tissue especially along the border with the old tissue. There was also a large reduction in the number of inflammatory cells present, which is thought to aid in the healing process.&lt;ref name="palate"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carstanjen B, Desbois C, Hekmati M, Behr L |journal=The Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research |year=2006 |volume=70 | pages=143–47 |pmid=16639947 |pmc=1410720 |issue=2 |title=Successful engraftment of cultured autologous mesenchymal stem cells in a surgically repaired soft palate defect in an adult horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ligament and tendon repair===
Autologous stem cell-based treatments for [[ligament]] injury, [[tendon]] injury, [[osteoarthritis]], [[osteochondrosis]], and sub-chondral bone cysts have been commercially available to practicing veterinarians to treat horses since 2003 in the United States and since 2006 in the United Kingdom. Autologous stem cell based treatments for tendon injury, ligament injury, and [[osteoarthritis]] in dogs have been available to veterinarians in the United States since 2005. Over 3000 privately owned horses and dogs have been treated with autologous adipose-derived stem cells. The efficacy of these treatments has been shown in double-blind clinical trials for dogs with osteoarthritis of the hip and elbow and horses with tendon damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Black LL, Gaynor J, Adams C, etal |title=Effect of intraarticular injection of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem and regenerative cells on clinical signs of chronic osteoarthritis of the elbow joint in dogs |journal=Vet. Ther. |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=192–200 |year=2008 |pmid=19003780 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nixon AJ, Dahlgren LA, Haupt JL, Yeager AE, Ward DL |title=Effect of adipose-derived nucleated cell fractions on tendon repair in horses with collagenase-induced tendinitis |journal=Am. J. Vet. Res. |volume=69 |issue=7 |pages=928–37 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18593247 |doi=10.2460/ajvr.69.7.928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Race horses are especially prone to injuries of the tendon and ligaments. Conventional therapies are very unsuccessful in returning the horse to full functioning potential. Natural healing, guided by the conventional treatments, leads to the formation of fibrous scar tissue that reduces flexibility and full joint movement. Traditional treatments prevented a large number of horses from returning to full activity and also have a high incidence of re-injury due to the stiff nature of the scarred tendon. Introduction of both bone marrow and adipose derived stem cells, along with natural mechanical stimulus promoted the regeneration of tendon tissue. The natural movement promoted the alignment of the new fibers and tendocytes with the natural alignment found in uninjured tendons. Stem cell treatment not only allowed more horses to return to full duty and also greatly reduced the re-injury rate over a three-year period.&lt;ref name=orthoa /&gt;

The use of embryonic stem cells has also been applied to tendon repair. The embryonic stem cells were shown to have a better survival rate in the tendon as well as better migrating capabilities to reach all areas of damaged tendon. The overall repair quality was also higher, with better tendon architecture and collagen formed. There was also no tumor formation seen during the three-month experimental period. Long-term studies need to be carried out to examine the long-term efficacy and risks associated with the use of embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref name=orthoa /&gt; Similar results have been found in small animals.&lt;ref name=orthoa /&gt;

====Joint repair====
Osteoarthritis is the main cause of joint pain both in animals and humans. Horses and dogs are most frequently affected by arthritis. Natural cartilage regeneration is very limited and no current drug therapies are curative, but rather look to reduce the symptoms associated with the degeneration. Different types of mesenchymal stem cells and other additives are still being researched to find the best type of cell and method for long-term treatment.&lt;ref name=orthoa /&gt;

Adipose-derived mesenchymal cells are currently the most often used because of the non-invasive harvesting. There has been a lot of success recently injecting mesenchymal stem cells directly into the joint. This is a recently developed, non-invasive technique developed for easier clinical use. Dogs receiving this treatment showed greater flexibility in their joints and less pain.&lt;ref name="arth"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guercio A, Di Marco P, Casella S, Cannella V, Russotto L, Purpari G, Di Bella S, Piccione G |title=Production of canine mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue and their application in dogs with chronic osteoarthritis of the humeroradial joints |journal=Cell Biol. Int. |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=189–94 |year=2012 |pmid=21936851 |doi=10.1042/CBI20110304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscle repairs===
Stem cells have successfully been used to ameliorate healing in the heart after myocardial infarction in dogs. Adipose and bone marrow derived stem cells were removed and induced to a cardiac cell fate before being injected into the heart. The heart was found to have improved contractility and a reduction in the damaged area four weeks after the stem cells were applied.&lt;ref name="hearta"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim U, Shin DG, Park JS, Kim YJ, Park SI, Moon YM, Jeong KS |title=Homing of adipose-derived stem cells to radiofrequency catheter ablated canine atrium and differentiation into cardiomyocyte-like cells |journal=Int. J. Cardiol. |volume=146 |issue=3 |pages=371–78 |year=2011 |pmid=19683815 |doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.07.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different trial is underway for a patch made of a porous substance onto which the stem cells are "seeded" in order to induce tissue regeneration in heart defects. Tissue was regenerated and the patch was well incorporated into the heart tissue. This is thought to be due, in part, to improved angiogenesis and reduction of inflammation. Although cardiomyocytes were produced from the mesenchymal stem cells, they did not appear to be contractile. Other treatments that induced a cardiac fate in the cells before transplanting had greater success at creating contractile heart tissue.&lt;ref name="heartb"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chang Y, Lai PH, Wei HJ, Lin WW, Chen CH, Hwang SM, Chen SC, Sung HW|title=Tissue regeneration observed in a basic fibroblast growth factor–loaded porous acellular bovine pericardium populated with mesenchymal stem cells|journal=The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery|volume=134|issue=1|year=2007|pages=65–73.e4|issn=0022-5223|doi=10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.02.019|pmid=17599488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nervous system repairs====
Spinal cord injuries are one of the most common traumas brought into veterinary hospitals.&lt;ref name=reviewz /&gt; Spinal injuries occur in two ways after the trauma: the primary mechanical damage, and in secondary processes, like inflammation and scar formation, in the days following the trauma. These cells involved in the secondary damage response secrete factors that promote scar formation and inhibit cellular regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells that are induced to a neural cell fate are loaded onto a porous scaffold and are then implanted at the site of injury. The cells and scaffold secrete factors that counteract those secreted by scar forming cells and promote neural regeneration. Eight weeks later, dogs treated with stem cells showed immense improvement over those treated with conventional therapies. Dogs treated with stem cells were able to occasionally support their own weight, which has not been seen in dogs undergoing conventional therapies.&lt;ref name="pmid22348702"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sung Su Park|title=Functional recovery after spinal cord injury in dogs treated with a combination of Matrigel and neural-induced adipose-derived mesenchymal Stem cells |journal=Cytotherapy |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=584–97 |doi=10.3109/14653249.2012.658913 |pmid=22348702|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19934591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ryu HH, Lim JH, Byeon YE, Park JR, Seo MS, Lee YW, Kim WH, Kang KS, Kweon OK |title=Functional recovery and neural differentiation after transplantation of allogenic adipose-derived stem cells in a canine model of acute spinal cord injury |journal=J.

Treatments are also in clinical trials to repair and regenerate peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves are more likely to be damaged, but the effects of the damage are not as widespread as seen in injuries to the spinal cord. Treatments are currently in clinical trials to repair severed nerves, with early success. Stem cells induced to a neural fate injected in to a severed nerve. Within four weeks, regeneration of previously damaged stem cells and completely formed nerve bundles were observed.&lt;ref name=nerve /&gt;

Stem cells are also in clinical phases for treatment in ophthalmology. Hematopoietic stem cells have been used to treat corneal ulcers of different origin of several horses. These ulcers were resistant to conventional treatments available, but quickly responded positively to the stem cell treatment. Stem cells were also able to restore sight in one eye of a horse with retinal detachment, allowing the horse to return to daily activities.&lt;ref name=eyes /&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Marketing===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s there was an initial wave of companies and clinics offering stem cell therapy to desperate people, often with extraordinary claims about what stem cells could do. Such companies and clinics included [[Advanced Cell Therapeutics]], [[Stowe BioTherapy]], Cells4Health run by Cornelis Kleinbloesem, the Beijing Xishan Institute for Neuroregeneration and Functional Recovery in [[Shijingshan]] run by [[Huang Hongyun]], and EmCell in [[Kiev, Ukraine]] run by Alexandr Smikodub.&lt;ref name=ScienceSelling2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Malignant/&gt; These clinics made strong claims about their outcomes, but rarely published their protocols or rigorous research showing that their therapies were safe and effective.&lt;ref name=ScienceSelling2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Enserink |first1=M |title=Biomedicine. Selling the stem cell dream. |journal=Science |date=14 July 2006 |volume=313 |issue=5784 |pages=160–3 |doi=10.1126/science.313.5784.160 |pmid=16840673}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012 a second wave of companies and clinics had emerged, usually located in developing countries where medicine is less regulated and offering stem cell therapies on a [[medical tourism]] model.&lt;ref name=Malignant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slabbert/&gt; Like the first wave companies and clinics, they have made similar strong claims and also have not published their protocols or rigorous research; Mexico, Thailand, and India have been centers of this activity,&lt;ref name=Malignant&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sipp |first1=D |title=The malignant niche: safe spaces for toxic stem cell marketing. |journal=NPJ Regenerative Medicine |date=2017 |volume=2 |pages=33 |doi=10.1038/s41536-017-0036-x |pmid=29302366 |pmc=5736713}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has South Africa.&lt;ref name=Slabbert&gt;{{cite news |last1=Slabbert |first1=Melodie |title=South Africa's struggle to control sham stem cell treatments |url=http://theconversation.com/south-africas-struggle-to-control-sham-stem-cell-treatments-45500 |work=The Conversation |date=August 21, 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the FDA sent a warning letter to StemGenex Biologic Laboratories in San Diego, which marketed a service in which it took body fat from people, processed it into mixtures it said contained various forms of stem cells, and administered it back to the person by inhalation, IV, or infusion into their spinal cords; the company said the treatment was useful for many chronic and life-threatening conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FDA presses its campaign against rogue regenerative med players, cites StemGenex for illegal sales |url=https://endpts.com/fda-presses-its-campaign-against-rogue-regenerative-med-players-cites-stemgenex-for-illegal-sales/ |work=Endpoints News |date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research". ''SENS Research Foundation website''&lt;/ref&gt; for the periodical repair of all age-related damage to human tissue with the ultimate purpose of maintaining a state of [[negligible senescence]] in the patient, thereby postponing [[age-associated disease]] for as long as the therapies are reapplied.&lt;ref name=EndingAging&gt;de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael (September 2007).

The term "[[negligible senescence]]" was first used in the early 1990s by professor [[Caleb Finch]] to describe organisms such as [[lobsters]] and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]]s, which do not show symptoms of aging. The term "engineered negligible senescence" first appeared in print in [[Aubrey de Grey]]'s 1999 book ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging'',&lt;ref name="isbn1587061554"&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (November 2003). ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging.'' Austin, Texas: Landes Bioscience. {{ISBN|1-58706-155-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was later prefaced with the term "strategies" in the article ''Time to Talk SENS: Critiquing the Immutability of Human Aging''&lt;ref name="pmid11976218"&gt;de Grey AD, Ames BN, Andersen JK, Bartke A, Campisi J, Heward CB, McCarter RJ, Stock G (April 2002).

==Framework==

[[File:Aging treatment approaches.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The arrows with flat heads are a notation meaning "inhibits," used in the literature of gene expression and gene regulation.]]

The ultimate objective of SENS is the eventual elimination of age-related diseases and infirmity by repeatedly reducing the state of senescence in the organism. The SENS project consists in implementing a series of periodic medical interventions designed to repair, prevent or render irrelevant all the types of molecular and cellular damage that cause age-related pathology and degeneration, in order to avoid debilitation and death from age-related causes.&lt;ref name=EndingAging/&gt;

De Grey defines aging as "the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us", and, more specifically, as follows: "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecule|molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an [[adult]] [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death."&lt;ref name="pmid12844502"&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (January 8, 2003). "[http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/manu16.pdf An engineer's approach to the development of real anti-aging medicine]". ''Sci Aging Knowledge Environ''. 2003 (1): VP1. {{doi|10.1126/sageke.2003.1.vp1}}. {{PMID|12844502}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds: "[[geriatrics]] is the attempt to stop damage from causing pathology; traditional [[gerontology]] is the attempt to stop [[metabolism]] from causing damage; and the SENS (engineering) approach is to eliminate the damage periodically, so keeping its abundance below the level that causes any pathology." The SENS approach to biomedical [[gerontology]] is thus distinctive because of its emphasis on tissue rejuvenation rather than attempting to slow the aging process.

By enumerating the various differences between young and old tissue identified by the science of [[biogerontology]], a 'damage' report was drawn, which in turn formed the basis of the SENS strategy. The results fell into seven main categories of 'damage', seven alterations whose reversal would constitute [[negligible senescence]]:

For each of these areas SENS offers at least one strategy, with a research and a clinical component. The clinical component is required because in some of the proposed therapies, feasibility has already been proven, but not completely applied and approved for human trials. These strategies do not presuppose that the underlying metabolic mechanisms of aging be fully understood, only that we take into account the form senescence takes as directly observable to science, and described in scientific literature..

==Types of aging damage and treatment schemes==

===Nuclear mutations/epimutations—OncoSENS===
These are changes to the nuclear DNA ([[nDNA]]), or to proteins which bind to the nDNA. Certain mutations can lead to [[cancer]].

This would need to be corrected in order to prevent or [[cure for cancer|cure cancer]]. SENS focuses on a strategy called "whole-body interdiction of lengthening [[telomere]]s" (WILT), which would be made possible by periodic [[regenerative medicine]] treatments.

===Mitochondrial mutations—MitoSENS===

[[Mitochondria]] are components in our [[cell (biology)|cells]] that are important for [[energy]] production. Because of the highly [[Oxidative stress|oxidative]] environment in mitochondria and their lack of the sophisticated repair systems, mitochondrial mutations are believed to be a major cause of progressive cellular degeneration.

This would be corrected by [[allotopic expression]]—copying the [[DNA]] for mitochondria completely within the cellular [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], where it is better protected. De Grey argues that experimental evidence demonstrates that the operation is feasible, however, a 2003 study showed that some mitochondrial proteins are too [[hydrophobic]] to survive the transport from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;Oca-Cossio, J. et al., 2003.

===Intracellular junk—LysoSENS===
{{tone|date=January 2018}}
Our cells are constantly breaking down [[protein]]s and other molecules that are no longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which can’t be digested accumulate as junk inside our cells, which is detected in the form of [[lipofuscin]] granules. [[Atherosclerosis]], [[macular degeneration]], [[liver spot]]s on the skin and all kinds of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s (such as [[Alzheimer's]] disease) are associated with this problem.

Junk inside cells might be removed by adding new [[enzymes]] to the cell's natural [[digestion]] organ, the [[lysosome]]. These enzymes would be taken from [[bacteria]], [[mold]]s and other organisms that are known to completely digest animal bodies.

===Extracellular junk—AmyloSENS===

Harmful junk protein can accumulate outside of our cells. Junk here means useless things accumulated by a body, but which cannot be digested or removed by its processes, such as the amyloid plaques characteristic of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other [[amyloidosis|amyloidoses]].

Junk outside cells might be removed by enhanced [[phagocytosis]] (the normal process used by the immune system), and small drugs able to break chemical beta-bonds. The large junk in this class can be removed surgically.

===Cell loss and atrophy—RepleniSENS===

Some of the cells in our bodies cannot be replaced, or can be only replaced very slowly—more slowly than they die. This decrease in cell number affects some of the most important tissues of the body.  Muscle cells are lost in [[skeletal muscle]]s and the heart, causing them to become frailer with age.  Loss of neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] causes [[Parkinson's disease]], while loss of immune cells impairs the [[immune system]].

This can be partly corrected by therapies involving [[exercise]] and [[growth factor]]s, but [[stem cell therapy]], [[regenerative medicine]] and [[tissue engineering]] are almost certainly required for any more than just partial replacement of lost cells.

===Cell senescence—ApoptoSENS===

[[Cellular senescence#Cellular senescence|Senescence]] is a phenomenon where the cells are no longer able to divide, but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other harmful things, like secreting proteins. Degeneration of [[joint]]s, immune senescence, accumulation of [[visceral fat]] and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] are caused by this. Cells sometimes enter a state of resistance to signals sent, as part of a process called [[apoptosis]], to instruct cells to destroy themselves.

Cells in this state could be eliminated by forcing them to apoptose (via [[suicide gene]]s, [[vaccine]]s, or recently discovered [[senolytics|senolytic agents]]), and healthy cells would multiply to replace them.

===Extracellular crosslinks—GlycoSENS===

Cells are held together by special linking proteins. When too many [[cross-links]] form between cells in a [[Biological tissue|tissue]], the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including arteriosclerosis, presbyopia and weakened skin texture. These are chemical bonds between structures that are part of the body, but not within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. In senescent people many of these become brittle and weak.

SENS proposes to further develop small-molecular drugs and [[enzyme]]s to break links caused by sugar-bonding, known as [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s, and other common forms of chemical linking.

==Scientific controversy==
While some fields mentioned as branches of SENS are broadly supported by the medical research community, e.g., [[stem cell research]] (RepleniSENS), [[Alzheimer's disease clinical research|anti-Alzheimers research]] (AmyloSENS) and [[oncogenomics]] (OncoSENS), the SENS programme as a whole has been a highly controversial proposal, with many critics arguing that the SENS agenda is fanciful and the highly complicated biomedical phenomena involved in the aging process contain too many unknowns for SENS to be fully implementable in the foreseeable future&lt;ref name="pmid16264422" /&gt;. Cancer may well deserve special attention as an [[Aging-associated diseases|aging-associated disease]] (OncoSENS), but the SENS claim that nuclear DNA damage only matters for aging because of cancer has been challenged in the literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Best, BP | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging 
| journal=Rejuvenation Research  | volume=12 | issue=3 | date=2009 | pages=199–208

| doi = 10.1089/rej.2009.0847 |  pmid=19594328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by material in the article [[DNA damage theory of aging]].

In November 2005, 28 biogerontologists published a statement of criticism in ''[[EMBO Journal|EMBO Reports]]'', "Science fact and the SENS agenda: what can we reasonably expect from ageing research?,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"&gt;Warner H ''et al.'' (November 2005). "Science fact and the SENS agenda. What can we reasonably expect from ageing research?". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1006–1008. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400555}}. {{PMID|16264422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing "each one of the specific proposals that comprise the SENS agenda is, at our present stage of ignorance, exceptionally optimistic,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; and that some of the specific proposals "will take decades of hard work [to be medically integrated], if [they] ever prove to be useful."&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; The researchers argue that while there is "a rationale for thinking that we might eventually learn how to postpone human illnesses to an important degree,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; increased basic research, rather than the goal-directed approach of SENS, is presently the scientifically appropriate goal. This article was written in response to a July 2005 ''EMBO Reports'' article previously published by de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (July 2005). "Resistance to debate on how to postpone ageing is delaying progress and costing lives". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (S1): S49–S53. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400399}}. {{PMID|15995663}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a response from de Grey was published in the same November issue.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (November 2005). "Like it or not, life-extension research extends beyond biogerontology". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1000. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400565}}. {{PMID|16264420}}.&lt;/ref&gt; De Grey summarizes these events in "The biogerontology research community's evolving view of SENS," published on the [[Methuselah Foundation]] website.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey.

In 2012, [[Colin Blakemore]] criticised Aubrey de Grey, but not SENS specifically, in a debate hosted at the [[Oxford University]] Scientific Society.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

More recently, biogerontologist [[Marios Kyriazis]] has sharply criticised the clinical applicability of SENS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyriazis M |title=The impracticality of biomedical rejuvenation therapies: translational and pharmacological barriers |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=390–6 |year=2014 |pmid=25072550 |pmc=4142774 |doi=10.1089/rej.2014.1588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kyriazis |first1=Marios |title=Translating laboratory anti-aging biotechnology into applied clinical practice: Problems and obstacles |journal=World Journal of Translational Medicine |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2015 |pages=51–4 |doi=10.5528/wjtm.v4.i2.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that such therapies, even if developed in the laboratory, would be practically unusable by the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyriazis M, Apostolides A |title=The Fallacy of the Longevity Elixir: Negligible Senescence May be Achieved, but Not by Using Something Physical |journal=Current Aging Science |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=227–34 |year=2015 |pmid=26135528 |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/132663/article |doi=10.2174/1874609808666150702095803}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Grey responded to one such criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Grey AD |title=The practicality or otherwise of biomedical rejuvenation therapies: a response to Kyriazis |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=397–400 |year=2014 |pmid=25072964 |doi=10.1089/rej.2014.1599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Technology Review'' controversy===

In February 2005, ''[[Technology Review]]'', which is owned by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], published an article by [[Sherwin Nuland]], a Clinical Professor of Surgery at [[Yale University]] and the author of "How We Die",&lt;ref&gt;Nuland, Sherwin (1994). ''How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter''. New York: Knopf Random House. {{ISBN|0-679-41461-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that drew a skeptical portrait of SENS, at the time de Grey was a computer associate in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100108033304/http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/flybase.htm Flybase Facility] of the [http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Genetics] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The April 2005 issue of ''Technology Review'' contained a reply by Aubrey de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (April2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14097&amp;ch=infotech Aubrey de Grey Responds]", ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous comments from readers.&lt;ref&gt;TR Readers (April 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14310&amp;ch=infotechReaders LETTERS: Our February cover story on Aubrey de Grey and antiaging science lives on]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During June 2005, [[David Gobel]], CEO and Co-founder of Methuselah Foundation offered Technology Review $20,000 to fund a prize competition to publicly clarify the viability of the SENS approach. In July 2005, Pontin announced a $20,000 prize, funded 50/50 by Methuselah Foundation and MIT Technology Review, open to any molecular biologist, with a record of publication in biogerontology, who could prove that the alleged benefits of SENS were "so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate."&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (July 28, 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/pontin/14968/ The SENS Challenge]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Technology Review'' received five submissions to its Challenge. In March 2006, ''Technology Review'' announced that it had chosen a panel of judges for the Challenge: [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Anita Goel]], [[Nathan Myhrvold]], [[Vikram Sheel Kumar]], and [[Craig Venter]].&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (March 14, 2006). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/16593/ We've picked the judges for our biogerontology prize]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the five submissions met the terms of the prize competition. They were published by ''Technology Review'' on June 9, 2006. Accompanying the three submissions were rebuttals by de Grey, and counter-responses to de Grey's rebuttals. On July 11, 2006, ''Technology Review'' published the results of the SENS Challenge.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130606111748/http://www.mprize.com/index.php?pagename=newsdetaildisplay&amp;ID=0104 SENS Withstands Three Challenges : $20,000 Remains Unclaimed]". Methuselah Foundation. Retrieved on July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, no one won the $20,000 prize. The judges felt that no submission met the criterion of the challenge and discredited SENS, although they unanimously agreed that one submission, by [[Preston Estep]] and his colleagues, was the most eloquent. [[Craig Venter]] succinctly expressed the prevailing opinion: "Estep et al. ... have not demonstrated that SENS is unworthy of discussion, but the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for it."&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt; Summarizing the judges' deliberations, Pontin wrote that SENS is "highly speculative" and that many of its proposals {{clarify|text=could not be reproduced with the scientific technology of that period.|date=April 2016}} Myhrvold described SENS as belonging to a kind of "antechamber of science" where they wait until technology and scientific knowledge advance to the point where it can be tested.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invincible Man"/&gt; In a letter of dissent dated July 11, 2006 in Technology Review, Estep et al. criticized the ruling of the judges.

==Social and economic implications==

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | date = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/sens/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

De Grey and other scientists in the general field have argued that the costs of a rapidly growing aging population will increase to the degree that the costs of an accelerated pace of aging research are easy to justify in terms of future costs avoided. Olshansky ''et al.'' 2006 argue, for example, that the total economic cost of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in the US alone will increase from $80–100 billion today to more than $1 trillion in 2050.&lt;ref name=TheLongevityDividend&gt;Olshansky, S. Jay; Perry, Daniel; Miller, Richard A.; Butler, Robert N. (March 2006). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160110004616/http://www.edmontonagingsymposium.com/files/eas/Longevity_Dividend.pdf In Pursuit of the Longevity Dividend: What Should We Be Doing To Prepare for the Unprecedented Aging of Humanity?]". ''The Scientist''. 20 (3): 28–36.&lt;/ref&gt; "Consider what is likely to happen if we don't [invest further in aging research]. Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD). For no other reason than the inevitable shifting demographics, the number of Americans stricken with AD will rise from 4 million today to as many as 16 million by midcentury. This means that more people in the United States will have AD by 2050 than the entire current population of the Netherlands. Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation. The US economic toll is currently $80–$100 billion, but by 2050 more than $1 trillion will be spent annually on AD and related dementias. The impact of this single disease will be catastrophic, and this is just one example."&lt;ref name=TheLongevityDividend/&gt;

== SENS Research Foundation ==
{{Main|SENS Research Foundation}}

The SENS Research Foundation is a [[non-profit organization]] co-founded by Michael Kope, [[Aubrey de Grey]], Jeff Hall, Sarah Marr and Kevin Perrott, which is based in [[California]], [[United States]]. Its activities include SENS-based research programs and [[public relations]] work for the acceptance of and interest in related research.

Before March 2009, the SENS research programme was mainly pursued by the [[Methuselah Foundation]], co-founded by Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel.  The [[Methuselah Foundation]] is most notable for establishing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]], a monetary prize awarded to researchers who extend the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths.&lt;ref name=MFMission&gt;

The '''uterine microbiome''' is the [[Commensalism|commensal]], [[nonpathogenic organisms|nonpathogenic]], [[bacteria]], viruses, yeasts/fungi present in a [[healthy]] [[uterus]], [[amniotic fluid]] and [[endometrium]] and the specific [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] which they inhabit. It has been only recently confirmed that the uterus and its [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] are not [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]].&lt;ref name="Per2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perez-Muñoz|first1=Maria Elisa|last2=Arrieta|first2=Marie-Claire|last3=Ramer-Tait|first3=Amanda E.|last4=Walter|first4=Jens|title=A critical assessment of the “sterile womb” and “in utero colonization” hypotheses: implications for research on the pioneer infant microbiome|journal=Microbiome|volume=5|issue=1|year=2017|issn=2049-2618|doi=10.1186/s40168-017-0268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to improved [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA gene]] [[sequencing]] techniques, detection of bacteria that are present in low numbers is possible.&lt;ref name="Verstrael6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstraelen|first1=Hans|last2=Vilchez-Vargas|first2=Ramiro|last3=Desimpel|first3=Fabian|last4=Jauregui|first4=Ruy|last5=Vankeirsbilck|first5=Nele|last6=Weyers|first6=Steven|last7=Verhelst|first7=Rita|last8=De Sutter|first8=Petra|last9=Pieper|first9=Dietmar H.|last10=Van De Wiele|first10=Tom|title=Characterisation of the human uterine microbiome in non-pregnant women through deep sequencing of the V1-2 region of the 16S rRNA gene|journal=PeerJ|volume=4|year=2016|pages=e1602|issn=2167-8359|doi=10.7717/peerj.1602|pmid=26823997|pmc=4730988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Bacteria, [[virus]]es and one [[genus]] of [[yeast]]s are a normal part of the uterus before and during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="PayneBayatibojakhi2014"/&gt; The uterus has been found to possess its own characteristic microbiome that differs significantly from the [[List of microbiota species of the lower reproductive tract of women|vaginal microbiome]]. Despite its close spatial connection with the vagina, the microbiome of the uterus more closely resembles the commensal bacteria found in the [[Oral microbiology|oral cavity]]. 
In addition, the [[List of antimicrobial peptides in the female reproductive tract|immune system]] is able to differentiate between those bacteria normally found in the uterus and those that are pathogenic.

== Clinical significance ==
Prophylactic antibiotics have been injected into the uterus to treat infertility. This has been done before the transfer of embryos with the intent to improve implantation rates. No association exists between successful implantation and antibiotic treatment.&lt;ref name="FranasiakScott2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Franasiak|first1=Jason M.|last2=Scott|first2=Richard T.|title=Reproductive tract microbiome in assisted reproductive technologies|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=104|issue=6|year=2015|pages=1364–1371|issn=0015-0282|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2015.10.012|pmid=26597628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infertility treatments often progress to the point where a microbiological analysis of the uterine microbiota is performed. Preterm birth is associated with certain species of bacteria that are not normally part of the healthy uterine microbiome.&lt;ref name="PayneBayatibojakhi2014" /&gt;

== Immune response ==

The immune response becomes more pronounced when bacteria are found that are not commensal.&lt;ref name="PayneBayatibojakhi2014" /&gt;

==History==
Investigations into reproductive-associated microbiomes began around 1885 by [[Theodor Escherich]]. He wrote that meconium from the newborn was free of bacteria. There was a general consensus at the time and even recently that the uterus was sterile and this was referred to as the ''sterile womb paradigm.'' Other investigations used sterile diapers for meconium collection. No bacteria were able to be cultured from the samples. Other studies showed that bacteria were detected and were directly proportional to the time between birth and the passage of meconium.&lt;ref name="Per2017"/&gt;

==Research==
Investigations into the role of the uterine microbiome in the development of the infant microbiome are ongoing.&lt;ref name = Per2017/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">'''Voltinism''' is a term used in biology to indicate the number of broods or generations of an organism in a year. The term is most often applied to insects, and is particularly in use in [[sericulture]], where [[silkworm]] varieties vary in their voltinism.

* '''Univoltine''' – (adjective) referring to organisms having one brood or generation per year
* '''Bivoltine''' – (adjective) referring to organisms having two broods or generations per year
* '''Multivoltine''' – (adjective) referring to organisms having more than two broods or generations per year
* '''Semivoltine''' – (adjective) referring to organisms whose [[generation time]] is more than one year

==Examples==
The [[speckled wood butterfly]] is '''univoltine''' in the northern part of its range, e.g. northern Scandinavia. Adults emerge in late spring, mate, and die shortly after laying eggs; their offspring will grow until [[pupation]], enter [[diapause]] in anticipation of the winter, and emerge as adults the following year – thus resulting in a single generation of butterflies per year. In southern Scandinavia, the same species is '''bivoltine'''&lt;ref name="Aalberg" /&gt; – here, the offspring of spring-emerging adults will develop directly into adults during the summer, mate, and die. Their offspring in turn constitute a second generation, which is the generation that will enter winter diapause and emerge as adults (and mate) in the spring of the following year. This results in a pattern of one short-lived generation (c. 2–3 months) that breeds during the summer, and one long-lived generation (ca. 9-10 months) that diapauses through the winter and breeds in the spring. The [[Parnassius smintheus|Rocky Mountain parnassian]] and the [[High brown fritillary]] are more examples of univoltine butterfly species.&lt;ref name="Aalberg"&gt;Aalberg Haugen IM, Berger D, and Gotthard K. 2012.

The bee species ''[[Macrotera portalis]]'' is bivoltine, and is estimated to have about 2 or 3 broods annually. During winter, individuals remain in diapause, in their pharate or prepupal stage. This diapause stage continues until metamorphosis in the next spring or summer, whereupon the bees emerge as adults. &lt;ref name="museum"&gt;Buchmann, Stephen L. [https://desertmuseum.org/books/nhsd_bees.php?print=y “Bees”], ''[[Bees]]'', Retrieved on 15 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amegilla dawsoni|Dawson's burrowing bee]] is an example of a '''univoltine''' insect of the order [[Hymenoptera]]. The brood of one winter will remain dormant underground until the following winter, and then will surface from their burrows to mate once, and establish new nests.  


===Partial voltinism===
The term '''partial voltinism''' is used to refer to two different (but not necessarily exclusive) situations:
* An organism wherein generations overlap in time, and so are not completely reproductively isolated. For example, in bees of the subfamily [[Halictinae]], one generation is produced in the early summer and one in the late summer, but males produced in the early summer may also [[Mating|mate]] in the late summer.&lt;ref name="Seger"&gt;Seger J. 1983. Partial bivoltinism may cause alternating sex-ratio biases that favor eusociality. 4pp. Nature, 301:59-62, Available online: [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v301/n5895/abs/301059a0.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* (More commonly) a population where the voltinism is mixed, because of genetic variation (e.g., in the [[hybrid zone]] between a univoltine and a bivoltine area) and/or because environmental stimuli do not induce bivoltinism in all individuals (or across all years). For example, far-northern populations of the [[green-veined white]] butterfly ''Pieris napi'' are mostly univoltine, but some individuals may avert [[diapause]] and produce an additional generation under warm conditions.&lt;ref name="Kivelä"&gt;Kivelä SM, Svensson B, Tiwe A, and Gotthard K. 2015. Thermal plasticity of growth and development varies adaptively among alternative developmental pathways. 13pp. Evolution, 69:9, Available online: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12734/full]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[phytophagous]] species that are dependent on seasonal plant resources are univoltine. Some such species have the ability to [[diapause]] for a large part of the year, typically during a cold winter.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.D. and J.N. McNeil. 1997  Host-plant quality influences diapause and voltinism in a polyphagous insect herbivore. Ecology 78: 977-986.

Yet other species that live in tropical regions with little seasonality may be highly multivoltine, with several generations feeding on constantly growing vegetation (such as some species of [[Saturniidae]]), or continually renewed detritus, such as ''[[Drosophila]]'' and many other genera of flies with a life cycle of just a week or two.&lt;ref name="Schowalter2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Timothy Duane Schowalter |title=Insect Ecology: An Ecosystem Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KzokTLIysQC&amp;pg=PA159 |year=2011 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-381351-0 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines running to the right are the tapes of genetic instructions, which are copied along with the body of the machines. The machine shown runs in a 32-state version of von Neumann's cellular automata environment, not his original 29-state specification.]]

[[John von Neumann]]'s '''universal constructor''' is a [[self-replicating machine]] in a [[cellular automata]] (CA) environment. It was designed in the 1940s, without the use of a computer. The fundamental details of the machine were published in von Neumann's book ''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata'', completed in 1966 by [[Arthur Burks|Arthur W. Burks]] after von Neumann's death.&lt;ref name=TSRA&gt;{{Citation| url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''| author1=von Neumann, John| author2=Burks, Arthur W.| year=1966| publisher=University of Illinois Press| format=Scanned book online| archivedate=2015-06-24| accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann's goal was to specify an abstract machine which, when run, would replicate itself. In his design, the machine consists of three parts: a 'blueprint' for itself, a mechanism that can read any blueprint and construct the machine (sans blueprint) specified by that blueprint, and a 'copy machine' that can make copies of any blueprint. After the mechanism has been used to construct the machine specified by the blueprint, the copy machine is used to create a copy of that blueprint, and this copy is placed into the new machine, resulting in a working replication of the original machine. Some machines will do this backwards, copying the blueprint and then building a machine.

To define his machine in more detail, von Neumann invented the concept of a cellular automaton. The [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|one he used]] consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of 29 states at any point in time. At each timestep, each cell updates its state depending on the states of the surrounding cells at the prior timestep. The rules governing these updates are identical for all cells. 

The universal constructor is a certain pattern of cell states in this cellular automaton. It contains one line of cells that serve as a 'tape', encoding a sequence of instructions that serve as a 'blueprint' for the machine. The machine reads these instructions one by one and performs the corresponding actions. The instructions direct the machine to use its 'construction arm' to build a copy of the machine, without tape, at some other location in the cell grid. The tape can't contain instructions to build an equally long tape, just as a container can't contain a container of the same size. Therefore, the machine contains a separate 'copy machine' which reads the tape and places a copy into the newly constructed machine. The resulting new machine and tape is identical to the old one, and it proceeds to replicate again.

== Purpose ==

Von Neumann's design has traditionally been understood to be a demonstration of the logical requirements for machine self-replication.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000&gt;{{Citation|journal=Artificial Life|last=McMullin|first=B.|year=2000|title=John von Neumann and the Evolutionary Growth of Complexity: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards...|volume=6|issue=4|pages=347–361|url=http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~alife/bmcm-alj-2000/|doi=10.1162/106454600300103674|pmid=11348586}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is clear that far simpler machines can achieve self-replication. Examples include trivial [[Crystal growth|crystal-like growth]], [[template replication]], and [[Langton's loops]]. But von Neumann was interested in something more profound: construction, universality, and evolution.&lt;ref name="walenz.org"&gt;[http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613231149/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This universal constructor can be seen as an abstract [[simulation]] of a physical [[universal assembler]].

Note that the simpler self-replicating CA structures (especially, [[Byl's loop]] and the [[Chou–Reggia loop]]) cannot exist in a wide variety of forms and thus have very limited [[evolvability]]. Other CA structures such as the [[Evoloop]] are somewhat evolvable but still don't support open-ended evolution. Commonly, simple replicators do not fully contain the machinery of construction, there being a degree to which the replicator is information copied by its surrounding environment. Although the Von Neumann design is a logical construction, it is in principle a design that could be instantiated as a physical machine. The issue of the environmental contribution to replication is somewhat open, since there are different conceptions of raw material and its availability.

The concept of a ''universal constructor'' is non-trivial because of the existence of [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden patterns]]. But a simple definition is that a universal constructor is able to construct any finite pattern of non-excited (quiescent) cells.

Von Neumann's crucial insight is that part of the replicator has a double use; being both an active component of the construction mechanism, and being the target of a passive copying process. This part is played by the tape of instructions in Von Neumann's combination of universal constructor plus instruction tape.

The combination of a universal constructor and a tape of instructions would i) allow self-replication, and also ii) guarantee that the open-ended complexity growth observed in biological organisms was possible.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt; The image below illustrates this possibility.

This insight is all the more remarkable because it preceded the discovery of the structure of the DNA molecule by [[James Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], though it followed the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] which identified [[DNA]] as the molecular carrier of genetic information in living organisms.&lt;ref name=Rocha_lec_notes&gt;{{citation |last=Rocha|first=Luis M.|title=Lecture Notes of I-585-Biologically Inspired Computing Course, Indiana University|contribution=Von Neumann and Natural Selection.|url=http://informatics.indiana.edu/rocha/i-bic/pdfs/ibic_lecnotes_c6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA molecule is processed by separate mechanisms that carry out its instructions and copy the DNA for insertion for the newly constructed cell. The ability to achieve open-ended evolution lies in the fact that, just as in nature, errors ([[mutations]]) in the copying of the genetic tape can lead to viable variants of the automaton, which can then evolve via [[Natural Selection|natural selection]].

[[Image:Pesavento replicator inherited mutations.png|thumb|center|700px|A demonstration of the ability of von Neumann's machine to support inheritable mutations. (1) At an earlier timestep, a mutation was manually added to the second generation machine's tape. (2) Later generations both display the [[phenotype]] of the mutation (a drawing of a flower) and pass the mutation on to their children, since the tape is copied each time. This example illustrates how von Neumann's design allows for complexity growth (in theory) since the tape could specify a machine that is more complex than the one making it.]]

== Implementations ==

[[Arthur Burks]] and others extended the work of von Neumann, giving a much clearer and complete set of details regarding the design and operation of von Neumann's self-replicator. The work of J. W. Thatcher is particularly noteworthy, for he greatly simplified the design. Still, their work did not yield a complete design, cell by cell, of a configuration capable of demonstrating self-replication.

[[Renato Nobili]] and Umberto Pesavento published the first fully implemented self-reproducing cellular automaton in 1995, nearly fifty years after von Neumann's work.&lt;ref name=Pesavento1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=NobiliPesavento1996&gt;{{Citation|last=Nobili|first=Renato|last2=Pesavento|first2=Umberto|contribution=Generalised von Neumann's Automata|title=Proc.

They also published an implementation of a general constructor within the original 29-state CA but not one capable of complete replication - the configuration cannot duplicate its tape, nor can it trigger its offspring; the configuration can only construct.&lt;ref name=NobiliPesavento1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Automata2008/&gt;

In 2004, D. Mange et al. reported an implementation of a self-replicator that is consistent with the designs of von Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE| title=A Macroscopic View of Self-replication| volume=92| issue=12| first=Daniel| last=Mange|last2=Stauffer|first2=A.|last3=Peparaolo|first3=L.|last4=Tempesti|first4=G.| pages=1929–1945| year=2004|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2004.837631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Nobili published a 32-state implementation that uses [[run-length encoding]] to greatly reduce the size of the tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129003524/http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |archivedate=January 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, William R. Buckley published two configurations which are self-replicators within the original 29-state CA of von Neumann.&lt;ref name=Automata2008&gt;{{Citation|title=Proc. Automata 2008|contribution=Signal Crossing Solutions in von Neumann Self-replicating Cellular Automata| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley|editor=[[Andrew Adamatzky]] |editor2=Ramon Alonso-Sanz |editor3=Anna Lawniczak |editor4=Genaro Juarez Martinez |editor5=Kenichi Morita |editor6=Thomas Worsch |pages=453–503|publisher=Luniver Press|url=http://uncomp.uwe.ac.uk/free-books/automata2008reducedsize.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley claims that the crossing of signal within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators.&lt;ref name=Automata2008/&gt; Buckley also points out that for the purposes of evolution, each replicator should return to its original configuration after replicating, in order to be capable (in theory) of making more than one copy. As published, the 1995 design of Nobili-Pesavento does not fulfill this requirement but the 2007 design of Nobili does; the same is true of Buckley's configurations.

In 2009, Buckley published with [[Golly (program)|Golly]] a third configuration for von Neumann 29-state cellular automata, which can perform either holistic self-replication, or self-replication by partial construction.  This configuration also demonstrates that signal crossing is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata.

C. L. Nehaniv in 2002, and also Y. Takada et al. in 2004, proposed a universal constructor directly implemented upon an asynchronous cellular automaton, rather than upon a synchronous cellular automaton.

As defined by von Neumann, universal construction entails the construction of passive configurations, only. As such, the concept of universal construction constituted nothing more than a literary (or, in this case, mathematical) device. It facilitated other proof, such as that a machine well constructed may engage in self-replication, while universal construction itself was simply assumed over a most minimal case. Universal construction under this standard is trivial. Hence, while all the configurations given here can construct any passive configuration, none can construct the real-time crossing organ devised by Gorman.&lt;ref name="Automata2008"/&gt;

== Practicality ==

=== Computational cost ===

All the implementations of von Neumann's self-reproducing machine require considerable resources to run on computer. For example, in the Nobili-Pesavento 32-state implementation shown above, while the body of the machine is just 6,329 non-empty cells (within a rectangle of size 97x170), it requires a tape that is 145,315 cells long, and takes 63 billion timesteps to replicate. A simulator running at 1,000 timesteps per second would take over 2 years to make the first copy. In 1995, when the first implementation was published, the authors had not seen their own machine replicate. However, in 2008, the [[hashlife]] algorithm was extended to support the 29-state and 32-state rulesets in [[Golly (program)|Golly]]. On a modern desktop PC, replication now takes only a few minutes, although a significant amount of memory is required.

=== Evolvability ===

It has been argued that the problem Von Neumann was trying to address was not self-reproduction ''per se'', but the evolutionary growth of complexity.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt; His “proof-of-principle” designs showed how it is logically possible, by using a general purpose programmable (“universal”) constructor, to exhibit an indefinitely large class of self-reproducing machines, spanning a wide range of “complexity” (in von Neumann's sense of “the ability to do complicated things”), interconnected by a network of potential mutational pathways, including pathways from the most simple to the most complex. This is an important result, as prior to that it might have been conjectured that there is a fundamental logical barrier to the existence of such pathways; in which case, biological organisms, which do support such pathways, could not be “machines”, as conventionally understood. But the result does not show what ''other'' conditions are necessary, in practice, for evolution along such pathways from simple to complex to be spontaneously realised or followed. In his unfinished work he briefly considers conflict and interactions between his self-reproducing machines;&lt;ref name="TSRA"/&gt;{{rp|147}} but in practice, his particular model cannot yield evolutionary dynamics because the machines are too fragile - the vast majority of perturbations cause them effectively to disintegrate.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt;
