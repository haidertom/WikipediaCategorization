The functions studied are often, but not always, Boolean-valued, making them Boolean functions. The area has found many applications in combinatorics, social choice theory, random graphs, and theoretical computer science, especially in hardness of approximation, property testing and PAC learning.\n\nWe will mostly consider functions defined on the domain formula_2. Sometimes it is more convenient to work with the domain formula_1 instead. If formula_5 is defined on formula_2, then the corresponding function defined on formula_1 is\n\nSimilarly, for us a Boolean function is a formula_9-valued function, though often it is more convenient to consider formula_10-valued functions instead.\n\nEvery real-valued function formula_11 has a unique expansion as a multilinear polynomial:\n\nThis is the Hadamard transform of the function formula_5, which is the Fourier transform in the group formula_14. The coefficients formula_15 are known as \"Fourier coefficients\", and the entire sum is known as the \"Fourier expansion\" of formula_5. The functions formula_17 are known as \"Fourier characters\", and they form an orthonormal basis for the space of all functions over formula_2, with respect to the inner product formula_19.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients can be calculated using an inner product:\n\nIn particular, this shows that formula_21 Parseval's identity states that\n\nIf we skip formula_23, then we get the variance of formula_5:\n\nThe \"degree\" of a function formula_11 is the maximum formula_27 such that formula_28 for some set formula_29 of size formula_27. In other words, the degree of formula_5 is its degree as a multilinear polynomial.\n\nIt is convenient to decompose the Fourier expansion into \"levels\": the Fourier coefficient formula_15 is on level formula_33.\n\nThe \"degree formula_27\" part of formula_5 is\n\nUsing this we can define the noise stability and the noise sensitivity, as before.\n\nThe Russo–Margulis formula states that for monotone Boolean functions formula_37,\n\nBoth the influence and the probabilities are taken with respect to formula_39, and on the right-hand side we have the average sensitivity of formula_5. If we think of formula_5 as a property, then the formula states that as formula_42 varies, the derivative of the probability that formula_5 occurs at formula_42 equals the average sensitivity at formula_42.\n\nThe Russo–Margulis formula is key for proving sharp threshold theorems such as Friedgut's.\n\nOne of the deepest results in the area, the invariance principle, connects the distribution of functions on the Boolean cube formula_2 to their distribution on \"Gaussian space\", which is the space formula_47 endowed with the standard formula_48-dimensional Gaussian measure.\n\nMany of the basic concepts of Fourier analysis on the Boolean cube have counterparts in Gaussian space:\n\n\nGaussian space is more symmetric than the Boolean cube (for example, it is rotation invariant), and supports continuous arguments which may be harder to get through in the discrete setting of the Boolean cube. The invariance principle links the two settings, and allows deducing results on the Boolean cube from results on Gaussian space.\n\nIf formula_54 has degree at most 1, then formula_5 is either constant, equal to a coordinate, or equal to the negation of a coordinate. In particular, formula_5 is a \"dictatorship\": a function depending on at most one coordinate.\n\nThe Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem, also known as the \"FKN theorem\", states that if formula_5 \"almost\" has degree 1 then it is \"close\" to a dictatorship. Quantitatively, if formula_54 and formula_59, then formula_5 is formula_61-close to a dictatorship, that is, formula_62 for some Boolean dictatorship formula_63, or equivalently, formula_64 for some Boolean dictatorship formula_63.\n\nSimilarly, a Boolean function of degree at most formula_27 depends on at most formula_67 coordinates, making it a \"junta\" (a function depending on a constant number of coordinates). The Kindler–Safra theorem generalizes the Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem to this setting. It states that if formula_54 satisfies formula_69 then formula_5 is formula_61-close to a Boolean function of degree at most formula_27.\n\nThe Poincaré inequality for the Boolean cube (which follows from formulas appearing above) states that for a function formula_11,\n\nThis implies that formula_75.\n\nThe Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem, also known as the \"KKL theorem\", states that if formula_5 is Boolean then formula_77.\n\nThe bound given by the Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem is tight, and is achieved by the \"Tribes\" function of Ben-Or and Linial:\n\nThe Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem was one of the first results in the area, and was the one introducing hypercontractivity into the context of Boolean functions.\n\nIf formula_54 is an formula_80-junta (a function depending on at most formula_80 coordinates) then formula_82 according to the Poincaré inequality.\n\nFriedgut's theorem is a converse to this result. It states that for any formula_83, the function formula_5 is formula_85-close to a Boolean junta depending on formula_86 coordinates.\n\nCombined with the Russo–Margulis lemma, Friedgut's junta theorem implies that for every formula_42, every monotone function is close to a junta with respect to formula_88 for some formula_89.\n\nThe invariance principle generalizes the Berry–Esseen theorem to non-linear functions.\n\nThe Berry–Esseen theorem states (among else) that if formula_90 and no formula_91 is too large compared to the rest, then the distribution of formula_5 over formula_2 is close to a normal distribution with the same mean and variance.\n\nThe invariance principle (in a special case) informally states that if formula_5 is a multilinear polynomial of bounded degree over formula_95 and all influences of formula_5 are small, then the distribution of formula_5 under the uniform measure over formula_2 is close to its distribution in Gaussian space.\n\nMore formally, let formula_99 be a univariate Lipschitz function, let formula_100, let formula_101, and let\nformula_102. Suppose that formula_103. Then\n\nBy choosing appropriate formula_99, this implies that the distributions of formula_5 under both measures are close in CDF distance, which is given by formula_107.\n\nThe invariance principle was the key ingredient in the original proof of the \"Majority is Stablest\" theorem.\n\nA Boolean function formula_54 is \"linear\" if it satisfies formula_109, where formula_110. It is not hard to show that the Boolean linear functions are exactly the characters formula_17.\n\nIn property testing we want to test whether a given function is linear. It is natural to try the following test: choose formula_112 uniformly at random, and check that formula_109. If formula_5 is linear then it always passes the test. Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld showed that if the test passes with probability formula_115 then formula_5 is formula_61-close to a Fourier character. Their proof was combinatorial.\n\nBellare et al. gave an extremely simple Fourier-analytic proof, that also shows that if the test succeeds with probability formula_118, then formula_5 is correlated with a Fourier character. Their proof relies on the following formula for the success probability of the test:\n\nArrow's impossibility theorem states that for three and more candidates, the only unanimous voting rule for which there is always a Condorcet winner is a dictatorship.\n\nThe usual proof of Arrow's theorem is combinatorial. Kalai gave an alternative proof of this result in the case of three candidates using Fourier analysis. If formula_54 is the rule that assigns a winner among two candidates given their relative orders in the votes, then the probability that there is a Condorcet winner given a uniformly random vote is formula_122, from which the theorem easily follows.\n\nThe FKN theorem implies that if formula_5 is a rule for which there is almost always a Condorcet winner, then formula_5 is close to a dictatorship.\n\nA classical result in the theory of random graphs states that the probability that a formula_125 random graph is connected tends to formula_126 if formula_127. This is an example of a \"sharp threshold\": the width of the \"threshold window\", which is formula_128, is asymptotically smaller than the threshold itself, which is roughly formula_129. In contrast, the probability that a formula_125 graph contains a triangle tends to formula_131 when formula_132. Here both the threshold window and the threshold itself are formula_133, and so this is a \"coarse threshold\".\n\nFriedgut's sharp threshold theorem states, roughly speaking, that a monotone graph property (a graph property is a property which doesn't depend on the names of the vertices) has a sharp threshold unless it is correlated with the appearance of small subgraphs. This theorem has been widely applied to analyze random graphs and percolation.\n\nOn a related note, the KKL theorem implies that the width of threshold window is always at most formula_134.\n\nLet formula_135 denote the majority function on formula_48 coordinates. Sheppard's formula gives the asymptotic noise stability of majority:\n\nThis is related to the probability that if we choose formula_138 uniformly at random and form formula_139 by flipping each bit of formula_140 with probability formula_141, then the majority stays the same:\n\nThere are Boolean functions with larger noise stability. For example, a dictatorship formula_143 has noise stability formula_53.\n\nThe Majority is Stablest theorem states, informally, then the only functions having noise stability larger than majority have influential coordinates. Formally, for every formula_83 there exists formula_146 such that if formula_54 has expectation zero and formula_148, then formula_149.\n\nThe first proof of this theorem used the invariance principle in conjunction with an isoperimetric theorem of Borell in Gaussian space; since then more direct proofs were devised.\n\nMajority is Stablest implies that the Goemans–Williamson approximation algorithm for MAX-CUT is optimal, assuming the unique games conjecture. This implication, due to Khot et al., was the impetus behind proving the theorem.\n"}

A number of different classification schemes have arisen, and though they share some similarities, there are differences due in part to the different purposes they serve. In addition, as mathematics continues to be developed, these classification schemes must change as well to account for newly created areas or newly discovered links between different areas. Classification is made more difficult by some subjects, often the most active, which straddle the boundary between different areas.\n\nA traditional division of mathematics is into pure mathematics, mathematics studied for its intrinsic interest, and applied mathematics, mathematics which can be directly applied to real world problems.\nThis division is not always clear and many subjects have been developed as pure mathematics to find unexpected applications later on. Broad divisions, such as discrete mathematics and computational mathematics, have emerged more recently.\n\nAn ideal system of classification permits adding new areas into the organization of previous knowledge, and fitting surprising discoveries and unexpected interactions into the outline.\nFor example, the Langlands program has found unexpected connections between areas previously thought unconnected, at least Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and number theory.\n\n\n\nArithmetic is the study of numbers and the properties of operations between them.\n\nThe study of structure begins with numbers, first the familiar natural numbers and integers and their arithmetical operations, which are recorded in elementary algebra. The deeper properties of these numbers are studied in number theory. The investigation of methods to solve equations leads to the field of abstract algebra, which, among other things, studies rings and fields, structures that generalize the properties possessed by everyday numbers. Long standing questions about compass and straightedge construction were finally settled by Galois theory. The physically important concept of vectors, generalized to vector spaces, is studied in linear algebra.\n\n\nWithin the world of mathematics, analysis is the branch that focuses on change: rates of change, accumulated change, and multiple things changing relative to (or independently of) one another.\n\nModern analysis is a vast and rapidly expanding branch of mathematics that touches almost every other subdivision of the discipline, finding direct and indirect applications in topics as diverse as number theory, cryptography, and abstract algebra. It is also the language of science itself and is used across chemistry, biology, and physics, from astrophysics to X-ray crystallography.\n\nCombinatorics is the study of finite or discrete collections of objects that satisfy specified criteria. In particular, it is concerned with \"counting\" the objects in those collections (enumerative combinatorics) and with deciding whether certain \"optimal\" objects exist (extremal combinatorics). It includes graph theory, used to describe inter-connected objects (a graph in this sense is a network, or collection of connected points). See also the list of combinatorics topics, list of graph theory topics and glossary of graph theory. A \"combinatorial flavour\" is present in many parts of problem-solving.\n\nGeometry deals with spatial relationships, using fundamental qualities or axioms. Such axioms can be used in conjunction with mathematical definitions for points, straight lines, curves, surfaces, and solids to draw logical conclusions.

{"id": "56275884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56275884", "title": "Data-driven control system", "text": "Data-driven control system\n\nData-driven control systems are a broad family of control systems, in which the identification of the process model and/or the design of the controller are based entirely on \"experimental data\" collected from the plant .\n\nIn many control applications, trying to write a mathematical model of the plant is considered a hard task, requiring efforts and time to the process and control engineers. This problem is overcome by \"data-driven\" methods, which allow to fit a system model to the experimental data collected, choosing it in a specific models class. The control engineer can then exploit this model to design a proper controller for the system. However, it is still difficult to find a simple yet reliable model for a physical system, that includes only those dynamics of the system that are of interest for the control specifications. The \"direct\" data-driven methods allow to tune a controller, belonging to a given class, without the need of an identified model of the system. In this way, one can also simply weight process dynamics of interest inside the control cost function, and exclude those dynamics that are out of interest.\n\nThe \"standard\" approach to control systems design is organized in two-steps: \nTypical objectives of system identification are to have formula_9 as close as possible to formula_7, and to have formula_6 as small as possible. However, from an identification for control perspective, what really matters is the performance achieved by the controller, not the intrinsic quality of the model.\n\nOne way to deal with uncertainty is to design a controller that has an acceptable performance with all models in formula_6, including formula_7. This is the main idea behind robust control design procedure, that aims at building frequency domain uncertainty descriptions of the process. However, being based on worst-case assumptions rather than on the idea of averaging out the noise, this approach typically leads to \"conservative\" uncertainty sets. Rather, data-driven techniques deal with uncertainty by working on experimental data, and avoiding excessive conservativism.\n\nIn the following, the main classifications of data-driven control systems are presented.\n\nThe fundamental distinction is between indirect and direct controller design methods. The former group of techniques is still retaining the standard two-step approach, \"i.e.\" first a model is identified, then a controller is tuned based on such model. The main issue in doing so is that the controller is computed from the estimated model formula_9 (according to the certainty equivalence principle), but in practice formula_16. To overcome this problem, the idea behind the latter group of techniques is to map the experimental data \"directly\" onto the controller, without any model to be identified in between.\n\nAnother important distinction is between iterative and noniterative (or one-shot) methods. In the former group, repeated iterations are needed to estimate the controller parameters, during which the optimization problem is performed based on the results of the previous iteration, and the estimation is expected to become more and more accurate at each iteration. This approach is also prone to on-line implementations (see below). In the latter group, the (optimal) controller parametrization is provided with a single optimization problem. This is particularly important for those systems in which iterations or repetitions of data collection experiments are limited or even not allowed (for example, due to economic aspects). In such cases, one should select a design technique capable of delivering a controller on a single data set. This approach is often implemented off-line (see below).\n\nSince, on practical industrial applications, open-loop or closed-loop data are often available continuously, on-line data-driven techniques use those data to improve the quality of the identified model and/or the performance of the controller each time new information is collected on the plant. Instead, off-line approaches work on batch of data, which may be collected only once, or multiple times at a regular (but rather long) interval of time.\n\nThe iterative feedback tuning (IFT) method was introduced in 1994 , starting from the observation that, in identification for control, each iteration is based on the (wrong) certainty equivalence principle.\n\nIFT is a model-free technique for the direct iterative optimization of the parameters of a fixed-order controller; such parameters can be successively updated using information coming from standard (closed-loop) system operation.\n\nLet formula_17 be a desired output to the reference signal formula_18; the error between the achieved and desired response is formula_19. The control design objective can be formulated as the minimization of the objective function:\n\nGiven the objective function to minimize, the \"quasi-Newton method\" can be applied, i.e. a gradient-based minimization using a gradient search of the type:\n\nThe value formula_22 is the step size, formula_23 is an appropriate positive definite matrix and formula_24 is an approximation of the gradient; the true value of the gradient is given by the following:\n\nThe value of formula_26 is obtained through the following three-step methodology:\n\n\nA crucial factor for the convergence speed of the algorithm is the choice of formula_23; when formula_38 is small, a good choice is the approximation given by the Gauss–Newton direction:\n\nNoniterative correlation-based tuning (nCbT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.\n\nSuppose that formula_4 denotes an unknown LTI stable SISO plant, formula_41 a user-defined reference model and formula_42 a user-defined weighting function. An LTI fixed-order controller is indicated as formula_43, where formula_44, and formula_45 is a vector of LTI basis functions. Finally, formula_46 is an ideal LTI controller of any structure, guaranteeing a closed-loop function formula_41 when applied to formula_4.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the following objective function:\n\nformula_50 is a convex approximation of the objective function obtained from a model reference problem, supposing that formula_51.\n\nWhen formula_4 is stable and minimum-phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of formula_53 in the scheme in figure.\n\nThe input signal formula_54 is supposed to be a persistently exciting input signal and formula_55 to be generated by a stable data-generation mechanism. The two signals are thus uncorrelated in an open-loop experiment; hence, the ideal error formula_56 is uncorrelated with formula_54. The control objective thus consists in finding formula_58 such that formula_54 and formula_56 are uncorrelated.\n\nThe vector of \"instrumental variables\" formula_61 is defined as:\n\nwhere formula_63 is large enough and formula_64, where formula_65 is an appropriate filter.\n\nThe correlation function is:\n\nand the optimization problem becomes:\n\nDenoting with formula_68 the spectrum of formula_54, it can be demonstrated that, under some assumptions, if formula_65 is selected as:\n\nthen, the following holds:\n\nThere is no guarantee that the controller formula_73 that minimizes formula_74 is stable.

Roughly speaking, an affine variety admitting \"plenty\" of actions of the additive group is considered similar to an affine space.\n\nLet formula_2 be a ring. Recall that a derivation of formula_2 is a map formula_11 satisfying the Leibniz rule formula_12 for any formula_13. If formula_2 is an algebra over a field formula_5, we additionally require formula_1 to be formula_5-linear, so formula_18.\n\nA derivation formula_1 is called a \"locally nilpotent derivation\" (LND) if for every formula_20, there exists a positive integer formula_21 such that formula_22.\n\nIf formula_2 is graded, we say that a locally nilpotent derivation formula_1 is \"homogeneous\" (of degree formula_25) if formula_26 for every formula_27.\n\nThe set of locally nilpotent derivations of a ring formula_2 is denoted by formula_29. Note that this set has no obvious structure: it is neither closed under addition (e.g. if formula_30, formula_31 then formula_32 but formula_33, so formula_34) nor under multiplication by elements of formula_2 (e.g. formula_36, but formula_37). However, if formula_38 then formula_39 implies formula_40 and if formula_41, formula_42 then formula_43.\n\nLet formula_2 be an algebra over a field formula_5 of characteristic zero (e.g. formula_47). Then there is a one-to-one corresponence between the locally nilpotent formula_5-derviations on formula_2 and the actions of the additive group formula_44 of formula_5 on the affine variety formula_52, as follows. \nA formula_44-action on formula_52 corresponds to an formula_5-algebra homomorphism formula_56. Any such formula_57 determines a locally nilpotnent derivation formula_1 of formula_2 by taking its derivative at zero, namely formula_60 where formula_61 denotes the evaluation at formula_62. \nConversely, any locally nilpotent derivation formula_1 determines a homomorphism formula_56 by formula_65\n\nIt is easy to see that the conjugate actions correspond to conjugate derivations, i.e. if formula_66 and formula_41 then formula_68 and formula_69\n\nThe algebra formula_70 consists of the invariants of the corresponding formula_44-action. It is algebraically and factorially closed in formula_2. A special case of Hilbert's 14th problem asks whether formula_70 is finitely generated, or, if formula_74, whether the quotient formula_75 is affine. By Zariski's finiteness theorem, it is true if formula_76. On the other hand, this question is highly nontrivial even for formula_77, formula_78. For formula_79 the answer, in general, is negative. The case formula_80 is open.\n\nHowever, in practice it often happens that formula_81 is known to be finitely generated: notably, by the Maurer–Weitzenböck theorem, it is the case for \"linear\" LND's of the polynomial algebra over a field of characteristic zero (by \"linear\" we mean homogeneous of degree zero with respect to the standard grading).\n\nAssume formula_70 is finitely generated. If formula_83 is a finitely generated algebra over a field of characteristic zero, then formula_81 can be computed using van den Essen's algorithm, as follows. Choose a \"local slice\", i.e. an element formula_85 and put formula_86. Let formula_87 be the \"Dixmier map\" given by formula_88. Now for every formula_89, chose a minimal integer formula_90 such that formula_91, put formula_92, and define inductively formula_93 to be the subring of formula_2 generated by formula_95. By induction, one proves that formula_96 are finitely generated and if formula_97 then formula_98, so formula_99 for some formula_100. Finding the generators of each formula_93 and checking whether formula_97 is a standard computation using Gröbner bases.\n\nAssume that formula_103 admits a \"slice\", i.e. formula_104 such that formula_105. The \"slice theorem\" asserts that formula_2 is a polynomial algebra formula_107 and formula_108.\n\nFor any local slice formula_109 we can apply the slice theorem to the localization formula_110, and thus obtain that formula_2 is \"locally\" a polynomial algebra with a standard derivation. In geometric terms, if a geometric quotient formula_112 is affine (e.g. when formula_76 by the Zariski theorem), then it has a Zariski-open subset formula_114 such that formula_115 is isomorphic over formula_114 to formula_117, where formula_44 acts by translation on the second factor.\n\nHowever, in general it is not true that formula_119 is locally trivial. For example, let formula_120. Then formula_81 is a coordinate ring of a singular variety, and the fibers of the quotient map over singular points are two-dimensional.\n\nIf formula_122 then formula_123 is a curve. To describe the formula_44-action, it is important to understand the goemetry formula_125. Assume further that formula_47 and that formula_127 is smooth and contractible (in which case formula_128 is smooth and contractible as well) and choose formula_125 to be minimal (with respect to inclusion). Then Kaliman proved that each irreducible component of formula_125 is a \"polynomial curve\", i.e. its normalization is isomorphic to formula_131. The curve formula_125 for the action given by Freudeburg's (2,5)-derivation (see below) is a union of two lines in formula_133, so formula_125 may not be irreducible. However, it is conjectured that formula_125 is always contractible.\n\nThe standard coordinate derivations formula_136 of a polynomial algebra formula_137 are locally nilpotent. The corresponding formula_138-actions are translations: formula_139, formula_140 for formula_141.\n\nLet formula_142, formula_143, and let formula_1 be the Jacobian derivation formula_145. Then formula_146 and formula_147 (see below); that is, formula_1 annihilates no variable. The fixed point set of the corresponding formula_44-action equals formula_150.\n\nConsider formula_151. The locally nilpotent derivation formula_152 of its coordinate ring corresponds to a natural action of formula_138 on formula_154 via right multiplication of upper triangular matrices. This action gives a nontrivial formula_138-bundle over formula_156. However, if formula_47 then this bundle is trivial in the smooth category\n\nLet formula_5 be a field of characteristic zero (using Kambayashi's theorem one can reduce most results to the case formula_47\n\n) and let formula_160 be a polynomial algebra.\n\n\nEvery LND of formula_163 can be conjugated to formula_164 for some formula_165. This result is closely related to the fact that every automorphism of an affine plane is tame, and does not hold in higher dimensions.\n\nThe kernel of every nontrivial LND of formula_168 is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in two variables; that is, a fixed point set of every nontrivial formula_44-action on formula_170 is isomorphic to formula_171.\n\nIn other words, for every formula_172 there exist formula_173 such that formula_174 (but, in contrast to the case formula_161, formula_2 is not necessarily a polynomial ring over formula_70). In this case, formula_1 is a Jacobian derivation: formula_145.\n\nAssume that formula_166 and formula_41 is homogeneous relative to some positive grading of formula_2 such that formula_183 are homogeneous. Then formula_184 for some homogeneous formula_185. Moreover, if formula_186 are relatively prime, then formula_187 are relatively prime as well.\n\nA quotient morphism formula_188 of a formula_44-action is surjective. In other words, for every formula_172, the embedding formula_191 induces a surjective morphism formula_192.\n\nThis is no longer true for formula_193, e.g. the image of a quotient map formula_194 by a formula_44-action formula_196 (which corresponds to a LND given by formula_197 equals formula_198.\n\nEvery fixed-point free action of formula_44 on formula_170 is conjugate to a translation. In other words, every formula_201 such that the image of formula_1 generates the unit ideal (or, equivalently, formula_1 defines a nowhere vanishing vector field), admits a slice. This results answers one of the conjectures from Kraft's list.\n\nAgain, this result is not true for formula_193: e.g. consider the formula_205. The points formula_206 and formula_207 are in the same orbit of the corresponding formula_138-action if and only if formula_209; hence the (topological) quotient is not even Hausdorff, let alone homeomorphic to formula_210.\n\nLet formula_103. Then formula_2 is faithfully flat over formula_81. Moreover, the ideal formula_214 is principal in formula_2.\n\nLet formula_216 be any system of variables of formula_2; that is, formula_218. A derivation of formula_2 is called \"triangular\" with respect to this system of variables, if formula_220 and formula_221 for formula_222. A derivation is called \"triangulable\" if it is conjugate to a triangular one, or, equivalently, if it is triangular with respect to some system of variables. Every triangular derivation is locally nilpotent. The converse is true for formula_223 by Rentschler's theorem above, but it is not true for formula_224.\n\nThe derivation of formula_225 given by formula_226 is not triangulable. Indeed, the fixed-point set of the corresponding formula_44-action is a quadric cone formula_228, while by the result of Popov, a fixed point set of a triangulable formula_44-action is isomorphic to formula_230 for some affine variety formula_231; and thus cannot have an isolated singularity.\n\nThe above necessary geometrical condition was later generalized by Freudenburg. To state his result, we need the following definition:\n\nA corank of formula_41 is a maximal number formula_233 such that there exists a system of variables formula_234 such that formula_235. Define formula_236 as formula_21 minus the corank of formula_1.\n\nWe have formula_239 and formula_240 if and only if in some coordinates, formula_241 for some formula_242.\n\nTheorem: If formula_41 is triangulable, then any hypersurface contained in the fixed-point set of the corresponding formula_44-action is isomorphic to formula_245.\n\nIn particular, LND's of maximal rank formula_21 cannot be triangulable. Such derivations do exist for formula_224: the first example is the \"(2,5)-homogeneous derivation\" (see above), and it can be easily generalized to any formula_224.\n\nThe intersection of the kernels of all locally nilpotent derivations of the coordinate ring, or, equivalently, the ring of invariants of all formula_44-actions, is called \"Makar-Limanov invariant\" and is an important algebraic invariant of an affine variety. For example, it is trivial for an affine space; but for the Koras–Russell cubic threefold, which is diffeomorphic to formula_210, it is not.\n\n"}
{"id": "18831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18831", "title": "Mathematics", "text": "Mathematics\n\nMathematics (from Greek μάθημα \"máthēma\", \"knowledge, study, learning\") includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change.\n\nMathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.\n\nRigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's \"Elements\". Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.\n\nGalileo Galilei (1564–1642) said, \"The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.\" Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) referred to mathematics as \"the Queen of the Sciences\". Benjamin Peirce (1809–1880) called mathematics \"the science that draws necessary conclusions\". David Hilbert said of mathematics: \"We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise.\" Albert Einstein (1879–1955) stated that \"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\"\n\nMathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance and the social sciences. Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind. Practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.\n\nThe history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals, was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.\n\nAs evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time – days, seasons, years.\n\nEvidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000 BC, when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy. The most ancient mathematical texts from Mesopotamia and Egypt are from 2000–1800 BC. Many early texts mention Pythagorean triples and so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in Babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system, and used a sexagesimal numeral system, still in use today for measuring angles and time.\n\nBeginning in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans, the Ancient Greeks began a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right with Greek mathematics. Around 300 BC, Euclid introduced the axiomatic method still used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. His textbook \"Elements\" is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time. The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be Archimedes (c. 287–212 BC) of Syracuse. He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of solids of revolution and used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus. Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are conic sections (Apollonius of Perga, 3rd century BC), trigonometry (Hipparchus of Nicaea (2nd century BC), and the beginnings of algebra (Diophantus, 3rd century AD).\n\nThe Hindu–Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western world via Islamic mathematics. Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition of sine and cosine, and an early form of infinite series.\nDuring the Golden Age of Islam, especially during the 9th and 10th centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of Islamic mathematics was the development of algebra. Other notable achievements of the Islamic period are advances in spherical trigonometry and the addition of the decimal point to the Arabic numeral system. Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as Al-Khwarismi, Omar Khayyam and Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī. \n\nDuring the early modern period, mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in Western Europe. The development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics. Leonhard Euler was the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and discoveries. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who made numerous contributions to fields such as algebra, analysis, differential geometry, matrix theory,number theory, and statistics. In the early 20th century, Kurt Gödel transformed mathematics by publishing his incompleteness theorems, which show that any axiomatic system that is consistent will contain unprovable propositions.\n\nMathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the \"Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\", \"The number of papers and books included in the \"Mathematical Reviews\" database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs.\"\n\nThe word \"mathematics\" comes from Ancient Greek μάθημα (\"máthēma\"), meaning \"that which is learnt\", \"what one gets to know\", hence also \"study\" and \"science\". The word for \"mathematics\" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning \"mathematical study\" even in Classical times. Its adjective is (\"mathēmatikós\"), meaning \"related to learning\" or \"studious\", which likewise further came to mean \"mathematical\". In particular, (\"mathēmatikḗ tékhnē\"), , meant \"the mathematical art\".\n\nSimilarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known as the \"mathēmatikoi\" (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant \"teachers\" rather than \"mathematicians\" in the modern sense.\n\nIn Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term \"mathematics\" more commonly meant \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") rather than \"mathematics\"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, Saint Augustine's warning that Christians should beware of \"mathematici\", meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.\n\nThe apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form (and the less commonly used singular derivative ), goes back to the Latin neuter plural (Cicero), based on the Greek plural (\"ta mathēmatiká\"), used by Aristotle (384–322 BC), and meaning roughly \"all things mathematical\"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective \"mathematic(al)\" and formed the noun \"mathematics\" anew, after the pattern of \"physics\" and \"metaphysics\", which were inherited from Greek. In English, the noun \"mathematics\" takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to \"maths\" or, in North America, \"math\".\n\nMathematics has no generally accepted definition. Aristotle defined mathematics as \"the science of quantity\", and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. Starting in the 19th century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as group theory and projective geometry, which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions. Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics, some emphasize its abstractness, some emphasize certain topics within mathematics. Today, no consensus on the definition of mathematics prevails, even among professionals. There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science. A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable. Some just say, \"Mathematics is what mathematicians do.\"\n\nThree leading types of definition of mathematics are called logicist, intuitionist, and formalist, each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought. All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.\n\nAn early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was Benjamin Peirce's \"the science that draws necessary conclusions\" (1870). In the \"Principia Mathematica\", Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead advanced the philosophical program known as logicism, and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of symbolic logic. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's \"All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic\" (1903).\n\nIntuitionist definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer, identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is \"Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other.\" A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct.\n\nFormalist definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. Haskell Curry defined mathematics simply as \"the science of formal systems\". A formal system is a set of symbols, or \"tokens\", and some \"rules\" telling how the tokens may be combined into \"formulas\". In formal systems, the word \"axiom\" has a special meaning, different from the ordinary meaning of \"a self-evident truth\". In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.\n\nThe German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss referred to mathematics as \"the Queen of the Sciences\". More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics \"the Queen of Science ... the main driving force behind scientific discovery\". In the original Latin \"Regina Scientiarum\", as well as in German \"Königin der Wissenschaften\", the word corresponding to \"science\" means a \"field of knowledge\", and this was the original meaning of \"science\" in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization restricting the meaning of \"science\" to \"natural science\" follows the rise of Baconian science, which contrasted \"natural science\" to scholasticism, the Aristotelean method of inquiring from first principles. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as biology, chemistry, or physics. Albert Einstein stated that \"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\"\n\nMany philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable, and thus not a science according to the definition of Karl Popper. However, in the 1930s Gödel's incompleteness theorems convinced many mathematicians that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that \"most mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently.\" Other thinkers, notably Imre Lakatos, have applied a version of falsificationism to mathematics itself.\n\nAn alternative view is that certain scientific fields (such as theoretical physics) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration of the logical consequences of assumptions. Intuition and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.\n\nThe opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is \"created\" (as in art) or \"discovered\" (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of \"Science and Mathematics\", indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nMathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, land measurement, architecture and later astronomy; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the physicist Richard Feynman invented the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's string theory, a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four fundamental forces of nature, continues to inspire new mathematics.\n\nSome mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between pure mathematics and applied mathematics. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. number theory in cryptography. This remarkable fact, that even the \"purest\" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what Eugene Wigner has called \"the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics\". As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest Mathematics Subject Classification runs to 46 pages. Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, operations research, and computer science.\n\nFor those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the \"elegance\" of mathematics, its intrinsic aesthetics and inner beauty. Simplicity and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant proof, such as Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers, and in an elegant numerical method that speeds calculation, such as the fast Fourier transform. G. H. Hardy in \"A Mathematician's Apology\" expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic. Mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant, proofs from \"The Book\" of God according to Paul Erdős. The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.\n\nMost of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century. Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery. Euler (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to Barbara Oakley, this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more \"abstract\" and more \"encrypted\" than those of natural language. Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as \"cow\") with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog. Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.\n\nMathematical language can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as \"or\" and \"only\", have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as \"open\" and \"field\" refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as \"homeomorphism\" and \"integrable\" that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as \"iff\" for \"if and only if\" belong to mathematical jargon. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as \"rigor\".\n\nMathematical proof is fundamentally a matter of rigor. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken \"theorems\", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject. The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of Isaac Newton the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about computer-assisted proofs. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.\n\nAxioms in traditional thought were \"self-evident truths\", but that conception is problematic. At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an axiomatic system. It was the goal of Hilbert's program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to Gödel's incompleteness theorem every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has undecidable formulas; and so a final axiomatization of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but set theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.\n\nMathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and analysis). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to logic, to set theory (foundations), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences (applied mathematics), and more recently to the rigorous study of uncertainty. While some areas might seem unrelated, the Langlands program has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and number theory.\n\nIn order to clarify the foundations of mathematics, the fields of mathematical logic and set theory were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections of objects. Category theory, which deals in an abstract way with mathematical structures and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase \"crisis of foundations\" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930. Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the controversy over Cantor's set theory and the Brouwer–Hilbert controversy.\n\nMathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous axiomatic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to Gödel's incompleteness theorems which (informally) imply that any effective formal system that contains basic arithmetic, if \"sound\" (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily \"incomplete\" (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved \"in that system\"). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into recursion theory, model theory, and proof theory, and is closely linked to theoretical computer science, as well as to category theory. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a consequence of the MRDP theorem.\n\nTheoretical computer science includes computability theory, computational complexity theory, and information theory. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model – the Turing machine. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the \"\" problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems. Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as compression and entropy.\n\nThe study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar natural numbers and integers (\"whole numbers\") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in arithmetic. The deeper properties of integers are studied in number theory, from which come such popular results as Fermat's Last Theorem. The twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture are two unsolved problems in number theory.\n\nAs the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a subset of the rational numbers (\"fractions\"). These, in turn, are contained within the real numbers, which are used to represent continuous quantities. Real numbers are generalized to complex numbers. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include quaternions and octonions. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the transfinite numbers, which formalize the concept of \"infinity\". According to the fundamental theorem of algebra all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the cardinal numbers. These include the aleph numbers, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.\n\nMany mathematical objects, such as sets of numbers and functions, exhibit internal structure as a consequence of operations or relations that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study groups, rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of abstract algebra.\n\nBy its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning compass and straightedge constructions were finally solved using Galois theory, which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is linear algebra, which is the general study of vector spaces, whose elements called vectors have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. Combinatorics studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.\n\nThe study of space originates with geometry – in particular, Euclidean geometry, which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known Pythagorean theorem. Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, non-Euclidean geometries (which play a central role in general relativity) and topology. Quantity and space both play a role in analytic geometry, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. Convex and discrete geometry were developed to solve problems in number theory and functional analysis but now are pursued with an eye on applications in optimization and computer science. Within differential geometry are the concepts of fiber bundles and calculus on manifolds, in particular, vector and tensor calculus. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of polynomial equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of topological groups, which combine structure and space. Lie groups are used to study space, structure, and change. Topology in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes point-set topology, set-theoretic topology, algebraic topology and differential topology. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are metrizability theory, axiomatic set theory, homotopy theory, and Morse theory. Topology also includes the now solved Poincaré conjecture, and the still unsolved areas of the Hodge conjecture. Other results in geometry and topology, including the four color theorem and Kepler conjecture, have been proved only with the help of computers.\n\nUnderstanding and describing change is a common theme in the natural sciences, and calculus was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. Functions arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of real numbers and functions of a real variable is known as real analysis, with complex analysis the equivalent field for the complex numbers. Functional analysis focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) spaces of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is quantum mechanics. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as differential equations. Many phenomena in nature can be described by dynamical systems; chaos theory makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still deterministic behavior.\n\nApplied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, \"applied mathematics\" is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge. The term \"applied mathematics\" also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, \"applied mathematics\" focuses on the \"formulation, study, and use of mathematical models\" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.\n\nIn the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in pure mathematics.\n\nApplied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with probability theory. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) \"create data that makes sense\" with random sampling and with randomized experiments; the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from observational studies, statisticians \"make sense of the data\" using the art of modelling and the theory of inference – with model selection and estimation; the estimated models and consequential predictions should be tested on new data.\n\nStatistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence. Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.\n\nComputational mathematics proposes and studies methods for solving mathematical problems that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. Numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory; numerical analysis includes the study of approximation and discretization broadly with special concern for rounding errors. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic matrix and graph theory. Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.\n\nArguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields Medal, established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe Wolf Prize in Mathematics, instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the Abel Prize, was instituted in 2003. The Chern Medal was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.\n\nA famous list of 23 open problems, called \"Hilbert's problems\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the \"Millennium Prize Problems\", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the Riemann hypothesis, duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a $1 million reward.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3008091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3008091", "title": "Mathematics Subject Classification", "text": "Mathematics Subject Classification\n\nThe Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) is an alphanumerical classification scheme collaboratively produced by staff of, and based on the coverage of, the two major mathematical reviewing databases, Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt MATH. The MSC is used by many mathematics journals, which ask authors of research papers and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The current version is MSC2010.\n\nThe MSC is a hierarchical scheme, with three levels of structure. A classification can be two, three or five digits long, depending on how many levels of the classification scheme are used.\n\nThe first level is represented by a two digit number, the second by a letter, and the third by another two digit number. For example:\n\n\nAt the top level, 64 mathematical disciplines are labeled with a unique 2 digit number. As well as the typical areas of mathematical research, there are top level categories for \"History and Biography\", \"Mathematics Education\", and for the overlap with different sciences. Physics (i.e. mathematical physics) is particularly well represented in the classification scheme with a number of different categories including:\n\nAll valid MSC classification codes must have at least the first level identifier.\n\nThe second level codes are a single letter from the Latin alphabet. These represent specific areas covered by the first level discipline. The second level codes vary from discipline to discipline.\n\nFor example, for differential geometry, the top-level code is 53, and the second-level codes are:\n\nIn addition, the special second level code \"-\" is used for specific kinds of materials. These codes are of the form:\n\n\nThe second and third level of these codes are always the same - only the first level changes. For example, it is not valid to use 53- as a classification. Either 53 on its own or, better yet, a more specific code should be used.\n\nThird level codes are the most specific, usually corresponding to a specific kind of mathematical object or a well-known problem or research area.\n\nThe third-level code 99 exists in every category and means \"none of the above, but in this section\"\n\nThe AMS recommends that papers submitted to its journals for publication have one primary classification and one or more optional secondary classifications. A typical MSC subject class line on a research paper looks like\n\nMSC Primary 03C90; Secondary 03-02;\n\nAccording to the American Mathematical Society (AMS) help page about MSC, the MSC has been revised a number of times since 1940. Based on a scheme to organize AMS's \"Mathematical Offprint Service\" (MOS scheme), the \"AMS Classification\" was established for the classification of reviews in \"Mathematical Reviews\" in the 1960s. It saw various ad-hoc changes. Despite its shortcomings, Zentralblatt für Mathematik started to use it as well in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, a jointly revised scheme with more formal rules was agreed upon by Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt für Mathematik under the new name Mathematics Subject Classification. It saw various revisions as \"MSC1990\", \"MSC2000\" and \"MSC2010\". In July 2016, Mathematical Reviews and zbMATH started collecting input from the mathematical community on the next revision of MSC, which is due to be released in 2020. The original classification of older items has not been changed. This can sometimes make it difficult to search for older works dealing with particular topics. Changes at the first level involved the subjects with (present) codes 03, 08, 12-20, 28, 37, 51, 58, 74, 90, 91, 92.\n\nFor physics papers the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) is often used. Due to the large overlap between mathematics and physics research it is quite common to see both PACS and MSC codes on research papers, particularly for multidisciplinary journals and repositories such as the arXiv.\n\nThe ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) is a similar hierarchical classification scheme for computer science. There is some overlap between the AMS and ACM classification schemes, in subjects related to both mathematics and computer science, however the two schemes differ in the details of their organization of those topics.\n\nThe classification scheme used on the arXiv is chosen to reflect the papers submitted. As arXiv is multidisciplinary its classification scheme does not fit entirely with the MSC, ACM or PACS classification schemes. It is common to see codes from one or more of these schemes on individual papers.\n\nThe top level subjects under the MSC are, grouped here by common area names that are not part of the MSC:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52380256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52380256", "title": "Mediation-driven attachment model", "text": "Mediation-driven attachment model\n\nIn the scale-free network theory (mathematical theory of networks or graph theory), a mediation-driven attachment (MDA) model appears to embody a preferential attachment rule tacitly rather than explicitly. According to MDA rule, a new node first picks a node from the existing network at random and connect itself not with that but with one of the neighbors also picked at random.\n\nBarabasi and Albert in 1999 noted through their seminal paper noted that (i) most natural and man-made networks are not static, rather they grow with time and (ii) new nodes do not connect with an already connected one randomly rather preferentially with respect to their degrees. The later mechanism is called preferential attachment (PA) rule which embodies the rich get richer phenomena in economics. In their first model, known as the Barabási–Albert model, Barabási and Albert (BA model) choose\n\nwhere, formula_2 is the probability that the new node picks a node formula_3 from the labelled nodes of the existing network. It directly embodies the rich get richer mechanism.\n\nRecently, Hassan \"et al.\" proposed a mediation-driven attachment model which appears to embody the PA rule but not directly rather in disguise. In the MDA model, an incoming node choose an existing node to connect by first picking one of the existing nodes at random which is regarded as mediator. The new node then connect with one of the neighbors of the mediator which is also picked at random. Now the question is: What is the probability formula_2 that an already existing node formula_3 is finally picked to connect it with the new node? Say, the node formula_3 has degree formula_7 and hence it has formula_7 neighbors. Consider that the neighbors of formula_3 are labeled formula_10 which have degrees formula_11 respectively. One can reach the node formula_3 from each of these formula_7 nodes with probabilities inverse of their respective degrees, and each of the formula_7 nodes are likely to be picked at random with probability formula_15. Thus the probability formula_2 of the MDA model is:\n\nIt can be re-written as\n\nwhere the factor formula_19 is the inverse of the harmonic mean (IHM) of degrees of the formula_7 neighbors of the node formula_3. Extensive numerical simulation suggest that for small formula_22 the IHM value of each node fluctuate so wildly that the mean of the IHM values over the entire network bears no meaning. However, for large formula_22 (specially formula_22 approximately greater than 14) the distribution of IHM value of the entire network become left skewed Gaussian type and mean starts to have a meaning which becomes a constant value in the large formula_22 limit. In this limit one finds that formula_26 which is exactly the PA rule. It implies that the higher the links (degree) a node has, the higher its chance of gaining more links since they can be reached in a larger number of ways through mediators which essentially embodies the intuitive idea of rich get richer mechanism. Therefore, the MDA network can be seen to follow the PA rule but in disguise. Moreover, for small formula_22 the MFA is no longer valid rather the attachment probability formula_2 becomes super-preferential in character.\n\nThe idea of MDA rule can be found in the growth process of the weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL). An existing node (the center of each block of the WPSL is regarded as nodes and the common border between blocks as the links between the corresponding nodes) during the process gain links only if one of its neighbor is picked not itself. It implies that the higher the links (or degree) a node has, the higher its chance of gaining more links since they can be reached in a larger number of ways. It essentially embodies the intuitive idea of PA rule. Therefore, the dual of the WPSL is a network which can be seen to follow preferential attachment rule but in disguise. Indeed, its degree distribution is found to exhibit power-law as underlined by Barabasi and Albert as one of the essential ingredients.\n\nimplies that one can apply the mean-field approximation (MFA). That is, within this approximation one can replace the true IHM value formula_30 of each node by their mean, where the factor formula_22 that the number of edges the new nodes come with is introduced for latter convenience. The rate equation to solve then becomes exactly like that of the BA model and hence the network that emerges following MDA rule is also scale-free in nature. The only difference is that the exponent formula_32 depends on formula_22 where as in the BA model formula_34 independent of formula_22.\n\nIn the growing network not all nodes are equally important. The extent of their importance is measured by the value of their degree formula_36. Nodes which are linked to an unusually large number of other nodes, i.e. nodes with exceptionally high formula_36 value, are known as hubs. They are special because their existence make the mean distance, measured in units of the number of links, between nodes incredibly small thereby playing the key role in spreading rumors, opinions, diseases, computer viruses etc. It is, therefore, important to know the properties of the largest hub, which we regard as the leader. Like in society, the leadership in a growing network is not permanent. That is, once a node becomes the leader, it does not mean that it remains the leader \"ad infinitum\". An interesting question is: how long does the leader retain this leadership property as the network evolves? To find an answer to this question, we define the leadership persistence probability formula_38 that aleader retains its leadership for at least up to time formula_39. Persistence probability has been of interest in many different systems ranging from coarsening dynamics to fluctuating interfaces or polymer chains.\n\nThe basic idea of the MDA rule is, however not completely new as either this or models similar to this can be found in a few earlier works, albeit their approach, ensuing analysis and their results are different from ours. For instance, Saramaki and Kaski presented a random-walk based model. Another model proposed by Boccaletti \"et al.\" may appear similar to ours, but it markedly differs on closer look. Recently, Yang {\\it et al.} too gave a form for formula_2 and resorted to mean-field approximation. However, the nature of their expressions are significantly different from the one studied by Hassan \"et al.\". Yet another closely related model is the Growing Network with Redirection (GNR) model presented by Gabel, Krapivsky and Redner where at each time step a new node either attaches to a randomly chosen target node with probability formula_41, or to the parent of the target with probability formula_42. The GNR model with formula_42 may appear similar to the MDA model. However, it should be noted that unlike the GNR model, the MDA model is for undirected networks, and that the new link can connect with any neighbor of the mediator-parent or not. One more difference is that, in the MDA model new node may join the existing network with formula_22 edges and in the GNR model it is considered formula_45 case only.\n"}

{"id": "457210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457210", "title": "Pure mathematics", "text": "Pure mathematics\n\nBroadly speaking, pure mathematics (or fundamental mathematics) is mathematics that studies entirely abstract concepts. This has been a recognizable category of mathematical activity from the 19th century onwards, at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of navigation, astronomy, physics, economics, engineering, and so on.\n\nAnother view is that pure mathematics is \"not necessarily\" applied mathematics: it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world. Even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians.\n\nOn the other hand, many pure mathematicians draw on natural and social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research.\n\nAncient Greek mathematicians were among the earliest to make a distinction between pure and applied mathematics. Plato helped to create the gap between \"arithmetic\", now called number theory, and \"logistic\", now called arithmetic. Plato regarded logistic (arithmetic) as appropriate for businessmen and men of war who \"must learn the art of numbers or [they] will not know how to array [their] troops\" and arithmetic (number theory) as appropriate for philosophers \"because [they have] to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being.\" Euclid of Alexandria, when asked by one of his students of what use was the study of geometry, asked his slave to give the student threepence, \"since he must make gain of what he learns.\" The Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga was asked about the usefulness of some of his theorems in Book IV of \"Conics\" to which he proudly asserted,\nThey are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason.\nAnd since many of his results were not applicable to the science or engineering of his day, Apollonius further argued in the preface of the fifth book of \"Conics\" that the subject is one of those that \"...seem worthy of study for their own sake.\"\n\nThe term itself is enshrined in the full title of the Sadleirian Chair, founded (as a professorship) in the mid-nineteenth century. The idea of a separate discipline of \"pure\" mathematics may have emerged at that time. The generation of Gauss made no sweeping distinction of the kind, between \"pure\" and \"applied\". In the following years, specialisation and professionalisation (particularly in the Weierstrass approach to mathematical analysis) started to make a rift more apparent.\n\nAt the start of the twentieth century mathematicians took up the axiomatic method, strongly influenced by David Hilbert's example. The logical formulation of pure mathematics suggested by Bertrand Russell in terms of a quantifier structure of propositions seemed more and more plausible, as large parts of mathematics became axiomatised and thus subject to the simple criteria of \"rigorous proof\".\n\nIn fact in an axiomatic setting \"rigorous\" adds nothing to the idea of \"proof\". Pure mathematics, according to a view that can be ascribed to the Bourbaki group, is what is proved. Pure mathematician became a recognized vocation, achievable through training.\n\nThe case was made that pure mathematics is useful in engineering education:\n\nOne central concept in pure mathematics is the idea of generality; pure mathematics often exhibits a trend towards increased generality. Uses and advantages of generality include the following:\n\n\nGenerality's impact on intuition is both dependent on the subject and a matter of personal preference or learning style. Often generality is seen as a hindrance to intuition, although it can certainly function as an aid to it, especially when it provides analogies to material for which one already has good intuition.\n\nAs a prime example of generality, the Erlangen program involved an expansion of geometry to accommodate non-Euclidean geometries as well as the field of topology, and other forms of geometry, by viewing geometry as the study of a space together with a group of transformations. The study of numbers, called algebra at the beginning undergraduate level, extends to abstract algebra at a more advanced level; and the study of functions, called calculus at the college freshman level becomes mathematical analysis and functional analysis at a more advanced level. Each of these branches of more \"abstract\" mathematics have many sub-specialties, and there are in fact many connections between pure mathematics and applied mathematics disciplines. A steep rise in abstraction was seen mid 20th century.\n\nIn practice, however, these developments led to a sharp divergence from physics, particularly from 1950 to 1983. Later this was criticised, for example by Vladimir Arnold, as too much Hilbert, not enough Poincaré. The point does not yet seem to be settled, in that string theory pulls one way, while discrete mathematics pulls back towards proof as central.\n\nMathematicians have always had differing opinions regarding the distinction between pure and applied mathematics. \nOne of the most famous (but perhaps misunderstood) modern examples of this debate can be found in G.H. Hardy's \"A Mathematician's Apology\".\n\nIt is widely believed that Hardy considered applied mathematics to be ugly and dull. Although it is true that Hardy preferred pure mathematics, which he often compared to painting and poetry, Hardy saw the distinction between pure and applied mathematics to be simply that applied mathematics sought to express \"physical\" truth in a mathematical framework, whereas pure mathematics expressed truths that were independent of the physical world. Hardy made a separate distinction in mathematics between what he called \"real\" mathematics, \"which has permanent aesthetic value\", and \"the dull and elementary parts of mathematics\" that have practical use.\n\nHardy considered some physicists, such as Einstein, and Dirac, to be among the \"real\" mathematicians, but at the time that he was writing the \"Apology\" he also considered general relativity and quantum mechanics to be \"useless\", which allowed him to hold the opinion that only \"dull\" mathematics was useful. Moreover, Hardy briefly admitted that—just as the application of matrix theory and group theory to physics had come unexpectedly—the time may come where some kinds of beautiful, \"real\" mathematics may be useful as well.\n\nAnother insightful view is offered by Magid:\nAnalysis is concerned with the properties of functions. It deals with concepts such as continuity, limits, differentiation and integration, thus providing a rigorous foundation for the calculus of infinitesimals introduced by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century. Real analysis studies functions of real numbers, while complex analysis extends the aforementioned concepts to functions of complex numbers. Functional analysis is a branch of analysis that studies infinite-dimensional vector spaces and views functions as points in these spaces.\n\nAbstract algebra is not to be confused with the manipulation of formulae that is covered in secondary education. It studies sets together with binary operations defined on them. Sets and their binary operations may be classified according to their properties: for instance, if an operation is associative on a set that contains an identity element and inverses for each member of the set, the set and operation is considered to be a group. Other structures include rings, fields, vector spaces and lattices.\n\nCombinatorics is a branch of mathematics concerning the study of finite or countable discrete structures. It also interacts with many other areas of mathematics. For example, additive combinatorics is related to number theory and analysis, and graph theory comes from topology.\n\nGeometry is the study of shapes and space, in particular, groups of transformations that act on spaces. For example, projective geometry is about the group of projective transformations that act on the real projective plane, whereas inversive geometry is concerned with the group of inversive transformations acting on the extended complex plane.\n\nNumber theory is the theory of the positive integers. It is based on ideas such as divisibility and congruence. Its fundamental theorem states that each positive integer has a unique prime factorization. In some ways it is the most accessible discipline in pure mathematics for the general public: for instance the Goldbach conjecture is easily stated (but is yet to be proved or disproved). In other ways it is the least accessible discipline; for example, Wiles' proof that Fermat's equation has no nontrivial solutions requires understanding automorphic forms, which though intrinsic to nature have not found a place in physics or the general public discourse.\n\nTopology is a modern extension of Geometry. Rather than focusing on the sizes of objects and their precise measurement, topology involves the properties of spaces or objects that are preserved under smooth operations such as bending or twisting (but not, for example, tearing or shearing). Topology's subfields interact with other branches of pure math: traditional topology uses ideas from analysis, such as metric spaces, and algebraic topology relies on ideas from combinatorics in addition to those of analysis.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58854243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58854243", "title": "Quota rule", "text": "Quota rule\n\nIn mathematics and political science, the quota rule states that when proportionally apportioning seats, the number of representative seats that should be alloted to a given party should be no more than the upper or lower roundings (called upper and lower quotas) of the proportional representation; i.e if a party deserves 10.56 seats out of 15, the quota rule states that when the seats are alloted, the party may get 10 or 11 seats, but not lower or higher. The use of this rule is important when allocating seats in places such as the U.S. House of Representatives and any place that uses proportional representation.\n\nThe rule can be rigorously defined as follows: Let formula_1 be the population of the party, formula_2 be the total population, and formula_3 be the number of available seats. The quota for that party is then\n\nWhen the quota results in a fractional value, the lower quota is the quota rounded down and the upper quota is the quota rounded up. Hence, the quota rule states that the only allocation for that party should be either the lower or upper quota. If at any time an allocation gives a party a greater or lesser number of seats than the upper or lower quota, that allocation (and by extension, the method used to allocate it) is said to be in violation of the quota rule.\n\nThe Balinski–Young theorem proved in 1980 that if an apportionment method satisfies the quota rule, it must fail to satisfy some other apportionment paradox. For instance, although Hamilton's method satisfies the quota rule, it violates the Alabama paradox and the population paradox. The theorem itself is broken up into several different proofs that cover a wide number of circumstances.\n\nSpecifically, there are two main statements that apply to the quota rule:\n\nDifferent methods for allocating seats may or may not satisfy the quota rule. For example, Hamilton's method proportions seats equally until a fractional value is reached; the surplus seats are then given to the state with the largest fractional parts until there are no more surplus seats. Hamilton's method will always pass the quota rule, as there is no period in which a state can be allotted more than the upper quota or less than the lower quota. \n\nJefferson's method, which was one of the first used by the United States, sometimes allocated more than is allowed, violating the quota rule. This violation led to a growing problem where larger states receive more representatives than smaller states, which was not corrected until Webster's method was implemented in 1842; Webster's method also violates the quota rule, although much more rarely.\n\n"}
