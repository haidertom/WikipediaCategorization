{"id": "2179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179", "title": "Autobiography", "text": "Autobiography\n\nAn autobiography (from the Greek, αὐτός-\"autos\" self + βίος-\"bios\" life + γράφειν-\"graphein\" to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself. The word \"autobiography\" was first used deprecatingly by William Taylor in 1797 in the English periodical \"The Monthly Review\", when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as \"pedantic\". However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by Robert Southey in 1809. Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity. Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that \"[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time\". Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition. While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. The memoir form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life. \n\n\"See also: List of autobiographies and for examples.\"\n\nAutobiographical works are by nature subjective. The inability—or unwillingness—of the author to accurately recall memories has in certain cases resulted in misleading or incorrect information. Some sociologists and psychologists have noted that autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history.\n\nSpiritual autobiography is an account of an author's struggle or journey towards God, followed by conversion a religious conversion, often interrupted by moments of regression. The author re-frames his or her life as a demonstration of divine intention through encounters with the Divine. The earliest example of a spiritual autobiography is Augustine's \"Confessions\" though the tradition has expanded to include other religious traditions in works such as Zahid Rohari's \"An Autobiography\" and \"Black Elk Speaks\". The spiritual autobiography works as an endorsement of his or her religion.\n\nA memoir is slightly different in character from an autobiography. While an autobiography typically focuses on the \"life and times\" of the writer, a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. One early example is that of Julius Caesar's \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\", also known as \"Commentaries on the Gallic Wars\". In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the Gallic Wars. His second memoir, \"Commentarii de Bello Civili\" (or \"Commentaries on the Civil War\") is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in the civil war against Gnaeus Pompeius and the Senate. \n\nLeonor López de Córdoba (1362–1420) wrote what is supposed to be the first autobiography in Spanish. The English Civil War (1642–1651) provoked a number of examples of this genre, including works by Sir Edmund Ludlow and Sir John Reresby. French examples from the same period include the memoirs of Cardinal de Retz (1614–1679) and the Duc de Saint-Simon.\n\nThe term \"fictional autobiography\" signifies novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own autobiography, meaning that the character is the first-person narrator and that the novel addresses both internal and external experiences of the character. Daniel Defoe's \"Moll Flanders\" is an early example. Charles Dickens' \"David Copperfield\" is another such classic, and J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\" is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. Charlotte Brontë's \"Jane Eyre\" is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., Robert Nye's \"Memoirs of Lord Byron\".\n\nIn antiquity such works were typically entitled \"apologia,\" purporting to be self-justification rather than self-documentation. John Henry Newman's Christian confessional work (first published in 1864) is entitled \"Apologia Pro Vita Sua\" in reference to this tradition.\n\nThe Jewish historian Flavius Josephus introduces his autobiography (\"Josephi Vita\", c. 99) with self-praise, which is followed by a justification of his actions as a Jewish rebel commander of Galilee.\n\nThe pagan rhetor Libanius (c. 314–394) framed his life memoir (\"Oration I\" begun in 374) as one of his orations, not of a public kind, but of a literary kind that could not be aloud in privacy.\n\nAugustine (354–430) applied the title \"Confessions\" to his autobiographical work, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau used the same title in the 18th century, initiating the chain of confessional and sometimes racy and highly self-critical, autobiographies of the Romantic era and beyond. Augustine's was arguably the first Western autobiography ever written, and became an influential model for Christian writers throughout the Middle Ages. It tells of the hedonistic lifestyle Augustine lived for a time within his youth, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits; his following and leaving of the anti-sex and anti-marriage Manichaeism in attempts to seek sexual morality; and his subsequent return to Christianity due to his embracement of Skepticism and the New Academy movement (developing the view that sex is good, and that virginity is better, comparing the former to silver and the latter to gold; Augustine's views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology). \"Confessions\" will always rank among the great masterpieces of western literature.\n\nIn the spirit of Augustine's \"Confessions\" is the 12th-century \"Historia Calamitatum\" of Peter Abelard, outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.\n\nIn the 15th century, Leonor López de Córdoba, a Spanish noblewoman, wrote her \"Memorias\", which may be the first autobiography in Castillian.\n\nZāhir ud-Dīn Mohammad Bābur, who founded the Mughal dynasty of South Asia kept a journal \"Bāburnāma\" (Chagatai/; literally: \"Book of Babur\" or \"Letters of Babur\") which was written between 1493 and 1529.\n\nOne of the first great autobiographies of the Renaissance is that of the sculptor and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply \"Vita\" (Italian: \"Life\"). He declares at the start: \"No matter what sort he is, everyone who has to his credit what are or really seem great achievements, if he cares for truth and goodness, ought to write the story of his own life in his own hand; but no one should venture on such a splendid undertaking before he is over forty.\" These criteria for autobiography generally persisted until recent times, and most serious autobiographies of the next three hundred years conformed to them.\n\nAnother autobiography of the period is \"De vita propria\", by the Italian mathematician, physician and astrologer Gerolamo Cardano (1574).\n\nIt is often claimed that the earliest known autobiography in English is the early 15th-century \"Book of Margery Kempe\", describing among other things Kempe's pilgrimage to the Holy Land and visit to Rome although it is, at best, only a partial autobiography and arguably more a memoir of religious experiences. The book remained in manuscript and was not published until 1936.\n\nPossibly the first publicly available autobiography written in English was Captan John Smith's autobiography published in 1630 which was regarded by many as not much more than a collection of tall tales told by someone of doubtful veracity. This changed with the publication of Philip Barbour's definitive biography in 1964 which, amongst other things, established independent factual bases for many of Smith's \"tall tales\", many of which could not have been known by Smith at the time of writing unless he was actually present at the events recounted. \n\nOther notable English autobiographies of the 17th century include those of Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1643, published 1764) and John Bunyan (\"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners\", 1666).\n\nJarena Lee (1783 – 1864), was the first African American woman to have a published biography in the United States.\n\nFollowing the trend of Romanticism, which greatly emphasized the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's \"Confessions\", a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. Stendhal's autobiographical writings of the 1830s, \"The Life of Henry Brulard\" and \"Memoirs of an Egotist\", are both avowedly influenced by Rousseau. An English example is William Hazlitt's \"Liber Amoris\" (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life.\n\nWith the rise of education, cheap newspapers and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop, and the beneficiaries of this were not slow to cash in on this by producing autobiographies. It became the expectation—rather than the exception—that those in the public eye should write about themselves—not only writers such as Charles Dickens (who also incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and Anthony Trollope, but also politicians (e.g. Henry Brooks Adams), philosophers (e.g. John Stuart Mill), churchmen such as Cardinal Newman, and entertainers such as P. T. Barnum. Increasingly, in accordance with romantic taste, these accounts also began to deal, amongst other topics, with aspects of childhood and upbringing—far removed from the principles of \"Cellinian\" autobiography.\nFrom the 17th century onwards, \"scandalous memoirs\" by supposed libertines, serving a public taste for titillation, have been frequently published. Typically pseudonymous, they were (and are) largely works of fiction written by ghostwriters. So-called \"autobiographies\" of modern professional athletes and media celebrities—and to a lesser extent about politicians, generally written by a ghostwriter, are routinely published. Some celebrities, such as Naomi Campbell, admit to not having read their \"autobiographies\".. Some sensationalist autobiographies such as James Frey's \"A Million Little Pieces\" have been publicly exposed as having embellished or fictionalized significant details of the authors' lives.\n\nAutobiography has become an increasingly popular and widely accessible form. \"A Fortunate Life\" by Albert Facey (1979) has become an Australian literary classic. With the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs as \"Angela’s Ashes\" and \"The Color of Water\", more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre.\n\nA genre where the \"claim for truth\" overlaps with fictional elements though the work still purports to be autobiographical is autofiction.\n\nFurthermore, in the latter years new impulses at the Autobiographical genre arrived from the italian poet and critic Menotti Lerro. In contrast to what Philippe Lejeune asserts Lerro claims that if the truth can only be grasped in a synchronic manner (also according to postmodernist philosophers point of view) and through fragments, why not entrust this narrative to the verse? Why not consider the role of “autobiography in verse” equally dignified as a form of self-narration? For the critic this, perhaps, is the necessary leap: through poetry it is possible to get the most dramatic and highest form of autobiographical narrative.\n\n"}
{"id": "26591223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26591223", "title": "Biographical criticism", "text": "Biographical criticism\n\nBiographical criticism is a form of literary criticism which analyzes a writer's biography to show the relationship between the author's life and their works of literature. Biographical criticism is often associated with historical-biographical criticism, a critical method that \"sees a literary work chiefly, if not exclusively, as a reflection of its author's life and times\".\n\nThis longstanding critical method dates back at least to the Renaissance period, and was employed extensively by Samuel Johnson in his \"Lives of the Poets\" (1779–81).\n\nLike any critical methodology, biographical criticism can be used with discretion and insight or employed as a superficial shortcut to understanding the literary work on its own terms through such strategies as Formalism. Hence 19th century biographical criticism came under disapproval by the so-called New Critics of the 1920s, who coined the term \"biographical fallacy\" to describe criticism that neglected the imaginative genesis of literature.\n\nNotwithstanding this critique, biographical criticism remained a significant mode of literary inquiry throughout the 20th century, particularly in studies of Charles Dickens and F. Scott Fitzgerald, among others. The method continues to be employed in the study of such authors as John Steinbeck, Walt Whitman and William Shakespeare.\n\nIn \"The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism\", in a chapter titled \"Peripatetic Biographical Criticism\", George Alexander Kennedy notes that in the Hellenistic age, \"The works of authors were read as sources of information about their lives, personalities and interests. Some of this material was then used by other commentators and critics to explain passages in their works. The process became a circular one in that, though Peripatetic biographers utilized external evidence where available, they had little to go on and quarried the texts for hints\".\n\nJackson J. Benson describes the form as a \"'recognition of 'otherness'—that there is an author who is different in personality and background from the reader—appears to be a simple-minded proposition. Yet as a basic prerequisite to the understanding and evaluation of a literary text it is often ignored even by the most sophisticated literary critics. The exploration of otherness is what literary biography and biographical criticism can do best, discovering an author as a unique individual, a discovery that puts a burden on us to reach out to recognize that uniqueness before we can fully comprehend an author's writings.'\"\n\nBiographical criticism shares in common with New Historicism an interest in the fact that all literary works are situated in specific historical and biographical contexts from which they are generated. Biographical Criticism, like New Historicism, rejects the concept that literary studies should be limited to the internal or formal characteristics of a literary work, and insists that it properly includes a knowledge of the contexts in which the work was created. Biographical criticism stands in ambiguous relationship to Romanticism. It has often been argued that it is a development from Romanticism, but it also stands in opposition to the Romantic tendency to view literature as manifesting a \"universal\" transcendence of the particular conditions of its genesis.\n\nIn \"The Art of Literary Biography\" (1995), John Worthen writes:\n\n"}
{"id": "174943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174943", "title": "Biographical evaluation", "text": "Biographical evaluation\n\nBiographical evaluation (), literally meaning\" 'Knowledge of Men' \"but more commonly understood as the \"Science of Narration\", refers to a discipline of Islamic religious studies within hadith terminology in which the narrators of hadith are evaluated. Its goal is to distinguish authentic and reliable hadiths from unreliable hadiths in establishing the credibility of the narrators, using both historic and religious knowledge. \"`Ilm ar-rijal\" is synonymous with what is commonly referred to as \"al-jarḥ wa al-taʻdīl\" (discrediting and accrediting) – the criticism and declared acceptance of hadith narrators.\n\nIn his \"Introduction to the Science of Hadith\", Ibn al-Salah, a renowned hadith specialist, explained the importance of the study of hadith narrators. Introducing the chapter entitled, 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable,' Ibn al-Salah said, \"This is from the most distinguished and noble types (of hadith study) as it results in recognizing the authenticity of a hadith or its weakness.\" He then explained that any criticism directed at a narrator was permissible due to the \"maintenance of the Shariah, purging it of any mistakes or misinformation\".\n\nStressing the importance of biographical evaluation, Ali ibn al-Madini, an early authority on the subject, said, \"Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge.\"\n\nThe Qur'anic verses are numerous that praise the Companions and criticize the hypocrites, both as a group and specific individuals from amongst them–as well as criticism of specific individuals other than the hypocrites. The most well-known of these is a verse of the Quran stating, \"O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done.\" While this verse was revealed regarding a particular individual, it is a general principle. Following this example, were the Prophet and then His Companions.\n\nWhile many Companions narrated hadith, according to Ahmad ibn Hanbal there were six who were the most prolific narrators of them, who lived long lives enabling them narrate to a large extent. They were: Abu Huraira, Abdullah ibn Umar, Aisha, Jabir ibn Abdullah, Ibn Abbas and Anas ibn Malik with Abu Huraira being the most prolific of them. According to Ibn al-Salah the most prolific narrators from the Companions was Abu Huraira followed by Ibn Abbas.\n\nIn spite of the Companions' efforts in narrating their hadith, there was no need for them to evaluate each other's narrating capabilities or trustworthiness. This is because, as Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi said, that Allah and his Prophet declared the Companions to be upright and trustworthy, and, therefore, there is no need to investigate their reliability, however, one must investigate the condition of those after them. However, there are many established narrations originating from the Companions praising some of the Followers with some criticism of specific individuals from them.\n\nAs for the Followers, the generation following the Companions, their praise of narrators was plentiful, while disparagement from them was seldom. Those narrators who were criticized from the Followers were not criticized for fabricating hadith, but, instead, due to heresy, such as the Kharijites, or due to weak memory or due to their condition as narrators being unknown.\n\nEvaluating the narrators of hadith began in the generation following that of the Companions based upon the statement of Muhammad Ibn Sirin, \"They did not previously inquire about the \"isnad\". However, after the turmoil occurred they would say, 'Name for us your narrators.' So the people of the Sunnah would have their hadith accepted and the people of innovation would not.\" The \"turmoil\" referred to is the conflicting ideologies of the Kharijites and extreme Shias that had emerged at the time of the third \"khalifas\" Uthman ibn Affan's assassination and the social unrest of the Kharijites in opposition to the succeeding rulers, Ali and Muawiyah. The death of Uthman was in the year 35 after the migration.\n\nIn the following generation, that after the Followers, and afterward, the weak, unacceptable narrators increased in number, necessitating that a group of scholars clarify the condition of the narrators and distinguishing any narrations that were not authentic.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Salah, quoting an early religious authority, the first to specialize in the study of hadith narrators was Shuʿba Ibn al-Ḥajjāj, followed by Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Qattan and then Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Yahya ibn Ma'in. Al-Bulqini added some names to the aforementioned: Ali ibn al-Madini and 'Amr ibn 'Ali al-Fallas, and then mentioned Malik ibn Anas and Hisham ibn Urwah as having preceded them in evaluating narrators.\n\nA hadith is subject to criticism on the basis of two matters. The first relates to the continuity of the hadith's chain of narration; if there is discontinuity between two or more narrators, that hadith is criticized on this basis as discussed in depth in the hadith terminology article. The second relates to criticism of a narrator, or more, in the chain of narration of a particular hadith.\n\nHadith narrators are evaluated in light of two qualities in determining the overall grading of a hadith. These qualities are derived from the definition of a hadith that is \"sahih\" constituting two of its five conditions. The first, uprightness (\"al-ʻadālah\"), is defined as the ability an individual possesses to adhere to moralistic decorum (\"al-taqwā\") and maintaining proper social graces (\"al-murūʼah\"). The second, precision (\"al-ḍabṭ\"), is of two types, the first is pertaining to memorization and the second to writing. Precision in memorization (\"ḍabṭ al-ṣadr\") refers to the ability to retain the specified information, recalling and conveying it at will. Precision in writing (\"ḍabṭ al-kitāb\") is the preservation of the written information from the time it was heard until its transmission.\n\nThe grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision. Ibn Ḥajr identified and enumerated ten qualities in which a narrator could be criticized. Five relate to trustworthiness and the other five to precision; however, he presented these ten qualities in order according to severity:\n\nHadith scholars of the past employed various methods by which to evaluate the narrating abilities of a narrator. From these means are the following:\n\nAs a result of the evaluation of narrators, each scholar would then conclude by describing the standing of each narrator. A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator, with some variation in usage of terms between the individual evaluators. These are divided into two categories, those terms that constitute praise (\"taʻdīl\") and those that constitute criticism (\"jarḥ\"). al-Suyūṭī gathered the various terms and arranged them in order of strength. He quoted four levels of strength for praise from Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah, adding that al-Dhahabi and Abd al-Rahim ibn al-Husain al-'Iraqi added an additional level and Ibn Ḥajr one above that. Thus according to al-Suyūṭī, there are six levels of praise. Similarly, al-Suyūṭī described six levels of terms used to criticize a narrator; he arranged them beginning with the least severe and concluding with the most severe criticism.<ref name=\"Tadrib 1/573-80\">\"Tadrib al-Rawi\", by al-Suyūṭī, vol. 1, pp. 573-8, \"Dar al-'Asimah\", Riyadh, first edition, 2003.</ref>\n\n\n\nCollections of narrator biographies are sometimes general and sometimes specific to particular categories of narrators. Among the most common of these categories are:\n\n\nBooks particular to the Companions:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character's real name is used. They differ from films \"based on a true story\" or \"historical drama films\" in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.\n\nBecause the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses. Ben Kingsley, Johnny Depp, Jim Carrey, and Jamie Foxx all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics: Ben Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi in \"Gandhi\" (1982), Depp as Ed Wood in \"Ed Wood\" (1994), Carrey as Andy Kaufman in \"Man on the Moon\" (1999), and Foxx as Ray Charles in \"Ray\" (2004).\n\nIn rare cases, sometimes called auto biopics, the subject of the film plays himself or herself: Jackie Robinson in \"The Jackie Robinson Story\"; Muhammad Ali in \"The Greatest\"; Audie Murphy in \"To Hell and Back\"; Patty Duke in \"Call Me Anna\"; Bob Mathias in \"The Bob Mathias Story\", Arlo Guthrie in \"Alice's Restaurant\"; Fantasia Barrino in \"\"; and Howard Stern in \"Private Parts\".\n\nBiopic scholars include George F. Custen of the College of Staten Island and Dennis P. Bingham of Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis. Custen, in \"Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History\" (1992), regards the genre as having died with the Hollywood studio era, and in particular, Darryl F. Zanuck. On the other hand, Bingham's 2010 study \"Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre\" shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by Rick Altman in his study, \"Film/Genre\". Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other, the former generally dealing with great accomplishments, the latter generally dealing with female victimization. Ellen Cheshire's \"Bio-Pics: a life in pictures\" (2014) examines UK/US films from the 1990s and 2000s. Each chapter reviews key films linked by profession and concludes with further viewing list. Christopher Robé has also written on the gender norms that underlie the biopic in his article, \"Taking Hollywood Back\" in the 2009 issue of \"Cinema Journal\". \n\nCasting can be controversial for biographical films. Casting is often a balance between similarity in looks and ability to portray the characteristics of the person. Anthony Hopkins felt that he should not have played Richard Nixon in \"Nixon\" because of a lack of resemblance between the two. The casting of John Wayne as Genghis Khan in \"The Conqueror\" was objected to because of the American Wayne being cast as the Mongol warlord. Egyptian critics criticized the casting of Louis Gossett, Jr., an African American actor, as Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in the 1982 TV miniseries \"Sadat\". Also, some objected to the casting of Jennifer Lopez in \"Selena\" because she is a New York City native of Puerto Rican descent while Selena was Mexican-American.\n\n"}

This kind of novel concentrates on the experiences a person had during his lifetime, the people they met and the incidents which occurred.

These reimagined biographies are sometimes called semi-biographical novels, to distinguish the relative historicity of the work from other biographical novels \n\nSome biographical novels bearing only superficial resemblance to the historical novels or introducing elements of other genres that supersede the retelling of the historical narrative, for example \"Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter\" follows the plot devices of a vampire fiction closely. Biographical fiction often also falls within the genres of historical fiction or alternative history.\n\nSome novels that are known best for their fictional prowess, but include extensive biographical information that is less obvious to readers. A very good example of this kind is Goldsmith's \"The Vicar of Wakefield\" and is believed to be the biography of a person the author had known and observed very closely. \n\nBiographical novels are frequently the foundation for film adaptations into the filmographic genre of biographical film.\n\nFor more reflection on the different types of biographical information used in literature, see Biography in literature.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7370562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7370562", "title": "Biography", "text": "Biography\n\nA biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality.\n\nBiographical works are usually non-fiction, but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life. One in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing. Works in diverse media, from literature to film, form the genre known as biography.\n\nAn authorized biography is written with the permission, cooperation, and at times, participation of a subject or a subject's heirs. An autobiography is written by the person himself or herself, sometimes with the assistance of a collaborator or ghostwriter.\n\nAt first, biographical writings were regarded merely as a subsection of history with a focus on a particular individual of historical importance. The independent genre of biography as distinct from general history writing, began to emerge in the 18th century and reached its contemporary form at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nOne of the earliest biographers was Cornelius Nepos, who published his work \"Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae\" (\"Lives of outstanding generals\") in 44 BC. Longer and more extensive biographies were written in Greek by Plutarch, in his \"Parallel Lives\", published about 80 A.D. In this work famous Greeks are paired with famous Romans, for example the orators Demosthenes and Cicero, or the generals Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar; some fifty biographies from the work survive. Another well-known collection of ancient biographies is \"De vita Caesarum\" (\"On the Lives of the Caesars\") by Suetonius, written about AD 121 in the time of the emperor Hadrian.\n\nIn the early Middle Ages (AD 400 to 1450), there was a decline in awareness of the classical culture in Europe. During this time, the only repositories of knowledge and records of the early history in Europe were those of the Roman Catholic Church. Hermits, monks, and priests used this historic period to write biographies. Their subjects were usually restricted to the church fathers, martyrs, popes, and saints. Their works were meant to be inspirational to the people and vehicles for conversion to Christianity (see Hagiography). One significant secular example of a biography from this period is the life of Charlemagne by his courtier Einhard.\n\nIn Medieval Islamic Civilization (c. AD 750 to 1258), similar traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad and other important figures in the early history of Islam began to be written, beginning the Prophetic biography tradition. Early biographical dictionaries were published as compendia of famous Islamic personalities from the 9th century onwards. They contained more social data for a large segment of the population than other works of that period. The earliest biographical dictionaries initially focused on the lives of the prophets of Islam and their companions, with one of these early examples being \"The Book of The Major Classes\" by Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi. And then began the documentation of the lives of many other historical figures (from rulers to scholars) who lived in the medieval Islamic world.\nBy the late Middle Ages, biographies became less church-oriented in Europe as biographies of kings, knights, and tyrants began to appear. The most famous of such biographies was \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" by Sir Thomas Malory. The book was an account of the life of the fabled King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. Following Malory, the new emphasis on humanism during the Renaissance promoted a focus on secular subjects, such as artists and poets, and encouraged writing in the vernacular.\n\nGiorgio Vasari's \"Lives of the Artists\" (1550) was the landmark biography focusing on secular lives. Vasari made celebrities of his subjects, as the \"Lives\" became an early \"bestseller\". Two other developments are noteworthy: the development of the printing press in the 15th century and the gradual increase in literacy.\n\nBiographies in the English language began appearing during the reign of Henry VIII. John Foxe's \"Actes and Monuments\" (1563), better known as \"Foxe's Book of Martyrs\", was essentially the first dictionary of the biography in Europe, followed by Thomas Fuller's \"The History of the Worthies of England\" (1662), with a distinct focus on public life.\n\nInfluential in shaping popular conceptions of pirates, \"A General History of the Pyrates\" (1724), by Charles Johnson, is the prime source for the biographies of many well-known pirates.\n\nThe American biography followed the English model, incorporating Thomas Carlyle's view that biography was a part of history. Carlyle asserted that the lives of great human beings were essential to understanding society and its institutions. While the historical impulse would remain a strong element in early American biography, American writers carved out a distinct approach. What emerged was a rather didactic form of biography, which sought to shape the individual character of a reader in the process of defining national character.\n\nThe first modern biography, and a work which exerted considerable influence on the evolution of the genre, was James Boswell's \"The Life of Samuel Johnson\", a biography of lexicographer and man-of-letters Samuel Johnson published in 1791. While Boswell's personal acquaintance with his subject only began in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, Boswell covered the entirety of Johnson's life by means of additional research. Itself an important stage in the development of the modern genre of biography, it has been claimed to be the greatest biography written in the English language. Boswell's work was unique in its level of research, which involved archival study, eye-witness accounts and interviews, its robust and attractive narrative, and its honest depiction of all aspects of Johnson's life and character - a formula which serves as the basis of biographical literature to this day.\n\nBiographical writing generally stagnated during the 19th century - in many cases there was a reversal to the more familiar hagiographical method of eulogizing the dead, similar to the biographies of saints produced in Medieval times. A distinction between mass biography and literary biography began to form by the middle of the century, reflecting a breach between high culture and middle-class culture. However, the number of biographies in print experienced a rapid growth, thanks to an expanding reading public. This revolution in publishing made books available to a larger audience of readers. In addition, affordable paperback editions of popular biographies were published for the first time. Periodicals began publishing a sequence of biographical sketches.\n\nAutobiographies became more popular, as with the rise of education and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop. Autobiographies were written by authors, such as Charles Dickens (who incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and Anthony Trollope, (his \"Autobiography\" appeared posthumously, quickly becoming a bestseller in London), philosophers, such as John Stuart Mill, churchmen – John Henry Newman – and entertainers – P. T. Barnum.\n\nThe sciences of psychology and sociology were ascendant at the turn of the 20th century and would heavily influence the new century’s biographies. The demise of the \"great man\" theory of history was indicative of the emerging mindset. Human behavior would be explained through Darwinian theories. \"Sociological\" biographies conceived of their subjects' actions as the result of the environment, and tended to downplay individuality. The development of psychoanalysis led to a more penetrating and comprehensive understanding of the biographical subject, and induced biographers to give more emphasis to childhood and adolescence. Clearly these psychological ideas were changing the way biographies were written, as a culture of autobiography developed, in which the telling of one's own story became a form of therapy. The conventional concept of heroes and narratives of success disappeared in the obsession with psychological explorations of personality.\nBritish critic Lytton Strachey revolutionized the art of biographical writing with his 1918 work \"Eminent Victorians\", consisting of biographies of four leading figures from the Victorian era: Cardinal Manning, Florence Nightingale, Thomas Arnold, and General Gordon. Strachey set out to breathe life into the Victorian era for future generations to read. Up until this point, as Strachey remarked in the preface, Victorian biographies had been \"as familiar as the \"cortège\" of the undertaker\", and wore the same air of \"slow, funereal barbarism.\" Strachey defied the tradition of \"two fat volumes...of undigested masses of material\" and took aim at the four iconic figures. His narrative demolished the myths that had built up around these cherished national heroes, whom he regarded as no better than a \"set of mouth bungled hypocrites\". The book achieved worldwide fame due to its irreverent and witty style, its concise and factually accurate nature, and its artistic prose.\n\nIn the 1920s and '30s, biographical writers sought to capitalize on Strachey's popularity by imitating his style. This new school featured iconoclasts, scientific analysts, and fictional biographers and included Gamaliel Bradford, André Maurois, and Emil Ludwig, among others. Robert Graves (\"I, Claudius\", 1934) stood out among those following Strachey's model of \"debunking biographies.\" The trend in literary biography was accompanied in popular biography by a sort of \"celebrity voyeurism\", in the early decades of the century. This latter form's appeal to readers was based on curiosity more than morality or patriotism. By World War I, cheap hard-cover reprints had become popular. The decades of the 1920s witnessed a biographical \"boom.\"\n\nThe feminist scholar Carolyn Heilbrun observed that women's biographies and autobiographies began to change character during the second wave of feminist activism. She cited Nancy Milford's 1970 biography \"Zelda\", as the \"beginning of a new period of women's biography, because \"[only] in 1970 were we ready to read not that Zelda had destroyed Fitzgerald, but Fitzgerald her: he had usurped her narrative.\" Heilbrun named 1973 as the turning point in women's autobiography, with the publication of May Sarton's \"Journal of a Solitude,\" for that was the first instance where a woman told her life story, not as finding \"beauty even in pain\" and transforming \"rage into spiritual acceptance,\" but acknowledging what had previously been forbidden to women: their pain, their rage, and their \"open admission of the desire for power and control over one's life.\"\n\nIn recent years, multimedia biography has become more popular than traditional literary forms. Along with documentary biographical films, Hollywood produced numerous commercial films based on the lives of famous people. The popularity of these forms of biography have led to the proliferation of TV channels dedicated to biography, including A&E, The Biography Channel, and The History Channel.\n\nCD-ROM and online biographies have also appeared. Unlike books and films, they often do not tell a chronological narrative: instead they are archives of many discrete media elements related to an individual person, including video clips, photographs, and text articles. Biography-Portraits were created in 2001, by the German artist Ralph Ueltzhoeffer. Media scholar Lev Manovich says that such archives exemplify the database form, allowing users to navigate the materials in many ways. General \"life writing\" techniques are a subject of scholarly study.\n\nIn recent years, debates have arisen as to whether all biographies are fiction, especially when authors are writing about figures from the past. President of Wolfson College at Oxford University, Hermione Lee argues that all history is seen through a perspective that is the product of our contemporary society and as a result biographical truths are constantly shifting. So the history biographers write about will not be the way that it happened; it will be the way they remembered it. Debates have also arisen concerning the importance of space in life-writing.\n\nDaniel R. Meister in 2017 argues that:\n\nBiographical research is defined by Miller as a research method that collects and analyses a person's whole life, or portion of a life, through the in-depth and unstructured interview, or sometimes reinforced by semi-structured interview or personal documents. It is a way of viewing social life in procedural terms, rather than static terms. The information can come from \"oral history, personal narrative, biography and autobiography” or \"diaries, letters, memoranda and other materials\". The central aim of biographical research is to produce rich descriptions of persons or \"conceptualise structural types of actions\", which means to \"understand the action logics or how persons and structures are interlinked\". This method can be used to understand an individual’s life within its social context or understand the cultural phenomena.\n\nThere are many largely unacknowledged pitfalls to writing good biographies, and these largely concern the relation between firstly the individual and the context, and, secondly, the private and public. Paul James writes:\nSeveral countries offer an annual prize for writing a biography such as the:\n\n\n\n"}

Two scholarly approaches use biography or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: literary biography and biographical criticism. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, biographical fiction and autobiographical fiction.\n\nA literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography. Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself. Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative. This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through psychoanalytic theory.\n\nLiterary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of Wilfrid Blunt, noted, \"Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use.\" However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, \"Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends.\"\n\nWell-received literary biographies include Richard Ellmann's \"James Joyce\" and George Painter's \"Marcel Proust\".\n\nBiographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.\n\nBiographical fiction is a type of historical fiction that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for \"truthful\" representation is less strict than in biography. \n\nThe various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like Gore Vidal's \"Lincoln\". Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as Malcolm Bradbury's \"To the Hermitage\" and Michael Cunningham's \"The Hours\". No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.\n\nBiographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people, but without direct reference to them, such as George Meredith's \"Diana of the Crossways\" (1885) and Somerset Maugham's \"The Moon and Sixpence\" (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.\n\nAutobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.\n\n"}

The first line is the name of the poem's subject, usually a famous person put in an absurd light, or revealing something unknown or spurious about them. The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often forced. The line length and metre are irregular. Bentley invented the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books. One of his best known is this (1905):\n\nA clerihew has the following properties:\n\nClerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target famous individuals and reposition them in an absurd, anachronistic or commonplace setting, often giving them an over-simplified and slightly garbled description (not unlike the schoolboy style of \"1066 and All That\").\n\nThe form was invented by and is named after Edmund Clerihew Bentley. When he was a 16-year-old pupil at St Paul's School in London, the lines of his first clerihew, about Humphry Davy, came into his head during a science class. Together with his schoolfriends, he filled a notebook with examples. The first use of the word in print was in 1928. Bentley published three volumes of his own clerihews: \"Biography for Beginners\" (1905), published as \"edited by E. Clerihew\"; \"More Biography\" (1929); and \"Baseless Biography\" (1939), a compilation of clerihews originally published in \"Punch\" illustrated by the author's son Nicolas Bentley.\n\nG. K. Chesterton, a friend of Bentley, was also a practitioner of the clerihew and one of the sources of its popularity. Chesterton provided verses and illustrations for the original schoolboy notebook and illustrated \"Biography for Beginners\". Other serious authors also produced clerihews, including W. H. Auden, and it remains a popular humorous form among other writers and the general public. Among contemporary writers, the satirist Craig Brown has made considerable use of the clerihew in his columns for \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\nThere has been newfound popularity of the form on Twitter.\n\nBentley's first clerihew, published in 1905, was written about Sir Humphry Davy:\nThe original poem had the second line \"Was not fond of gravy\"; but the published version has \"Abominated gravy\".\n\nOther clerihews by Bentley include:\n\nand\nW. H. Auden's \"Academic Graffiti\" (1971) includes:\nSatirical magazine \"Private Eye\" noted Auden's work and responded:\n\nA second stanza aimed a jibe at Auden's publisher, Faber and Faber.\n\nAlan Turing, one of the founders of computing, was the subject of a clerihew written by the pupils of his \"alma mater\", Sherborne School in England:\nA clerihew appreciated by chemists is cited in \"Dark Sun\" by Richard Rhodes, and regards the inventor of the thermos bottle (or Dewar flask): \n\"Dark Sun\" also features a clerihew about the German-British physicist and Soviet nuclear spy Klaus Fuchs:\nIn 1983, \"Games\" magazine ran a contest titled \"Do You Clerihew?\" The winning entry was:\nThe clerihew form has also occasionally been used for non-biographical verses. Bentley opened his 1905 \"Biography for Beginners\" with an example, entitled \"Introductory Remarks\", on the theme of biography itself:\n\nThe third edition of the same work, published in 1925, included a \"Preface to the New Edition\" in 11 stanzas, each in clerihew form.

Other scholars apply the label to speakers of even more languages: twelve, sixteen, or in the most extreme cases, even fifty or more.\n\nIt is difficult to judge which individuals are polyglots, as there is no uncontroversial definition for what it means to \"master\" a language, and because it is not always clear where to distinguish a dialect from a language. Being able to communicate in a language does not mean the person has \"mastered\" a language. There are far fewer who have attained higher levels of multi-linguistic skill, and there is no basis for testing those levels, or at least those levels of ability have not been noted here.\n\nThis list consists of people who have been noted in news media, historical texts, or academic work as speaking five or more languages fluently.

Collectively, for example, the contemporary Frisians and Danes are two related Germanic peoples, while various Middle Eastern ethnic groups are often linguistically categorized as Semitic peoples.\n\nVarious states govern, or claim to govern, in the name of \"the people\". Both the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire used the Latin term \"Senatus Populusque Romanus\", (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the Roman Emperors achieved a state of total personal autarchy, they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.\n\nA People's Republic is typically a Marxist or socialist one-party state that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a dictatorship. Populism is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the \"common people\" instead of the elite.\n\nChapter One, Article One of the Charter of the United Nations states that peoples have the right to self-determination.\n\nIn criminal law, in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of \"the People\". Several U.S. states, including California, Illinois, and New York, use this style. Citations outside the jurisdictions in question usually substitute the name of the state for the words \"the People\" in the case captions. Four states — Massachusetts, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky — refer to themselves as \"the Commonwealth\" in case captions and legal process. Other states, such as Indiana, typically refer to themselves as \"the State\" in case captions and legal process. Outside the United States, criminal trials in Ireland and the Philippines are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.\n\nThe political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the sovereign; thus, in these U.S. states, the \"people\" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the United Kingdom and other dependencies of the British Crown, criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of the Crown. \"The people\" identifies the entire body of the citizens of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes.\n\n"}
{"id": "219599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=219599", "title": "Person", "text": "Person\n\nA person is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility. The defining features of personhood and consequently what makes a person count as a person differ widely among cultures and contexts.\n\nIn addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.\n\nThe common plural of \"person\", \"people\", is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in \"a people\"). The plural \"persons\" is often used in philosophical and legal writing.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the word \"persona\" (Latin) or \"prosopon\" (πρόσωπον; Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various \"personae\" in the stage play.\n\nThe concept of person was further developed during the Trinitarian and Christological debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature. During the theological debates, some philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the Λóγος/\"Verbum\" and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word \"prosopon\" (πρόσωπον) from the Greek theatre. Therefore, Christus (the Λóγος/\"Verbum\") and God were defined as different \"persons\". This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings.\n\nSince then, a number of important changes to the word's meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence.\n\nPersonhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and law, and is closely tied to legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability.\nPersonhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of slavery and the fight for women's rights, in debates about abortion, fetal rights, and in animal rights advocacy.\n\nVarious debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of animals, women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, living adult humans are usually considered persons, but depending on the context, theory or definition, the category of \"person\" may be taken to include or not children or such non-human entities as animals, artificial intelligences, or extraterrestrial life, as well as legal entities such as corporations, sovereign states and other polities, or estates in probate.\n\nPersonal identity is the unique identity of persons through time. That is to say, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the \"same\" person, persisting through time. In the modern philosophy of mind, this concept of personal identity is sometimes referred to as the \"diachronic\" problem of personal identity. The \"synchronic\" problem is grounded in the question of what features or traits characterize a given person at one time.\n\nIdentity is an issue for both continental philosophy and analytic philosophy. A key question in continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are incorrect.\n\nProposed solutions to the problem of personal identity include continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or memory, the bundle theory of self, continuity of personality after the death of the physical body, and proposals that there are actually no persons or selves who persist over time at all.\n\n\n"}
