'''5.1 surround sound''' ("five-point one") is the common name for six channel [[surround sound]] audio systems. 5.1 is the most commonly used layout in [[home cinema]].{{cn|date=December 2016}} It uses five full bandwidth channels and one [[low-frequency effects]] channel (the "point one").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crutchfield.com/S-bDkeT92VqJj/learn/learningcenter/home/hometheater_surround.html |title=Understanding Surround Sound Formats |publisher=Crutchfield.com |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dolby Digital]], Dolby [[Pro Logic II]], [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]], [[Sony dynamic digital sound|SDDS]], and [[THX]] are all common 5.1 systems. 5.1 is also the standard surround sound audio component of [[digital broadcast]] and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.5dot1.com/what_is_5_1_.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317220352/http://www.5dot1.com/what_is_5_1_.html |archivedate=17 March 2012 |title=What is 5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All 5.1 systems use the same speaker channels and configuration, having a front left and right, a [[center channel]], two [[surround channels]] and the [[low-frequency effects]] channel designed for a [[subwoofer]].

==History==
A prototype for five-channel surround sound, then dubbed "quintaphonic sound", was used in the 1975 film ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quintaphonic Sound|author=Mosely, John|journal= Journal of the SMPTE|volume=l86|date=January 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5.1 dates back to 1976{{cn|date=December 2016}} when Dolby Labs modified the track usage of the six analogue magnetic soundtracks on [[Todd-AO#Todd-AO process|Todd-AO 70 mm film prints]]. The Dolby application of optical matrix encoding in 1976 (released on the film, ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]'') did not use split surrounds, and thus was not 5.1. Dolby's first use of split surrounds was with 70mm film, which received wide release in 1979 with ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''. Instead of the five screen channels and one surround channel of the Todd-AO format, [[Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track]] provided three screen channels, two high-passed surround channels and a low-frequency surround channel monophonically blended with the two surround channels.

When digital sound was applied to 35&amp;nbsp;mm release prints, starting with ''[[Batman Returns]]'' in 1992, the 5.1 layout was adopted. The ability to provide 5.1 sound had been one of the key reasons for using 70&amp;nbsp;mm for prestige screenings. The provision of 5.1 digital sound on 35&amp;nbsp;mm significantly reduced the use of the very expensive 70&amp;nbsp;mm format. Digital sound and the 5.1 format were introduced in 1990, by KODAK and Optical Radiation Corporation, with releases of ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' and ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' using the CDS (Cinema Digital Sound) format.

5.1 digital surround, in the forms of Dolby Digital AC3 and DTS, started appearing on several mid 90s Laserdisc releases, with among the earliest being ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (the latter having both AC3 and DTS versions). Many DVD releases have Dolby Digital tracks up to 5.1 channels, due to the implementation of Dolby Digital in the development of the DVD format. In addition, some DVDs have DTS tracks with most being 5.1 channel mixes (a few releases, however, have 6.1 “[[Matrix decoder|matrixed]]” tracks). [[Blu-ray]] and [[digital cinema]] both have eight-channel capability which can be used to provide either 5.1 or [[7.1 surround sound]]. 7.1 is an extension of 5.1 that uses four surround zones: two at the sides and two at the back.

A system of digital 5.1 surround sound has also been used in 1987 at the Parisian cabaret the [[Moulin Rouge]], created by French engineer Dominique Bertrand. To achieve such a system in 1985 a dedicated mixing console had to be designed in cooperation with [[Solid State Logic]], based on their 5000 series, and dedicated speakers in cooperation with APG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apg.tm.fr/recherche-developpement-apg-france.html |title=Recherche &amp; Développement |accessdate=2015-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803041440/http://www.apg.tm.fr/recherche-developpement-apg-france.html |archivedate=3 August 2008 }}&lt;!--could not an archive or alternative URL--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The console included ABCDEF channels. Respectively: A left, B right, C centre, D left rear, E right rear, F bass.  The same engineer had already developed a similar 3.1 system in 1973, for use at the official International Summit of Francophone States in [[Dakar]].

==Application==

===Channel order===
The order of channels in a 5.1 file is different across file formats. The order in [[WAV file]]s is (not complete) Front Left, Front Right, Center, [[Low-frequency effects]], Surround Left, Surround Right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn653308%28v=vs.85%29.aspx |title=Multiple channel audio data and WAVE files |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
[[File:5-1-surround-sound.svg|thumb|Suggested configuration for 5.1 music listening.]]

Regarding music, the main goal of 5.1 surround sound is a proper localization and equability of all acoustic sources for a centered positioned audience. Therefore, ideally five matched speakers should be used.

For play-back of 5.1 music recommendations of the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) have been released and propose the following configuration (ITU-R BS 775):&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=9095 |author=Thomas Lund |title=Enhanced Localization in 5.1 Production |publisher=Audio Engineering Society |date=1 September 2000 |accessdate=2015-11-19 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* five speakers of the same size for front, center and surround
* identical distance from the listeners for all five speakers
* angle adjustment regarding viewing direction of audience: center 0°, front ±22.5° for movies ±30° for music, surround ±110°

An '''adventure park''' is a place which can contain a wide variety of elements, such as rope climbing exercises, obstacle courses and zip-lines. They are usually intended for recreation.

"Recreational-oriented" adventure parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors. They do not follow a specific educational concept, but see the individual, physical and mental challenge as a predominantly recreational activity. Neither climbing techniques nor special/specific physical fitness experience are necessary. Typical slogans are: ''Have Fun, Test your Courage, Overcome your Own Fears, Be Outside, Be in the Nature, Do some Physical Activities, etc.''

== History ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 2.jpg|thumb|Treetop Adventure Park in Bali|]]
[[File:Adventure Park, Ashramam, Kollam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adventure Park, Kollam|Asramam Adventure Park]], [[Kollam]], [[Kerala]]]]
It is unclear where and when the first ropes course was created. A ropes course was built in 1875 in France and functioned mainly as a physical challenge activity for the participants. During the Second World War, ropes courses were used as obstacle courses for improving the physical fitness of the British military.

In the mid-1960s, ropes courses became a central component of outdoor seminars in the United States.

In recent years, specifically recreation-oriented Adventure Parks were developed. The market has boomed especially in Europe &amp; Asian countries.

== Related Outdoor Activities ==
As already mentioned, a [[ropes course]] is often a challenging outdoor personal development and team-building activity with a relatively low number of participants. Some parks offer both - a recreational section and a team building section.

A [[canopy tour]] is a specific type of [[ziplining]] where a person is harnessed to a steel cable and propelled by gravity from platform to platform high up in the trees of a thick forest canopy. Although these date back far into history for civil and even scientific uses, they are now used for recreation and have created a new activity for the tourism industry.

== Facts &amp; Figures Adventure Parks ==
The category Adventure Parks can be broken down into a huge variety of specific types. They differ according to the following main criteria:
* Type of parks: 	 	        stationary / mobile
* Structural System:                  trees / poles / buildings / metallic structure
* Target visitors:                       all / kids from 4 years old / disabled
* Height of the lifeline: 	        "mid-height", "out of reach"
* Belay system: 		        self / permanent / continuous
* Locations:			        touristic / urban

[[image:Leonhard-Eißnert-Park 06.jpg|thumb|Forest Adventure Park]]
[[image:Hochseilgarten Isselburg.jpg|thumb|Adventure Park on Poles]]
[[File:Indoor-Kletterpark.jpg|thumb|Indoor Adventure Park in Shopping Mall]]Forest Adventure Parks are very popular. They take advantage of the beauty of a forest, of the trees (no investment in poles) and offer an outdoor activity surrounded by nature. They offer not only an adventure “at height” in a forest, but also the benefit for customers of experiencing the spectacular natural beauty of trees, hills, cliffs and/or rivers. In forest parks, there is a particular focus on tree-friendly installation. In most cases, the platforms are held to the trees through the principle of friction. When the exercise elements are mounted, the trees are protected by coats of wood or rubber to prevent rubbing from the ropes.

Depending on how they are used and where they are located, parks on poles are an excellent alternative. They offer complete freedom in terms of park design and location but, at the same time, require higher investment (in the poles). The heat of the summer can be a challenge. A mix of poles/trees at the edge of a forest has the potential to work well.
 
Indoor parks have the great advantage of being an “all year round” operation but with the corresponding weakness of that strength at times when fine weather encourages outdoor activities. These trails are often built on a modular metallic structure. New parks on wood poles have shown that an indoor park can also provide a good experience.

Adventure Parks can be found in a multitude of places/locations. Examples of trends:
*	Close to large tourist destinations
*	In Ski Resorts as an attraction during summer months (a boom in Switzerland and several European countries)
*	In Amusement Parks, Holiday Clubs/Villages, Hotel Club and Resorts, etc.
*	Urban parks or close to conglomerations (e.g. the park in the center of Lyon, France)
*	Close to a significant pool of potential customers, such as a large Shopping Mall, Zoo, Campsite, etc.
*	Small (kids) parks for shopping malls (as indoor), city events, etc.

Large Adventure Parks usually have several trails of increasing difficulty levels and can reach up to 10 trails. With 10 to 20 acrobatic elements per trail, the park can easily reach up to 200 elements (it is usually between 40 and 200 elements).

The majority of trails are for everyone from the age of 7 years old (sometimes 10). The difficulty level starts at a low level or “green trail” and progresses to a very challenging level or “black trail”. Specific trails for kids from 4 years are very popular with families and provide a boost to the business (up to 20-30% more clients). Sometimes there are specific trails for the disabled.

Most kids love Adventure Parks. In a park they can act independently, try and fail and try again, and overcome their own fears without any risk (a continuous belay system is strongly recommended). Thanks the variety of levels, each time they can push their own boundaries and reach their own challenges. This is a perfect outdoor activity (with individual, physical and mental challenges) to learn through play.

The acrobatic elements are artificial obstacles (exercises) made from ropes, nets and wood in various forms, and which are installed at different heights in trees. The clever arrangement of such obstacles encourages many basic forms of movement such as climbing, hand over hand, balancing, holding, slipping and sliding. A good mix of elements and [[zip-line]]s increases the diversity and interest of parks – People love zip-lines.

There are two approaches to how to structure a park: (1) the so-called French approach where you move from one trail to the next one, like setting out on a trip and coming back to the start or (2) more the Swiss approach with one common starting point (often a platform) where the visitors can choose anytime which trail they want to go. The latter approach has the great advantage to be self-distributing and therefore allowing higher throughput by peak.

[[File:Capture d’écran 2012-06-12 à 14.09.01.jpg|thumb|Adventure Park with lifeline "out of reach"]]
There are 2 schools concerning the height of the lifeline:
*The more traditional approach, frequently seen on continental Europe, is the lifeline at mid-height. This height at {{convert|1.40|-|1.60|m|ft|abbr=on}} is well adapted for carabiners.
*The lifeline out of reach, at {{convert|2|-|2.30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, possible with continuous belay system, is more frequent in UK and shows several advantages:  (1) ''Higher throughput by peaks'' - up to 20% more (No manipulation on platforms and therefore gains of time - No need to install additional trolley for the ziplines).  (2) ''More impressive and challenging elements''  (No "mid-heigh" cables to help the visitors - Impressive and when necessary, the visitor can anytime help himself with the lanyard - Impressive and without risk of numerous rescues).  (3) ''Higher convenience for the park visitors''  (Platforms are free of any "mid-heigh" cable, ease for the visitors - Fun &amp; thrills on elements while relaxing on platforms).  (4) ''Much lower risk of injury''  (No contact with safety device - As the lanyard is already tighter, the distance of possible fall will be shorter)

Concerning the safety, traditionally a self-safety system is used where participants take responsibility for themselves. Before starting, the participants receive special training in how to use the safety equipment and then run the various trails independently. The emergence of new technologies has drastically increased the level of safety and opened new business opportunities.

== Safety systems ==
[[image:Seilpark Gantrisch - 03.jpg|thumb|Self belay with carabiners]]
[[File:Rheinfall Seilpark 4.jpg|thumb|Continuous Belay for Kids Trails from 4 years old]]
The safety equipment for each participant basically consists of a harness, a lanyard and a belay system (another option would simply be a net under the trails – relatively expensive and with limited application). Sometimes helmets are also used.

There are distinctions between the following main four belay systems:
* Self belay with carabiners
* Permanent belay with carabiners
* Continuous belay on rail
* Continuous belay on cable (with a hook or a trolley)

The traditional self-belay system basically consists of two carabiners operated by the participants. The participants successively unlock/lock the connection of the carabiners on each platform (zone of risk). Mishandling and removal of both carabiners at the same time will cause complete unlocking. This situation could mean a life-threatening risk and there have been instances of serious accidents and even terminal injuries.

The permanent belay systems significantly reduce the risk of accident. The two carabiners have a "communicating system” which avoids simultaneous opening of the carabiners and the complete unlocking from the cable. A permanent system with integrated rollers can even be found.

The continuous belay systems on rail offer a high level of safety but has limited application – it is mainly on poles with a heavy structure, for relatively short elements and it is expensive (and more common in the USA than in Europe).

With a continuous belay system on cable, visitors are continuously connected to the lifeline (cable) from the start to the finish without any possibility of becoming unlocked - which provides the highest safety level. At the start of the trail, the visitors simply connect the lifeline into the belay device (hook or trolley) and they can run the whole trail – in term of safety, no specific further action is required. 
For the continuous belay system with integrated trolley, the belay device simply rolls along the whole lifeline and greatly eases the passage on zip-lines (no handling required). This last technology is the only system allowing the lifeline to be “out of reach” which has numerous advantages (higher throughput, more impressive elements, more convenience, lower risk of injury)

== Adventure Parks Operation ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 3.jpg|thumb|Round Platform]]
Recreational-oriented Adventure Parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors: In Europe 10,000 to 60,000 or even more participants per season are common (usually April to October) and often with a high variation pattern (high attendance on weekends and during vacations).

The key challenges are manifold: attractive value proposition, pool of potential clients, safety level &amp; risk management, needs of training &amp; supervision and flexible operation.

In order to ensure a profitable and sustainable operation, meeting the last three challenges is essential. The new technologies in safety systems bring Adventure Parks into a new era by dramatically reducing the risk of accident (permanent and continuous systems) and reducing the needs of training and supervision (continuous systems).

The EN 15567-1 and -2 standards regulate the construction and operation of high ropes Courses / Adventure Parks. The various associations as ERCA and IAPA in Europe or ACCT and PRCA in the USA are acting towards professionalization of the industry.

{{about|the entertainment industry|the concept of ancillary markets in power systems|ancillary services (electric power)}}

'''Ancillary markets''' are non-theatrical markets for [[feature films]], like [[home video]], television, [[Pay Per View]], [[Video on demand|VOD]], Internet streaming, airlines and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://indieranch.com/distribute.html |title=Knowing your audience is one thing, reaching them is another. |first=Yuri |last=Koll |work=indieranch.com |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maccs.com/non-theatrical |title=MACCS International Theatrical Film Distribution Software |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109215530/http://www.maccs.com/non-theatrical |archivedate=January 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Before television, studios played their films in theaters exclusively. However, in 1950 many studios began to sell all their pre-1948 features to television syndicators. The television syndicators then would use these films to fill in their programming schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Criticism-Ideology/Distribution-ANCILLARY-MARKETS.html |title=Ancillary markets - Distribution |first= |last= |work=filmreference.com |year=2013 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the 1960s, the first domestic ancillary market for feature films was created. NBC was the first to practice the market on September 23, 1961 by programming "NBC Saturday Night at the Movies." After such success, ABC became the second network ever to program a series of prime time features in 1962. One of the other networks, CBS, followed and added a prime time feature program in 1965.

Today, feature films opens in motion picture theaters to establish its box-office value. After that is established, it is then released to ancillary markets in a particular order as follows:

* Video and [[Pay Per View]] (PPV)
* Premium cable services such as HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax
* Cable television
* Network television
* Television syndication

The sequence is to maximize the full economic potential of each market.

==VCR==
Home video recorders were made public when Sony introduced the half-inch Betamax cassette in 1975. Following Betamax, the company JVC introduced the Video Home System (VHS).  Marketed by RCA and manufactured by Matsushita, VHS soon became known as the video-cassette recorders (VCRs). VCRs, which gave the consumer the option of recording programs from television, were a new form of competition in the demanding consumer market. VCRs revenue contributed to the development of the ancillary market of video and DVD. By the 1980s, five million households owned VCRs. Major studios had not yet adapted to the new video technologies that were being developed for consumers. There were no anticipations of new markets or other opportunities to expand until an entrepreneur, Andre Blay, opened Hollywood film companies’ eyes. Blay wanted the license to transfer and sell their films on tape.  After he succeeded and his approach was beneficial, film companies all around became a part of the video distribution. The film companies could not deny the fact that this new distribution would lead to a new revenue stream.&lt;ref&gt;P., McDonald &amp; J., Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD==
As the VHS market saturated, multiple media executives and manufacturers liked the idea of utilizing other home video technologies. In 1993, the film industry upgraded their technology with the creation of several new formats including the DVD, or digital video disc. Many manufacturers such as the Japanese (Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Pioneer, Sony and Toshiba) and the European (Philips and Thomson) collaborated to facilitate development of the DVD Forum. In March 1997, the US launch of the DVD systems went smoothly due to Hollywood's solidarity. Manufacturers and film studios decided to avoid making the same mistake of the VHS format battles and agreed upon a universal standard of cooperation. When first introduced in 1997, DVDs sold at the low price of $20, for which they offered high-quality image and extra special features. Consumers liked the advantages of the DVDs and soon surpassed VHS sales.&lt;ref&gt;Wasser, Frederick.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video and DVD: Hollywood Retools". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premium television==

The first premium rate television services were [[Phonevision]], [[Telemeter (pay television)|Telemeter]], SubscriberVision, among others. None of them were successful, until the launch of Home Box Office ([[HBO]]) in 1972, considered the first successful premium-rate subscription television service. Other services were launched: [[Z Channel]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[The Movie Channel]], [[Cinemax]], [[Spotlight (TV channel)|Spotlight]] and [[Home Theater Network]]. Only Showtime, The Movie Channel and Cinemax survived through the 1980s. These premium rate services air features unedited, uncut, and commercial-free, the same way they were shown on theaters and/or home video.

==Network television==
Out of the many ancillary markets out there, none were more effective and revenue rewarding than network television, and eventually syndication began. [[Amanda D. Lotz]] spoke on the radical change in her book titled ''Television Will Be Revolutionized (2008)."
She mentions how time went on and as the post-network era developed, that the limited ways there were for medium to be distributed was eliminated. What was expanding, and evolving was network television as a whole.&lt;Lotz 85&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lotz|first=Amanda|title=Television Will be Revolutionized|year=2007|publisher=NYU Press|pages=86|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/archivedassets/096/15646.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt; At first channels were few, and very limited. But soon came the multi-channel transition, then on with the creation of cable TV. As that later expended cable began to see the 'cash cow' in that and began selling shares to different networks in order to air their studio programs. Not only did Network Television open up ancillary markets for TV, but other markets as well. The VCR then became a hot commodity, because the consumer wanted the option of recording. That slowly transitioned to the DVD that took out the VCR, and finally DVR. Which seems to be just that, a VCR and a DVD combined. Network television took a gigantic step when it later allowed programs to have different showing dates, and even multiple air times. This offered different networks to still be able to ear revenue off of an older film that already has left the box office.

==Making Television Safe for Film==

According to McDonald and Wasko, Hollywood's interest in emerging medium of television dates from the 1920s and includes experiments with the developing technology, an alternative model of television as home theater, applications for television frequencies, as well as investments in broadcasting companies that were exploring television (Anderson, 1994; Hilmes, 1990; Wasko, 1994). The evidence suggests that studios clearly wanted to control the development and implementation of television technology. Securing that control required the assistance of the Federal Communication Commission, which regulated television's development by articulating technical standards and operating rules and through the FCC's exclusive right to license the use of television frequencies for experimentation or broadcast (McDonald and Wasko, p.&amp;nbsp;107).

==Video games==
Video games are a rapidly growing ancillary market for feature films. Video game over-all gross income has consistently surpassed that of movie sales since 2004. Because of the increased interest in video games many major media and communication companies have begun to show interest in video games as a way to market, brand, and advertise for their product.  Some movies that have benefited from this are the ''Harry Potter'', ''Lord of the Rings'', and ''James Bond'' series. Because the video game industry has been able to outplay and outgross many movies, video game manufacturers are beginning to look in the direction of producing their own movies as well. Microsoft's producers of ''Halo'' have decided to pass Hollywood studios and produce their own movie.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Randy.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollywood has shown interest in the video game industry as an ancillary market almost as far as video games have existed. The film industry's goal within the video game industry is to either seek control and therefore ownership of the video game market or to license products to video game producers. Once the video game profits are high, that is when Hollywood seeks control. On the other hand, when profits are down, that is when Hollywood offers the licensing. The collaboration had always been problematic since the film industry had been uncertain about the development of video games. Hollywood has seen video games as another promotional scheme for a film.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Randy.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recorded Music==
Hollywood has had interactions with the recorded music industry that dates back as far as the studio system itself.  The interactions between the two include three main periods; 1927-1957: recorded music as a form of promotion, 1957-1977: recorded music as cross-promotion and ancillary revenue, and 1977-1997: recorded music as cross-promotion, ancillary revenue stream, and means of spreading risk.
In addition to music's promotional value, studios realized that, "A chart success was an effective way of generating additional revenue for their companies, both in terms of publishing and performance royalties and, of course, in outright sales."  Recorded music proved to be of great value as an ancillary market to the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-3388-3|pages=143–151|author=Smith, Jeff|authorlink=Ancillary Markets-Recorded Music: Charting the Rise and Fall of the Soundtrack Album|editor=McDonald &amp; Wasko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Assembly Rooms, Bath - geograph.org.uk - 979274.jpg|thumb|The Assembly Rooms, Bath]]
In [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], especially in the [[18th century Britain|18th]] and 19th centuries, '''assembly rooms''' were gathering places for members of the higher [[social class]]es open to members of both sexes. At that time most entertaining was done at home and there were few public places of entertainment open to both sexes besides theatres (and there were few of those outside London). [[Upper class]] men had more options, including [[coffee house]]s and later [[gentlemen's club]]s. 

Major sets of assembly rooms in London, in [[spa town]]s such as [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and in important provincial cities such as [[York]], were able to accommodate hundreds, or in some cases over a thousand people for events such as [[masquerade ball]]s (masked balls), [[Ball (dance)|conventional balls]], public concerts and assemblies (simply gatherings for conversation, perhaps with incidental music and entertainments) or [[Salon (gathering)|Salons]]. By later standards these were formal events: the attendees were usually screened to make sure no one of insufficient rank gained admittance; admission might be subscription only; and unmarried women were [[Chaperone (social)|chaperoned]]. Nonetheless, assemblies played an important part in the marriage market of the day.  

A major set of assembly rooms consisted of a main room and several smaller subsidiary rooms such as card rooms, tea rooms and supper rooms. On the other hand, in smaller towns a single large room attached to the best inn might serve for the occasional assembly for the local [[landed gentry]]. 

Formal assemblies and the associated assembly rooms faded away in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as the range of places of public entertainment increased (for example public dance halls and nightclubs) and attitudes became more accepting of women from the higher social classes attending them. Also to some extent they were supplanted by the ballrooms of major hotels as British hotels became larger from the railway age onwards.

==Examples==
*[[Almack's]] - London's most exclusive assembly rooms.
*[[Pantheon, London|The Pantheon]] - an architecturally grander but more briefly fashionable set of assembly rooms in London.
*[[Bath Assembly Rooms]] - the assembly rooms in England's most fashionable spa.
*[[York Assembly Rooms]] - a notable building designed by [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]].
*[[Victoria Rooms (Bristol)]]
*[[Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh)]]
*[[Assembly Rooms, Surbiton]] in [[Surbiton]], Surrey.
*[[Glasgow Assembly Rooms|New Assembly and Concert Rooms]], 1796, [[Glasgow]], later the home of the [[Glasgow Athenaeum|Athenaeum]] (demolished by new owners, the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]], in 1892)
* [[Assembly Rooms, Newcastle]] - built in 1776 in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], one of the finest examples of [[Georgian architecture]] in Newcastle's [[Grainger Town]].
* [[Dumfries]] Assembly rooms, c. 1825 - elegant building by Walter Newall, Architect, of Dumfries

==Public gardens==
London also had a number of outdoor "public gardens" where similar entertainments took place. They were more commercial establishments and tended to have less exclusive rules on admission. Each had at least one major indoor space for balls and the like. See: [[Marylebone Gardens]], [[Vauxhall Gardens]], [[Ranelagh Gardens]] and [[Cremorne Gardens, London|Cremorne Gardens]].

{{Chinese martial arts}}

'''Baguazhang''' ({{zh-cp|c=八卦掌|p=Bāguà Zhǎng}}) is one of the three main [[Chinese martial arts]] of the [[Wudang chuan|Wudang]] school, the other two being [[Taijiquan]] and [[Xing Yi Quan]]. It is more broadly grouped as an internal practice (or [[neijia|neijia quan]]). ''Bāguà zhǎng'' literally means "eight trigram palm," referring to the [[Bagua|trigrams]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'' (''Yijing''), one of the canons of [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The creation of Baguazhang, as a formalised martial art, is attributed to [[Dong Haichuan]] (董海川), who is said to have learned from Taoist and Buddhist masters in the mountains of rural [[China]] during the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Yintao, Fei and Yuliang, Fei. “Classical Baguazhang Volume IV: Wudang Baguazhang.” Trans. Joseph Crandall. Pinole, California: Smiling Tiger Martial Arts 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Chinese authorities do not accept the Buddhist origin, instead maintaining that those teachers were purely Taoist in origin, the evidence lying in Baguazhang's frequent reference to core concepts central to [[Taoism]], such as [[Yin and yang|Yin and Yang]] theory, [[I Ching]] and Taoism's most distinctive paradigm, the [[Bagua]] diagram.&lt;ref&gt;Liang Shou-yu, Yang Jwing-Ming, Wu Wen-Ching, “Baguazhang: Emei Baguazhang Theory and Applications” 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Allen, Tina Chunna Zhang, “The Whirling Circles of Ba Gua Zhang: The Art and Legends of the Eight Trigram Palm 2007” .&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution to Buddhist teachers came from the 2nd generation teachers, i.e. Dong Haichuan's students, some of whom were Buddhist. There is evidence to suggest a synthesis of several pre-existing martial arts taught and practised in the region in which Dong Haichuan lived, combined with Taoist circle walking. Through his work as a servant in the Imperial Palace he impressed the emperor with his graceful movements and fighting skill, and became an instructor and a bodyguard to the court.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Green, Thomas A. "Martial Arts of the World" 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Dong Haichuan taught for many years in [[Beijing]], eventually earning patronage by the Imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;Jingru, Liu and Youqing, Ma. “Classical Baguazhang Volume II: Cheng Shi Baguazhang (Cheng Family Baguazhang).” Trans. Joseph Crandall. Pinole, California: Smiling Tiger Martial Arts 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous disciples of Dong Haichuan to become teachers were [[Yin Fu]] (尹福), [[Cheng Tinghua]] (程廷華), [[Ma Gui (martial artist)|Ma Gui]] (马贵), Song Changrong (宋長榮), Liu Fengchun (劉鳳春), Ma Weiqi (馬維棋), Liu Baozhen (劉寶珍), [[Liang Zhenpu]] (梁振蒲) and Liu Dekuan (劉德寛). Although they were all students of the same teacher, their methods of training and expressions of palm techniques differed.&lt;ref name="Lie, Zhang 1995" /&gt; The Cheng and Liu styles are said to specialize in "pushing" the palms, Yin style is known for "threading" the palms, Song's followers practice "Plum Flower" (梅花 ''[[Prunus mume|Mei]] Hua'') palm technique and Ma style palms are known as "hammers." Some of Dong Haichuan's students, including Cheng Tinghua, participated in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In general, most bagua exponents today practice either the Yin (尹), Cheng (程), or Liang (梁) styles, although Fan (樊), Shi (史), Liu (劉), Fu (傅), and other styles also exist.  (The Liu style is a special case, in that it is rarely practiced alone, but as a complement to other styles). In addition, there are sub-styles of the above methods as well, such as the Sun (孫), Gao (高), and Jiang (姜) styles, which are sub-styles of Cheng method.

===Common aspects===
[[Image:250 Bagau016ChangChaoDong.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Internal martial arts|Internalist]] Zhang Zhaodong, also known as Zhang Zhankui.]]
The practice of circle walking, or "turning the circle", as it is sometimes called, is Baguazhang's characteristic method of stance and movement training. All forms of Baguazhang utilize circle walking as an integral part of training. Practitioners walk around the edge of the circle in various low stances, facing the center, and periodically change direction as they execute forms.&lt;ref&gt;Lie, Zhang. ''Classical Baguazhang Volume V: Yin Style Baguazhang.'' Trans. Joseph Crandall. Pinole, California: Smiling Tiger Martial Arts 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; For a beginner, the circle is six to twelve feet in diameter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Students first learn flexibility and proper body alignment through the basic exercises, then move on to more complex forms and internal power mechanics.  Although the internal aspects of Baguazhang are similar to those of Xingyiquan and Taijiquan, they are distinct in nature.

[[Image:Baguadao (八卦刀).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Fu Chen Sung|Fu Zhensong]] with a large bagua saber.]]
Many distinctive styles of weapons are contained within Baguazhang; some use concealment, like the "scholar's pen" or a pair of knives (the most elaborate, which are unique to the style, are the crescent-shaped [[deer horn knives]] (Chinese: 鹿角刀; pinyin: Lùjiǎodāo). Baguazhang is also known for practicing with extremely large weapons, such as the ''bāguà jian'' (八卦劍), or bagua sword, and the ''bāguà [[dāo]]'' (八卦刀), or bagua broadsword. Other, more conventional weapons are also used, such as the staff (''gun''), spear (''qiang''), cane (''guai''), hook sword (''gou'') and the straight, double-edged sword ([[jian]]). Baguazhang practitioners are also known for being able to use anything as a weapon using the principles of their art.

Baguazhang contains an extremely wide variety of techniques as well as weapons, including various strikes (with palm, fist, elbow, fingers, etc.), kicks, joint locks, throws, and distinctively evasive circular footwork. As such, Baguazhang is considered neither a purely striking nor a purely grappling martial art. Baguazhang practitioners are known for their ability to "flow" in and out of the way of objects.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} This is the source of the theory of being able to fight multiple attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baguazhang's evasive nature is also shown by the practice of moving behind an attacker, so that the opponent cannot harm the practitioner.

Although the many branches of Baguazhang are often quite different from each other (some, like Cheng style, specialize in close-in wrestling and joint locks, while others, like some of the Yin styles, specialize in quick, long-range striking), all have circle walking, spiraling movement, and certain methods and techniques (piercing palms, crashing palms, etc.) in common.

Baguazhang's movements employ the whole body with smooth coiling and uncoiling actions, utilizing hand techniques, dynamic footwork, and throws.  Rapid-fire movements draw energy from the center of the abdomen. The circular stepping pattern also builds up [[centripetal force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Ballpits530.jpg|thumb|right|A child playing in a ball pit]] 
A '''ball pit''' (originally called "'''ball crawl'''" and also known as a '''ball pool''' or '''ball pond''') is a padded box or pool filled with small colorful hollow plastic balls generally no larger than {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter. Instead of balls, other spherical objects can be used, such as balloons. It is typically employed as a recreation and exercise for children.

[[File:Bollhav.jpg|thumb|A ball pit as part of a larger play area]]
Ball pits are often found at nurseries, [[carnival]]s, [[amusement park]]s, [[Family fun center|fun center]]s, [[fast-food restaurants]], and large [[video arcade]]s.  [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] and (now defunct) [[Discovery Zone]] formerly had ball pits and they were frequently incorporated into larger play structures, such as [[maze]]s, [[Playground slide|slide]]s, and [[jungle gym]]s.

Ball pits may be rented for [[party|parties]], and smaller versions are sold for use in the home. While ball pits are traditionally intended for children, some are large enough to accommodate [[adult]]s.

Ball pits may be used together with a [[trampoline]], or combining the two by filling a closed trampoline with the balls.

==Urban legends==
Beginning in the late 1990s, a number of [[urban legend]]s arose about children being severely injured or even killed due to ball-pit encounters with venomous [[snake]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blsnakes.htm|title=Snakes in the Ball Pit - Urban Legends|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[hypodermic needle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blneedle.htm|title=Needles Hidden Under Gas Pump Handles Are an Urban Legend|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no truth to these stories,&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/parenting/news/20010831/bounce-carefully-in-ball-pit#1|title=Bounce Carefully in the Ball Pit|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; workers have reported finding dirty diapers, half-eaten food and syringes in ball pits.&lt;ref name="webmd"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the ''[[Rugrats]]'' episode, "Piggy's Pizza Palace", the Rugrats jump on a costumed pig named Piggy as an act of revenge to get Angelica's tickets back. Thus, it caused the ball pit structure to split right open and all of the balls fall out all over the restaurant. 

In season 3 episode 14, ("The Einstein Approximation") of the TV series ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', Sheldon seeks inspiration in a ball pit at a [[shopping mall|mall]], and then hides from Leonard, who becomes frustrated as he spends a good amount of time and effort trying to retrieve Sheldon from the ball pit, but Sheldon keeps saying "Bazinga".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=VanDerWerff|first1=Todd|title=The Big Bang Theory: “The Einstein Approximation”|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/the-big-bang-theory-the-einstein-approximation-37774|accessdate=August 25, 2016|date=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Potts|first1=Kimberly|title=Every Inside Joke on The Big Bang Theory, Alphabetized|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/big-bang-theory-inside-jokes-alphabetized.html|accessdate=August 25, 2016|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a [[YouTube]] vlogger under the name ''[[Roman Atwood]]'' made a video of transforming the living room of his home into a massive ball pit, intended as a prank for his girlfriend who has returned from a trip. He later collaborates with another vlogger,  [[Freddie Wong]], to create a comedy video involving giant ball pit and "ball monster" prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waxman|first1=Olivia B.|title=Watch a Guy Surprise His Girlfriend by Turning Their House into a Giant Ball Pit|url=http://time.com/3674421/house-ball-pit-prank/|accessdate=August 25, 2016|work=TIME.com|date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a pop-up "ball pit bar" opened in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/san-francisco-ball-pit-bar-is-latest-in-line-of-th.html|title=San Francisco "Ball Pit Bar" Is the Latest Crazy Themed Bar|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Bioscope''' show was a [[music hall]] and [[funfair|fairground]] attraction consisting of a travelling [[Movie theater|cinema]]. The heyday of the Bioscope was from the late 1890s until [[World War I]].

Bioscope shows were fronted by the largest [[fairground organ]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamfairground.co.uk/l3_bioscope.html "Hollycombe Steam Museum bioscope show"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these formed the entire public face of the show. A stage was usually in front of the organ, and dancing girls would entertain the crowds between film shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-bioscopes.html "Fairground Heritage Trust"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703073622/http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-bioscopes.html |date=July 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Films shown in the Bioscope were primitive, and the earliest of these were made by the showmen themselves. Later, films were commercially produced.

Bioscope shows were integrated, in Britain at least, into the Variety shows in the huge Music Halls which were built at the end of the nineteenth century.

After the Music Hall Strike of 1907 in London, bioscope operators set up a trade union to represent them. There were about seventy operators in London at this point.

==Modern use==
In South Africa "Bioscope" or in [[Afrikaans]] "bioskoop" is an archaic word for the cinema and some people (especially older generations) still use it regularly.

In modern day Dutch, "bioscoop" is a wide-spread term, and the equivalent of the English "movie theater" or "cinema".

[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|Burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'', c. 1900]]
A '''burlesque''' is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24999 "Burlesque",] ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burlesco}}'', which, in turn, is derived from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burla}}'' – a joke, ridicule or mockery.&lt;ref&gt;In theatrical use, a burla was "a comic interlude or practical joke introduced, usually extempore, into a performance by the servant masks of the [[commedia dell'arte]] … developed at will into a small independent 'turn', the characters returning at its conclusion to the main theme of the plot". See Hartnoll, Phyllis and Peter Found. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e492 "Burla",] ''The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre'',  Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-43624043/the-new-york-clipper-vol-62-september#fullscreen "Burlesque News – The Growth of Burlesque"], ''[[New York Clipper]]'', Vol. 62, No. 31, September 12, 1914, p. 18 (accessed February 28, 2017, ''via'' [[MyHeritage]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Burlesque overlaps in meaning with [[caricature]], [[parody]] and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with [[extravaganza]], as presented during the [[Victorian burlesque|Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H. W. Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]], rev. [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]] (1965). ''Modern English Usage''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 68 and 96&lt;/ref&gt;  "Burlesque" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are [[Alexander Pope]]'s  ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''.  An example of musical burlesque is  [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].  Examples of [[Victorian burlesque|theatrical burlesques]] include [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' and the [[A. C. Torr]] – [[Meyer Lutz]] shows, including ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.

A later use of the term, [[American burlesque|particularly in the United States]], refers to performances in a [[variety show]] format.  These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in [[cabaret]]s and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female [[striptease]].  Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and 1979's ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'', among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sankar-Gorton|first1=Eliza|title=Burlesque Is Back and Here Is What You Need to Know About It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eliza-sankargorton/burlesque-is-back-and-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-it_b_7176112.html| website=www.huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Petkovic| first1=John| title=Burlesque: Then and now, a timeline of performers from Lili St. Cyr to Dita VonTeese|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2010/11/burlesque_then_and_now_a_timel.html|website=www.cleveland.com|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary origins and development==
[[File:Arabella-Fermor-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arabella Fermor, target of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'']]
The word first appears in a title in [[Francesco Berni]]'s ''Opere burlesche'' of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as ''poesie bernesca'' in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson: "Burlesque", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 04, 2008), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Pyramus and Thisbe scene in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' were early examples of such imitation.&lt;ref name=stanton&gt;Stanton, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet [[Miguel de Cervantes]] ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are ''[[Exemplary Novels]]'' and the ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'' published in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQTtSRP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570534/burlesque.html Burlesque], ''MSN Encarta'', accessed 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick/&gt;

Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with "[[pastiche]]", "[[parody]]", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the "[[mock-heroic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt;

17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: '''High burlesque''' refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary [[Parody#English term|parody]] and the [[mock-heroic]]. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is [[Alexander Pope]]'s "sly, knowing and courtly" ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, pp. 290–91&lt;/ref&gt; '''Low burlesque''' applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s poem ''[[Hudibras]]'', which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric [[doggerel]] verse, using a colloquial idiom.  Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hudibras'' was so popular that it became the subject of parody itself.  See Sanders, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in [[revue]]s and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].&lt;ref name=stanton/&gt;  [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'' is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p. 50; and Hunter, Jim (1982) ''Tom Stoppard's Plays''. London: Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-11903-4}}, pp. 23–33, 141–146 and 237–242&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
{{see also|Parody music}}

===Classical music===
Beginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect.&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As derived from literature and theatre, "burlesque" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;

In this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by [[Johann Strauss II]] (''Die lustigen Weiber von Wien'', 1868),&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Strauss, Johann" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Michael Ziehrer|Ziehrer]] (''Mahomed's Paradies'',1866; ''Das Orakel zu Delfi'', 1872; ''Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende'', 1875; ''In fünfzig Jahren'', 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Ziehrer, C. M." in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Granichstaedten]] (''Casimirs Himmelfahrt'', 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though [[André Grétry|Grétry]] composed for a "drame burlesque" (''Matroco'', 1777).&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, David and M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43361 "Grétry, André-Ernest-Modeste: Works,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 24 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (''The Fox'') a ''"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée"'' (''burlesque tale sung and played'') and his 1911 ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' a "burlesque in four scenes". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by [[Ernst Krenek]] entitled ''[[Schwergewicht]]'' (''Heavyweight'') (1927).
{{listen|filename=Richard_Strauss_-_Neal_O'Doan_-_Burleske.ogg|title=Burleske|description=''[[Burleske]]'' (1885–86), by [[Richard Strauss]]. Performed by Neal O'Doan with the Seattle Philharmonic Orchestra|format=[[ogg]]}}
Some orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite ''Burlesque de Quixotte'', TWV 55, by [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and the Sinfonia Burlesca by [[Leopold Mozart]] (1760). Another often-performed piece is [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;  Other examples include the following:
*1901: Six Burlesques, Op. 58 for piano four hands by [[Max Reger]]
*1904: Scherzo Burlesque, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra by [[Béla Bartók]]
*1911: Three Burlesques, Op. 8c for piano by Bartók
*1920: Burlesque for Piano, by [[Arnold Bax]]
*1931: Ronde burlesque, Op. 78 for orchestra by [[Florent Schmitt]]
*1932: Fantaisie burlesque, for piano by [[Olivier Messiaen]]
*1956: Burlesque for Piano and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 13g by [[Bertold Hummel]]
*1982: Burlesque for Wind Quintet, Op. 76b by Hummel

Burlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in [[Partitas, BWV 825-830|Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827)]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], the "Rondo-Burleske" third movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and the "Burlesque" fourth movement of [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, Andrew, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mmzf "Dmitri Shostakovich Violin Concertos 1 &amp; 2 Review"], BBC Music, accessed 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz===
The use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well known [[ragtime]] travesties include ''The Russian Rag'', by [[George L. Cobb]], which is based on [[Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]], and [[Harry L. Alford|Harry Alford]]'s  ''Lucy's Sextette'' based on the [[sextet]], 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Donizetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Max (2006): ''Rachmaninoff: Life, Works, Recordings'' p 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian theatrical burlesque==
[[File:Florence St. John.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
{{main|Victorian burlesque}}
Victorian burlesque, sometimes known as "travesty" or "[[extravaganza]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s.  It took the form of [[parody music|musical theatre parody]] in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work.  The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors.  [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Other authors of burlesques included [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;

Victorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English [[pantomime]] "with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early burlesques, following the example of [[ballad opera]], the words of the songs were written to popular music;&lt;ref&gt;Moss,  Harold Gene. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/830406 "Popular Music and the Ballad Opera",] ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 365–82, University of California Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; later burlesques mixed the music of [[opera]], [[operetta]], [[music hall]] and [[revue]], and some of the more ambitious shows had original music composed for them.  This English style of burlesque was successfully introduced to New York in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faustupto.jpg|thumb|150px|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]''|left]]

Burlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Royal Strand Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.  Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize.  The house stars included [[Nellie Farren]], [[John D'Auban]], [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps".

{{main|American burlesque}}
American burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, [[Lydia Thompson]] and the "British Blondes", beginning in 1868.&lt;ref name=Friends&gt;Hoffos, Signe and Moulder, Bob.

They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted [[Olio (musical number)|olios]] and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9018177 "Burlesque show",] ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Online Library Edition, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While burlesque went out of fashion in England towards the end of the 19th century, to be replaced by [[Edwardian musical comedy]], the American style of burlesque flourished, but with increasing focus on female nudity. Exotic "cooch" dances were brought in, ostensibly Syrian in origin.  The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres. By the early 20th century, there were two national circuits of burlesque shows competing with the [[vaudeville]] circuit, as well as resident companies in New York, such as [[Minsky's Burlesque|Minsky's]] at the Winter Garden.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

The transition from burlesque on the old lines to striptease was gradual. At first, [[soubrette]]s showed off their figures while singing and dancing; some were less active but compensated by appearing in elaborate stage costumes.&lt;ref name=humez&gt;Humez, Nick.

Comics who appeared in burlesque early in their careers included [[Fanny Brice]], [[Mae West]], [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[W. C. Fields]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Bert Lahr]], [[Phil Silvers]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Red Skelton]] and [[Sophie Tucker]].&lt;ref name=humez/&gt;

'''Calligraphic projection''' is a system, often used for [[laser lighting display]]s, whereby one or more [[laser]] beams draws an image on a screen by reflecting the laser beam from one or more mirrors attached to a deflecting mechanism.

Analog [[oscilloscope]]s have customarily employed this kind of [[vector graphics]], as did a number of [[computer graphics]] terminals in the 1970s, such as the [[Tektronix 4014]].

Calligraphic projection is sometimes called [[Jules Antoine Lissajous|Lissajous]] projection, after the mathematical figure (and mathematician).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15151">A '''caption contest''' or '''caption competition''' is a competition between multiple participants, who are required to give the best description for a certain [[image]] offered by the [[Competition|contest]] organizer. Rules and information about the competition process are also given by the competition organizer.

== General information ==
Caption contest participants have to describe a given image as accurately and [[originality|originally]] as possible. Contests may vary by image type ([[photograph|photo]] or [[drawing]]), [[Photo caption|caption]] format ([[description]] of a situation or a [[dialogue]]), as well as [[judgement|judging]] criteria. The competition organizer is required to give information about caption submission rules and other information that is important for the contest.

Caption contests are mainly arranged as an [[amusement]], and they can be organized under different conditions (between separate individuals, in public events, [[mass media]], etc.), as well as using various means (drawn pictures on paper, digital image, printed image, press publication, etc.). Traditionally, the most popular and typical format has been publication of caption contests in [[newspaper]]s or [[magazine]]s, but with the development of modern technologies, it is also very popular to organize caption contests on the [[Internet]].

Caption contests can be used not only as an [[entertainment]] but also for other purposes, such as newspaper promotion, bringing forward a certain [[problem]], or product [[advertising|advertisement]]. An important aspect of caption competition is to look at an object, event or issue from unusual point of view.

The caption, unless competition rules do not restrict, can be in any form of literary expression - [[prose]], [[poetry]], as one [[word]] or a [[word play]]. Usually the submitted captions are judged by the originality and [[wit]], but not always the decisive assessment is [[humour]]. It is generally assumed that the caption has to describe image as precisely as possible, so both humour and precision are equally important.

As caption writing is an [[art]] of words, it is rarely possible to evaluate the superiority of one caption over others accurately and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]]. Consequently, the judging of submitted captions is usually quite [[subjectivity|subjective]]. Sometimes competition rules limit caption size, but usually the caption is no longer than one [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (10 - 20 words). As an exception, the caption can consist of several sentences. Usually it is not allowed to use [[profanity|profane]] or offensive language in submitted captions.

In several caption contests, [[champion|winners]] are awarded with [[prize]]s.

== History ==
It is considered that the origins of caption contests are related to the increase of [[popularity]] of [[cartoon]]s and [[comics]] as well as widespread use of [[illustration]]s and the rise of [[photojournalism]] in printed media at the end of the 19th century. All these areas share the combination of words and images that could be multiplied and made available to a wide audience with the beginnings of mass printing and wide spread of newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/earlier-media-achieved-critical-mass-printing-press-yelling-stop-presses-didn-t.html D. J. R. Bruckner. "How the Earlier Media Achieved Critical Mass." ''The New York Times'', November 20, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From currently available information, the first caption contests in printed media appeared in the [[United States|U.S.]] press of the late 19th century (such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-11-07/ed-1/seq-25/ "$1000.00 in Prizes." ''New-York tribune'', November 07, 1920.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which was published from year 1883 to 1936). At that time these competitions were called ''picture title'' or ''picture headline'' contests, but their concept and meaning was identical to current caption contests. It must be considered, that the term ''caption'' in its present sense firstly appeared in [[English language]] only in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=caption&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 20th century, at least in the U.S. press (for example, ''[[The San Francisco Call]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1912-01-07/ed-1/seq-17/ "The Sunday Call Will Pay $20 for the Best Title for This Picture."

Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daily News (New York)|The Daily News]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-03-23/ed-1/seq-11/ "What does this Picture mean?"

Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Connecticut Post|The Bridgeport Telegram]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/bridgeport-telegram/1921-12-20/page-30/ "$10 A Week for the Best Titles in Sunday Post Caption Contest" ''Bridgeport Telegram'', December 20, 1921, p.30.] newspaperarchive.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) caption contests were already quite popular. In these competitions drawn pictures and cartoons were mainly used. [[Photo caption]] contests appeared little later with the improvement of printing quality (towards the second quarter of 20th century).

During the course of the 20th century, caption contests were published in printed media in many countries of the world. For example, in Soviet Union one of the first caption contests was published in daily newspaper ''Izvestia'' Sunday supplement ''Nedelya'' (''The Week'') at the beginning of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odnako.org/magazine/material/show_14096/ "Золотой глаз-Геолог и Мальтус".] odnako.org. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Little later a newspaper ''Literaturnaya gazeta'' began to publish caption contests that became very popular and they are part of this newspaper up until now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/ "Что бы это значило?".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620052849/http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/# |date=2012-06-20 }} lgz.ru. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of caption contests increased even more with the emergence of the Internet by the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century. Internet has made the organization of caption contests and participation in them possible for wide audiences across the world.

== Present situation ==
Although a considerable amount of caption contests are now on Internet, caption contests in printed media still exist and are quite popular. A very popular and prominent is a weekly caption contest published in American magazine ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904199404576538831896448132 Russell Adams.

In 2009, there was released an online multiplayer caption writing game called ''[[Caption That (Game)|Caption That]]'' where players write captions for a given image and then vote for their favourite from the list others have written.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionthat.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219001151/http://www.captionthat.com/ |date=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the iPhone app [http://www.captionit.co Captionit] was released on the Apple App Store. Captionit is a free mobile app that allows people to play and create caption contests on their iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/waste-your-creativity-with-captionits-new-iphone-app-483131.htm/ Waste Your Creativity with Captionit's New Iphone App"] SBWire, March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionit.co/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, mobile phone application [http://tinnbin.com TinnBin] was released for both iPhone and Android. TinnBin users create contests called "Bins" by uploading a picture from their device and selecting how long they would like the contest to run. While the bin is open, users can add and vote on comments, called "Tinns". Once the bin is closed, the winning tinn is appended to the image in the form of a caption. TinnBin is different from most other caption contests as the winner is chosen strictly by users of the application, and not the contest creators, and all the contests are created by users of the application.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tinnbin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Yorker'' magazine, noting the popularity of its cartoon caption contest, has created a caption contest [[board game]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731102549/http://www.familyandpartygames.com/pdf/NY_instructions.pdf/ "The New Yorker Cartoon caption game"] familyandpartygames.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and issued a book with the most interesting cartoons and winning captions as well as comprehensive information covering this theme.&lt;ref&gt;Mankoff, Robert (2008).

Also concerning the ''New Yorker'' caption contest, several scientific studies have been carried out: researchers from [[University of New Mexico]], Department of Anthropology, in 2010 have compared humour ability in males and females in context of this competition;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000523/ | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2011.03.006 | volume=39 | title=Humor ability reveals intelligence, predicts mating success, and is higher in males | journal=Intelligence | pages=188–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of ''The New Yorker'' editorial board and [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado Boulder]] [[Leeds School of Business]] in 2011 analysed several thousand entries of this contest to study the concept of humour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 Leeds School of Business "What It Takes To Win The New Yorker`s Cartoon Caption Contest"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204013344/http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 |date=December 4, 2012}} leeds.colorado.edu, April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future perspectives ==
The future of caption contests depends on the [[imagination]] and [[creativity]] of their organizers and participants, as well as future development of information and [[Information and communications technology|communication technologies]].

== In popular culture ==
In U.S. TV series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', seventh-season episode ''[[The Search (The Office)|The Search]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/the-office/episode-guide/season-7/42801/the-search/episode-715/281549/ "The Search".] "The Office" episode guide. nbc.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; its character [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] starts a caption contest in the office, with her co-worker [[Gabe Lewis|Gabe]] instituting rules that no one wants to follow.

In [[British sitcom]] ''[[Green Wing]]'', the second series, episode six, its character [[Alan Statham]] wins a caption competition on the ''Consultant Radiologists International'' website, an organisation of which Alan claims to be an "Esteemed member".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/green-wing/episodes/ "Episode 6 – Season 2".] "Green Wing" episode guide. tv.com. Retrieved June 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a children's novel ''[[Absolute Zero (novel)|Absolute Zero]]'' by [[Helen Cresswell]] its character Uncle Parker has won a trip to the [[Caribbean]] in a caption contest. The rest of the family immediately enter similar competitions in an attempt to better his prize but, much of the time, beating the others to an entry form is a victory in itself.

In season two of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Bored to Death]]'', George (played by [[Ted Danson]]) struggles to caption a New Yorker cartoon, which portrays a police duck interacting with a suicidal bear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1296">'''Casting television''' is a competition [[television program]] where the winner wins a recording contract, or takes part in a competition.

== Slovakia ==

Slovakia's competition is Superstars, and the prize is a car, cash and recording contracts. Stars such as [[Zdenka Predna]] came to prominence this way.

== United Kingdom ==

Simon Cowell's "Popstars" is perhaps the most famous one of the lot, and other shows on a similar focus are ''[[Stars in Their Eyes]]'', and Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?]]''.

== United States ==
Following directly on the UK template is the ''[[American Idol]]'' competition.

== Republic of Ireland ==

Ireland's version, called ''[[You're a Star]]'', had a unique twist: winners came into the Eurovision Song Contest as the prize.  However, after the disaster of the [[McCall Twins]] that format has been abandoned. The most famous winner and most successful in Eurovision (though he did not win) was [[Mickey Joe Harte]].

'''Circassian beauties''' is a phrase used to refer to an idealized image of the women of the [[Circassians|Circassian people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus|Northwestern Caucasus]]. A fairly extensive literary history suggests that Circassian women were thought to be unusually beautiful, spirited, and elegant, and as such were desirable as [[concubine]]s.

This reputation dates back to the Late Middle Ages, when the Circassian coast was frequented by traders from Genoa, and the founder of the Medici dynasty, [[Cosimo de' Medici]], had [[Carlo de' Medici|an illegitimate son]] from a Circassian slave. During the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Persian [[Safavid]] and [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties, Circassian women living as slaves in the Sultan's [[Imperial Harem]] and Shah's harems started to build their reputation as extremely beautiful and genteel, which then became a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in Western [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, ''Çerkes Güzeli: Bir Şarkiyatçı İmgenin Serüveni'' [The Fair Circassian: Adventures of an Orientalist Motif], trans. A. Anadol (Istanbul: Oğlak Yayınları, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this reputation, in Europe and America Circassians were often characterised as [[ideal of feminine beauty|ideals of feminine beauty]] in poetry and art. Cosmetic products were advertised, from the 18th century on, using the word "Circassian" in the title, or claiming that the product was based on substances used by the women of Circassia.

In consequence, most wives of several [[Ottoman Sultan]]s were ethnic Circassians converted to [[Islam]], e.g. [[Valide Sultan]]s (Empress mothers), including [[Rahime Perestu Sultan|Perestü Valide Sultan]], [[Pertevniyal Sultan|Pertevniyal Valide Sultan]], [[Şevkefza Sultan|Şevkefza Valide Sultan]], [[Tirimüjgan Sultan|Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan]], [[Nükhetsezâ Hanımefendi (wife of Abdul Hamid I)|Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi]], other important [[Khatun|Hatun]]s (Ladies) and [[Sultans]] like [[Şemsiruhsar Hatun]] and [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Saçbağlı Sultan]], [[Haseki sultan]]s (chief consorts) such as [[Mahidevran Sultan|Mahidevran Haseki Sultan]], [[Hümaşah Sultan|Hümaşah Haseki Sultan]], [[Hatice Muazzez Sultan|Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan]], and [[Ayşe Hatun (wife of Osman II)|Ayşe Haseki Sultan]] besides numerous [[Kadınefendi|Başkadınefendi]]s (most senior consorts), including [[Bedrifelek Kadınefendi|Bedrifelek I]], [[Biydâr Kadın Efendi|Bidar II]], [[Kamures Kadınefendi|Kamures I]], and [[Servetsezâ Kadınefendi|Servetseza I]] as well as [[Kadınefendi]]s (senior consorts) such as [[Bezmican Kadınefendi|Bezmara VI]], [[Düzd-i Dil Kadın Efendi|Düzdidil III]], [[Hayranidil Kadınefendi|Hayranıdil II]], [[Meyliservet Kadınefendi|Meyliservet IV]], [[Mihrengiz Kadınefendi|Mihrengiz II]], [[Neşerek Kadınefendi|Neşerek III]], [[Abdul Hamid II#Second marriage and issue|Nurefsun II]], [[Reftar-i Dil Hatgil|Reftaridil II]], [[Şayan Kadınefendi (wife of Murad V)|Şayan III]], amongst many others, or [[Hanımefendi|İkbals]] (honoured lady consorts), most notable of them being [[Cevherriz Hanımefendi|Cevherriz II]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Ceylanyar II]], [[Dilfirib Kadınefendi|Dilfirib I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nalanıdil III]], and [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nergis IV]] in addition to [[Hanımefendi|Gözde]]s (favourite lady consorts), including [[Abdul Hamid II|Dürdane I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Hüsnicenan III]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Safderun IV]], amongst others. The "golden age" of the Circassian beauty may be considered to be between the 1770s, when the Russian Empire seized the [[Crimean Khanate]] and cut off their slave trade in Eastern European women, which increased the demand for Circassian women in Near Eastern harems; and the 1860s, when the Russians [[Circassian genocide|destroyed Circassia itself]].

In the 1860s the showman [[P. T. Barnum]] exhibited women who he claimed were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, [[big hair]] style, which had no precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which was soon copied by other female performers in the United States, who became known as "moss-haired girls". This hair style was a sort of a exhibit's trademark and was achieved by washing the hair of women in beer, drying it and then teasing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Showmen, Disabilities and the Freak Show|last=Bogdan|first=Robert|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-74393-8|location=NY|pages=200, 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It may have been a reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.

There were also several classical Turkish music pieces and poems that praise the beauty of the "Lepiska Saçlı Çerkes" (Straight, [[blonde#flaxen|flaxen]]-haired Circassian; "lepiska" refers to long blonde hair which is soft and straight, as if flatironed).

==Literary allusions==
[[File:Inspecting New Arrivals by Giulio Rosati 2.jpg|thumb|''Inspection of New Arrivals'', a typical [[orientalism|Orientalist]] fantasy painted by [[Giulio Rosati]] (1858–1917).]]

The legend of Circassian women in the western world was enhanced in 1734, when, in his ''[[Letters on the English]]'', [[Voltaire]] alludes to the beauty of Circassian women:

{{Quote|The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with those beauties the [[seraglio]] of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian [[Sophy (Safavid Empire)|Sophy]], and of all of those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise. These maidens are very honorably and virtuously instructed how to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the pleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; Letter XI, On Inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1778voltaire-lettres.html |title=Voltaire's Letters on the English |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Their beauty is mentioned in [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), in which Fielding remarked, "How contemptible would the brightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies, appear to my eyes!"&lt;ref&gt;Henry Fielding, ''Tom Jones'', book 5, ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar erotic claims about Circassian women appear in [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1818–24), in which the tale of a slave auction is told:

{{Quote|''Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars&lt;br/&gt;For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,&lt;br /&gt;Warranted virgin. Beauty's brightest colours&lt;br /&gt;Had decked her out in all the hues of heaven.&lt;br /&gt;Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,&lt;br /&gt;Who bade on till the hundreds reached the eleven,&lt;br /&gt;But when the offer went beyond, they knew&lt;br /&gt;‘Twas for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; ''Don Juan'', canto IV, verse 114 }}

The legend of Circassian women was also repeated by legal theorist [[Gustav Hugo]], who wrote that "Even beauty is more likely to be found in a Circassian slave girl than in a beggar girl", referring to the fact that even a slave has some security and safety, but a "free" beggar has none. Hugo's comment was later condemned by [[Karl Marx]] in ''The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law'' (1842) on the grounds that it excused slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]], [http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/08/09.htm The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law]", first appearing in Supplement to the ''Rheiniche Zeitung'' No. 221, 9 August 1842. (Excerpts online)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] reported in ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' (1869) that "Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in [[Constantinople]] by their parents, but not publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Twain |date=1869 |chapter=34 |title=''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' |publisher=American Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American travel author and diplomat [[Bayard Taylor]] in 1862 claimed that, "So far as female beauty is concerned, the Circassian women have no superiors. They have preserved in their mountain home the purity of the Grecian models, and still display the perfect physical loveliness, whose type has descended to us in the [[Venus de' Medici]]."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Bayard |author-link=Bayard Taylor |date=1862 |chapter=Circassian Beauty |title=Prose Writings of Bayard Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HN_v61_E-cC&amp;dq=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned%2C%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned,%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;f=false |volume=7 |publisher=[[G.

==Circassian features==
[[File:Circassian woman.jpg|thumb|Circassian woman, date unknown]]
[[File:Bella Kukan.jpg|thumb|Bella Kukan, "Miss Circassia," 2013]]
An anthropological literary suggests that Circassians were best characterized by what was called "rosy pale" or "translucent white skin". While most [[Circassians#Circassian tribes|Circassian tribes]] were famous for abundance of fair or dark blond and red hair combined with greyish-blue or green eyes,&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu&gt;{{cite book |last=Osmanoğlu |first=Ayşe |date=1960 |title=Babam Abdülhamid |location=Istanbul |publisher=Güven Yayınevi |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; many also had the pairing of very dark hair with very light complexions, a typical feature of [[Peoples of the Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=ColarussoBeauties&gt;Colarusso, John 1989. [http://johncolarusso.net/pdf/Prometheus_among_the_Circassians.pdf  "Prometheus among the Circassians"]. In ''The World &amp; I''. Washington, D.C.: The Washington Times Publishing Corporation. Pp. 644-651. Page 644: "The Circassians were famed throughout the Middle East for the beauty of their women and the courage of their men. Physically most Circassians are European in appearance with perhaps a slight oriental cast to their features. Many Circassians are blond and blue-eyed, while others show a common feature of the Caucasus: very light skin coupled with black or extremely dark hair. A lithe and erect physique were favored, both for the men and the woman, and many villages even today have large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Circassian women in the Ottoman harem were described as having "green eyes and long, dark blond hair, pale skin of translucent white colour, thin waist, slender body structure, and very good-looking hands and feet."&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu/&gt; The fact that Circassian women were traditionally encouraged to wear corsets in order to keep their posture straight might have shaped their [[wasp waist]] as a result. In the late 18th century, it was claimed by Western European coutouriers that "the Circassian Corset is the only one which displays, without indelicacy, the shape of the bosom to the greatest possible advantage; gives a width to the chest which is equally conducive to health and elegance of appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Morison |year=2009 |orig-year=1930 |chapter=The Fair Circassian |title=[[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]], 1745–1831: A Memoir |format=Paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |publication-date=November 2009 |page=70 |isbn=978-0-521-14314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that a lithe and erect physique were favored for Circassians, and many villages had large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Colarusso |first=John |date=March 1989 |title=Prometheus among the Circassians: A modern oral tale from a little known people of the Caucasus shows striking parallels with myths from Ancient Greece, Ancient India and the pagan Germanic world |magazine=[[World and I]] |publisher=[[The Washington Times|Washington Times Publishing Corporation]] |volume= |issue= |pages=644–651 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maturin Murray Ballou]] described Circassians as being of the "fair and rosy-cheeked race," and "with a form of ravishing loveliness, large and lustrous eyes, and every belonging that might go to make up a Venus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Maturin Murray |author-link=Maturin Murray Ballou |date=1851 |title=The Circassian Slave, or, the Sultan's Favorite: A Story of Constantinople and the Caucasus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOhEAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=circassian%20ebony&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=fair%20and%20rosy-cheeked%20Circassian%20race&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Frederick Gleason]] |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Henry Lindlahr]]'s words in the early 20th century, "Blue-eyed Caucasian regiments today form the cream of the Sultan's army. Circassian beauties are admired for their abundant and luxuriant yellow hair and blue eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindlahr |first=Henry |author-link=Henry Lindlahr |date=1974 |orig-year=1919 |chapter=Iris color and Mental Characteristics |title=Natural Therapeutics: Iridiagnosis and Other Diagnostic Methods |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ky6m_hnfaIC&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;vq=Circassian%20beauties%20are%20admired%20for%20their%20abundant%20and%20luxuriant%20yellow%20hair%20and%20blue%20eyes.&amp;dq=Blue-eyed%20Caucasian%20regiments%20today%20form%20the%20cream%20of%20the%20Sultan's%20army.&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q=Circassian%20beauties%20are%20admired%20for%20their%20abundant%20and%20luxuriant%20yellow%20hair%20and%20blue%20eyes.&amp;f=false |location=Pomeroy, WA |publisher=Health Research Books |page=32 |isbn=978-0-787-30563-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''A Year Among the Circassians'', John Augustus Longworth describes a Circassian girl of typical Circassian features as the following: "She had regular and pretty features, blue eyes, and fair complexion; her hair was of a light auburn colour, and hung in a profusion of braided tresses over her shoulders, from a bonnet of scarlet cloth, trimmed and crossed with broad silver lace, not unlike the Albanian skull-cap. She was tall, and well, though slightly, shaped; and held herself, like all Circassians, men or women, very erect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longworth, Esq. |first=John Augustus |date=1840 |title=A Year Among the Circassians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYGeRLRf7xsC&amp;dq=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features%2C%20blue%20eyes%2C%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features,%20blue%20eyes,%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Henry Colburn |volume=1 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also understood from the memoirs of Princess Emily Ruete, a half-Circassian and half-Omani herself, that Circassian women, who were captured in Constantinople and brought to Africa for the harem of Zanzibari [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman]], were envied by their rivals who considered Circassians to be of the "hateful race of blue-eyed cats."

{{Quote|At [[Sultan's Palace, Zanzibar|Bet il Sahel]] there was much more luxury and grand style than at Bet il Mtoni. The handsome and graceful Circassian women were much more numerous than at Bet il Mtoni, where my mother and her lady friend Medîne were the only members of this race. Here the majority of the women were Circassian, who without any doubt are much more distinguished in appearance....This natural superiority was the cause of a good deal of ill-will and envy. One Circassian woman, favoured with an aristocratic appearance, was avoided and even hated by the chocolate-coloured Abyssinian women through no fault of hers, but simply because she looked majestic. Under these circumstances it was bound to happen that occasionally a kind of ridiculous "racism" broke out among my brothers and sisters....We, the children of Circassian women, were usually called "cats" by those of our brothers and sisters who had Abyssinian blood in their veins, because some of us had the misfortune of possessing: blue eyes. Derisively they called us "Highness", a proof of how annoyed they were about us having been born with lighter skin. My father was of course never forgiven the fact that he had chosen his favourite children Sharîfe and Chole—both by Circassian mothers, Sharîfe even being blue-eyed—from the hateful race of "cats".&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruete |first=Princess Emily |author-link=Emily Ruete |date=1993 |original-date= |title=An Arabian Princess Between Two Worlds: Memoirs, Letters Home, Sequels to the Memoirs |chapter=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mU2w8K8IyoEC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;f=false |editor=E.

Regarding one of her half-sisters who was also from a Circassian mother, Princess Ruete of Zanzibar mentions that, "The daughter of a Circassian was a dazzling beauty with the complexion of a German blonde. Besides, she possessed a sharp intellect, which made her into a faithful advisor of my father's."&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"/&gt;

The characteristics of Circassian and Northwest Georgian women were further articulated in 1839 by the author Emma Reeve who, as stated by Joan DelPlato, differentiated "between 'the blond Circassians' who are 'indolent and graceful, their voices low and sweet' and what she calls the slightly darker-skinned Georgians who are 'more animated' and have more 'intelligence and vivacity than their delicate rivals'."&lt;ref name="DelPlato"&gt;{{cite book |last=DelPlato |first=Joan |date=2002 |chapter=Chapter 2.

Similar descriptions of the Circassian women appear in [[Florence Nightingale]]'s travel journal where Nightingale called Circassians "the most graceful and the most sensual-looking creatures I ever saw".&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

According to the feminist [[Harriet Martineau]], Circassians were the only saving virtue of the Egyptian harem where these Circassian mothers produced the finest children and if they were to be excluded from the harem, the upper class in Egypt would be doomed.&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

In parts of Europe and North America where blond hair was more common, the pairing of extremely white skin with very dark hair also present among some Circassians was exalted, even in Russia which was [[Russo-Circassian War|at war with the Circassians]]; Semyon Bronevskii exalted Circassian women for having light skin, dark brown hair, dark eyes and "the lineaments of the face of the Ancient Greek".&lt;ref&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 135&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the girls disguised as "Circassians" exhibited by [[Phineas T. Barnum]] were in fact Catholic [[Irish people|Irish girls]] from [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=King139&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Circassian men were also exalted for their beauty, manliness and bravery in Western Europe, in a way Caucasus historian Charles King calls "homoerotic".&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 134&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], in 1862, Circassian chiefs arrived to advocate their cause against Russia and to persuade Britain to stop the [[Circassian genocide|actions of the Russian army at that time]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosser-Owen (2007)."The First 'Circassian Exodus' to the Ottoman Empire (1858-1867)". Page 46&lt;/ref&gt; and upon the arrival of two Circassian leaders, Hadji Hayder Hassan and Kustan Ogli Ismael, the ''Dundee Advertiser'' reported that "the Chiefs are two remarkable looking men. Their imposing bearing, their romantic dress... and their natural dignity of mien, stamp them as very superior... Raven haired, black-bearded, broad-browed, with wide springing eyebrows of sooty black... these bronzed and armed children of the mountains tend to put us out of love with our own specimens of men, and suggests thoughts not complementary to the types of manhood which, in this country, they are surrounded."&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic/&gt;

===Pseudoscientific explanations for the extreme white skin===
During the 19th century, various Western intellectuals offered [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] explanations for the light complexion present among Circassians. The [[doctor of medicine]] [[Hugh Williamson]], a signatory to the [[United States Constitution]], argued that the reason for the extreme whiteness of the Circassian and coastal [[Celtic people|Celto]]-[[Germanic peoples]] can be explained by the geographical [[Location (geography)|location]] of these folks' ancestral homelands which lie in high latitudes ranging from 45° to 55° N near a sea or ocean where [[Prevailing Westerlies|Westerlies]] prevail from the west towards the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Williamson |date=1811 |title=Observations of the Climate in different parts of America, compared with the Climate in corresponding Parts of the other Continent |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|There are not any people, on the old continent, perfectly fair, except those who live in high latitudes, where the westerly winds come from the sea, at no great distance, so tempered as not to be very sharp nor very dry. This rule applies to Great Britain and Ireland, to the Germans, Danes, Swedes, and Circassians; but going to the eastward in the same latitude, as we depart from the ocean or the Black Sea, having more dry land to the windward, by which the air is charged with sun-dry exhalations, the skin changes its colour; it ceases to be perfectly fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Tilloch |editor1-first=Alexander |editor1-link=Alexander Tilloch |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-link=Richard Taylor (editor) |date=1816 |title=XLIV.

The pustules of the child in whom the artificial small-pox has been thus inoculated are employed to communicate the same distemper to others|sign=Voltaire|source=On Inoculation}}

==Pseudoscientific racialist theories==
By the early nineteenth century, Circassians were associated with theories of racial hierarchy, which elevated the Caucasus region as the source of the purest examples of the "white race", which was named the [[Caucasian race]] after the area by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach theorised that the Circassians were the closest to God's original model of humanity, and thus "the purest and most beautiful whites were the Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop Jordan, ''White over Black'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968, pp. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; This fuelled the idea of female Circassian beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/searchlm.php?function=find&amp;exhibit=star&amp;browse=star |title=The Circassian Beauty Archive |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, the decade after the expulsion of Circassians from the Caucasus where only a minority of them live today, it was argued that "the Caucasian Race receives its name from the Caucasus, the abode of the Circassians who are said to be the handsomest and best-formed nation, not only of this race, but of the whole human family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Sarah S. |date=1873 |title=Cornell's Physical Geography: Accompanied with Nineteen Pages of Maps, a Great Variety of Map-questions, and One Hundred and Thirty Diagrams and Pictorial Illustrations, and Embracing a Detailed Description of the Physical Features of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6waAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Caucasian%20Race%20receives%20its%20name%20from%20the%20Caucasus&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20abode%20of%20the%20Circassians,%20who%20are%20said%20to%20be%20the%20handsomest%20and%20best-formed%20nation,%20not%20only%20of%20this%20race,%20but%20of%20the%20whole%20human%20family&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] and [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another anthropologist [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]] distinguished the Caucasian race and the "Circassians who are admired for their beauty" in particular by their oval form of their head, straight nose, thin lips, vertically-placed teeth, facial angle from 80 to 90 degrees that he calls the most developed one, and their regular features overall, which "causes them to be considered as the most handsome and agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William |author-link=William Guthrie (historian) |date=1843 |title=A new geographical, historical, and commercial grammar |editor=Richard Alfred Davenport |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bayard Taylor]] observed the Circassian women during his trip to the Ottoman Empire and argued that, "the Circassian face is a pure oval; the forehead is low and fair, an excellent thing in woman, and the skin of an ivory whiteness, except the faint pink of the cheeks and the ripe, roseate stain of the lips."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"/&gt;

Circassians are depicted in images of harems at this time through these ideologies of racial hierarchy. [[John Frederick Lewis]]'s ''The Harem'' portrays Circassians as the dominant mistresses of the harem, who look down on other women, as implied in the review of the painting in ''[[The Art Journal]]'', which described it as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It represents the interior of a harem at Cairo, wherein is seated in luxurious ease a young Turk, attired in the excess of Moslem fashion. Near him, and reclining upon cushions, are two Circassian women, also dressed in the extremity of Oriental taste... On the right is seen a tall Nubian eunuch, who removes from the shoulders of an Egyptian slave the shawl by which she had been covered, in order to show her to the master of the harem; this figure with her high shoulders and the characteristics of her features, is a most successful national impersonation. The Circassian women look languidly to the Egyptian with an expression of supreme contempt, which is responded to by a sneer on the face of the Nubian eunuch.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Journal'', Review of the Old Water-colour Society Exhibition, 1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orientalizing paintings of nudes were also sometimes exhibited as "Circassians".

The Circassians became major news during the [[Caucasian War]], in which [[Russia]] conquered the North Caucasus, displacing large numbers of Circassians southwards. In 1856 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report entitled "Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women — Infanticide in Turkey", asserting that a consequence of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus was an excess of beautiful Circassian women on the [[Constantinople]] slave market, and that this was causing prices of slaves in general to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/ Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women—Infanticide in Turkey]; ''New York Daily Times'', 6 August 1856&lt;/ref&gt; The story drew on ideas of racial hierarchy, stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The temptation to possess a Circassian girl at such low prices is so great in the minds of the Turks that many who cannot afford to keep several slaves have been sending their blacks to market, in order to make room for a newly purchased white girl.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article also claimed that children born to the "inferior" black concubines were being killed. This story drew widespread attention to the area, as did later conflicts.

At the same time writers and illustrators were also creating images depicting the authentic costumes and people of the Caucasus. [[Francis Davis Millet]] depicted Circassian women during his 1877 coverage of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]], specifying local costume and hairstyle.

==Advertising of beauty products==
[[File:Circassian hair dye.jpg|thumb|A poster from c. 1843 advertising Circassian Hair Dye]]

An advertisement from 1782 titled "Bloom of Circassia" makes clear that it was by then well established "that the Circassians are the most beautiful Women in the World", but goes on to reveal that they "derive not all their Charms from Nature". They used a concoction supposedly extracted from a vegetable native to Circassia. Knowledge of this "Liquid Bloom" had been brought back by a "well-regarded gentleman" who had traveled and lived in the region. It "instantly gives a Rosy Hue to the Cheeks", a "lively and animated Bloom of Rural Beauty" that would not disappear in perspiration or handkerchiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom of Circassia, ''New-York Gazette'', 2 September 1782&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 "the Balm of Mecca" was also marketed as being used by Circassians: "This delicate as well as fragrant composition has been long celebrated as the summit of cosmetics by all the Circassian and Georgian women in the seraglio of the Grand Sultan". It claims that the product was endorsed by Lady [[Mary Wortley Montague]] who stated that it was very helpful "for removing those sebacious impurities so noxious to beauty". The article continues: "Any lady must be as great an Infidel as the Grand Sultan himself, who, after receiving such authority can doubt that her skin will become as superlatively smooth, soft, white and delicate, as that of the lovely Fatima, whatever may have been its feel or its appearance before. What fair one but must yield implicit faith, when she has the honour of the Countess De --- fairly pledged, that all sepacious [sic] impurities will be at once removed by this wonder-working nostrum. And above all, who but must long for an article, from the seraglio of the Grand Turk, which produces a near resemblance to the Georgian and Circassian beauties?"&lt;ref&gt;To the Ladies, ''New-York Herald'', 14 July 1802&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Lotion" was sold in 1806 for the skin, at fifty cents the bottle. "A sovereign remedy for surfeits, scorching from the heat of the sun, freckles, blights from cold and chills of winter, scorbutic, pimples or eruptions of the face and skin, however violent or disfigured, animalcula generated under the cuticle or outer skin, prickley heat, shingles, ring worms, redness of the nose and chin, obstinate cutaneous diseases, and for every impurity or unnatural appearance with which the skin may be affected; to be used as a common wash for clearing and improving the complexion, and in a superior degree to preserve, soften, cleanse and beautify the skin".&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle' (NYC), 20 September 1806&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Eye-Water" was marketed as "a sovereign remedy for all diseases of the eyes",&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Gazette and State Journal, 2 February 1815&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1840s "Circassian hair dye" was marketed to create a rich dark lustrous effect.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Barrett (1998), Southern Living (in Captivity): The Caucasus in Russian Popular Culture, ''The Journal of Popular Culture'' 31 (4), 75–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century sideshow attraction==
[[Image:Circassian.jpg|thumb|As a sideshow attraction, Circassian beauties were women with [[big hair]], a reference to the teased hair they wore, held in place by beer. Circassian ancestry was not required as in this example.]]

The combination of the popular issues of [[slavery]], the [[Orient]], racial ideology, and sexual titillation gave the reports of Circassian women sufficient notoriety at the time that the [[circus]] leader [[P. T. Barnum]] decided to capitalize on this interest. He displayed a "Circassian Beauty" at his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in 1865. Barnum's Circassian beauties were young women with tall, teased hairstyles, rather like the [[Afro]] style of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850–1877'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2005, pp. 68–88&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Circassian hairstyles bore no resemblance to Barnum's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/23800/23851/Circassian_23851.htm |title=Circassian |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum's first "Circassian" was marketed under the name "[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/344/ Zalumma Agra]" and was exhibited at his American Museum in New York from 1864. Barnum had written to John Greenwood, his agent in Europe, asking him to purchase a beautiful Circassian girl to exhibit, or at least to hire a girl who could "pass for" one. However, it seems that "Zalumma Agra" was probably a local girl hired by the show, as were later "Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]], ''Freakery: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body'', [[New York University Press]], 1996, pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum also produced a booklet about another of his Circassians, Zoe Meleke, who was portrayed as an ideally beautiful and refined woman who had escaped a life of sexual slavery.

The portrayal of a white woman as a rescued slave at the time of the [[American Civil War]] played on the racial connotations of slavery at the time. It has been argued that the distinctive hairstyle affiliates the side-show Circassian with African identity, and thus,

&lt;blockquote&gt;resonates oddly yet resoundingly with the rest of her identifying significations: her racial purity, her sexual enslavement, her position as colonial subject; her beauty. The Circassian blended elements of white Victorian True Womanhood with traits of the enslaved African American woman in one curiosity.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trend spread, with supposedly Circassian women featured in [[dime museum]]s and travelling [[medicine show]]s, sometimes known as "Moss-haired girls". They were typically identified by the distinctive hairstyle, which was held in place by the use of beer. They also often performed in pseudo-oriental costume. Many postcards of Circassians also circulated. Though Barnum's original women were portrayed as proud and genteel, later images of Circassians often emphasised erotic poses and revealing costumes.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; As the original fad faded, the "Circassians" started to add to their appeal by performing traditional circus tricks such as [[sword swallowing]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bogdan, ''Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1990, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[The Safety Fire]], British [[progressive metal]] band, released their song "[[Grind the Ocean|Circassian Beauties]]" in 2012.
*The American [[alternative rock]] band [[Monks of Doom]] released another song with the title "Circassian Beauty" in their 1991 album ''Meridian''.

Though stage conjurers generally do not use coin effects, coin magic is sometimes performed onstage using large coins. In a different type of performance setting, a close-up coin magician (or 'coin worker') will use a large video projector so the audience can see the magic on a big screen. Coin magic is generally considered harder to master than other close-up techniques such as [[card magic]], as it requires great skill and grace to perform convincingly, and this takes a lot of practice to acquire.

==Elements==
Coin effects include productions, vanishes, transformations, transpositions, teleportations, penetrations, restorations, levitations and mental magic—some are combined in a single routine. A simple effect might involve borrowing a coin, making it vanish, concealing the coin, then reproducing it again unexpectedly and returning it to the owner. More complex effects may involve multiple coins, substituting or switching coins and other objects or props can be employed (i.e. [[handkerchief]]s, [[glasses]]) as well as the coins. However, the power of most coin magic lies in its simplicity and the solidity of the object; the basic skills of [[sleight of hand]] and misdirection often appear most magical without complex equipment. Almost any audience will be amazed by the simplest mystery, such as passing a coin through a table.

==Sleights and tricks==

==Performance==
Although some coin magic use [[gimmick]]s (e.g. modified coins or trick coins), such gimmicks usually do not entirely create the magical effect. Gimmicked coins are made by several major manufacturers, such as Sterling, Johnson, Sasco or Tango Magic. Producing a memorable mystery requires significant skill in presenting the effect and utilizing misdirection to distract the audience from the secret of the gimmick. A performer who relies entirely on special equipment may not impress an audience. Many people are more impressed by an effect which depends (or seems to depend) entirely on skillful manipulation and misdirection than by an effect which appears to depend to some extent on specially made props. A performer who has mastered the basic skills can nonetheless use gimmicks to powerful effect without it being obvious to the audience. Some prefer not to use gimmicks at all, though most well-known coin magicians do use simple coin gimmicks.

==In literature==
Canadian novelist [[Robertson Davies]] devotes a good part of his ''[[The Deptford Trilogy|Deptford Trilogy]]'' to the art of coin magic. All three novels follow in part or wholly the career of a fictitious magician, Magnus Eisengrim, who was abducted as a boy by a traveling circus and learned his craft while concealed in a papier-mâché automaton. The descriptions of coin magic throughout are remarkable for their clarity. The final novel in the series, [[World of Wonders (novel)|World of Wonders]], details his life and career.

In the [[Neil Gaiman]] novel ''[[American Gods]]'', the main character, Shadow, is experienced with coin magic, and many different tricks and aspects of coin magic are discussed in the book.

In the [[Dean Koontz]] novel ''[[From the Corner of His Eye]]'', a police officer uses coin magic to interrogate suspects.

[[Stock character|Thieves, wizards, and jesters]], in historical and fantasy literature are often depicted as being skilled in sleight of hand, and are often depicted doing standard coin magic. [[Coin walk|Rolling a coin across the knuckles]] (coin walking) is a popular image. Silk in [[David Eddings]]'s ''[[Belgariad]]'', and [[Mat Cauthon]] and [[Thom Merrilin]] in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[Wheel of Time]]'' do this frequently. Johnny Depp's whimsical character Jack Sparrow coin walks in the end of [[Pirates of the Caribbean]]. Also, [[Vila Restal]] in the [[BBC]] [[science fiction]] television program ''[[Blake's 7]]'' mixed his skills as a thief with such tricks.

A '''comic book''' or '''comicbook''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw!]], Mike Kazaleh, "Secret Agent Orange," ''Annoying Orange'' #1, New York: Papercutz, December 2012, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''comic magazine''' or simply '''comic''', is a publication that consists of [[comic]] art in the form of sequential juxtaposed [[panel (comics)|panels]] that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in [[word balloon]]s emblematic of the comics art form. Although {{not a typo|comics has}} some origins in [[18th century]] [[Japan]], comic books were first popularized in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor [[comic strip]]s, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html A History of the Comic Book]. Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''comic book'' derives from [[American comic book]]s once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

The largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the [[manga]] market in Japan was valued at {{JPY|586.4 billion|link=yes}} ({{US$|6{{ndash}}7 billion|long=no|link=yes}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schodt|first=Frederik|authorlink=Frederik L.

==Structure==
Comic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.
&lt;!-- 
WHAT??? There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==American comic books==
{{main|American comic book}}
Comics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois|The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in 1842 in hardcover,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/collections/books/ocn259708589/ocn259708589.html ''The Adventures of M. Obadiah Oldbuck''] at the [[Dartmouth College]] library&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with historians generally citing [[Dell Publishing]]'s 36-page ''Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics'' as the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it "the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing".&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ron Goulart | last=Goulart | first=Ron | title = Comic Book Encyclopedia| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper Entertainment]] | location=New York| year= 2004 | isbn=978-0060538163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s [[Superman]] in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Goulart | first=Ron | authorlink=Ron Goulart | title=Comic Book Culture: An Illustrated History | date= 2000 | publisher=Collectors Press | page=43 | isbn=978-1-888054-38-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ushered the [[Golden Age of Comics]]. The Golden Age originated the [[archetype]] of the [[superhero]].According to historian [[Michael A. Amundson]], appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeman|first1=Scott C.|last2=Amundson|first2=Michael A.|title=Atomic Culture: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=9780870817632|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] began in the 1930s; which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book that we know today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/the-golden-age-of-comics/ | title= The Golden Age of Comics | work = History Detectives: Special Investigations | publisher = [[PBS]] | accessdate= February 18, 2015| quote= The precise era of the Golden Age is disputed, though most agree that it was born with the launch of Superman in 1938.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silver Age of comic books]] is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''  #4 (Oct. 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | title=DC Flashback: The Flash | accessdate=27 June 2008 | last=CBR News Team | date=2 July 2007 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65JDtF5cz?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | archivedate=8 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706  | title=Breaking the Border – Rants and Ramblings | accessdate=5 January 2010 | last=Zicari | first=Anthony | date=3 August 2007 | publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070826092448/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706 |archivedate = 26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time [[Marvel Comics]] revolutionized the medium with such [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] superheroes as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Fantastic Four]] and Lee and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Spider-Man]]. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=libraries&gt;{{cite book | title=Comic Book Collections for Libraries | publisher=Libraries Unlimited | first=Bryan D. |last=Fagan  |first2= Jody Condit| last2= Condit | isbn=  978-1598845112 | year=2011| page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modern Age of Comic Books]] runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= [[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]] | year=2008 |volume=38| page= 1028 | chapter = Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s criticisms of the medium in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), which prompted the American [[Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Jeffrey|title=Comic Book Fandom and Cultural Capital|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|date=1997|volume=30|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMAA instilled the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comic book fandom and cultural capital|last = Brown|first = Jeffrey|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Popular Culture|doi = 10.1111/j.0022-3840.1997.3004_13.x|pmid = |access-date = |issn = 0022-3840|volume = 30|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.

===   Underground comic books   ===
{{Main|Underground comix}}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as [[underground comix]]. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth [[counterculture]] and [[drug culture]] of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure "[[Tijuana bibles]]". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as [[head shops]] and record stores, as well as by [[mail order]].

[[Frank Stack]]'s ''The Adventures of Jesus'', published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon,&lt;ref name="Shelton"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Stack | first1=Frank | authorlink1=Frank Stack | last2=Shelton | first2=Gilbert | authorlink2=Gilbert Shelton | title=The New Adventures of Jesus | date=25 December 2006 | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | page=9 | chapter=Introduction | isbn=978-1-56097-780-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"/&gt; has been credited as the first underground comic;&lt;ref name="Shelton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Skinn | first=Dez | authorlink=Dez Skinn | title=Comix: The Underground Revolution | date=20 May 2004 | publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] | page=34 | chapter=Heroes of the Revolution | isbn=978-1-56025-572-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[R. Crumb]] and the crew of cartoonists who worked on ''[[Zap Comix]]'' popularized the form.

===Alternative comics===
{{Main|Alternative comics}}

The rise of comic book [[specialty store]]s in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for "independent" or "[[alternative comics]]" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].

During the 1970s the "[[small press]]" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].

A number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The "[[minicomic]]s" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.

Small publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].

===Graphic novels===
[[File:The_Junior_Disease_Detectives_-_Operation_Outbreak.pdf|thumb|The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published this instructional graphic novel in 2018 to keep youth from spreading infectious diseases]]
{{Main|Graphic novel}}
In 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term "graphic novel".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger. ''Adult Comics: An Introduction''(Routledge New Accents Library Collection, 2005), p. 291 {{ISBN|978-0-415-29139-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-29139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Lynd Ward]] and others, including Stan Lee.
In 1950, [[St. John Publications]] produced the [[digest-sized]], adult-oriented "picture novel" ''[[It Rhymes with Lust]]'', a 128-page digest by [[pseudonym]]ous writer "Drake Waller" ([[Arnold Drake]] and [[Leslie Waller]]), penciler [[Matt Baker (artist)|Matt Baker]] and inker [[Ray Osrin]], touted as "an original full-length novel" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist [[Gil Kane]] and collaborators devised the paperback "comics novel" ''[[Blackmark]]''. [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term "graphic novel" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work ''[[A Contract with God|A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' in 1978.

===Market size===
In 2017, the comic book market size for North America was just over $1 billion with digital sales being flat, book stores having a 1 percent decline, and comic book stores having a 10 percent decline over 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/industrywide/2017-industrywide.html |title=Comics and graphic novel sales down 6.5% in 2017 |work=Comichron |date=2018-07-13 |accessdate=2018-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic book collecting===
{{Main|Comic book collecting}}

The 1970s saw the advent of specialty [[comic book store]]s. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Comic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.

Some rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The "Pay Copy" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=818&amp;Lot_No=2020&amp;type=prte-pr091305a |title=Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1 Pay Copy (First Funnies, Inc., 1939) CGC VF/NM 9.0 Cream to off-white pages. This is one of... Golden Age (1938–1955)Superhero |publisher=Comics.ha.com |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over $1 million USD {{as of|2010|December|lc=y}}, including two examples of [[Action Comics]] #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]],&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/26/news/economy/batman_comic/ Batman comic book beats Superman at auction, sets record] CNN Money 2-26-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/news/companies/comic-record/index.html Superman comic sells for record $3.2 million] (CNN Money) – 25 Auguest 2014&lt;/ref&gt; both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and [[Detective Comics]] #27, the first appearance of [[Batman]], via public auction.

Updating the above price obtained for ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]], the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Superman's Action Comics No. 1 sells for record $3.2 million on eBay|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/supermans-action-comics-no-1-sells-for-record-3-2-million-on-ebay|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Sentence fragment: Before [[Fawcett Comics]] introduced [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] --&gt;

Misprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen#Issue 5 recall|original press run]] of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' #5, which DC executive [[Paul Levitz]] recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage [[Victorian era]] advertisement for "Marvel [[Douche]]", which the publisher considered offensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?article=2153 | publisher=Comic Book Resources | date=23 May 2005 | title=Alan's Previous Problems With DC (sidebar) | work=Lying in the Gutters | last=Johnston | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been [[Comics Guaranty LLC|CGC]] graded. (See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)

In 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to "slab" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. {{as of|2014||}}, there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as [http://comics.gocollect.com GoCollect] and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.

The original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.

When the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.

===Japanese manga===
{{Main|Manga}}

The first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as {{Nihongo|"red books"|赤本|akahon}}, {{Nihongo|"black books"|黒本|kurobon}}, and {{Nihongo|"blue books"|青本|aohon}}, these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book {{Nihongo|''Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream''|金々先生栄花の夢|Kinkin sensei eiga no yume}}, an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the {{nihongo3|lit. ''yellow cover''|黄表紙|[[kibyōshi]]}}. Published in thousands of copies, the ''kibyōshi'' may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain [[Extant literature|extant]].

Modern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints {{Nihongo|''[[ukiyo-e]]''|浮世絵|}} with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term ''manga'' means "random (or whimsical) pictures", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as [[Santō Kyōden]]'s picturebook {{Nihongo|''Shiji no yukikai''|四時交加|}} (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's ''Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women'' (1798). During the [[Meiji period]], the term ''[[Akahon]]'' was also common.

Western artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; these were things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in ''ukiyo-e'', as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as ''Ponchi-e'' (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or [[Yonkoma|four-picture format]].

Dr. [[Osamu Tezuka]] (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled {{Nihongo|''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]''|桃太郎　海の神兵|''Momotarō Umi no Shinpei''}} inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]], and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the ''ukiyo-e'' tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.

Though a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.

Manga magazines—also known as [[comics anthology|"anthologies"]]—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for [[List of manga series by volume count|many years]] if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called {{nihongo3|lit. ''stand-alone book''|単行本|[[tankōbon]]}}, the equivalent of the American [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.

===Dōjinshi===
{{Main|Dōjinshi}}

{{nihongo3|''fan magazine''|同人誌|Dōjinshi}}, [[fan-made]] Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American "underground comics" market; the largest dōjinshi fair, [[Comiket]], attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;Mizoguchi Akiko (2003). "Male-Male Romance by and for Women in Japan: A History and the Subgenres of Yaoi Fictions". ''U.S.-Japan Women's Journal'', '''25''': 49–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean manhwa===
{{Main|Manhwa}}

Korean manhwa have quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the [[Korean Wave]]. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunt the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.

===Webtoons===
{{Main|Webtoons}}

Webtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwaga]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.

===Franco-Belgian comics===

{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}
[[File:René Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[René Goscinny]] (1926 – 1977), writer of the ''[[Astérix]]'' comic book series.]] 
France and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessinées'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone "Franco-Belgian" comics, but have their own distinct style.

The name ''bande dessinée'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as "the drawn strip"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word "bande" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms "comics" and "funnies", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvième art'' (literally, "the ninth art") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.

In France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.

===British comics===

[[File:Ally Sloper's Half Holiday (front cover - 27 December 1884).png|thumb|upright|200px|Cover to 27 December 1884 edition of ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]''.

Although ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'' (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. ''The Guardian'' refers to [[Ally Sloper]] as “one of the world’s first iconic cartoon characters”, and “as famous in Victorian Britain as [[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher|Dennis the Menace]] would be a century later.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top hats off to Marie Duval, a lost Victorian cartoonist sensation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/oct/27/marie-duval-victorian-cartoonist-ally-sloper |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated [[penny dreadful]]s of the Victorian era (featuring [[Sweeney Todd]], [[Dick Turpin]] and ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'').&lt;ref name="histoday94"&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000228860 | title= Horror Comics: The Nasties of the 1950s | author= John Sringhall | work=[[History Today]]| issue= 7| volume= 44 | date=July 1994| publisher= [[Questia Online Library]]| accessdate=2010-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Penny dreadfuls: the Victorian equivalent of video games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/penny-dreadfuls-victorian-equivalent-video-games-kate-summerscale-wicked-boy |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most popular British comic books, ''[[The Beano]]'' and ''[[The Dandy]]'', were first published by [[DC Thomson]] in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, Stephen.

In 1954, ''[[Tiger (Fleetway)|Tiger]]'' comics introduced ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of [[Roy Race]] and the team he played for, [[Melchester Rovers]]. The stock media phrase "real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), "Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished. Some comics, such as ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and other ''2000 AD'' titles, have been published in a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] form. Underground comics and [[British small press comics|"small press"]] titles have also appeared in the UK, notably ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]''.

The content of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]] also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.

In the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the "[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]]" in comic book history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.artfund.org/news/2014/05/01/comics-unmasked-the-british-invasion | title= Comics Unmasked: The British invasion | author=  | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= Art Fund| accessdate=2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and "darker and edgier" comic books and jump start the [[Modern Age of Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://sequart.org/magazine/20743/1986-british-invasion-part-3-neil-gaiman-swamp-thing/ | title= The British Invasion, Part 3: Neil Gaiman &amp; Swamp Thing | author= Peter Sanderson | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= ''Sequart Organization''| accessdate=September 28, 2014 }} May 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Writers included [[Alan Moore]], famous for his ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', ''[[From Hell]]'', ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[Marvelman]]'', and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2092739/ Please, Sir, I Want Some Moore / How Alan Moore transformed American comics], by Douglas Wolk in [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], December, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Gaiman]] with ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' mythos and ''[[Books of Magic]]''; [[Warren Ellis]], creator of ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' and ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]''; and others such as [[Mark Millar]], creator of ''[[Wanted (comics)|Wanted]]'' and ''[[Kick-Ass (comic book)|Kick-Ass]]''. The comic book series ''[[Hellblazer]]'', which is largely set in Britain and starring the magician [[John Constantine]], paved the way for British writers such as [[Jamie Delano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.tabula-rasa.info/AusComics/Hellblazers.html| title= The Writers of Hellblazer: Interviews with Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis | publisher= Tabula Rasa| accessdate=2014-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic [[Annual publication|annuals]], printed and bound as hardcover [[ISO 216#A series|A4]]-size books; [[Rupert Bear|"Rupert"]] supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. [[DC Thomson]] also repackages ''[[The Broons]]'' and ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.

On 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the [[Royal Mail]], released a set of stamps depicting British comic-book characters and series.&lt;ref name="Stamps"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The collection featured ''[[The Beano]]'', ''[[The Dandy]]'', ''[[Eagle (comics)|Eagle]]'', ''[[The Topper (comics)|The Topper]]'', ''[[Roy of the Rovers (comic)|Roy of the Rovers]]'', ''[[Bunty]]'', ''[[Buster (comics)|Buster]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Twinkle (comics)|Twinkle]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''.&lt;ref name="Stamps"/&gt;

===Italian comics===

[[File:Hugo Pratt (1989) by Erling Mandelmann - 2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Hugo Pratt]] (1927–1995), author of the ''[[Corto Maltese]]'' comic book series.]]
In [[Italy]], comics (known in Italian as ''fumetti'') made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Guido Crepax]] exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as ''[[Diabolik]]'' or the ''[[Sergio Bonelli Editore|Bonelli]]'' line—namely ''[[Tex Willer]]'' or ''[[Dylan Dog]]''—remain best-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fumettologica.it/2014/06/quanto-vendono-i-fumetti-bonelli-i-dati-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white [[digest size]] format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's ''[[Corto Maltese]]''.

Italian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and [[Argentina]]. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of [[Walt Disney]] comic stories outside the U.S. [[Donald Duck]]'s superhero alter ego, [[Paperinik]], known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.

===Czech comics===
{{Main|Čtyřlístek}}
''Čtyřlístek'' (in English translated as Lucky Four or Four-Leaf Clover) is one of the most well-known comics for children published in the Czech Republic.

==Distribution==
Distribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The [[smartphone]] and the [[tablet computer|tablet]] have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.&lt;ref name=NYT72113&gt;{{cite news|title=Embracing Tablets, Comic Book Publishers Cash In on a Digital Revolution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/media/comic-books-cash-in-on-a-digital-revolution.html|accessdate=July 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2013|author=Gregory Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital distribution===
On November 13, 2007, [[Marvel Comics]] launched [[Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited]], a subscription service allowing readers to read many [[Digital comic|comics]] from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16781/avenging_spider-man_1_makes_digital_history|title=Avenging Spider-Man #1 Makes Digital History|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is [[comiXology]]. Some platforms, such as [[Graphicly]], have shut down.

== Comic collections in libraries ==
Many libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccgclibraries.com/integrating-comics-into-your-exhibits-and-collections/|title=» Integrating Comics Into Your Exhibits and Collections|website=ccgclibraries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guinness World Record ==
The largest comic book ever published was on the 5th of August 2018 in São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. It is named ''[[Monica's Gang|Turma da Mônica — O Maior Gibi do Mundo!]]'' by [[Panini Comics|Panini Comics Brasil]] and [[Mauricio de Sousa|Mauricio de Sousa Editora]], and it measures at 69.9&amp;nbsp;cm by 99.8&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;ft 3.51 in by 3&amp;nbsp;ft 3.29 in).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-comic-book-published|title=Largest comic book published|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese manga author [[Eiichiro Oda]] has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the "Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". His widely popular comic titled [[One Piece]] was first serialised in [[Weekly Shonen Jump]] magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of less than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/6/japanese-manga-“one-piece”-is-most-printed-comic-series-by-one-author-ever-385868|title=Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Convenience Technologies''' enable viewers and users of [[television]], [[Internet]], [[mobile devices]], [[Digital Video Recorders]] (DVR), [[Video on Demand]] (VOD) and [[Digital Versatile Disc]] (DVD) to more easily seek out specific content and view it in individualized patterns. These technologies increase viewers’ ability to choose when they want to watch a program with the use of DVR, VOD and DVD, and where to watch a program with the use of [[DVD]], [[iPOD]], TiVo ToGo and mobile phones. These technological enhancers provide the most comprehensive and varied adjustments in the technological potential of the medium ([[Amanda D. Lotz]], 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;59).&lt;ref&gt;Lotz, Amanda D. "The Television Will Be Revolutionized." New York University Press. Retrieved April 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Convenience Technologies encourage active selection instead of generally watching what “comes on next” or “is on”. Because of this, consequently, viewers focused more on programs they wanted to watch than on the networks that supplied them (Lotz, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;59)

The main problem for networks is that the DVR using audience appears, by basically every measure that’s vital to advertisers, more wanted than the non-DVR crowds. According to a  Horizon Media Study, early adopters of technology are usually above the national average in income, in a “well-off” set. They are typically college graduates and white-collar workers (Lowry, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, Brian. Variet, September 27-October 3, 2010, Vol. 420, Issue 7, p.&amp;nbsp;15-20, 2p. DVRS Along for the divide&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4513">'''Corporate entertainment''' describes private events held by [[corporation]]s or [[business]]es for their staff, clients or stakeholders. These events can be for large audiences such as conventions and conferences, or smaller events such as retreats, holiday parties or even private [[concert]]s.

It is also commonly used to mean corporate hospitality, the process of entertaining guests at corporate events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.showsinabox.com/what-is-a-corporate-event/|title=What Is A Corporate Event? - Shows In a Box|date=2012-12-12|work=Shows In a Box|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The companies that provides corporate [[entertainment]] are called corporate event planners or corporate booking agencies.

== Types of corporate entertainment events ==
There are various types of corporate events that make use of entertainment.  An Opening General Session may include entertainment that adds excitement and presents the overall theme of the meeting. Mixers or pre-dinner parties many times use entertainment meant to provide a backdrop for conversation, perhaps an acoustic ensemble or pre-recorded music. Awards or Gala events, usually the last event in a series of meetings, can make use of many options, from [[celebrity]] entertainers to exciting bands providing dance music or other options that will leave the attendees with a feeling of excitement and looking forward to the next meeting. There are many different types of corporate entertainment.

=== Corporate team building ===
Corporate entertainment can also include a day of [[team building]] activities. These activities include traditional camp activities like tug of war, scavenger hunts, and relay races.

A '''cosmorama''' is an exhibition of [[perspective picture]]s of different places in the world, usually world [[landmark]]s. Careful use of illumination and lenses gives the images greater realism.

Cosmorama was also the name of an entertainment in 19th century London, at 207-209 [[Regent Street]], at which the public could view scenes of distant lands and exotic subjects through optical devices that magnified the pictures. It was later converted into an exhibition of curiosities named the [[Prince of Wales Bazaar]]. Exhibits included a sea lion, a sea serpent and L. Bertolotto's [[Flea circus]].

[[File:Dance marathon, 1923.jpg|right|thumb|Marathon dancing, 1923]]
'''Dance marathons''' are events in which people dance or walk to music for an extended period of time. They started as dance contests in the 1920s and developed into entertainment events during the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/pfop-dance-marathons-walkathons-once-talk-of-the-town/article_7cc11c8c-a911-5262-bc4e-e992fe8e4a25.html |title= Dance marathons, walkathons once talk of the town |newspaper= [[The Pantagraph]] |date= 2016-03-13 |accessdate= 2016-04-11 |last= Kemp |first= Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the development of "reality shows", dance marathons blurred the line between theatre and reality. Also known as endurance contests, dance marathons attracted people to compete as a way to achieve fame or win monetary prizes.&lt;ref&gt;Camus, Renee. [http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Renee/DanceMarathons.html "Dance Marathons"], ''U.S.A. Twenties'', ''[[Grolier]]'', 2004 {{ISBN|0-7172-6019-4}}, 2005 paperback {{ISBN|0-7172-6013-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BnoSrB7LJkIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=marathon+dance&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Dance of the sleepwalkers: the dance marathon fad |publisher=Popular Press |last = Calabria|first=Frank M. |accessdate=2010-01-24 |isbn=9780879725709 |date=1993-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1969 film ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They?

* exploitation of the poor, by promoters, during the Great Depression
|date=February 2015}}

Dance marathons became popular in the United States during the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sonny Watson |url=http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/d5marthn.htm |title=Dance Marathons - aka Continuos Motion Derbies and Pageants of fatique Main1 |website=Streetswing.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of dance marathons began in 1923 when a woman named Alma Cummings danced continuously for 27 hours with six different partners. After Cummings established her record, dance marathons became common in the United States. Initially, participants competed in order to break Cummings's record, but later on people began to compete to win prizes,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Solis |first=Kimberly |url=http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Dance_Marathons |title=Dance Marathons |website=Dance.lovetoknow.com |date=2008-12-29 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could range from money to publicity.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;“Dance Marathon” Sonny Watson’s StreetSwing.com. January 1, 2013. Accessed April 8,2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance marathons were a huge hit during the Great Depression as they provided contestants and spectators food, shelter and the opportunity to earn cash prizes, at a time when many people needed a meal and free entertainment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The dances were popular at this time  not only because these events supplied  basic human needs to both the contestants and audience, but are also popular due to the sadistic pleasure, or power the audience felt through watching the contestants compete in the grueling event.&lt;ref name="history link" /&gt;

The depression era marathons faded in the public's enthusiasm in the late 1930s due to increased municipal ordinances and the decreased number of towns where the seamier side of the promotions were unknown. The improving economic conditions and the American entry into World War II also contributed to their demise.&lt;ref name="history link" /&gt;

== Rules ==
Rules vary widely, but one common rule of the marathon stated that the participants could not fall asleep, although some marathons would allow one part of the team to sleep as long as their teammates continued dancing. It was important for the team to keep moving because if they stopped, they would be disqualified from the contest.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Contestants were only allowed to leave the dance floor for hygienic or medical purposes, to change clothing, or for other similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Farrel, James. "The dance marathons." Melus 18, no. 1 (Spring93 1993): 133. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 22, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of other elements were incorporated in the marathons including elimination sprints, raffles, mud wrestling and fake weddings of competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/04/bop-till-you-drop-americas-dance-marathons-no-miracles-here-edinburgh-festival | title=Bop till you drop: The staggering true stories behind America's dance marathons| newspaper=The Guardian| date=2017-08-04| last1=Winship| first1=Lyndsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, the type of music played at a dance marathon changed throughout the duration of it. It consisted of a mix of slow and upbeat music to give the contestants breaks and also keep them going and energized.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Spectators were allowed to come in and watch the marathon and the contestants competing. Often, viewers were able to pay 25 cents to watch the marathon for as long as they wished.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Opposing groups ==
Although many people supported marathons because they were sources of entertainment, there were outside groups that opposed the marathons. Some external groups did not like what the marathons were doing to participants. Movie theater owners, church groups, and women's groups were among those that opposed the marathons.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Movie theatre owners were unhappy because people were paying to watch the marathons instead of attending films. Churches were unhappy with the way that the contestants danced with each other as it was not socially acceptable during the time period. Women's groups were upset because they thought it was unethical to charge spectators to watch dancers humiliate themselves.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1928, Seattle passed an ordinance prohibiting dance marathons within city limits when a woman attempted suicide after competing in a 19-day marathon and receiving 5th place.&lt;ref name="history link"&gt;{{cite web|author=Becker, Paula|title=Dance Marathons of the 1920s and 1920s|website=HistoryLink.org|date=August 25, 2003|accessdate=March 22, 2015|url=http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=5534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states followed Seattle's precedent shortly after. Although marathons were extremely popular, they were also dangerous. During a marathon in the 1920s, a man named Homer Morehouse was the first contestant to dance in the marathon, but after dancing for 87 hours, he collapsed from exhaustion and died on the dance floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandatory.com/2013/01/10/10-fads-that-killed-people/4 |title=10 Fads That Killed People - CraveOnline |website=Mandatory.com |date=2013-01-10 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity dance marathons==
Today, over 250 colleges and high schools nationwide participate in dance marathons of some sort to raise money for children's hospitals. Some raise money under the Children's Miracle Network and with their help, while others are entirely student-run and operate to benefit partnered charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dancemarathon.com/AboutUs |title=ABC's of Dance Marathon |accessdate=2014-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731053926/http://dancemarathon.com/AboutUs |archivedate=2014-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, students organize and host different types of dance marathon events in which participants stand on their feet for 12–46 hours straight.

'''Entertainment''' is a form of activity that holds the attention and [[Interest (emotion)|interest]] of an [[audience]], or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (Oxford University Press, 1971, Vol 1 pp.&amp;nbsp;213–14) gives Latin and French origins for the word, including ''inter'' (among) + ''tenir'' (to hold) as derivations, giving translations of "to hold mutually" or "to hold intertwined" and "to engage, keep occupied, the [[attention]] thoughts or time (of a person)". It also provides words like "merry-making", "pleasure", "delight", as well as "to receive as a guest and show hospitality to". It cites a 1490 usage by [[William Caxton]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. [[Storytelling]], [[music]], [[drama]], [[dance]], and different kinds of [[performance]] exist in all cultures, were supported in [[Court (royal)|royal courts]], developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an [[entertainment industry]] that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a [[banquet]] adapted for two; to any size or type of [[party]], with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.

The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with [[amusement]], so that one common understanding of the idea is [[fun]] and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of [[ceremony]], celebration, [[religious festival]], or [[satire]] for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving [[insight]] or intellectual growth.

An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private [[recreation]] or [[leisure]] activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[television show]], or [[film]]; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of [[game]]s, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of [[theatre]] or [[concert]]s; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of [[List of traditional children's games|children's games]]. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]]. Films and [[video game]]s, for example, although they use newer media, continue to [[storytelling|tell stories]], present drama, and play music. [[Festival]]s devoted to [[music festival|music]], [[Film festival|film]], or [[Competitive dance|dance]] allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.

Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as [[fencing]] or [[archery]], once necessary skills for some, have become serious [[sport]]s and even [[professional|professions]] for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as [[cooking]], have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.

The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative [[remix]]. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.

== Psychology and philosophy ==
Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as [[education]] and [[marketing]] even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals. The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example, the application of psychological models and theories to entertainment is discussed in Part III of {{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Jennings|title=Psychology of Entertainment|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-5238-7|pages=367–434|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFSayreKing2010|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations (Google eBook)|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|edition=2nd|author2=King, Cynthia}} p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as [[museology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation, Education, Entertainment?|year=2011|publisher=Channel View Publication|isbn=978-1-84541-164-0|editor=Frost, Warwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Revolutions|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-203-93264-1|authors=Macleod, Suzanne; Watson, Sheila|editor=Knell, Simon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is "the attainment of [[gratification]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zillmann|first=Dolf|title=Media Entertainment –  the psychology of its appeal|year=2000|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Taylor &amp; Francis e-library (2009)|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-3324-2|page=vii|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This is in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more "entertaining" and entertainment or marketing seek to be more "educational". Such mixtures are often known by the [[neologism]]s "[[edutainment]]" or "[[infotainment]]". The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields.&lt;ref&gt;For example, marketers mix commercial messages with non-commercial messages in entertainments on radio, television, films, videos and games. {{cite book|last=Shrum|first=L.J.J.|title=The Psychology of Entertainment Media|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84872-944-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some education-entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Entertainment-Education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-4106-0959-6|editors=Singhal, Arvind; Cody, Michael J.; Rogers, Everett; Sabido, Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Games and Learning |year=2011 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=London; New York |isbn=978-1-4411-9870-9 |editor1-last=de Freitas |editor1-first=Sara |editor2-last=Maharg |editor2-first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people are entertained by others' pain or the idea of their unhappiness ([[schadenfreude]]).

An entertainment might go beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience.  Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: "What is the meaning of life?"; "What does it mean to be human?"; "What is the right thing to do?"; or "How do I know what I know?". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s influential play ''[[Hamlet]]'', whose hero articulates these concerns in [[poetry]]; and films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', which explores the nature of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Irwin|editor-first=William|title=The Matrix and Philosophy|year=2002|publisher=Carus Publishing Company|location=Peru, Illinois|page=196|isbn=0-8126-9502-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ql_9 IMDb ''The Matrix'' worldwide release dates]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novel]]s give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter|title=Philosophy and the Novel|year=1975|location=Oxford, Clarendon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Originally a [[radio comedy]], this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, [[audiobook]], [[LP record]], [[adventure game]] and [[online game]], its ideas became popular references (see [[Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]) and has been translated into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, M.J. |title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide |edition=2nd |publisher=Pocket Essentials |year=2005 |isbn=1-904048-46-3 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its themes encompass the [[meaning of life]], as well as "the [[ethics]] of entertainment, [[artificial intelligence]], multiple worlds, God, and [[philosophical method]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Joll|editor-first=Nicholas|title=Philosophy and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire; New York|isbn=978-0-230-29112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ancient craft of communicating events and experiences, using words, images, sounds and gestures" by telling a story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gakhar|first=Sonia|title=The influence of storytelling on pre-service students' attitudes and intentions (MSc Thesis)|year=2007|publisher=Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not only the means by which people passed on their cultural values and traditions and history from one generation to another, it has been an important part of most forms of entertainment ever since the earliest times. Stories are still told in the early forms, for example, around a fire while [[camping]], or when listening to the stories of another culture as a [[tourist]]. "The earliest storytelling sequences we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels."&lt;ref name=Kuhns&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhns|first=Richard Francis|title=Decameron and the Philosophy of Storytelling: Author as Midwife and Pimp|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York; Chichester West Sussex|isbn=0-231-13608-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed "toward variety".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression. Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and [[game]]s are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as [[running]] and [[jumping]]) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that [[pole vault]]ing "may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge. Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle."&lt;ref name=Carlsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlsen|first=Spike|title=A Splintered History of Wood|year=2009|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-137356-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods such as [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hickory]] or [[hazel]];  in the 19th century [[bamboo]] was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre]].&lt;ref name=Carlsen/&gt; Other activities, such as [[Stilts|walking on stilts]], are still seen in [[circus]] performances in the 21st century. [[Gladiator|Gladiatorial combats]], also known as "gladiatorial games", popular during Roman times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport, punishment, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Gladiators: violence and spectacle in ancient Rome|author = Dunkle, Roger| year= 2008| location = Harlow, England; New York| publisher = Pearson/Longman| isbn = 9781405807395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Medieval Sport: Quest for Survival | author1=Wiseman, Douglas C. | year=1977  | publisher=Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse Microfiche }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to what is regarded as entertainment can occur in response to cultural or historical shifts. Hunting wild animals, for example, was introduced into the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Carthage]] and became a popular public entertainment and spectacle, supporting an international trade in wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potter|first=David Stone|title=Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire|year=1999|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10924-3|page=308|author2=Mattingly, David J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entertainment also evolved into different forms and expressions as a result of social upheavals such as wars and revolutions. During the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], for example, [[Revolutionary opera]] was sanctioned by the Communist party and [[World War I]], the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Russian revolution]] all affected entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roshwald|first=Aviel|title=European Culture in the Great War: The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda, 1914–1918|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57015-8|author2=Stites, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinrich|first=Anselm|title=Heinrich, Entertainment, propaganda, education: regional theatre in Germany and Britain between 1918 and 1945|year=2007|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|location=Hatfield, England|isbn=978-1-902806-74-7|editor=Meech, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=Max|title=When this bloody war is over: soldiers' songs from the First World War|year=2001|publisher=Piatkus|location=London|isbn=0-7499-2252-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Horn, Dave Laing, Paul Oliver, Peter Wicke, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society,"&gt;{{cite book|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-6321-5|authors=Laing, Dave; Oliver, Paul; Wicke, Peter|editor=Horn, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McReynolds|first=Louise|title=Russia at Play: Leisure Activities at the End of the Tsarist Era|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University|isbn=0-8014-4027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively minor changes to the form and venue of an entertainment continue to come and go as they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology, and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a [[music hall]], a [[Movie theater|movie theatre]], a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]], or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a [[tablet computer]]. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]], [[auditorium]], or [[stadium]]. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the [[Colosseum]], "dedicated [[Before common era|AD]]&amp;nbsp;80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators," and in it audiences "enjoyed "blood sport with the trappings of stage shows".{{sfnp|ref=harv|McDonald Walton|2007|p=51}} [[Spectacle]]s, competitions, [[Racing|races]], and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences.

=== Court entertainment ===
[[File:Codex Manesse 192v - Albrecht von Rapperswil.jpg|thumb|left|Tournament before an audience and musicians (14th century)]]
[[File:Ralph Hedley The tournament 1898.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ralph Hedley]] ''The Tournament'' (1898) Children adapting a courtly entertainment]]
Imperial and royal courts have provided training grounds and support for professional entertainers, with different cultures using palaces, castles and forts in different ways. In the [[Maya civilization|Maya city states]], for example, "spectacles often took place in large plazas in front of palaces; the crowds gathered either there or in designated places from which they could watch at a distance."&lt;ref name=Walthall&gt;{{cite book|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-520-25443-5|editor=Walthall, Anne|ref=CITEREFWalthall2008}} pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Court entertainments also crossed cultures. For example, the [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] was introduced to India by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughals]], and passed onto the [[British Empire]], which then followed Indian tradition: "institutions, titles, customs, ceremonies by which a [[Maharaja]] or [[Nawab]] were installed&amp;nbsp;... the exchange of official presents&amp;nbsp;... the order of precedence", for example, were "all inherited from&amp;nbsp;... the Emperors of Delhi".&lt;ref name="Indian Princes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Charles|authorlink = Charles Allen (writer)|last2 = Dwivedi|first2=Sharada|authorlink2 = Sharada Dwivedi|title=Lives of the Indian Princes|year=1984|publisher=Century Publishing|location=London|isbn=0-7126-0910-5|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, the "court entertainment dance" was "originally performed in the palace for entertainment at court banquets."&lt;ref name="Van Zile"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Van Zile|first=Judy|title=Perspectives on Korean Dance|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, Connecticut|isbn=0-8195-6494-X}} p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Court entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more general use among [[commoner]]s. This was the case with "masked dance-dramas" in Korea, which "originated in conjunction with village [[Shamanism|shaman]] rituals and eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=9}} [[Nautch]] dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces. Another evolution, similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice, was the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment, such as happened during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty with the Narye festival. Originally "solely religious or ritualistic, a secular component was added at the conclusion".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=69}} Former courtly entertainments, such as [[jousting]], often also survived in children's games.

In some courts, such as those during the [[Byzantine Empire]], the genders were segregated among the upper classes, so that "at least before the period of the [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]]" (1081–1185) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there was entertainment such as receptions and banquets.&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Lynda|title=Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience 800–1200|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot, Hampshire|isbn=978-0-7546-5737-8|pages=177–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court ceremonies, palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them, have been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power. Such events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled; between those with power and those without, serving to "dramatise the differences between ordinary families and that of the ruler".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}} This is the case as much as for traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials, such as the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony]] in 1997, at which an array of entertainments (including a banquet, a parade, fireworks, a festival performance and an art spectacle) were put to the service of highlighting a change in political power. Court entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as "for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} Royal courts, such as the Korean one, also supported traditional dances.{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} In Sudan, musical instruments such as the so-called "slit" or "talking" drums, once "part of the court orchestra of a powerful chief", had multiple purposes: they were used to make music; "speak" at ceremonies; mark community events; send long-distance messages; and call men to hunt or war.&lt;ref name="Slit Drum"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=Episode 94: Sudanese Slit Drum (Transcript)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode94/|work=History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC Radio 4/British Museum|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGregor&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=A History of the World in 100 objects|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-413-4|pages=613–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/FMgugdskR7eaWj_ST2fAeQ British Museum catalogue image of Sudanese slit drum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between entertainer and spectator: individuals may be either an entertainer or part of the audience, or they may swap roles even during the course of one entertainment. In the court at the [[Palace of Versailles]], "thousands of courtiers, including men and women who inhabited its apartments, acted as both performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status hierarchy".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}}

Like court entertainment, royal occasions such as coronations and weddings provided opportunities to entertain both the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and the people. For example, the splendid 1595 [[Accession Day]] celebrations of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] offered [[tournament]]s and jousting and other events performed "not only before the assembled court, in all their finery, but also before thousands of Londoners eager for a good day's entertainment. Entry for the day's events at the [[Tiltyard]] in [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] was set at [[History of the English penny (1485–1603)#Elizabeth I|12d]]".&lt;ref name=Bevington&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-59436-7|author=Holbrook, Peter|editor=Bevington, David|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public punishment ===
[[File:Ticket for the execution of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|160px|Ticket for the execution of [[Jonathan Wild]] (1725)]]
Although most forms of entertainment have evolved and continued over time, some once-popular forms are no longer as acceptable.  For example, during earlier centuries in Europe, watching or participating in the punishment of criminals or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment. Many forms of [[public humiliation]] also offered local entertainment in the past. Even capital punishment such as [[hanging]] and [[Decapitation|beheading]], offered to the public as a warning, were also regarded partly as entertainment. Capital punishments that lasted longer, such as [[stoning]] and [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]], afforded a greater public spectacle. "A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the unemployed but the unemployable. Good bourgeois or curious aristocrats who could afford it watched it from a carriage or rented a room."&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt; Public punishment as entertainment lasted until the 19th century by which time "the awesome event of a public hanging aroused the[ir] loathing of writers and philosophers".&lt;ref name=Gay&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Peter Gay|last=Gay|first=Peter|title=Schnitzler's Century – The making of middle-class culture 1815–1914|year=2002|publisher=W.W.

== Children ==
{{Main article|Play (activity)}}
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 041b.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' (1560)]]

Children's entertainment is centred on [[Play (activity)|play]] and is significant for their growth. Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by adults and many activities that appeal to them such as [[puppet]]s, [[clown]]s, [[pantomime]]s and [[cartoon]]s are also enjoyed by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=John|title=Harlequin Britain: Pantomime and Entertainment, 1690–1760|year=2004|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geipel|first=John|title=The cartoon: a short history of graphic comedy and satire|year=1972|publisher=Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles|isbn=0-7153-5328-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have always played games. It is accepted that as well as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] called ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as [[Marble (toy)|marbles]], [[hide-and-seek]], blowing [[soap bubble]]s and [[Piggy-back (transportation)|piggyback riding]] continue to be played.

[[File:Israel Rating.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Example of a rating system specifying age appropriateness (Israel)]]
Most forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children's needs and interests. During the 20th century, starting with the often criticised but nonetheless important work of [[G. Stanley Hall]], who "promoted the link between the study of development and the 'new' laboratory psychology",&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Thompson |first1=Dennis |last2=Hogan |first2=John D. |last3=Clark |first3=Philip M. |title=Developmental Psychology in Historical Perspective |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford |isbn=978-1-4051-6747-5 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially with the work of [[Jean Piaget]], who "saw cognitive development as being analogous to biological development",{{sfnp|Thompson|2012|p=114}} it became understood that the [[Developmental psychology|psychological development]] of children occurs in stages and that their capacities differ from adults. Hence, stories and activities, whether in books, film, or video games were developed specifically for child audiences. Countries have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital entertainment by developing systems such as [[television content rating systems]], to guide the public and the [[entertainment industry]].

In the 21st century, as with adult products, much entertainment is available for children on the internet for private use. This constitutes a significant change from earlier times. The amount of time expended by children indoors on screen-based entertainment and the "remarkable collapse of children's engagement with nature" has drawn criticism for its negative effects on [[imagination]], adult [[cognition]] and [[Subjective well-being|psychological well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobb|first=Edith|title=The ecology of imagination in childhood|year=1977|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-03870-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louv|first=Richard|title=[[Last Child in the Woods]]: saving our children from nature-deficit disorder|year= 2005|publisher=Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|isbn=1-56512-391-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature"&gt;{{cite news|last=Monbiot|first=George|title=If children lose contact with nature they won't fight for it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banquets ===
[[Banquet]]s have been a venue for entertainment since ancient times, continuing until the 21st century, when they are still being used for many of their original purposes{{snd}} to impress visitors, especially important ones ('''4''', '''6''', '''9'''); to show hospitality ('''2''', '''4''', '''8'''); as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing, or both ('''2''', '''3'''). They were an integral part of court entertainments ('''3''', '''4''') and helped entertainers develop their skills ('''2''', '''3'''). They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations ('''9'''), weddings ('''7'''), [[birthday]]s ('''10''') civic or political achievements ('''5'''), military engagements or victories ('''6''') as well as religious obligations ('''1'''). In modern times, banquets are commercially available, for example, in restaurants ('''10''') and combined with a performance in [[dinner theater|dinner theatres]]. Cooking by professional [[chef]]s has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the [[Bocuse d'Or]].

=== Music ===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:A full house, seen from the rear of the stage, at the Metropolitan Opera House for a concert by pianist Josef Hofmann, 1 - NARA - 541890.tif|thumb|left|A full house at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City, waiting for a musical entertainment to begin (1937)]]
Music is a supporting component of many kinds of entertainment and most kinds of performance. For example, it is used to enhance storytelling, it is indispensable in dance ('''1''', '''4''') and opera, and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|title=A concise history of western music|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-84294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own, constituting an entire performance such as when [[concert]]s are given ('''2''', '''4''', '''5''', '''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9''' ). Depending on the [[rhythm]], [[Musical instrument|instrument]], performance and style, music is divided into many genres, such as [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Folk music|folk]], ('''4''', '''5''', '''8'''), [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music]] ('''6''', '''9''') or traditional ('''1''', '''3'''). Since the 20th century, performed music, once available only to those who could pay for the performers, has been available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry, which broadcasts it or pre-records it for sale.

The wide variety of musical performances, whether or not they are artificially [[Amplifier|amplified]] ('''6''', '''7''', '''9''', '''10'''), all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the performance is from [[Solo (music)|soloists]] ('''6'''), [[Choir|choral]] ('''2''') or [[orchestra|orchestral groups]] ('''5''', '''8'''), or [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] ('''3'''). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation ('''5''', '''8'''). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate ('''7''', '''9'''). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately ('''10''').

The instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the [[human voice]] ('''2''', '''6''') or solely instrumental ('''1''', '''3''') or some combination of the two ('''4''', '''5''', '''7''', '''8'''). Whether the performance is given by [[Singing|vocalists]] or [[Musician|instrumentalists]], the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual ('''10'''), passing by ('''3'''), small ('''1''', '''2''') or large ('''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9'''). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably [[a cappella]] and [[overtone singing]], are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing ('''7''').

=== Games ===
{{Main article|Game}}
Games are played for entertainment—sometimes purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a [[World Chess Championship|chess championship]]. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.

Equipment varies with the game. [[Board game]]s, such as [[Go (game)|Go]], ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' or [[backgammon]] need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is [[Senet]], a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Botermans|first=Jack|title=The Book of Games: Strategy, Tactics &amp; History|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Pub Co Inc|isbn=1-4027-4221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Card game]]s, such as [[whist]], [[poker]] and [[Contract bridge|Bridge]] have long been played as evening entertainment among friends. For these games, all that is needed is a deck of [[playing card]]s. Other games, such as [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via [[gambling]]. Many are [[children's game|geared for children]], and can be played outdoors, including [[hopscotch]], [[hide and seek]], or [[Blind man's bluff (game)|Blind man's bluff]]. The [[list of ball games]] is quite extensive. It includes, for example, [[croquet]], [[lawn bowling]] and [[paintball]] as well as many sports using various forms of [[ball]]s. The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in [[motor skill]]s. Number games such as [[Sudoku]] and puzzle games like the [[Rubik's cube]] can develop mental prowess.

[[History of video games|Video games]] are played using a controller to create results on a screen. They can also be played online with participants joining in remotely. In the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century the number of such games increased enormously, providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Digital Games|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London; California; New Delhi|isbn=1-4129-0033-6|author=Bryce, Jo|editor=Rutter, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James|title=Videogames|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|isbn=0-203-64290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games are popular in [[East Asia]]n countries such as South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Dal Yong|title=Korea's Online Gaming Empire|year=2010|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=978-0-262-01476-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French poet [[Louise Labé]] (1520/1522–1566) wrote "a profound and timeless insight into reading's innate power".

''The past gives us pleasure and is of more service than the present; but the delight of what we once felt is dimly lost never to return and its memory is as distressing as the events themselves were then delectable&amp;nbsp;... But when we happen to put our thoughts in writing, how easily, later on, does our mind race through an infinity of events, incessantly alive, so that a long time afterwards when we take up those written pages we can return to the same place and to the same disposition in which we once found ourselves.'' &lt;br&gt;quote from and commentary by Fischer (2003)&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Steven Roger|title=A history of reading|year=2003|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1-86189-160-1|ref=harv|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Saint [[Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–1582) read chivalrous novels and wrote about the "rapture" that books provided.

''I became accustomed to reading [novels] and that small fault made me cool my desire and will to do other tasks. I thought nothing of spending many hours a day and night in this vain exercise, hidden from my father. My rapture in this was so great, that unless I had a new book to read, it seemed to me that I could not be happy.'' &lt;br&gt; quoted in Fischer (2003){{sfnp|Fischer|2003|pp=234–35}}

[[Reading (process)|Reading]] has been a source of entertainment for a very long time, especially when other forms, such as performance entertainments, were (or are) either unavailable or too costly. Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of [[orality]] and oral traditions survive in the form of [[performance poetry]] for example. However, they have drastically declined. "Once literacy had arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative."{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=215}} The advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as [[font]]s were standardised and texts became clearer, "reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure".{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=212}} By the 16th century in Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.

Among [[literature]]'s many genres are some designed, in whole or in part, purely for entertainment. [[Limerick (poetry)|Limericks]], for example, use verse in a strict, predictable rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or readers. Interactive books such as "[[choose your own adventure]]" can make literary entertainment more participatory.

[[File:Goscinny (scenarist van de strips Asterix en Lucky Luke) (l) en Morris (tekenaar, Bestanddeelnr 924-5894.jpg|thumb|Readers entertained by comic books (1971)]]
[[Comics]] and cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics, usually in combination with text, to convey an entertaining narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=James|title=British comics: a cultural history|year=2011|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary comics have elements of [[fantasy]] and are produced by companies that are part of the [[entertainment industry]]. Others have unique authors who offer a more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about [[superheroes]] such as [[Superman]] are of the first type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Mike|title=Superhero comics of the Golden Age: the illustrated history|year= 1992|publisher=Taylor Publishing|location=Dallas, Texas|isbn=0-87833-808-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years  of [[Charles M.

The Japanese [[Manga]] style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. [[Caricature]] uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.

[[Comedy]] is both a [[genre]] of entertainment and a component of it, providing laughter and amusement, whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece. It is a valued contributor to many forms of entertainment, including in literature, theatre, opera, film and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roston|first=Murray|title=The comic mode in English literature: from the Middle Ages to today|year=2011|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9588-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grindon|first=Leger|title=The Hollywood romantic comedy: conventions, history, controversies|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-8266-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In royal courts, such as in the Byzantine court, and presumably, also in its wealthy households, "[[Mime artist|mimes]] were the focus of orchestrated humour, expected or obliged to make fun of all at court, not even excepting the emperor and members of the imperial family.

=== Performance ===
{{Main|Performance}}
Live performances before an audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes a wide range of forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented [[masque]]s that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.

Audiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause. However, all performers run the risk of failing to hold their audience's attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct.

{{Quotation|"Of course you all ought to know that while singing a good song or, or giving a good recitation&amp;nbsp;... helps to arrest the company's attention&amp;nbsp;... Such at least was the case with me{{snd}} the [[publican]] devised a plan to bring my entertainment to an end abruptly, and the plan was, he told the waiter to throw a wet towel at me, which, of course, the waiter did&amp;nbsp;... and I received the wet towel, full force, in the face, which staggered me&amp;nbsp;... and had the desired effect of putting an end to me giving any more entertainments in the house."

==== Storytelling ====
{{Main|Storytelling}}
Storytelling is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all other forms. It is "not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on [[illuminated manuscript]]s and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones.&lt;ref name=Watanabe&gt;{{cite book|last=Watanabe|first=Masako|title=Storytelling in Japanese Art|year=2011|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=978-0-300-17590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] used [[pilgrim]]s in his literary work ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng'en in the 16th century in ''[[Journey to the West]]''. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.

The power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous ones—[[Scheherazade]]—a story in the [[Iran|Persian]] professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamanaka|first=Yuriko|title=The Arabian nights and orientalism: perspectives from East &amp; West|year=2006|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London; New York|author2=Nishio, Tetsuo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Sir Richard (1821–1890) (in English)|title=Arabian nights. A plain and literal translation of the Arabian nights' entertainments: now entitled The book of the thousand and one nights |year=1958|publisher=Barker|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arabian nights in English literature : studies in the reception of The thousand and one nights into British culture|year=1988|publisher=Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|isbn=0-333-36693-X|editor=Caracciolo, Peter L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Shéhérazade (Ravel)|Ravel]] and [[Karol Szymanowski|Szymanowski]] have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pasolini]] made a [[Arabian Nights (1974 film)|film adaptation]]; and there is an [[The Magic of Scheherazade|innovative video game]] based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of [[wayang]], in which the performance is accompanied by a [[gamelan]] orchestra or the similarly traditional [[Punch and Judy]] show.

Epic narratives, poems, [[saga]]s and [[allegory|allegories]] from all cultures tell such gripping tales that they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''; [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]''; the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]''; the Persian epic ''[[Shahnameh]]''; the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] and the celebrated ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of the Genji]]''. Collections of stories, such as ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' or those by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rankin|first=Walter|title=Grimm pictures: fairy tale archetypes in eight horror and suspense films|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most powerful and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories, also called [[myth of origin|origin]] or [[creation myth]]s such as the [[Dreamtime]] myths of the [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]], the Mesopotamian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The epic of Gilgamesh: the Babylonian epic poem and other texts in Akkadian and Sumerian (English –  translated from Akkadian and Sumerian by Andrew George)|year=1999|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=0-7139-9196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Vivian Laubach|title=Hawaiian Myths of Earth, Sea, and Sky|year=1966|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-1171-2|author2=Kahalewai, Marilyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; These too are developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.

[[Theatre]] performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic times]] when "leading musicians and actors" performed widely at "poetical competitions", for example at "[[Delphi]], [[Delos]], [[Ephesus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|title=The Cambridge companion to Greek and Roman theatre|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-83456-2|editors=McDonald, Marianne and Walton, J. Michael}} p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] and his teacher [[Plato]] both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as "What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform? What kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the elite?"{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=93}} The "Ptolemys in Egypt, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] in [[Pergamon|Pergamum]]" also had a strong theatrical tradition and later, wealthy patrons in Rome staged "far more lavish productions".{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=26}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of British Theatre|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press (3 volumes)|isbn=0-521-82790-6|editors=Milling, Jane; Donohue, Joseph W.; Thomson, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage and the spaces set out in front of it for an audience create a theatre. All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience, including the impromptu or improvised ('''2''', '''3''', '''6'''); the temporary ('''2'''); the elaborate ('''9'''); or the traditional and permanent ('''5''', '''7'''). They are erected indoors ('''3''', '''5''', '''9''') or outdoors ('''2''', '''4''', '''6'''). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as [[stagecraft]] ('''10'''). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.

==== Cinema and film ====
{{Main|Film}}
[[File:Munken kino (kinolerret).jpg|thumb|left|Film audiences are typically seated in comfortable chairs arranged in close rows before a projection screen. Norway (2005)]]

[[Film]]s are a major form of entertainment, although not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: [[documentary film]], for example, aims to create a record or inform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyver|first=John|title=The Moving Image: An International History of Film, Television, and Video|year=1989|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Limited|isbn=0-631-16821-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: "The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] were the first to send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public."&lt;ref name=Paris&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFParis1999|title=The First World War and popular Cinema|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-8135-2824-0|editor=Paris, Michael}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Pathé]] launched and distributed [[Pathé News|newsreels]]&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; and by [[World War I]], films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. "In the first decade of the [20th] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms."&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; The Americans first "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," but "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle".{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=115}} Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. [[Animation]], for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavalier|first=Stephen|title=The world history of animation|year= 2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-26112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) in the 21st century made it "possible to do spectacle" more cheaply and "on a scale never dreamed of" by [[Cecil B. DeMille]].&lt;ref name=Byrnes&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Pompeii, Noah and Exodus: The sword giveth again|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/pompeii-noah-and-exodus-the-sword-giveth-again-20140327-35jm4.html|work=Film|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the "only mass entertainment" but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Losing the plot|last = Byrnes|first = Paul|date = 12 December 2015|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = |via = |pages = 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated [[visual effects]] and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and [[Fantasy|fantastic]]) but also to animate non-living items such as [[Lego]] normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form.&lt;ref name=Maddox&gt;{{cite web|last=Maddox|first=Garry|title=The Lego Movie: Hit off the old block | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-lego-movie-hit-off-the-old-block-20140327-35jek.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators of ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' "wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer."&lt;ref name=Maddox/&gt; The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a [[home cinema|home theatre]], recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.

Films also re-imagine entertainment from other forms, turning stories, books and plays, for example, into new entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=Kenneth S.|title=A History of Shakespeare on Screen: A Century of Film and Television|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-59404-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey|The Story of Film]]'', a documentary about the [[history of film]], gives a survey of global achievements and innovations in the medium, as well as changes in the conception of film-making. It demonstrates that while some films, particularly those in the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] tradition that combines "realism and [[melodrama]]tic romanticism",{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=17}} are intended as a form of [[escapism]], others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences. For example, the award winning Senegalese film ''[[Xala]]'' takes government corruption as its theme. [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' was a brave and innovative parody, also on a political theme. Stories that are thousands of years old, such as [[Noah (2014 film)|''Noah'']], have been re-interpreted in film, applying familiar [[literary devices]] such as allegory and [[personification]] with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as "human folly", good and evil, courage and despair, love, faith, and death{{snd}} themes that have been a main-stay of entertainment across all its forms.&lt;ref name=Byrnes2&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Noah review: Moments of brilliance but can't shake sinking feeling  |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/noah-review-moments-of-brilliance-but-cant-shake-sinking-feeling-20140327-35jm3.html|work=Review|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other media, excellence and achievement in films is recognised through a range of awards, including ones from the  American [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] in France and the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]].

==== Dance ====
{{Main|Dance}}
[[File:Peterborough Snow Ball 2008 silent video.ogg|left|thumb|Dancers creating their own entertainment at a ball. &lt;br&gt; Peterborough (2008) (silent video)]]
The many forms of [[dance]] provide entertainment for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when it is used to express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines many forms of entertainment{{snd}} music, movement, storytelling, theatre{{snd}} it provides a good example of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.

Dance is "a form of cultural representation" that involves not just dancers, but "[[Choreography (dance)|choreographers]], audience members, [[Patronage|patrons]] and [[impresario]]s&amp;nbsp;... coming from all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods."&lt;ref name="Dils"&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFDilsAlbright2001|title=Moving History/Dancing Cultures: A Dance History Reader|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8195-6412-5|author=Albright, Ann Cooper|editor=Dils, Ann}} p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether from Africa, Asia or Europe, dance is constantly negotiating the realms of political, social, spiritual and artistic influence."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} Even though dance traditions may be limited to one cultural group, they all develop. For example, in Africa, there are "[[Dahomey|Dahomean]] dances, [[Hausa people|Hausa]] dances, [[Maasai people|Masai]] dances and so forth."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=34}} [[Ballet]] is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Clarke|first=Mary|title=The history of dance|year=1981|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-54282-X}} p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dances, such as the [[quadrille]], a square dance that "emerged during the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic years]] in France"{{sfnp|Clarke|1981|p=97}} and other [[country dance]]s&lt;ref name="Wilson2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=An Analysis of Country Dancing|date=1808|publisher=W. Calvert}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once popular at social gatherings like [[Ball (dance)|balls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fullerton|first=Susannah|title=A Dance with [[Jane Austen]]: How a Novelist and Her Characters Went to the Ball|year=2012|publisher=Pgw|isbn=0-7112-3245-8|author2=Le Faye, Deirdre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=The Treasures of Terpsichore: or, A Companion for the Ball-Room|date=1816|publisher=Sherwood, Neely and Jones|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now rarely performed. On the other hand, many [[folk dance]]s (such as [[Scottish highland dance|Scottish Highland dancing]] and [[Irish dance|Irish dancing]]), have evolved into competitions, which by adding to their audiences, has increased their entertainment value. "Irish dance theatre, which sometimes features traditional Irish steps and music, has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation."&lt;ref name="Wulff"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulff|first=Helena|title=Dancing at the Crossroads: Memory and Mobility in Ireland|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-328-2|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since dance is often "associated with the female body and women's experiences",{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} female dancers, who dance to entertain, have in some cases been regarded as distinct from "decent" women because they "use their bodies to make a living instead of hiding them as much as possible".{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=142}} Society's attitudes to female dancers depend on the culture, its history and the entertainment industry itself. For example, while some cultures regard any dancing by women as "the most shameful form of entertainment",&lt;ref&gt;van Nieuwkerk, Karin. "Changing Images and Shifting Identities: Female Performers in Egypt" in Dils &amp; Albright (2001). p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; other cultures have established venues such as [[strip clubs]] where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as [[striptease]] are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences.

Various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing, sometimes because of disapproval of the music or clothes associated with it. Nationalism, authoritarianism and racism have played a part in banning dances or dancing. For example, during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, American dances such as [[Swing (dance)|swing]], regarded as "completely un-German", had "become a public offense and needed to be banned".&lt;ref name="Karina"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karina|first=Lilian|title=Hitler's Dancers: German Modern Dance and the Third Reich|year=1999|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=1-57181-300-4|page=174|edition=English language|others=Translated by Jonathan Steinberg|author2=Kant, Marion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Shanghai, China, in the 1930s, "dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise the excess that plagued Chinese society" and officials wondered if "other forms of entertainment such as [[brothel]]s" should also be banned.

Dances can be performed [[Solo (dance)|solo]] ('''1''', '''4'''); in pairs, ('''2''', '''3'''); in groups, ('''5''', '''6''', '''7'''); or by massed performers ('''10'''). They might be improvised ('''4''', '''8''') or highly choreographed ('''1''', '''2''', '''5''', '''10'''); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, ('''4'''); a paying audience ('''2'''); a world audience ('''10'''); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre ('''3''', '''5'''). They might be a part of a celebration, such as a [[wedding]] or [[New Year]] ('''6''', '''8'''); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by [[warrior]]s like a [[haka]] ('''7'''). Some dances, such as traditional dance in '''1''' and ballet in '''2''', need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the [[can-can]], require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves ('''9''').

==== Animals ====
Animals have been used for the purposes of entertainment for millennia. They have been hunted for entertainment (as opposed to hunted for food); displayed while they hunt for prey; watched when they compete with each other; and watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement. The Romans, for example, were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and acts performed by trained animals. They watched as "lions and bears danced to the music of pipes and [[cymbal]]s; horses were trained to kneel, bow, dance and prance&amp;nbsp;... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild leopards." There were "violent confrontations with wild beasts" and "performances over time became more brutal and bloodier".&lt;ref name="St Leon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=St Leon|first=Mark|title=Circus: the Australian story|year=2011|publisher=Melbourne Books|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-1-877096-50-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals that perform trained routines or "acts" for human entertainment include fleas in [[flea circus]]es, dolphins in [[Dolphinarium|dolphinaria]], and monkeys doing tricks for an audience on behalf of the player of a [[street organ]]. Animals kept in [[zoo]]s in ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hancocks|first=David|title=A different nature: the paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-23676-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contests between animals are now regarded as sports{{snd}} for example, [[horse racing]] is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on [[Melbourne Cup]] Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, [[camel racing]] requires human riders, while [[greyhound racing]] does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like [[Cockroach racing|cockroaches]].

The use of animals for entertainment is often controversial, especially the hunting of wild animals. Some contests between animals, once popular entertainment for the public, have become illegal because of the cruelty involved. Among these are [[blood sport]]s such as [[bear-baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cockfighting]]. Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors. For example, the conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as "a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship, and proponents, who view it as entertainment" has been tested in a court of law.&lt;ref name=Bronner&gt;An extensive discussion of the legal and cultural issues can be found in {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bronner|first=Simon J.|title=Killing Tradition: Inside Hunting and Animal Rights Controversies|year=2008|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2528-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox hunting]], which involves the use of horses as well as hounds, and [[bullfighting]], which has a strong theatrical component, are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history. They both involve animals and are variously regarded as sport, entertainment or cultural tradition&lt;!--don't use 'either' nor 'and/or' in this sentence; 'variously' is used in conjunction with 'or' to mean they're regarded as one, two or three of these things--&gt;. Among the organisations set up to advocate for the rights of animals are some whose concerns include the use of animals for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: [http://www.league.org.uk/ The League against Cruel Sports, UK]; [http://www.peta.org/ People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), multinational]; and [http://www.sharkonline.org/ Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK), US].&lt;/ref&gt; However, "in many cases of animal advocacy groups versus organisations accused of animal abuse, both sides have cultural claims."{{sfn|Bronner|2008}}

==== Circus ====
{{Main|Circus}}
[[File:Cirque Soleil Stilt 1.jpg|thumb|Children entertained by a [[stilts|stilt]] walker performing in a circus act]]

A [[circus]], described as "one of the most brazen of entertainment forms",&lt;ref name=Stoddart&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoddart|first=Helen|title=Rings of Desire: Circus History and Representation|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK &amp; New York|page=13|isbn=0-7190-5233-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a special type of theatrical performance, involving a variety of physical skills such as [[acrobatics]] and [[juggling]] and sometimes performing animals. Usually thought of as a travelling show performed in a [[wikt:big top|big top]], circus was first performed in permanent venues. [[Philip Astley]] is regarded as the founder of the modern circus in the second half of the 18th century and [[Jules Léotard]] is the French performer credited with developing the art of the [[trapeze]], considered synonymous with circuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Michael|title=Victorian sensation, or, The spectacular, the shocking, and the scandalous in nineteenth-century Britain|year=2003|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|isbn=1-84331-076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astley brought together performances that were generally familiar in traditional British fairs "at least since the beginning of the 17th century": "tumbling, rope-dancing, juggling, animal tricks and so on".&lt;ref name=Stoddart/&gt; It has been claimed that "there is no direct link between the Roman circus and the circus of modern times.&amp;nbsp;... Between the demise of the Roman 'circus' and the foundation of Astley's Amphitheatre in London some 1300 years later, the nearest thing to a circus ring was the rough circle formed by the curious onlookers who gathered around the itinerant tumbler or juggler on a [[village green]]."{{sfnp|St Leon|2011}}

==== Magic ====
{{Main|Magic (illusion)}}
The form of entertainment known as [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] or conjuring and recognisable as performance, is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times. (References to magic, for example, can be found in the [[Bible]], in [[Hermeticism]], in [[Zoroastrianism]], in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition, in [[mysticism]] and in the sources of [[Freemasonry]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi|first=Éliphas|title=The History of Magic ''(originally published in 1860 as'' Histoire de la Magie ''English edition, translated by A.E. Waite in 1913)''|year=2001|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87728-929-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, [[psychological manipulation]], sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the [[stunt performer|stunt performances]] and [[Escapology|escape acts]] of [[Harry Houdini]], for example, regarded him as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Houdini: the man who walked through walls  | author1=Gresham, William Lindsay  | year=1959  | publisher=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=The Great Houdini: magician extraordinary  | author1=Epstein, Beryl| author2=Epstein, Sam  | year=1971  | location = Folkestone| publisher=Bailey Brothers and Swinfen (Reprint.

Originally published: New York: Dutton, c1920)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magician (fantasy)|Fantasy magicians]] have held an important place in literature for centuries, offering entertainment to millions of readers. Famous wizards such as [[Merlin]] in the [[Arthurian legends]] have been written about since the 5th and 6th centuries, while in the 21st century, the young wizard [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] became a global entertainment phenomenon when the book series about him sold about 450 million copies (as at June 2011), making it the [[List of book series|best-selling book series in history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rowling 'makes £5 every second'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7649962.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter series to be sold as e-books|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13889578|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Street performance ====
[[File:Didgeridoo street player.jpg|thumb|[[Didgeridoo]] player entertaining passers by in the street]]

Street entertainment, [[street performance]] or "busking" are forms of performance that have been meeting the public's need for entertainment for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=The buskers: a history of street entertainment|year= 1981|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot; North Pomfret, Vermont|isbn=0-7153-8026-5|author2=Greenwood, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "an integral aspect of London's life", for example, when the city in the early 19th century was "filled with spectacle and diversion".{{sfnp|Ackroyd|2000|p=346 (caption to plate following text pages)}} [[Minstrel]]s or [[troubadour]]s are part of the tradition. The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.coffsharbourbuskers.com/ 2012 Coffs Harbour International Buskers and Comedy Festival].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic forms of contemporary street performance. The first form is the "circle show". It tends to gather a crowd, usually has a distinct beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[magician (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, acrobats, [[juggler]]s and sometimes [[musician]]s. This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the ''walk-by act'', has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, ''café busking'', is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and cafés. This type of act occasionally uses [[public transport]] as a venue.

==== Parades ====
{{Main|Parade}}
[[Parade]]s are held for a range of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. [[Cavalcade]]s and the modern variant, the [[motorcade]], are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the [[Trooping the Colour]] in '''8''') and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.

One of the earliest forms of parade were "[[Roman triumph|triumphs]]"{{snd}} grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils, given by triumphant Roman generals to celebrate their victories. They presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted the prestige of the victor. "In the summer of 46&amp;nbsp;[[Before common era|BCE]] [[Julius Caesar]] chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurval|first=Robert Alan|title=Actium and Augustus: The Politics and Emotions of Civil War|year=1995|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=0-472-10590-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe from the Middle Ages to the [[Baroque]] the [[Royal Entry]] celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets, passing various shows and displays. The annual [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times.

Many religious festivals (especially those that incorporate [[processions]], such as [[Holy Week procession]]s or the Indian festival of [[Holi]]) have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose. Sometimes, religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments, or like the [[Festa del Redentore]] in Venice, have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance. However, [[pilgrimage]]s, such as the Christian pilgrimage of the [[Way of St. James]], the Muslim [[Hajj]] and the Hindu [[Kumbh Mela]], which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or procession, are not intended as entertainment: they are instead about an individual's spiritual journey. Hence, the relationship between spectator and participant, unlike entertainments proper, is different. The manner in which the Kumbh Mela, for example, "is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for Western consumption{{snd}} renders the presence of [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] deeply problematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maclean|first=Kama|title=Pilgrimage and Power: The Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, 1765–1954|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533894-2|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parades generally impress and delight often by including unusual, colourful costumes ('''7, 10'''). Sometimes they also commemorate ('''5''', '''8''') or celebrate ('''1''', '''4, 6,''' '''8''', '''9'''). Sometimes they have a serious purpose, such as when the context is military ('''1''', '''2''', '''5'''), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or have a role to play ('''6''', '''7, 10'''). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away ('''9'''), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.

==== Fireworks ====
{{Main|Fireworks}}
[[File:Medellín-Juegos pirotécnicos bicentenario-11.jpg|thumb|Spectators at Bicentennial [[fireworks]] in Colombia]]

[[Fireworks]] are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a "crowning feature of elaborate celebrations" in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnists]], especially the skilled Italian ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Giacomo Casanova|last=Casanova|first=Giacomo Chevalier de Seingalt|title=History of My Life, Volumes 9–10 Vol 10|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland; London|isbn=0-8018-5666-3|page=333|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-03722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays "inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might. Birthdays, name-days, weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany 1648–1914|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0982-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and while the fireworks themselves caused a fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Christopher Hogwood|last=Hogwood|first=Christopher|title=Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83636-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accompanying [[Music for the Royal Fireworks]] written by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] has been popular ever since. Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations, fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the Indian [[Dashavatar]]a Kala of Gomantaka "the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman|title=History of Indian Theatre (vol. 2)|year=1992|publisher=Shakti Malik Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7017-278-0|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fire, sudden noise and smoke" of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment. For example, fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the [[millennium]] around the world. As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays and open-air parties greeted the [[New Year]] as the [[time zone]]s changed over to the next century. Fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off against the backdrop of many of the world's most famous buildings, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] in Egypt, the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, [[Red Square]] in Moscow, [[Vatican City]] in Rome, the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, and [[Elizabeth Tower]] in London.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport}}
[[File:Tifosi fiorentina.jpg|thumb|Tifosi fiorentina|Audience engagement from a crowd of Italian sport fans]]
[[File:2010 FIFA World Cup Fans.jpg|thumb|Audience engagement by individual South African fans at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] ]]

[[Sports|Sporting]] competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the players from the audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in [[stadium]] and [[auditorium]] design, as well as in recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and [[spectator sport]] has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are [[association football]] and [[cricket]]. Their ultimate international competitions, the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[test cricket]], are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6052-3|authors=Hardy, Stephen; Sutton, William Anthony|editor=Mullin, Bernard James}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the [[Tour de France]], unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Christopher S.|title=The Tour de France: A Cultural History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|isbn=978-0-520-25630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from sports that have world-wide appeal and competitions, such as the [[Olympic Games]], the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and country where people play it. For example, in the United States, [[baseball]] and [[basketball]] games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is [[rugby union]]; in Iran, it is [[freestyle wrestling]]. Japan's unique [[sumo]] wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kubota|first=Makoto|title=Sumo|year=1999|publisher=Chronicle Books Llc|isbn=0-8118-2548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as the international running group [[Hash House Harriers]], participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more important than the competitive.

The evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of [[History of surfing|surfing]] is associated with Hawaii and that of [[History of skiing|snow skiing]] probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in the case of [[ice hockey]]—an important entertainment in Canada.

=== Fairs, expositions, shopping ===
{{Main|Fair|World's fair}}
[[Fair]]s and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times, displaying wealth, innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Great Exhibitions: The World Fairs 1851–1937|year=2007|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|isbn=978-0-7241-0284-6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether in a medieval market or a small shop, "shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from the everyday".&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Mark Howard|title=Shopping as an Entertainment Experience|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland; Plymouth, UK|page=3|isbn=978-0-7391-1680-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the modern world, "merchandising has become entertainment: spinning signs, flashing signs, thumping music&amp;nbsp;... video screens, interactive computer kiosks, day care .. cafés".&lt;ref name=Moss/&gt;

By the 19th century, "expos" that encouraged arts, manufactures and commerce had become international. They were not only hugely popular but affected international ideas. For example, the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Exposition]] facilitated international cooperation about ideas, innovations and standards. From London 1851 to Paris 1900, "in excess of 200 million visitors had entered the turnstiles in London, Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, Chicago and a myriad of smaller shows around the world."&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Colombian Exposition of 1893|url=http://columbus.gl.iit.edu/|publisher=Chicago Illinois Institute of Technology|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]] "well over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles".&lt;ref name=Boisseau&gt;{{cite book|title=Gendering the Fair: Histories of Women and Gender at World's Fairs|year=2010|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-03558-6|authors=Rydell, Robert; Boisseau, T.J.; Markwyn, Abigail M.; Rydell, Robert W.|editor=Boisseau, T.J.|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of spectacle and entertainment, expositions influenced "everything from architecture, to patterns of globalisation, to fundamental matters of human identity"&lt;ref name=Boisseau/&gt; and in the process established the close relationship between "fairs, the rise of department stores and art museums",&lt;ref name=Rydell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rydell|first=Robert W.|title=World of Fairs: The Century-of-Progress Expositions|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-73236-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern world of mass consumption and the entertainment industry.

== Safety ==
Some entertainments, such as at large festivals (whether religious or secular), concerts, clubs, parties and celebrations, involve big crowds. From earliest times, crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers, especially when combined with the recreational consumption of [[Recreational drug use|intoxicants]] such as alcohol. The Ancient Greeks had [[Dionysian Mysteries]], for example, and the Romans had [[Saturnalia]]. The consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] of behaviour, sometimes causing injury or even death, such as for example, at the [[Altamont Free Concert]], an outdoor [[rock festival]]. The list of [[Nightclub#Serious incidents|serious incidents at nightclubs]] includes those caused by [[stampede]]; overcrowding; terrorism, such as the [[2002 Bali bombings]] that targeted a nightclub; and especially fire. Investigations, such as that carried out in the US after [[The Station nightclub fire]] often demonstrate that lessons learned "regarding fire safety in nightclubs" from earlier events such as the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] do "not necessarily result in lasting effective change".&lt;ref name=Tubbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Tubbs|first=Jeffrey|title=Egress Design Solutions: A Guide to Evacuation and Crowd Management Planning|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-71956-4|page=83|author2=Meacham, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers, such as the medieval [[Lord of Misrule]] or, in modern times, [[security officers]] who control access; and also ongoing improvement of relevant [[International Organization for Standardization|standards]] such as those for building safety. The [[tourism]] industry now regards safety and security at entertainment venues as an important management task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Tourism, security and safety: from theory to practice | author1=Mansfeld, Yoel  | author2=Pizam, Abraham  | date = 2006 |location = Burlington, Mass.|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann  | isbn=0750678984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
Although kings, rulers and powerful people have always been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=Andi|title=An Introduction to the Entertainment Industry|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0341-4|author2=Evans, Beth Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key issues in the arts and entertainment industry|publisher=Goodfellow Publishers |location=Woodeaton, Oxford|isbn=1-906884-20-X|editor=Walmsley, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as [[show business]], the industry relies on [[business model]]s to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sickels|first=Robert C|title=The Business of Entertainment|publisher=Greenwood Publishing (Three Volumes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Harold L.|title=Entertainment industry economics: a guide for financial analysis|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-87485-8|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[film industry]] is a part of the entertainment industry. Components of it include the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/hollywood|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mid Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/bollywood|publisher=Mid Day|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; film industries, as well as the [[cinema of the United Kingdom]] and all the [[Cinema of Europe|cinemas of Europe]], including [[cinema of France|France]], [[cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[cinema of Spain|Spain]], [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Casper|first=Drew|title=Postwar Hollywood, 1946–1962|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4051-5074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sex industry]] is another component of the entertainment industry, applying the same forms and media (for example, film, books, dance and other performances) to the development, marketing and sale of sex products on a commercial basis.

[[Amusement park]]s entertain paying guests with [[rides]], such as [[roller coasters]], [[ridable miniature railway]]s, [[water rides]], and [[dark rides]], as well as other events and associated attractions. The parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named "lands". Sometimes the whole amusement park is based on one theme, such as the various [[SeaWorld]] parks that focus on the theme of sea life.

One of the consequences of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of [[employment]]. While jobs such as [[writer]], musician and [[composer]] exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] or [[special effect]]s supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.

Prestigious [[List of prizes, medals, and awards|awards are given by the industry]] for excellence in the various types of entertainment. For example, there are awards for Music, Games (including video games), Comics, Comedy, Theatre, Television, Film, Dance and Magic. Sporting awards are made for the results and skill, rather than for the entertainment value.

== Architecture ==

=== Architecture for entertainment ===
Purpose-built structures as venues for entertainment that accommodate audiences have produced many famous and innovative buildings, among the most recognisable of which are [[Theatre (structure)|theatre structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=Victoria|title=Site and sound: the architecture and acoustics of new opera houses and concert halls|year=2012|publisher=Monacelli Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58093-281-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Greeks, "the architectural importance of the theatre is a reflection of their importance to the community, made apparent in their monumentality, in the effort put into their design, and in the care put into their detail."&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;Green, J.R. "The Theatre of Paphos and the Theatre of Alexandria: Some First Thoughts" in {{cite book |title=The Library of Alexandria |year=2002 |publisher=The American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo |isbn=977-424-710-8 |editor=MacLeod, Roy}} p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans subsequently developed the stadium in an oval form known as a [[Circus (building)|circus]]. In modern times, some of the grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers. The [[Sydney Opera House]], for example, is a [[World Heritage Site]] and [[The O₂ (London)|The O₂]] in London is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor [[arena]], a music club, a cinema and exhibition space. The [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] in Germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition.

Two of the chief architectural concerns for the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue empty is important both for amenity and safety, because large crowds take a long time to disperse from a badly designed venue, which creates a safety risk. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. [[Sightline]]s and [[acoustics]] are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.

In the 21st century, entertainment venues, especially stadia, are "likely to figure among the leading architectural genres".&lt;ref name=Sheard&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheard|first=Rod|title=Sports Architecture|year=2001|publisher=Spon Press|location=London|isbn=0-419-21220-5|ref=CITEREFSheard2001}} p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they require "a whole new approach" to design, because they need to be "sophisticated entertainment centres, multi-experience venues, capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}} Hence, architects now have to design "with two distinct functions in mind, as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences, and as sports and entertainment studios serving the viewing and listening requirements of the remote audience".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

=== Architecture as entertainment ===
[[File:Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg|[[Sleeping Beauty]]|thumb|left|Inauthentic castle in [[Disneyland]] amusement park]]
Architects who push the boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations of the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]], designed by [[Frank Gehry]], are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really [[folly|follies]], deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.

On the other hand, sometimes architecture is entertainment, while pretending to be functional. The tourism industry, for example, creates or renovates buildings as "attractions" that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose. They are instead re-purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences. Buildings, history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase. Such intentional tourist attractions divorce buildings from the past so that "the difference between historical authenticity and contemporary entertainment venues/theme parks becomes hard to define".&lt;ref name=Lasansky&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFLasansky2004|last=Lasansky|first=D. Medina|title=Architecture and Tourism: Perception, Performance and Place|year=2004|edition=English|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=1-85973-709-9|author2=McLaren, Brian}} p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "the preservation of the [[Alcázar of Toledo]], with its grim Civil War History, the conversion of slave dungeons into tourist attractions in Ghana, [such as, for example, [[Cape Coast Castle]]] and the presentation of indigenous culture in Libya".{{sfnp|Lasansky|2004|p=xvii, Part II, Ch. 4, 5, 6}} The specially constructed buildings in amusement parks represent the park's theme and are usually neither authentic nor completely functional.

== Effects of developments in electronic media ==

=== Globalisation ===
By the second half of the 20th century, developments in electronic [[Media (communication)|media]] made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms{{snd}} stories, theatre, music, dance{{snd}} wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in [[data storage device]]s such as [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] or [[compact disc]]s, along with increasing [[miniaturisation]]. Computerisation and the development of [[barcodes]] also made ticketing easier, faster and global.

=== Obsolescence ===
In the 1940s, [[radio]] was the electronic medium for family entertainment and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garratt|first=G.R.M.|title=The early history of radio: from Faraday to Marconi|year=1994|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers, in association with the Science Museum|location=London|isbn=0-85296-845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio reader: essays in the cultural history of radio|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92820-6|editor1=Hilmes, Michele |editor2=Loviglio, Jason }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Jim|title=The great radio sitcoms|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3146-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, it was [[television]] that was the new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spigel|first=Lynn|title=Make room for TV: television and the family ideal in postwar America|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-76966-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, [[history of video games|games]] could be played electronically, then [[Handheld video game|hand-held]] devices provided mobile entertainment, and by the last decade of the 20th century, via [[online game|networked play]]. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films.&lt;ref name=Tryon&gt;{{cite book|last=Tryon|first=Chuck|title=Reinventing Cinema: Movies in the Age of Media Convergence|year=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|pages=6, 9|isbn=978-0-8135-4546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid [[obsolescence]] of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television after TV: Essays on a Medium in Transition|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3383-X|editors=Spigel, Lynn; Olsson, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a [[Wii]] console, "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953".&lt;ref name=Cogburn&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogburn|first=Jon|title=Philosophy Through Video Games|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-98857-8|page=i|author2=Silcox, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called "[[digital revolution]]" has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Gillian|title=Media Ownership: The Economics and Politics of Convergence and Concentration in the UK and European Media|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|format=Google eBook|isbn=0-7619-6680-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=John|title=Scheduling: the last creative act in television?|journal=Media Culture Society|date=January 2000|volume=22|series=Bournemouth University/Large Door Productions|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1177/016344300022001002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the UK: {{cite web|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|title=Government thinktank to tackle media convergence issues|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 November 2012|date=21 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;And for example, in Australia: {{cite web|title=Convergence Review|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|date=30 April 2012|publisher=Australian Government: Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available."{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=49}} Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as "professional engagers" shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite news|last=Power|first=Julie|title=Laughter and music better than drugs for dementia patients|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/laughter-and-music-better-than-drugs-for-dementia-patients-20130802-2r4w9.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence ===
By the second decade of the 21st century, [[analogue recording]] was being replaced by [[digital recording]] and all forms of electronic entertainment began to [[technological convergence|converge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer|first=Tim|title=Media Convergence|year=2010|publisher=Open University Press McGraw-Hill Education|location=Maidenhead, Berkshire, England and New York|isbn=978-0-335-22873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas "success or failure used to be determined by the first weekend of its run. Today,&amp;nbsp;... a series of exhibition 'windows', such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits."{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=156}} Part of the industry's adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|pp=22, 30 ''ff''}} It is also "the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups".&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt; Globalisation and [[cultural imperialism]] are two of the cultural consequences of convergence.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=30}} Others include [[fandom]] and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Convergence culture: where old and new media collide|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-4281-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet" also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways{{snd}} for example, audiences can "watch highlights, call up statistics", "order tickets and merchandise" and generally "tap into the stadium's resources at any time of the day or night".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

The introduction of television altered the availability, cost, variety and quality of entertainment products for the public and the convergence of online entertainment is having a similar effect. For example, the possibility and popularity of user-generated content, as distinct from commercial product, creates a "networked audience model [that] makes programming obsolete".{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=536}} Individuals and corporations use [[video hosting service]]s to broadcast content that is equally accepted by the public as legitimate entertainment.

While technology increases demand for entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms that make up the content are in themselves, relatively stable. Storytelling, music, theatre, dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] provides an overview of and topical guide to entertainment and the entertainment industry:

'''[[Entertainment]]''' is any activity which provides a diversion or permits people to [[amusement|amuse]] themselves in their [[leisure|leisure time]], and may also provide [[fun]], enjoyment and laughter. People may create their own entertainment, such as when they spontaneously invent a  game; participate actively in an activity they find entertaining, such as when they play [[sport]] as a hobby; or consume an entertainment product passively, such as when they attend a performance.

The '''[[entertainment industry]]''' (informally known as '''show business''' or '''show biz''') is part of the [[tertiary sector of the economy]] and includes a large number of sub-industries devoted to [[entertainment]]. However, the term is often used in the [[mass media]] to describe the mass media companies that control the distribution and manufacture of mass media entertainment. In the popular parlance, the term ''show biz'' in particular connotes the commercially popular performing arts, especially [[musical theatre]], [[vaudeville]], [[comedy]], [[film]], and [[music]].  It applies to every aspect of entertainment including [[film|cinema]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[theatre]], and [[music]].
