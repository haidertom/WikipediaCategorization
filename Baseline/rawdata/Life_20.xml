'''3D Virtual Creature Evolution''', abbreviated to 3DVCE, is an artificial evolution simulation program created by Lee Graham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Speciation  Through Selection and Drift | last1=Graham | first1=Lee | last2=Oppacher | first2=Franz | publisher=ACTA Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is currently down. Its purpose is to visualize and research common themes in [[body plan]]s and strategies to achieve a [[fitness function]] of the [[Artificial life|artificial organisms]] generated and maintained by the system in their given environment. The program was inspired by [[Karl Sims|Karl Sims’]] 1994 artificial evolution program, Evolved Virtual Creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| title=Evolving Virtual Creatures | last1=Sims | first1=Karl | url=http://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph94.pdf | book-title=SIGGRAPH ‘94 Proceedings|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| title=Evolving 3D Morphology and Behavior by Competition | last1=Sims | first1=Karl | url=http://www.karlsims.com/papers/alife94.pdf | book-title=Artificial Life IV Proceedings|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is run through volunteers who download the program from the home website and return information from completed simulations. It is currently only available on [[Windows]] and in some cases [[Linux]].

==Settings==
3DVCE uses [[evolutionary algorithms]] to simulate evolution. The user sets the body plan restrictions (maximum number of segment types, branching segments’ length and depth limits, and size limits) and whether fitness score is scaled in relation to size. Limb interpenetration is also an option. Reproduction / population settings include the size of each population and their run time (how long each individual has to attain a fitness score), percentage of individuals who get to reproduce (tournament size), what percentage sexually or asexually reproduce, and selection type is then determined. Crossover rate determines what percentage of an individual is created via crossover of parents and mutation. Mutation rate in body and brain is then determined. Specific mathematical operations and values can be attributed to the creature’s brain as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Simulating Biped Jumping Behavior using Evolutionary Algorithm | author=Heryadi, Yaya | ISSN=1978-774X | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitness function is then determined. Artificial organisms’ fitness score is determined by how well they achieve their fitness goal within their evaluation time. Fitness functions include distance traveled, maximum height, average height, “TOG” (determined by amount of time creature is in contact with ground), and “Sphere” (determined by creature’s ability to catch and hold spheres). These goals are not individualized and can be set to specific strengths (from zero, as not having an influence on fitness, to one, or having maximum influence) to determine the fitness goal. What generations the fitness function applies to can also be set. The environment, or “Terrain”, is then determined. This includes a flat plain, bumpy terrain (in which a hill is generated around creature that constantly inclines as distance is traveled from the creature’s spawning point), water (a low gravity simulator, non-functional), and “spheres” (spheres are generated above creature to catch).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ottawaskeptics.org/topics/skepticism/132-tam-6-highlights | title=TAM 6 Highlights: 3DVCE-Lee Graham | publisher=Ottawa Skeptics | author=Barry Green | date=June 28, 2008 | accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulation==
Everything in the simulation is viewed from a [[First person (video games)|first person viewpoint]]. After settings are determined, the first generation is generated from randomly created individuals. All creatures appear at the same spawning point and are made of segments or rectangular prisms connected to others at joints. Colors are assigned to segment types randomly. Segment type is determined by the size and joints a segment has. Colors indicate nothing else than that. These first generation creatures move randomly, with no influence from the fitness goal. Creatures with the largest fitness value reproduce and the following generation is based on this reproduction. Eventually, patterns in the population form and fitness increases even further. Fitness function can be changed during the simulation to simulate environmental changes and individual runs can be duplicated to simulate different lineages or [[Speciation (genetic algorithm)|speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants/ | title=Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants: Video games are reshaping how we perform and promote science | author=Morgan, Abbie | publisher=SEED Magazine | date=September 7, 2008 | accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~dubroe/journalism/evolution.pdf | title=Evolution Mutates Beyond Biology | author=Dubrofsky, Elan | publisher=UBC | year=2008 | accessdate=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3DVCE is not only for evolutionary research. Objects can also be spawned for graphics and simulated physics tests. This includes pre-installed blocks, spheres, grenades, and structures that can either be thrown from camera or generated at a spawning point. Artificial gravity can also be manipulated. Random and archived creatures can also be re-spawned to manipulate or view. Lee Graham has also included a [[TARDIS]] in the simulation, which when moved into can teleport the camera back to the original spawning point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.openviv.com/video/07AU7p_cytQ/blue-strand-evolved-virtual-creature | title=Blue Strand: Evolved Virtual Creatures | publisher=Penviv | accessdate=April 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creatures==
[[Image:Evolved Virtual Creature (Rolling Ribbon).png|thumb | right | 300px | An example of a Rolling Ribbon creature on a flat terrain]]
[[Convergent evolution]] occurs often in 3DVCE, as similar structures and behaviors of the creatures form to maximize fitness. Two-Armed Jumpers consist of a small core and two large symmetrical "wings", and evolve in response to jumping and distance requirement. These creatures propel themselves forward using their limbs by jiggling or flapping them. Jumping Ribbons and Springs consist of a chain of segments and evolve in response to max height and distance. They contract or curl up and stretch out their body to leap into the air. Rolling Ribbons and Springs are very similar to the previous group, except they are often larger and segments are more repetitive. They evolve in response to average height, distance, and TOG (touching the ground). They roll on the ground to propel their head into the air to attain height while still touching the ground. Some simply roll in a horizontal fashion like a cylinder. Single-Joint Powered Creatures have more erratic structures and evolve in response to distance on bumpy terrain. They have one large segment in back which kicks the creature forward, but being poorly balanced they use the rest of their bodies to get back up after stumbling or prevent stumbles altogether.

Many other types of creatures also form that do not necessarily fit the four main groups previously described by Lee Graham. Tall stick-like creatures also evolve to attain maximum height. Some users have been able to fix the water simulator to evolve creatures that swim. Many other creatures evolve that share traits of multiple groups. There are currently over 220 creatures archived on the main website, which can be found on YouTube by visiting the "Creature Mann" channel.

An '''agent-based model''' ('''ABM''') is a class of [[computational models]] for [[computer simulation|simulating]] the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. It combines elements of [[game theory]], [[complex systems]], [[emergence]], [[computational sociology]], [[multi-agent system]]s, and [[evolutionary programming]]. [[Monte Carlo method]]s are used to introduce randomness.  Particularly within ecology, ABMs are also called '''individual-based models''' ('''IBMs'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grimm |first1=Volker |first2=Steven F. |last2=Railsback |title=Individual-based Modeling and Ecology |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2005 |pages=485 |isbn=978-0-691-09666-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals within IBMs may be simpler than fully autonomous agents within ABMs. A review of recent literature on individual-based models, agent-based models, and multiagent systems shows that ABMs are used on non-computing related scientific domains including [[biology]], ecology and [[social science]].&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |year=2011 |title=Agent-based Computing from Multi-agent Systems to Agent-Based Models: A Visual Survey |journal=Scientometrics |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=479–499 |doi=10.1007/s11192-011-0468-9 |url=http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012005027/http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes|arxiv=1708.05872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agent-based modeling is related to, but distinct from, the concept of '''[[multi-agent system]]s''' or '''multi-agent simulation''' in that the goal of ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in designing agents or solving specific practical or engineering problems.&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"/&gt;

Agent-based models are a kind of [[Microscale and macroscale models|microscale model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Leif |last1=Gustafsson |first2=Mikael |last2=Sternad |year=2010 |title=Consistent micro, macro, and state-based population modelling |journal=Mathematical Biosciences |volume=225 |issue=2 |pages=94–107 |doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2010.02.003 |pmid=20171974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena. The process is one of [[emergence]] from the lower (micro) level of systems to a higher (macro) level. As such, a key notion is that simple behavioral rules generate complex behavior. This principle, known as [[KISS principle|K.I.S.S.]] ("Keep it simple, stupid"), is extensively adopted in the modeling community. Another central tenet is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  Individual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |title=Agent-Based Models of Industrial Ecosystems |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |date=October 6, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720041914/http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. ABM agents may experience "learning", adaptation, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/suppl_3/7280 |title=Agent-based modeling: Methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |pages=7280–7 |date=May 14, 2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598 |last1=Bonabeau |first1=E. |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agent-based models are composed of: (1) numerous agents specified at various scales (typically referred to as agent-granularity); (2) decision-making heuristics; (3) learning rules or adaptive processes; (4) an interaction topology; and (5) an environment. ABMs are typically implemented as [[computer simulation]]s, either as custom software, or via ABM toolkits, and this software can be then used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the system's emerging overall behavior.

==History==
The idea of agent-based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940s. Since it requires computation-intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until the 1990s.

===Early developments===
The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproduction. The device [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then built upon by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up—creating the first of the devices later termed [[cellular automata]].
Another advance was introduced by the mathematician [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].  He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by tremendously simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

===1970s and 1980s: the first models===

One of the earliest agent-based models in concept was [[Thomas Schelling]]'s segregation model,&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schelling |first=Thomas C. |title=Dynamic Models of Segregation |year=1971 |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=143–186 |url=http://zolaist.org/wiki/images/c/cf/Models_of_Segregation.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1080/0022250x.1971.9989794}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discussed in his paper "Dynamic Models of Segregation" in 1971.  Though Schelling originally used coins and graph paper rather than computers, his models embodied the basic concept of agent-based models as autonomous agents interacting in a shared environment with an observed aggregate, emergent outcome.

In the early 1980s, [[Robert Axelrod]] hosted a tournament of [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] strategies and had them interact in an agent-based manner to determine a winner.  Axelrod would go on to develop many other agent-based models in the field of political science that examine phenomena from [[ethnocentrism]] to the dissemination of culture.&lt;ref name="Axelrod_1997"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Axelrod |given=Robert |authorlink=Robert Axelrod |year=1997 |title=The Complexity of Cooperation: Agent-Based Models of Competition and Collaboration |publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01567-5 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the late 1980s, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]' work on [[flocking behavior|flocking]] models contributed to the development of some of the first biological agent-based models that contained social characteristics. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

The first use of the word "agent" and a definition as it is currently used today is hard to track down.  One candidate appears to be [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] and John H. Miller's 1991 paper "Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory",&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |first1=J.H. |last2=Miller |first2=J.H. |title=Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory |year=1991 |journal=American Economic Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=365–71 |url=http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027152415/http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-27 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an earlier conference presentation of theirs.

At the same time, during the 1980s, social scientists, mathematicians, operations researchers, and a scattering of people from other disciplines developed Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT).  This field grew as a special interest group of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) and its sister society, the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA).

===1990s: expansion===
With the appearance of StarLogo in 1990, [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] and [[NetLogo]] in the mid-1990s and [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] and [[AnyLogic]] in 2000, or GAMA&lt;ref&gt;[http://gama-platform.org/ GAMA]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 as well as some custom-designed code, modelling software became widely available and the range of domains that ABM was applied to, grew.  Bonabeau (2002) is a good survey of the potential of agent-based modeling as of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bonabeau |first=Eric |title=Agent-based modeling: methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=7280–7287 |year=2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s were especially notable for the expansion of ABM within the social sciences, one notable effort was the large-scale ABM, [[Sugarscape]], developed by
[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joshua M. |last1=Epstein |authorlink1=Joshua M. Epstein |first2=Robert |last2=Axtell |authorlink2=Robert Axtell |title=Growing artificial societies: social science from the bottom up |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |date=October 11, 1996 |pages=224 |isbn=978-0-262-55025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable 1990s developments included [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Kathleen Carley]] ABM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/construct/index.php |title=Construct |publisher=Computational Analysis of Social Organizational Systems |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the co-evolution of social networks and culture.
During this 1990s timeframe [[Nigel Gilbert]] published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist (1999) and established a journal from the perspective of social sciences: the ''[[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]]'' (JASSS). Other than JASSS, agent-based models of any discipline are within scope of SpringerOpen journal ''[[Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling]]'' (CASM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casmodeling.com Springer Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling Journal (CASM)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the mid-1990s, the social sciences thread of ABM began to focus on such issues as designing effective teams, understanding the communication required for organizational effectiveness, and the behavior of social networks.  CMOT—later renamed Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)—incorporated more and more agent-based modeling.  Samuelson (2000) is a good brief overview of the early history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Designing Organizations |journal=OR/MS Today |date=December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Samuelson (2005) and Samuelson and Macal (2006) trace the more recent developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Agents of Change |journal=OR/MS Today |date=February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.orms-today.org/orms-8-06/fragent.html |last1=Samuelson |first1=Douglas A. |last2=Macal |first2=Charles M. |title=Agent-Based Modeling Comes of Age |journal=OR/MS Today |date=August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the merger of TIMS and ORSA to form [[INFORMS]], and the move by INFORMS from two meetings each year to one, helped to spur the CMOT group to form a separate society, the North American Association for Computational Social and Organizational Sciences (NAACSOS).  Kathleen Carley was a major contributor, especially to models of social networks, obtaining [[National Science Foundation]] funding for the annual conference and serving as the first President of NAACSOS.  She was succeeded by David Sallach of the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]], and then by Michael Prietula&lt;ref&gt;[http://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/academic_areas/isom/prietula_michael.html Michael Prietula]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Emory University]]. At about the same time NAACSOS began, the [[European Social Simulation Association]] (ESSA) and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-Based Approach in Social Systems Science (PAAA), counterparts of NAACSOS, were organized.  As of 2013, these three organizations collaborate internationally.  The First World Congress on Social Simulation was held under their joint sponsorship in Kyoto, Japan, in August 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The Second World Congress was held in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., in July 2008, with [[George Mason University]] taking the lead role in local arrangements.

===2000s and later===

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sun |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Sun |title=Cognition and Multi-Agent Interaction: From Cognitive Modeling to Social Simulation |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0-521-83964-5 |isbn=978-0-521-83964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill McKelvey, Suzanne Lohmann, Dario Nardi, Dwight Read and others at [[UCLA]] have also made significant contributions in organizational behavior and decision-making.  Since 2001, UCLA has arranged a conference at Lake Arrowhead, California, that has become another major gathering point for practitioners in this field.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 2014, Sadegh Asgari from [[Columbia University]] and his colleagues developed an agent-based model of the construction competitive bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Developing a Virtual Laboratory for Construction Bidding Environment Using Agent-Based Modeling |journal=Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering |date=2014-10-06 |pages=04014105 |volume=29 |issue=6 |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000440 |first=R. |last=Awwad |first2=S. |last2=Asgari |first3=A. |last3=Kandil}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his model was used to analyze the low-bid lump-sum construction bids, it could be applied to other bidding methods with little modifications to the model.

==Theory==
Most computational modeling research describes systems in [[Steady state|equilibrium]] or as moving between equilibria. Agent-based modeling, however, using simple rules, can result in different sorts of complex and interesting behavior.  The three ideas central to agent-based models are agents as objects, [[emergence]], and [[complexity]].

Agent-based models consist of dynamically interacting rule-based agents. The systems within which they interact can create real-world-like complexity.  Typically agents are
[[situated]] in space and time and reside in networks or in lattice-like neighborhoods. The location of the agents and their responsive behavior are encoded in [[algorithm]]ic form in computer programs.  In some cases, though not always, the agents may be considered as intelligent and purposeful.  In ecological ABM (often referred to as "individual-based models" in ecology), agents may, for example, be trees in forest, and would not be considered intelligent, although they may be "purposeful" in the sense of optimizing access to a resource (such as water).
The modeling process is best described as [[inductive reasoning|inductive]]. The modeler makes those assumptions thought most relevant to the situation at hand and then watches phenomena emerge from the agents' interactions. Sometimes that result is an equilibrium. Sometimes it is an emergent pattern. Sometimes, however, it is an unintelligible mangle.

In some ways, agent-based models complement traditional analytic methods. Where analytic methods enable humans to characterize the equilibria of a system, agent-based models allow the possibility of generating those equilibria. This generative contribution may be the most mainstream of the potential benefits of agent-based modeling. Agent-based models can explain the emergence of higher-order patterns—network structures of terrorist organizations and the Internet, [[power-law distributions]] in the sizes of traffic jams, wars, and stock-market crashes, and social segregation that persists despite populations of tolerant people. Agent-based models also can be used to identify lever points, defined as moments in time in which interventions have extreme consequences, and to distinguish among types of path dependency.

Rather than focusing on stable states, many models consider a system's robustness—the ways that complex systems adapt to internal and external pressures so as to maintain their functionalities. The task of harnessing that complexity requires consideration of the agents themselves—their diversity, connectedness, and level of interactions.

===Framework===
Recent work on the Modeling and simulation of Complex Adaptive Systems has demonstrated the need for combining agent-based and complex network based models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aditya Kurve |author2=Khashayar Kotobi |author3=George Kesidis |title=An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator |journal=Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling |volume=1 |pages=12 |doi=10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A.

# Complex Network Modeling Level for developing models using interaction data of various system components.
# Exploratory Agent-based Modeling Level for developing agent-based models for assessing the feasibility of further research. This can e.g. be useful for developing proof-of-concept models such as for funding applications without requiring an extensive learning curve for the researchers.
# Descriptive Agent-based Modeling (DREAM) for developing descriptions of agent-based models by means of using templates and complex network-based models. Building DREAM models allows model comparison across scientific disciplines.

===Organizational ABM: agent-directed simulation===

The agent-directed simulation (ADS) metaphor distinguishes between two categories, namely "Systems for Agents" and "Agents for Systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~yilmaz/ADS.html |title=Agent-Directed Simulation |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems for Agents (sometimes referred to as agents systems) are systems implementing agents for the use in engineering, human and social dynamics, military applications, and others. Agents for Systems are divided in two subcategories. Agent-supported systems deal with the use of agents as a support facility to enable computer assistance in problem solving or enhancing cognitive capabilities. Agent-based systems focus on the use of agents for the generation of model behavior in a system evaluation (system studies and analyses).

==Implementation==

Many agent-based modeling software are designed for serial [[Von Neumann architecture|von-Neumann computer architectures]]. This limits the speed and scalability of these systems. A recent development is the use of data-parallel algorithms on Graphics Processing Units [[GPU]]s for ABM simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Isaac Rudomin |url=https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |title=Large Crowds in the GPU |year=2006 |publisher=[[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] |accessdate=|display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111054342/https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |archivedate=January 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roshan M. |last=D'Souza |url=http://www.me.mtu.edu/~rmdsouza/ABM_GPU.html |title=Mega-Scale Interactive Agent-Based Model Simulations on the GPU |publisher=[[Michigan Technological University]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul |last1=Richmond |first2=Daniela M. |last2=Romano |url=http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090115220835/http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 15, 2009 |format=PDF |title=Agent Based GPU, a Real-time 3D Simulation and Interactive Visualisation Framework for Massive Agent Based Modelling on the GPU |journal=Proceedings International Workshop on Super Visualisation (IWSV08) |year=2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme memory bandwidth combined with the sheer number crunching power of multi-processor GPUs has enabled simulation of millions of agents at tens of frames per second.

==Verification and validation==
[[Verification and validation]] (V&amp;V) of simulation models is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Sargent |first1=R.

As an example of V&amp;V technique, consider VOMAS (virtual overlay multi-agent system),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |first3=Mario |last3=Kolberg |title=Verification and Validation of Agent-Based Simulations using the VOMAS approach |journal=Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems and Simulation '09 (MASS '09), as Part of MALLOW 09, Sep 7–11, 2009, Torino, Italy |url=http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614052017/http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a software engineering based approach, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system is developed alongside the agent-based model. The agents in the multi-agent system are able to gather data by generation of logs as well as provide run-time validation and verification support by watch agents and also agents to check any violation of invariants at run-time. These are set by the Simulation Specialist with help from the SME ([[subject-matter expert]]). Muazi et al. also provide an example of using VOMAS for verification and validation of a forest fire simulation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Qasim |last2=Siddique |first3=Amir |last3=Hussain |first4=Mario |last4=Kolberg |title=Verification &amp; Validation of an Agent-Based Forest Fire Simulation Model |journal=Proceedings of the Agent Directed Simulation Symposium 2010, as Part of the ACM SCS Spring Simulation Multiconference |pages=142–149 |date=April 11–15, 2010 |url=http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725083937/http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VOMAS provides a formal way of validation and verification. To develop a VOMAS, one must design VOMAS agents along with the agents in the actual simulation, preferably from the start. In essence, by the time the simulation model is complete, one can essentially consider it to be one model containing two models:
# An agent-based model of the intended system
# An agent-based model of the VOMAS

Unlike all previous work on verification and validation, VOMAS agents ensure that the simulations are validated in-simulation i.e. even during execution. In case of any exceptional situations, which are programmed on the directive of the Simulation Specialist (SS), the VOMAS agents can report them. In addition, the VOMAS agents can be used to log key events for the sake of debugging and subsequent analysis of simulations. In other words, VOMAS allows for a flexible use of any given technique for the sake of verification and validation of an agent-based model in any domain.

Details of validated agent-based modeling using VOMAS along with several case studies are given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A. K. |last=Niazi |title=Towards A Novel Unified Framework for Developing Formal, Network and Validated Agent-Based Simulation Models of Complex Adaptive Systems |date=June 11, 2011 |publisher=[[University of Stirling]]|hdl=1893/3365 }} PhD Thesis&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis also gives details of "exploratory agent-based modeling", "descriptive agent-based modeling" and "validated agent-based modeling", using several worked case study examples.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L. White-box model" /&gt;

'''Animat''' (''third-person indicative present of the [[Latin]] verb '''animō'''''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbix.com/webverbix/go.php?D1=9&amp;H1=109&amp;T1=animo "Animo" at Verbix Latin Verb Conjugator]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning to "animate, give or bring life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/animo "Animo" at Latdict Latin Dictionary and Grammar Resources]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animats''' are artificial [[animal]]s, a contraction of [[animal]]-materials. The term includes physical robots and virtual simulations.  Animat research, a subset of [[Artificial Life]] studies, has become rather popular since [[Rodney Brooks]]' seminal paper "Intelligence without representation". The word was coined by S.W. Wilson in 1985,
in "Knowledge growth in an artificial animal", published in the first ''Proceedings'' 
''of an International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and Their Applications''.

An example using the Animat model as proposed by Wilson is discussed at some length in chapter 9 of [[Stan Franklin]]'s book, [[Artificial Minds]]. In this implementation, the animat is capable of independent learning about its environment through application and evolution of pattern-matching rules called "taxons".

In 2001 Thomas DeMarse performed studies on '[[neurally controlled animat]]'.  Every two years, the Society of Adaptive Behaviour meets and produces a proceedings on this topic.  They also have a journal, ''[[Adaptive Behavior]]''.

[[Alan H Goldstein]] has proposed that, because [[nanobiotechnology]] is in the process of creating real animal-materials, speculative use of this term should be discouraged and its application become purely phenomenological.  Based on the Animat Test (contained in the reference  "I, Nanobot.") any nonbiological material or entity that exhibits the minimum set of behaviors that define a life form is, de facto, an Animat.  Goldstein's basic premise is that in the age of nanobiotechnology it is necessary to follow the chemistry and molecular engineering rather than watching for the emergence of some pre-conceived minimum level of 'intelligence' such as an artificial neural network capable of adaptive phenomena.   Goldstein has cautioned that there is a serious disconnect between the fields of nanobiotechnology and A-life based on profound differences in scientific training, experimental systems, and the different sets of terminology (jargon) these two fields have produced.  Nanobiotechnologists (really molecular engineers who work with both biological and nonbiological molecules) are generally not concerned with complex systems per se; even when they are building molecular interconnects between such systems, e.g. neuroelectronic splices.  A-Life researchers mainly take a systems-level approach.  The enormous transformative power of novel molecular engineering has the potential to create Animats, true nonbiological life forms, whose relatively simple behavior would not fit into most standard A-Life paradigms.  As a result, Goldstein argues, the first Animats may come into being completely unrecognized by either scientific community.

is a chemical-like system that usually consists of objects, called molecules, that interact according to rules resembling chemical reaction rules. Artificial chemistries are created and studied in order to understand fundamental properties of chemical systems, including prebiotic evolution, as well as for developing chemical computing systems. Artificial chemistry is a field within computer science wherein chemical reactions—often biochemical ones—are computer-simulated, yielding insights on evolution, self-assembly, and other biochemical phenomena. The field does not use actual chemicals, and should not be confused with either synthetic chemistry or computational chemistry. Rather, bits of information are used to represent the starting molecules, and the end products are examined along with the processes that led to them. The field originated in [[artificial life]] but has shown to be a versatile method with applications in many fields such as [[chemistry]], [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[linguistics]].

==Formal definition==
An artificial chemistry is defined in general as a triple (S,R,A). In some cases it is sufficient to define it as a tuple (S,I).

*S is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of possible molecules S={s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...,s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}, where n is the number of elements in the set, possibly infinite.
*R is a set of [[arity|n-ary]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s on the molecules in S, the reaction rules R={r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...,r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}. Each rule r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is written like a chemical reaction a+b+c-&gt;a*+b*+c*. Note here that r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are operators, as opposed to +.
*A is an [[algorithm]] describing how to apply the rules R to a [[subset]] P&lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt;S.
*I are the interaction rules of the molecules in S.

==Types of artificial chemistries==

* depending on the space of possible molecules
** finite
** infinite
* depending on the type of reactions
** catalytic systems
** reactive systems
** inhibitive systems
* depending on the space topology
** well stirred reactor
** topologically arranged (1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional)

==Important concepts==
* The field is heavily reliant on mathematics, to include mathematical modeling. It in fact relies more on a mathematics background than a chemistry background.
* Organizations: An organization is a set of molecules that is closed and self-maintaining. As such, it is a set that does not create anything outside itself, and such that any molecule inside the set can be generated within the set.
* Closed sets
* Self-maintaining sets
* Hasse diagram of organizations

==History of artificial chemistries==

Artificial chemistries emerged as a sub-field of [[artificial life]], in particular from [[strong artificial life]]. The idea behind this field was that if one wanted to build something alive, it had to be done by a combination of non-living entities. For instance, a cell is itself alive, and yet is a combination of non-living molecules. Artificial chemistry enlists, among others, researchers that believe in an extreme bottom-up approach to artificial life. In artificial life, bits of information were used to represent bacteria or members of a species, each of which moved, multiplied, or died in computer simulations. In artificial chemistry  bits of information are used to represent starting molecules capable of reacting with one another. The field has pertained to artificial intelligence by virtue of the fact that, over billions of years, non-living matter evolved into primordial life forms which in turn evolved into intelligent life forms.

==Important contributors==

The first reference about Artificial Chemistries come from a Technical paper written by [[John McCaskill]]
.&lt;ref&gt;J.S.McCaskill. Polymer chemistry on tape: A computational model for emergent genetics. Technical report, MPI for Biophysical Chemistry, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Walter Fontana]] working with [[Leo Buss]] then took up the work developing the [[AlChemy model]]
&lt;ref&gt;W. Fontana. Algorithmic chemistry. In C. G. Langton, C. Taylor, J. D. Farmer, and S. Rasmussen, editors, Artificial Life II, pages 159–210. Westview Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was presented at the second International Conference of Artificial Life.
In his first papers he presented the concept of [[organization]], as a set of molecules that is algebraically closed and self-maintaining.
This concept was further developed by Dittrich and Speroni di Fenizio into a theory of chemical organizations

Two main schools of artificial chemistries have been in Japan and Germany.
In Japan the main researchers have been [[Takashi Ikegami]]

In [[Germany]], it was [[Wolfgang Banzhaf]], who, together with his students [[Peter Dittrich]] and [[Jens Ziegler]], developed various artificial chemistry models.
Their 2001 paper 'Artificial Chemistries - A Review' &lt;ref name="DZB2001" /&gt; became a standard in the field.
[[Jens Ziegler]], as part of his PhD thesis, proved that an artificial chemistry could be used to control a small Khepera robot
.&lt;ref&gt;J.Ziegler and W.Banzhaf. Evolving control metabolisms for a robot. ArtificialLife, 7(2):171–190, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among other models, [[Peter Dittrich]] developed the [[Seceder model]] which is able to explain group formation in society through some simple rules. Since then he became a professor in [[Jena]] where he investigates artificial chemistries as a way to define a general theory of [[constructive dynamical system]]s.

==Applications of artificial chemistries==

Artificial Chemistries are often used in the study of protobiology, in trying to bridge the gap between [[chemistry]] and [[biology]].
A further motivation to study artificial chemistries is the interest in constructive dynamical systems. Yasuhiro Suzuki has modeled various systems such as membrane systems, signaling pathways (P53), ecosystems, and enzyme systems by using his method, abstract rewriting system on multisets (ARMS).

'''Artificial creation''' is a field of research that studies the primary synthesis of complex lifelike structures from primordial lifeless origins.  

The field bears some similarity to [[artificial life]], but unlike artificial life, artificial creation focuses on the primary emergence of complex structures and processes of abiogenesis.  Artificial creation does not rely exclusively on the application of [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to optimize artificial creatures or grow synthetic life forms.  Artificial creation instead studies systems of rules of interaction, initial conditions and  primordial building blocks that can generate complex lifelike structures, based exclusively on repeated application of rules of interaction.
   
An essential difference that distinguishes artificial creation from other related fields is that no explicit [[fitness function]] is used to select for fit structures. Structures exist based only on their ability to persist as entities that do not violate the system's rules of interaction. Artificial creation studies the way in which complex [[emergent properties]] can arise to form a [[self-organizing system]].

==Origins==

Although concepts and elements of artificial creation are represented to some degree in many areas, the field itself is less than a decade old. There are models of self-organizing systems that produce emergent properties in [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[engineering]] and other fields. Artificial creation differs from these in that it focuses on underlying properties of systems that can generate the endless environmentally interactive complexity of living systems.  

One of the primary impetuses for the exploration of artificial creation comes from the realization in the [[artificial life]] and [[evolutionary computing]] fields that some basic assumptions common in these fields represent subtle mischaracterizations of natural [[evolution]].  These fall into two general classes: 1) there are fundamental problems with the use of [[fitness functions]] for the primary synthesis of complex systems, and 2)  the process of [[self-replication]] used in almost all artificial life research is not a fundamental property of [[self-organizing systems]].

==Issues==

The concept of a [[fitness function]] (or [[objective function]]) is central to [[artificial life]] systems. The [[fitness function]] is used to drive a given [[artificial evolution]] process to create [[synthetic organisms]] capable of performing a given task.  However, [[fitness functions]], even aggregate high-level ones, drive evolving systems to particular solutions and place a ceiling on innovation and complexity.  Natural [[evolution]] does not drive organisms toward particular solutions to problems.  There is no motive force for [[evolution]] in our universe beyond that of adherence to physical law.  This is a subtle point: when modern organisms are viewed in a local context it does appear that they are evolving to optimize particular abilities that will help them survive.  This is not the case in a global sense.  In fact, the pressure to optimize a given ability comes from the current state of a given population.  The only fundamental selective pressure is the ability of structures to adhere to physical law.  [[Stochastic]] events initiated the appearance of features that we might view as adaptive traits, and it is the local evolution of these traits that much of evolutionary theory is based upon.  

The universe maintains its own consistency.  However, when trying to model the universe, or create [[artificial organisms]] by mimicking natural evolution, the application of [[fitness functions]] that select for particular abilities force an unnatural bias onto the evolving organisms. 

In [[evolutionary biology]], it is well understood that all properties of organisms and [[ecosystems]] are [[emergent properties]] of fundamental physical law. The conceptual problems related to generations, offspring and populations that occur in [[artificial life]] systems stem from the fact that self-replication is itself an innovation of life on Earth.  The dynamics observed in modern self-replicating life forms on Earth are extremely complex [[emergent properties]] of the organisms themselves, not driving forces imposed by an external controlling entity.

== Overview ==
Artificial life studies the fundamental processes of [[living system]]s in artificial environments in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex information processing that define such systems.  These topics are broad, but often include [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary dynamics]], [[Emergence|emergent properties of collective systems]], [[Biomimetics|biomimicry]], as well as related issues about the [[Philosophy of biology|philosophy of the nature of life]] and the use of lifelike properties in artistic works.

== Philosophy ==

The modeling philosophy of artificial life strongly differs from traditional modeling by studying not only "life-as-we-know-it" but also "life-as-it-might-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Langton, C. G. 1992. [http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf Artificial Life] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311225322/http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf |date=March 11, 2007 }}. Addison-Wesley. ., section 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional model of a biological system will focus on capturing its most important parameters. In contrast, an alife modeling approach will generally seek to decipher the most simple and general principles underlying life and implement them in a simulation. The simulation then offers the possibility to analyse new and different lifelike systems.

Vladimir Georgievich Red'ko proposed to generalize this distinction to the modeling of any process, leading to the more general distinction of "processes-as-we-know-them" and "processes-as-they-could-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Red'ko, V. G. 1999. [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MATHME.html Mathematical Modeling of Evolution]. in: F. Heylighen, C. Joslyn and V. Turchin (editors): Principia Cybernetica Web (Principia Cybernetica, Brussels). For the importance of ALife modeling from a cosmic perspective, see also Vidal, C. 2008.[https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1087 The Future of Scientific Simulations: from Artificial Life to Artificial Cosmogenesis]. In Death And Anti-Death, ed. Charles Tandy, 6: Thirty Years After Kurt Gödel (1906-1978) p. 285-318. Ria University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the commonly accepted [[Life#Definitions|definition of life]] does not consider any current alife simulations or [[software]] to be alive, and they do not constitute part of the evolutionary process of any [[ecosystem]]. However, different opinions about artificial life's potential have arisen:

* The ''strong alife'' (cf. [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Strong AI vs. weak AI|Strong AI]]) position states that "life is a process which can be abstracted away from any particular medium" ([[John von Neumann]]) {{citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=There seems to be no original source for this quote, and in fact if you restrict a web search to pages that don't contain the phrase artificial life, there are only a handful left.}}. Notably, [[Thomas S. Ray|Tom Ray]] declared that his program [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] is not simulating life in a computer but synthesizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=Thomas|authorlink1=Thomas S. Ray|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=C. C.|editor2-last=Farmer|editor2-first=J. D.|editor3-last=Rasmussen|editor3-first=S|title=An approach to the synthesis of life|journal=Artificial Life II, Santa Fe Institute Studies in the Sciences of Complexity|date=1991|volume=XI|pages=371–408|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/alife2/tierra.tex|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Redwood City, CA|language=English|quote=The intent of this work is to synthesize rather than simulate life.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711051305/http://life.ou.edu/pubs/alife2/tierra.tex|archivedate=2015-07-11|accessdate=24 January 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''weak alife'' position denies the possibility of generating a "living process" outside of a chemical solution. Its researchers try instead to simulate life processes to understand the underlying mechanics of biological phenomena.

=== Techniques ===
*[[cellular automaton|Cellular automata]] were used in the early days of artificial life, and are still often used for ease of [[scalability]] and [[parallelization]].  Alife and cellular automata share a closely tied history.
*[[Artificial neural network]]s are sometimes used to model the brain of an agent.  Although traditionally more of an [[artificial intelligence]] technique, neural nets can be important for simulating [[population dynamics]] of organisms that can ''learn''.  The symbiosis between learning and evolution is central to theories about the development of instincts in organisms with higher neurological complexity, as in, for instance, the [[Baldwin effect]].

====Program-based====
{{Further|programming game}}
Program-based simulations contain organisms with a complex DNA language, usually [[Turing complete]].  This language is more often in the form of a computer program than actual biological DNA.  Assembly derivatives are the most common languages used. An organism "lives" when its code is executed, and there are usually various methods allowing [[self-replication]]. Mutations are generally implemented as random changes to the code. Use of [[cellular automata]] is common but not required. Another example could be an [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent system/program]].

====Module-based====
Individual modules are added to a creature.  These modules modify the creature's behaviors and characteristics either directly, by hard coding into the simulation (leg type A increases speed and metabolism), or indirectly, through the emergent interactions between a creature's modules (leg type A moves up and down with a frequency of X, which interacts with other legs to create motion).  Generally these are simulators which emphasize user creation and accessibility over mutation and evolution.

====Parameter-based====
Organisms are generally constructed with pre-defined and fixed behaviors that are controlled by various parameters that mutate.  That is, each organism contains a collection of numbers or other ''finite'' parameters. Each parameter controls one or several aspects of an organism in a well-defined way.

====Neural net–based====
These simulations have creatures that learn and grow using neural nets or a close derivative.  Emphasis is often, although not always, more on learning than on natural selection.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers  use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L. White-box model" /&gt;

Biochemical-based life is studied in the field of [[synthetic biology]]. It involves e.g. the creation of [[synthetic DNA]]. The term "wet" is an extension of the term "[[wetware (brain)|wetware]]".

'''Artificial Life''' is a free and [[Open-source software|open source]]d [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Software framework|framework]] created to simulate [[Life]]. It is a multi-agents framework where each agent runs its own Thread.

The agents are split into two different categories: the services and the processes. The services deliver services to other agents and the processes execute specific tasks.

The agents are organized in a [[tree structure]] called Instance. Within an Instance, the services and the processes are grouped together and unlimited groups can be defined. Each node of the Instance tree can have a collection of views used to monitor the activity of the node or interact with the node. The definition of Java classes used within the Instance (i.e. processes, services or views) is defined in the Instance Model.

In order to avoid dead locking, [[Artificial life|Artificial Life]] implements a messaging system, a method invocation mechanism based on the messaging system and an event mechanism also based on the messaging system.

'''Biological organization''' is the [[hierarchy]] of [[complex systems|complex]] [[biology|biological]] [[structures]] and [[systems]] that define [[life]] using a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] approach.&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|Berg|Martin|2002|pp=9&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional hierarchy, as detailed below, extends from [[atom]]s to [[biosphere]]s. The higher levels of this scheme are often referred to as an '''ecological organization''' concept, or as the [[Branches of science|field]],  [[#Fundamentals|hierarchical ecology]].

Each level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational [[wikt:complexity|complexity]], with each "object" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle behind the organization is the concept of ''[[emergence]]''—the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and irrelevant at the lower levels.

The biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas of [[scientific research]], particularly in the [[Medicine|medical sciences]]. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more difficult—and likely impossible—to apply the study of the effects of various [[physical phenomenon|physical]] and [[chemical phenomenon|chemical]] phenomena to [[diseases]] and [[physiology]] (body function). For example, fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] could not exist if the brain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of [[pharmacology]] could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular level can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the [[ecological]] levels as well. For example, [[DDT]]'s direct [[insecticide|insecticidal]] effect occurs at the [[subcellular]] level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple [[ecosystem]]s. Theoretically, a change in one [[atom]] could change the entire [[biosphere]].

==Levels==
[[File:Levels of Organization.svg|thumb|The simplest unit of life is the atom, like oxygen. Two or more atoms is a molecule, like a dioxide. Many small molecules may combine in a chemical reaction to make up a macromolecule, such as a phospholipid. Multiple macromolecules form a cell, like a club cell. A group of cells functioning together as a tissue, for example, Epithelial tissue. Different tissues make up an organ, like a lung. Organs work together to form an organ system, such as the Respiratory System. All of the organ systems make a living organism, like a lion. A group of the same organism living together in an area is a population, such as a pride of lions. Two or more populations interacting with each other form a community, for example, lion and zebra populations interacting with each other.  Communities interacting not only with each other but also with the physical environment encompass an ecosystem, such as the Savanna ecosystem. All of the ecosystems make up the biosphere, the area of life on Earth.]]
The simple standard biological organization scheme, from the lowest level to the highest level, is as follows:&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"/&gt;

|}

More complex schemes incorporate many more levels. For example, a molecule can be viewed as a grouping of [[chemical element|elements]], and an atom can be further divided into [[subatomic particle]]s (these levels are outside the scope of biological organization). Each level can also be broken down into its own hierarchy, and specific types of these biological objects can have their own hierarchical scheme. For example, [[genome]]s can be further subdivided into a hierarchy of [[gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level in the hierarchy can be described by its lower levels. For example, the organism may be described at any of its component levels, including the atomic, molecular, cellular, histological (tissue), organ and organ system levels. Furthermore, at every level of the hierarchy, new functions necessary for the control of life appear. These new roles are not functions that the lower level components are capable of and are thus referred to as ''[[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]]''.

Every organism is organised, though not necessarily to the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postlethwait|Hopson|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism can not be organised at the [[histological]] (tissue) level if it is not composed of tissues in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witzany | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Biological Self-organization | url = | journal = International Journal of Signs and Semiotic Systems | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Empirically, a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organization|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

A simpler and more direct way to explain the fundamentals of the "hierarchical organization of life", was introduced in [[Ecology]] by [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]] and others as the "[[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s hierarchical principle";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1969|pp=192–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon&lt;ref&gt;Simon's texts at {{doi|10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_4}}, [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705161014/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html |date=July 5, 2015 }} or [http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ johncarlosbaez/2011/08/29 transcriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531145800/https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ |date=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that hierarchy "''emerges almost inevitably through a wide variety of evolutionary processes, for the simple reason that &lt;u&gt;hierarchical structures are stable&lt;/u&gt;''".

To motivate this deep idea, he offered his "parable" about imaginary watchmakers.

:{|
!Parable of the Watchmakers
|-
|
There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently; new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch (for instance, to answer the phone), it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.

Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten components each. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly. Finally, ten of the larger subassemblies constituted the whole watch. Each subassembly could be put down without falling apart.

[[File:Carbone lewis.svg|thumb|100px|The [[Lewis structure]] of a [[carbon]] atom, showing its four [[valence electrons]]]]

[[Carbon]] is a key component of all known [[life]] on [[Earth]], representing approximately 45-50% of all dry biomass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/forestry/17111/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Complex [[molecule]]s are made up of [[carbon]] [[chemical bond|bonded]] with other [[chemical element|elements]], especially [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] and frequently also with [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]]. Carbon is abundant on Earth. It is also lightweight and relatively small in size, making it easier for enzymes to manipulate carbon molecules.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is frequently assumed in [[astrobiology]] that if life exists elsewhere in the [[universe]], it will also be carbon-based.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: An Interview With Dr. Farid Salama |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2000 |work=Astrobiology magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620075201/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |archivedate=2008-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics refer to this assumption as [[carbon chauvinism]].&lt;ref name =darling&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/carbon-based_life.html |title=Carbon-based life |accessdate=14 September 2007 |first=David|last=Darling |publisher=Encyclopedia of Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Carbon forms a vast number of [[chemical compound|compounds]], more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date,&lt;ref name=lanl&gt;"There are close to ten million known carbon compounds, many thousands of which are vital to organic and life processes." {{cite web|author=Chemistry Operations|date=December 15, 2003|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html|title=Carbon|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913063402/http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html |archivedate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the "king of the elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deming |first=Anna |date=2010 |title=King of the elements? |journal=Nanotechnology |volume=21 |issue=30 |pages=300201 |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/21/30/300201 |pmid=20664156 |bibcode=2010Nanot..21D0201D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon is the 15th [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|most abundant element in the Earth's crust]], and the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass]] after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[oxygen]]. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of [[organic compound]]s, and its unusual ability to form [[polymer]]s at the temperatures commonly encountered on [[Earth]] enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the [[human body]] by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology|last=Reece|first=Jane B.|date=31 October 2013|publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]]|isbn=9780321775658|edition=10|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What we normally think of as 'life' is based on chains of carbon atoms, with a few other atoms, such as nitrogen or phosphorus", per [[Stephen Hawking]] in a 2008 lecture, "carbon [...] has the richest chemistry." &lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stephen Hawking|title=Life in the Universe, 50th anniversary celebration of NASA|url=http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2011/05/stephen-hawking-on-non-carbon-based-alien-life.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most important characteristics of carbon as a basis for the [[chemistry]] of life are, that it has four valence bonds, and that the energy required to make or break a bond is at an appropriate level for building molecules, which are stable and reactive.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms; this allows the building of arbitrarily long complex molecules and [[polymers]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Other candidates==
There are not many other elements which even appear to be promising candidates for supporting life, for example, processes such as [[metabolism]]. The most frequently suggested alternative is [[silicon]].&lt;ref name="Pace"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pace | first1 = NR | title = The universal nature of biochemistry. | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/805.full.pdf | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 805–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11158550 | pmc = 33372 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 | bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon is in the same group in the [[Periodic Table]] of [[chemical element|elements]], and has four [[valence bond theory|valence bonds]], and bonds to itself, generally in the form of [[crystal lattice]]s rather than long chains.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} It is considerably more electropositive than carbon. Silicon compounds do not readily [[Recombination_(chemistry)|recombine]] into different permutations in a manner that would plausibly support lifelike processes.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Key  molecules ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
The most notable groups of chemicals used in the processes of living organisms include:

* [[Protein]]s, which are the building blocks from which the structures of living organisms are constructed (this includes almost all [[enzyme]]s, which [[catalyst|catalyse]] organic chemical reactions)
* [[Nucleic acid]]s, which carry [[Genetics|genetic]] information
* [[Carbohydrate]]s, which store energy in a form that can be used by living [[cell (biology)|cells]]
* [[Lipid]]s, which also store energy, but in a more concentrated form, and which may be stored for extended periods in the bodies of animals

==Fiction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Silicon has been a theme of non-carbon-based-life since it is somewhat similar to carbon in its chemical characteristics.  
In cinematic and literary [[science fiction]], when man-made machines cross from non-living to living, this new form would be an example of non-carbon-based life. Since the advent of the [[microprocessor]] in the late 1960s, these machines are often classed as "silicon-based life". Another example of "silicon-based life" is the episode "The Devil in the Dark" from [[Star Trek: The Original Series]], in which a living rock creature's biochemistry is based on silicon. Also in The X-Files episode "Firewalker" where silicon based organism was discovered in a volcano.

In the [[2010_(film)|movie adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's "2010" (1984)]] a character argues, "Whether we are based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference; we should each be treated with appropriate respect"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010: Quotes|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002895/quotes|website=IMDb|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This quote may be the basis of [[Steve Jobs]]'s quip when he introduced [[Carbon (API)|Carbon within MacOS X]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWDC '98|url=http://www.noteskey.com/events/1998_05.html|website=NotesKey|date = May 11, 1998|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "Carbon. All life forms will be based on it."

[[Image:Chirality with hands.svg|200px|thumb|Two enantiomers of a generic [[amino acid]] that is '''chiral''']]

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|iː}} is a property of [[asymmetry]] important in several branches of science. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|χειρ}} (''kheir''), "hand," a familiar chiral object.

An object or a system is ''chiral'' if it is distinguishable from its [[mirror image]]; that is, it cannot be [[wikt:superposed|superposed]] onto it.  Conversely, a mirror image of an ''achiral'' object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object. A chiral object and its mirror image are called ''enantiomorphs'' (Greek, "opposite forms") or, when referring to molecules, ''[[enantiomers]]''. A non-chiral object is called ''achiral'' (sometimes also ''amphichiral'') and can be superposed on its mirror image. If the object is non-chiral and is imagined as being colored blue and its mirror image is imagined as colored yellow, then by a series of rotations and translations the two can be superposed, producing green, with none of the original colors remaining.

The term was first used by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] in 1893 in the second [[Robert Boyle Lecture]] at the [[Oxford University Junior Scientific Club]] which was published in 1894:

{{quote|I call any geometrical figure, or group of points, 'chiral', and say that it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Molecular Tactics of a Crystal |author=Sir William Thomson Lord Kelvin | year=1894 | publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] | url=https://archive.org/details/moleculartactic00kelvgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human [[hand]]s are perhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes.&lt;ref name="OCATUA"&gt;Georges Henry Wagnière, ''On Chirality and the Universal Asymmetry: Reflections on Image and Mirror Image'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand. In mathematics, ''chirality'' is the property of a figure that is not identical to its mirror image.

{{main|Chirality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone.  For example, a right shoe is different from a left shoe, and clockwise is different from anticlockwise. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition.

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called achiral or amphichiral.

The [[helix]] (and by extension a spun string, a screw, a propeller, etc.) and [[Möbius strip]] are chiral two-dimensional objects in three-dimensional ambient space. The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space.

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves, glasses (where two lenses differ in prescription), and shoes. A similar notion of chirality is considered in [[knot theory]], as explained below.

Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the [[right-hand rule]].

===Geometry===
In [[geometry]] a figure is achiral if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry.
In two dimensions, every figure that possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry.
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[plane of symmetry]] or a center of symmetry is achiral. There are, however, achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry.
In terms of [[point groups]], all chiral figures lack an improper axis of rotation (S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). This means that they cannot contain a center of inversion (i) or a mirror plane (σ). Only figures with a point group designation of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, T, O, or I can be chiral.

===Knot theory===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called chiral. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

{{main|Chirality (physics)}}

In physics, chirality may be found in the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a particle, where the handedness of the object is determined by the direction in which the particle spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/nov/lookingfortherig591|title=Looking for the Right Hand - DiscoverMagazine.com|author=|date=|website=discovermagazine.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicity]], which is the projection of the spin along the linear momentum of a subatomic particle, chirality is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon like spin. Although both can have left-handed or right-handed properties, only in the massless case do they have a simple relation.&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/06/19/helicity-chirality-mass-and-the-higgs/|title=Quantum Diaries|author=|date=|website=www.quantumdiaries.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for a massless particle the helicity is the same as the chirality while for an antiparticle they have opposite sign.

The ''handedness'' in both chirality and helicity relate to the rotation of a particle while it proceeds in linear motion with reference to the human hands. The thumb of the hand points towards the direction of linear motion whilst the fingers curl into the palm, representing the direction of rotation of the particle (i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise). Depending on the linear and rotational motion, the particle can either be defined by left-handedness (ex. translating leftwards and rotating counterclockwise) or right-handedness (ex. translating in the right direction and rotating clockwise).&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"/&gt; A symmetry transformation between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Invariance under parity by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called ''chiral symmetry''.

===Electromagnetism===

{{main|Chirality (electromagnetism)}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic]] wave [[Wave propagation|propagation]] as [[handedness]] is wave [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and described in terms of [[Circular dichroism|helicity]] (occurs as a helix). Polarization of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is the property that describes the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], i.e., the [[periodic function|time-varying]], direction ([[Euclidean vector|vector]]), and [[amplitude]] of the [[electric field]] vector. For a depiction, see the adjacent image.

A ''chiral molecule'' is a type of [[molecule]] that has a non-superposable [[mirror image]]. The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon atom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y.

The term "chiral" in general is used to describe the object that is non-superposable on its mirror image.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called [[enantiomer]]s or optical [[isomer]]s. Pairs of enantiomers are often designated as "[[right-handed|right-]]", "left-handed" or if it has no bias achiral. As polarized light passes through a chiral molecule, the plane of polarization, when viewed along the axis toward the source, will be rotated in a clockwise (to the right) or anticlockwise (to the left). A right handed rotation is dextrorotary (d); that to the left is levorotary (l). The d- and l-isomers are the same compound but are called [[enantiomers]]. An equimolar mixture of the two optical isomers will produce no net rotation of polarized light as it passes through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Raymond|title=Chemistry|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-394-32983-X|page=660|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left handed molecules have l- prefixed to their names; d- is prefixed to right handed molecules.

Molecular chirality is of interest because of its application to [[stereochemistry]] in [[inorganic chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[supramolecular chemistry]].

More recent developments in chiral chemistry include the development of chiral inorganic nanoparticles that may have the similar tetrahedral geometry as chiral centers associated with sp3 carbon atoms traditionally associated with chiral compounds, but at larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moloney|first=Mícheál P.|last2=Gun'ko|first2=Yurii K.|last3=Kelly|first3=John M.|date=2007-09-26|title=Chiral highly luminescent CdS quantum dots|url=https://doi.org/10.1039/b704636g|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|volume=0|issue=38|doi=10.1039/b704636g|issn=1364-548X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaaff|first=T.

==Biology==
{{See also|Homochirality}}

All of the known life-forms show specific chiral properties in chemical structures as well as macroscopic anatomy, development and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Wende|last2=Ernst|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Palotas|first3=Krisztian|last4=Zhang|first4=Yuyang|last5=Bruyer|first5=Emilie|last6=Peng|first6=Lingqing|last7=Greber|first7=Thomas|last8=Hofer|first8=Werner A.|last9=Scott|first9=Lawrence T.|date=2016-02-08|title=Microscopic origin of chiral shape induction in achiral crystals|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2449|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=En|volume=8|issue=4|pages=326–330|doi=10.1038/nchem.2449|issn=1755-4330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any specific organism or evolutionarily related set thereof, individual compounds, organs, or behavior are found in the same single enantiomorphic form. Deviation (having the opposite form) could be found in a small number of chemical compounds, or certain organ or behavior but that variation strictly depends upon the genetic make up of the organism. From chemical level (molecular scale), biological systems show extreme stereospecificity in synthesis, uptake, sensing, metabolic processing. A living system usually deals with two enantiomers of same compound in a drastically different way.

In biology, homochirality is a common property of [[Amino acid#Isomerism|amino acids]] and [[Monosaccharide#Open-chain stereoisomers|carbohydrates]]. The chiral [[Proteinogenic amino acid|protein-making amino acids]], which are translated through the ribosome from genetic coding, occur in the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; form. However, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are also found in nature. The monosaccharides (carbohydrate-units) are commonly found in &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-configuration. DNA double helix is chiral (as any kind of [[Helix#Types|helix]] is chiral), and [[B-DNA|B-form of DNA]] shows a right-handed turn.

Macroscopic example of Chirality is found in plant kingdom, animal kingdom and all other groups of organism. A simple example is the coiling direction of any climber plants. It may be one of two possible type of helix.

In anatomy, chirality is found in the imperfect mirror image symmetry of many kinds of animal bodies. Organisms such as [[gastropod]]s exhibit chirality in their coiled shells, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance. Over 90% of gastropod species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schilthuizen | first1 = M. | last2 = Davison | first2 = A. | year = 2005 | title = The convoluted evolution of snail chirality | url = | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | volume = 92 | issue = 11| pages = 504–515 | doi =  10.1007/s00114-05-0045-2| bibcode = 2005NW.....92..504S }}&lt;/ref&gt; have ''dextral'' (right-handed) shells in their coiling, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always ''sinistral'' (left-handed). A very few species (for example ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm|title=Amphidromus perversus (Linnaeus, 1758)|author=|date=|website=www.jaxshells.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) show an equal mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals.

In humans, chirality (also referred to as ''handedness'' or ''laterality'') is an attribute of humans defined by their unequal distribution of [[fine motor skill]] between the left and right [[hands]]. An individual who is more [[Dexterity|dexterous]] with the right hand is called ''[[right-handed]]'', and one who is more skilled with the left is said to be ''[[left-handed]]''. Chirality is also seen in the study of [[facial asymmetry]].

In flatfish, the [[Summer flounder]] or fluke are left-eyed, while [[halibut]] are right-eyed.

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|i}} is a geometric property of some molecules and ions.  A chiral molecule/ion is non-superposable on its [[mirror image]]. The presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon center]] is one of several structural features that induce [[chirality]] in organic and inorganic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice. Pearson Educational Books. {{ISBN|9780131407480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers (2004)

The mirror images of a chiral molecule or ion are called [[enantiomer]]s or '''optical [[isomer]]s'''. Individual enantiomers are often designated as either [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|right-handed or left-handed]]. Chirality is an essential consideration when discussing the [[stereochemistry]] in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry]].  The concept is of great practical importance because most biomolecules and pharmaceuticals are chiral.

Chiral molecules and ions are described by various ways of designating their [[absolute configuration]], which codify either the entity's geometry or its [[polarimetry|ability to rotate plane-polarized light]], a common technique in studying chirality.

== Definition ==
Chirality is based on [[Molecular symmetry|molecular symmetry elements]]. Specifically, a chiral compound can contain no [[improper axis of rotation]] (S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), which includes planes of symmetry and inversion center. Chiral molecules are always dissymmetric (lacking S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) but not always asymmetric (lacking all symmetry elements except the trivial identity).  Asymmetric molecules are always chiral.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, F. A., "Chemical Applications of Group Theory," John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereogenic centers==
{{main article|Stereogenic center}}
In general, chiral molecules have '''point chirality''' at a single ''stereogenic'' atom, which has four different substituents. The two enantiomers of such compounds are said to have different '''absolute configurations''' at this center. This center is thus stereogenic (i.e., a grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism). The stereogenic atom (also known as the ''stereocenter'') is usually carbon, as in many biological molecules.  However a stereocenter can coincide with any atom, including metals (as in many chiral [[coordination compound]]s), phosphorus, or sulfur. The low barrier of [[nitrogen inversion]] make most ''N''-chiral amines (NRR′R″) impossible to resolve, but [[P-Chiral phosphine|''P''-chiral phosphines]] (PRR′R″) as well as S-chiral sulfoxides (OSRR′) are optically stable.
[[File:R-BINOL-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|144px|right|[[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol]] is an example of a molecule lacking point chirality.]]
While the presence of a stereogenic atom describes the great majority of chiral molecules, many variations and exceptions exist. For instance it is not necessary for the chiral substance to have a stereogenic atom.  Examples include 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluoro[[adamantane]], methylethylphenyl[[tetrahedrane]], certain [[calixarenes]] and [[fullerenes]], which have [[inherent chirality]].  The [[C2-Symmetric ligands|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric species]] [[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-bi-2-naphthol]] (BINOL), 1,3-dichloro[[Propadiene|allene]] have [[axial chirality]]. (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]] and many [[ferrocene]]s have [[planar chirality]].

When the optical [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotation]] for an enantiomer is too low for practical measurement, the species is said to exhibit [[cryptochirality]].

Even isotopic differences must be considered when examining chirality. Illustrative is the derivative of [[benzyl alcohol]] PhCHDOH, which is chiral. The ''S'' enantiomer has [''α'']&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = +0.715°.&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Streitwieser}}{{cite journal |author1=Streitwieser, A., Jr. |author2=Wolfe, J. R., Jr. |author3=Schaeffer, W.

==In biochemistry==
Many biologically active molecules are chiral, including the naturally occurring [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s) and [[sugar]]s. In biological systems, most of these compounds are of the same chirality: most amino acids are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|L}}) and sugars are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|D}}). Typical naturally occurring proteins are made of {{smallcaps all|L}}-amino acids and are known as ''left-handed proteins''; the comparably rarer {{smallcaps all|D}}-amino acids produce ''right-handed proteins''.

The origin of this [[homochirality]] in [[biology]] is the subject of much debate.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08&gt;{{cite book | author= Meierhenrich, Uwe J.  | year= 2008 | title= Amino acids and the Asymmetry of Life | edition = | location = Berlin, GER | publisher = Springer | isbn= 3540768858 | chapter =  | pages = | url = | access-date = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientists believe that Earth life's "choice" of chirality was purely random, and that if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, their chemistry could theoretically have opposite chirality. However, there is some suggestion that early amino acids could have formed in comet dust. In this case, circularly polarised radiation (which makes up 17% of stellar radiation) could have caused the selective destruction of one chirality of amino acids, leading to a selection bias which ultimately resulted in all life on Earth being homochiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKee |first=Maggie |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7895-space-radiation-may-select-amino-acids-for-life.html |title=Space radiation may select amino acids for life |publisher=New Scientist |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meierhenrich Uwe J., Nahon Laurent, Alcaraz Christian, Hendrik Bredehöft Jan, Hoffmann Søren V., Barbier Bernard, Brack André | year = 2005 | title = Asymmetric Vacuum UV photolysis of the Amino Acid Leucine in the Solid State | url = | journal = Angew.

[[Enzyme]]s, which are chiral, often distinguish between the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate. One could imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.

{{smallcaps all|L}}-forms of amino acids tend to be tasteless, whereas {{smallcaps all|D}}-forms tend to taste sweet.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08/&gt; [[Spearmint]] leaves contain the {{smallcaps all|L}}-enantiomer of the chemical [[carvone]] or ''R''-(−)-carvone and [[caraway]] seeds contain the {{smallcaps all|D}}-enantiomer or ''S''-(+)-carvone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf60176a035 | title=Chemical and sensory data supporting the difference between the odors of the enantiomeric carvones |author1=Theodore J.

Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase). Chirality in context of such phases in polymeric fluids has also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Srinivasarao&gt;{{cite journal | author= Srinivasarao, M. | year = 1999 | title= Chirality and Polymers | journal = Current Opinion in Colloid &amp; Interface Science | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 369–376 | doi = | url=  | quote =  }} {{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Complex (chemistry)#Optical isomerism|l1=Complex (chemistry): Isomerism}}
Chirality is a symmetry property, not a characteristic of any part of the periodic table.  Thus many inorganic materials, molecules, and ions are chiral.  [[Quartz]] is an example from the mineral kingdom.  Such noncentric materials are of interest for applications in [[nonlinear optics]].

In the areas of [[coordination chemistry]] and [[organometallic chemistry]], chirality is pervasive and of practical importance.  A famous example is [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)]] complex in which the three bipyridine ligands adopt a chiral propeller-like arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;von Zelewsky, A. (1995). ''Stereochemistry of Coordination Compounds.'' Chichester: John Wiley.. {{ISBN|047195599X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two enantiomers of complexes such as [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be designated as Λ (capital [[lambda]], the Greek version of "L") for a left-handed twist of the propeller described by the ligands, and Δ (capital [[delta (letter)|delta]], Greek "D") for a right-handed twist (pictured).

Chiral ligands confer chirality to a metal complex, as illustrated by metal-[[amino acid]] complexes.  If the metal exhibits catalytic properties, its combination with a chiral ligand is the basis of [[asymmetric catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. {{ISBN|189138953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and practices==

The term ''[[optical activity]]'' is derived from the interaction of chiral materials with polarized light. In a solution, the (−)-form, or [[levorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] the plane of a beam of [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized light]] [[counterclockwise]]. The (+)-form, or [[dextrorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer does the opposite. The rotation of light is measured using a [[polarimeter]] and is expressed as the optical rotation.

== History ==
The rotation of plane polarized light by chiral substances was first observed by [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Lakhtakia, A. (ed.) | title=Selected Papers on Natural Optical Activity (SPIE Milestone Volume 15) |publisher=SPIE | year=1990 }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained considerable importance in the sugar industry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. [[Louis Pasteur]] deduced in 1848 that this phenomenon has a molecular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Pasteur, L. | title=Researches on the molecular asymmetry of natural organic products, English translation of French original, published by Alembic Club Reprints (Vol. 14, pp. 1–46) in 1905, facsimile reproduction by SPIE in a 1990 book | year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Eliel, Ernest Ludwig; Wilen, Samuel H. &amp; Mander, Lewis N. | year = 1994 | title = Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds | edition = 1st | chapter = Chirality in Molecules Devoid of Chiral Centers (Chapter 14) | pages = | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Wiley &amp; Sons | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IyfwAAAAMAAJ | access-date = 2 February 2016 | isbn =  0471016705 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''chirality'' itself was coined by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Bentley, Ronald | year = 1995 | title = From Optical Activity in Quartz to Chiral Drugs: Molecular Handedness in Biology and Medicine. | journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|Perspect.

[[Romanticism]] grew largely out of an attempt to understand not just inert nature, but also vital nature. Romantic works in the realm of art and [[medicine|Romantic medicine]] were a response to the general failure of the application of method of inertial science to reveal the foundational laws and operant principles of vital nature. German romantic science and medicine sought to understand the nature of the life principle identified by John Hunter as distinct from matter itself via [[Blumenbach|Johan Friedrich Blumenbach]]'s ''Bildungstrieb'' and [[Hahnemann|Romantic medicine]]'s ''Lebenskraft'', as well as Röschlaub's development of the [[Brunonian|Brunonian system of medicine]] system of John Brown, in his ''excitation theory'' of life (German:''Erregbarkeit theorie''), working also with  Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'', the work of [[Goethe]] regarding morphology, and the first dynamic conception of physiology of [[Richard Saumarez]]. But it is in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] that we find the question of life and vital nature most intensely and comprehensively examined, particularly in his '''''Hints towards the Formation of a more Comprehensive Theory of Life'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (1818), providing the foundation for [[Romanticism and epistemology|Romantic philosophy]], science and medicine.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levere|first1=Trevor H.|title=Coleridge and the Sciences|journal=CUP Archive|date=June 28, 1990|pages=295–306|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=Owen+Barfield+Hints+Towards+a+More+Comprehensive+Theory+of+Life&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Owen%20Barfield%20Hints%20Towards%20a%20More%20Comprehensive%20Theory%20of%20Life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is key to understanding the relationship of Romantic literature and science.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Male|first1=Roy R. Jr|title=The Background of Coleridge's Theory of Life|journal=|date=1954|volume=33|issue=The University of Texas Studies in English|page=60|jstor=20776075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Enlightenment had developed a philosophy and science supported by formidable twin pillars: the first the Cartesian split of mind and matter, the second Newtonian physics, with its conquest of inert nature, both of which focused the mind's gaze on things or objects. For Cartesian philosophy, life existed on the side of matter, not mind; and for the physical sciences, the method that had been so productive for revealing the secrets of inert nature, should be equally productive in examining vital nature. The initial attempt to seek the cause and principle of life in matter was challenged by John Hunter, who held that the principle of life was not to be found nor confined within matter, but existed independently of matter itself, and informed or animated it, that is, he implied, it was the unifying or antecedent cause of the things or what Aristotelean philosophy termed ''natura naturata'' (the outer appearances of nature).
 
This reduction of the question of life to matter, and the corollary, that the method of the inertial sciences was the way to understand the very phenomenon of life, that is, its very nature and essence as a power (''natura naturans''), not as manifestations through sense-perceptible appearances (''natura naturata''), also reduced the individual to a material-mechanical 'thing' and seemed to render human freedom an untenable concept. It was this that Romanticism challenged, seeking instead to find an approach to the essence of nature as being also vital not simply inert, through a systematic method involving not just physics, but physiology (living functions). For Coleridge, quantitative analysis was anti-realist and needed to be grounded in qualitative analysis ('-ologies') (as was the case with Goethe's approach).&lt;ref name=Dyssebeia&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Metaphors In Coleridge's Theory of Life|url=http://dyssebeia.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/two-metaphors-in-coleridges-theory-of-life/|website=Dyssebeia|publisher=[[Wordpress]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the same time, the Romantics had to deal with the idealistic view that life was a 'somewhat' outside of things, such that the things themselves lost any real existence, a stream coming through Hume and Kant, and also infusing the German natural philosophical stream, German idealism, and in particular ''naturphilosophie'', eventuating scientifically in the doctrine of 'vitalism'. For the Romantics, life is independent of and antecedent to nature, but also infused and suspended in nature, not apart from it, As David Bohm expresses it in more modern terms "In nature nothing remains constant…everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is…at the foundation of the possibility of our understanding nature in a rational way."&lt;ref name=Bohm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bohm|first1=David|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|location=1957|page=1|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=nweG_wrUHuAC&amp;q=foundation#v=snippet&amp;q=foundation&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And as Coleridge explained, 'this antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each union, it has since the time of Bacon and Kepler been customary to call a law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|location=Middletown, CT|page=44, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as law, "we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=45, fn 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coleridge’s theory of life ==

Coleridge's was the dominant mind on many issues involving the philosophy and science in his time, as John Stuart Mill acknowledged, along with others since who have studied the history of Romanticism.

:The name of Coleridge is one of the few English names of our time which are likely to be oftener pronounced, and to become symbolical of more important things, in proportion as the inward workings of the age manifest themselves more and more in outward facts.&lt;ref name=Mill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mill|first1=John Stuart|title=Collected Works of John Stuart Mill|edition=Vol. 10|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=241&amp;chapter=21494&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

For Coleridge, as for many of his romantic contemporaries, the idea that matter itself can begat life only dealt with the various changes in the arrangement of particles and did not explain life itself as a principle or power that lay behind the material manifestations, ''natura naturans'' or "the productive power suspended and, as it were, quenched in the product" Until this were addressed, according to Coleridge, "we have not yet attained to a science of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This productive power is above sense experience, but not above nature herself, that is, supersensible, but not supernatural, and, thus, not 'occult' as was the case with vitalism. Vitalism failed to distinguish between spirit and nature, and then within nature, between the visible appearances and the invisible, yet very real and not simply hypothesized notion, essence or motivating principle (''natura naturans''). Even Newton spoke of things invisible in themselves (though not in their manifestations), such as force, though Comte, the thorough materialist, complained of the use of such terms as the 'force of gravity' as being relics of animism.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matter was not a 'datum' or thing in and of itself, but rather a product or effect, and for Coleridge, looking at life in its broadest sense, it was the product of a polarity of forces and energies, but derived from a unity which is itself a power, not an abstract or nominal concept, that is Life, and this polar nature of forces within the power of Life is the very law or 'Idea' (in the Platonic sense) of Creation.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"/&gt;

== Life as polarity/function/motion ==

For Coleridge the essence of the universe is motion and motion is driven by a dynamic polarity of forces that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestations. This polarity is the very dynamic that acts throughout all of nature, including into the more particular form of 'life biological', as well as of mind and consciousness.
 
:The tendency having been ascertained, what is its most general law? I answer—polarity, or the essential dualism of Nature, arising out of its productive unity, and still tending to reaffirm it, either as equilibrium, indifference, or identity.&lt;ref name="Theory of Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Hints Towards a More Comprehensive Theory of Life|date=1848|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=AXcNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge+theory+of+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vGNTVLG8E8OogwSsvoCgDw&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And this polarity is dynamic, that is real, though not visible, and not simply logical or abstract. Thus, the polarity results in manifestations that are real, as the opposite powers are not contradictory, but counteracting and inter-penetrating.

:...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and in the process of our own self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Biographia Literaria|date=1834|publisher=Leavitt, Lord &amp; Company|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=QHdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=coleridge+biographia+literaria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2RTVMaCA4aeNtPPgMAN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biographia%20literaria&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing—a self-subsistent hypostasis—but an act and process...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

And in that sense Coleridge re-phrases the question "What is Life?" to "What is not Life that really is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dynamic polar essence of nature in all its functions and manifestations is a universal law in the order of the law of gravity and other physical laws of inert nature. And, critically, this dynamic polarity of constituent powers of life at all levels is not outside or above nature, but is within nature (''natura naturans''), not as a part of the visible product, but as the ulterior natural functions that produce such products or things.

:a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function…

:The first product of its energy is the thing itself… Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=34, fn 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is these functions that provided the bridge being sought by Romantic science and medicine, in particular by Andreas Röschlaub and the [[Brunonian system|Brunonian system of medicine]], between the inertial science of inert nature (physics) and the vital science of vital nature (physiology) and its therapeutic application or physic (the domain of the physician).

=== Romanticism and vitalism ===

Coleridge was influenced by German philosophy, in particular Kant, Fichte and Schelling (Naturphilosophie), as well as the physiology of Blumenbach and the dynamic excitation theory of life of the Brunonian system. He sought a path that was neither the mystical tendency of the earlier vitalists nor the materialistic reductionist approach to natural science, but a dynamic one.

:What Coleridge was after was definitely not animism or naive vitalism based on vital substance, or mechanical philosophy based on material substance. He was trying to find a general law...that explicates its self-regulating internal power.&lt;ref name=Hawk&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawk|first1=Byron|title=A Counter-history of Composition: Toward Methodologies of Complexity|date=2007|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=dnHFgu43x1oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=Coleridge%27s+theory+of+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UljAqrEoxP&amp;sig=ojuS_BPEC--PNpfZVQ15yb1PUIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tfpTVODlMsebNpTGgsgE&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Coleridge%27s%20theory%20of%20life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's challenge was to describe something that was dynamic neither in mystical terms not materialistic ones, but via analogy, drawing from the examples of inertial science. As one writer explains, he uses the examples of electricity, magnetism and gravity not because they are like life, but because they offer a way of understanding powers, forces and energies, which lie at the heart of life. And using these analogies, Coleridge seeks to demonstrate that life is not a material force, but a product of relations amongst forces. Life is not linear and static, but dynamic process of self-regulation and [[emergence|Emergent evolution]] that results in increasing complexity and individuation.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt; This spiral, upward movement (cf. Goethe's ideas) creates a force for organization that unifies, and is most intense and powerful in that which is most complex and most individual - the self-regulating, enlightened, developed individual mind. But at the same time, this process of life increases interdependence (like the law of comparative advantage in economics) and associational powers of the mind. Thus, he is not talking about an isolated, individual subjective mind, but about the evolution of a higher level of consciousness and thought at the core of the process of life.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt;

== Life and liberty ==

And the direction of this motion is towards increasing individuation, that is the creation of specific, individual units of things. At the same time, given the dynamic polarity of the world, there must always be an equal and opposite tendency, in this case, that of connection. So, a given of our experience is that man is both an individual, tending in each life and in history generally to greater and greater individualization, and a social creature seeking interaction and connection. It is the dynamic interplay between the individuation and connecting forces that leads to higher and higher individuation.
 
:By Life I everywhere mean the true Idea of Life,… the tendency to individuation… [which] cannot be conceived without the opposite tendency to connect, even as the centrifugal power supposes the centripetal, or as the two opposite poles constitute each other, and are the constituent acts of one and the same power in the magnet…. Again, if the tendency be at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment, the individuation itself must be a tendency to the ultimate production of the highest and most comprehensive individuality. This must be the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object, or by whatever other word we may designate that something which bears to a final cause the same relation that Nature herself bears to the Supreme Intelligence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Creative life and vital nature ==

Coleridge makes a further distinction between mathematics and life, the latter being productive or creative, that is, living, and the former ideal. Thus, the mathematical approach that works so well with inert nature, is not suitable for vital nature.

:In its productive power, of which the product is the only measure, consists its incompatibility with mathematical calculus. For the full applicability of an abstract science ceases, the moment reality begins.

:This productive or generative power of life exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but the forces are not extinguished in the product - they take on a different role, namely that of functions. Thus, the very nature of the “given” is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts. 
The counteraction then of the two assumed forces does not depend on their meeting from opposite directions; the power which acts in them is indestructible; it is therefore inexhaustibly re-ebullient; and as something must be the result of these two forces, both alike infinite, and both alike indestructible; and as rest or neutralization cannot be this result; no other conception is possible, but that the product must be a tertium aliquid, [a third thing] or finite generation. Consequently this conception is necessary. Now this tertium aliquid can be no other than an inter-penetration of the counteracting powers, partaking of both… Consequently the 'constituent powers', that have given rise to a body, may then reappear in it as its function: "a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function...the first product of its energy is the thing itself: ''ipsa se posuit et iam facta est ens positum''. Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body...The vital functions are consequents of the ''Vis Vitae Principium Vitale'', and presuppose the Organs, as the Functionaries.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Life, that is, the essential polarity in unity (multeity in unity) in Coleridge’s sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form.

:But as little can we conceive the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. (BL)
To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Life and matter ==

This dynamic polarity that is Life is expressed at different levels. At its most basic it is Space-Time, with its product - motion. The interplay of both gives us either a line or a circle, and then there are different degrees possible within a given form or “predominance” of forces. Geometry is not conceivable except as the dynamic interplay of space (periphery) and time (point). Space, time and motion are also geometrically represented by width, length (breadth) and depth. And this correspondence is repeated throughout the scale of Life.

:We have been thus full and express on this subject, because these simple ideas of time, space, and motion, of length, breadth, and depth, are not only the simplest and universal, but the necessary symbols of all philosophic construction. They will be found the primary factors and elementary forms of every calculus and of every diagram in the algebra and geometry of a scientific physiology. Accordingly, we shall recognise the same forms under other names; but at each return more specific and intense; and the whole process repeated with ascending gradations of reality, exempli gratiâ: Time + space = motion; Tm + space = line + breadth = depth; depth + motion = force; Lf + Bf = Df; LDf + BDf = attraction + repulsion = gravitation; and so on, even till they pass into outward phenomena, and form the intermediate link between productive powers and fixed products in light, heat, and electricity.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Matter, then, is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power. It is also the mass of a given body.
 
:If we pass to the construction of matter, we find it as the product, or tertium aliquid, of antagonist powers of repulsion and attraction. Remove these powers, and the conception of matter vanishes into space—conceive repulsion only, and you have the same result. For infinite repulsion, uncounteracted and alone, is tantamount to infinite, dimensionless diffusion, and this again to infinite weakness; viz., to space. Conceive attraction alone, and as an infinite contraction, its product amounts to the absolute point, viz., to time. Conceive the synthesis of both, and you have matter as a fluxional antecedent, which, in the very act of formation, passes into body by its gravity, and yet in all bodies it still remains as their mass...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Coleridge’s understanding of life is contrasted with the materialist view which is essentially reduced to defining life as that which is the opposite of not-life, or that which resists death, that is, that which is life.

:By an easy logic, each of the two divisions has been made to define the others by a mere assertion of their assumed contrariety. The theorist has explained Y+X by informing us that it is the opposite of Y-X: and if we ask, what then is Y-X, we are told that it is the opposite of Y+X! A reciprocation of good services....I turn to a work by the eminent French physiologist, Bichat, where I find this definition: Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted....that is, that life consists in being able to live!...as if four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together than the words life, death, function, and resistance.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Cognition and life ==

The problem for Coleridge and the Romantics was that the intellect, 'left to itself' as Bacon stated, was capable of apprehending only the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) and not the inmost, living functions (natura naturans) giving rise to these forms. Thus, effects can only be 'explained' in terms of other effects, not causes. It takes a different capacity to 'see' these living functions, which is an imaginative activity. For Coleridge, there is an innate, primitive or 'primary' imagination that configures invisibly sense-experience into perception, but a rational perception, that is, one raised into consciousness and awareness and then rationally presentable, requires a higher level, what he termed 'secondary imagination', which is able to connect with the thing being experienced, penetrate to its essence in terms of the living dynamics upholding its outer form, and then present the phenomena as and within its natural law, and further, using reason, develop the various principles of its operation.

This cognitive capacity involved what Coleridge termed the 'inmost sense' or what Goethe termed the '''Gemüt'''. It also involved the reactivation of the old Greek noetic capacity, and the ability to 'see' or produce the theory (Greek ''theoria'' from the verb 'to see') dynamic polarities, or natural Laws, the dynamic transcendent (foundational) entities that Plato termed 'Ideas' (''eidos'').

Since ''natura naturata'' is sustained by ''natura naturans'', and the creative power of ''natura naturans'' is one of a kind with the human mind, itself creative, then there must be a correspondence or connection between the mind and the things we perceive, such that we can overcome the apparent separation between the object and the representation in the mind of the object that came to bedevil Enlightenment thought (Hume, Kant). As one commentator noted "to speak at all of the unity of intelligence and nature is of course flatly to contradict Descartes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and evolution ==

For Coleridge the power of life lies in every seed as a potential to be unfolded as a result of interaction with the environment (heat, light, air, moisture, etc.), an insight which allowed him to see in the Brunonian system a dynamic polarity in excitation theory.
 
Coleridge also saw that there was a progressive movement through time and space of life or the law of polarity, from the level of physics (space and time) and the mineral or inert nature (law of gravity, operating through forces of attraction and repulsion), up to man, with his law of resonance in terms of his innate desire to be himself (force of individuation) and to also connect with like-minded (force of connection), as Goethe expressed in his novel ''Elective Affinities'' (''Wahlverwandschaften'') as well as in his own life's experience.
 
Evolution occurred because the original polarity of creation, the very 'Law of Creation', itself gives birth to subsequent polarities, as each pole is itself a unity that can be further polarized (what Wilhelm Reich later termed 'orgonomic functionalism' and what at the biological level constitutes physiology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insight that would later be taken up by the concept of emergent evolution, including the emergence of mind and consciousness.

:the productive power, or ''vis naturans'', which in the sensible world, or n''atura naturata'', is what we mean by the word, nature, when we speak of the same as an agent, is essentially one (that is, of one kind) with the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And that this is so, is also an intimate and shared experience of all humans, as is set out in Reid's Common Sense philosophy. As Coleridge states

:but for the confidence which we place in the assertions of our reason and our conscience, we could have no certainty of the reality and actual outness of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That nature evolves towards a purpose, and that is the unfolding of the human mind and consciousness in all its levels and degrees, is not teleological but a function of the very nature of the law of polarity or creation itself, namely that of increasing individuation of an original unity, what Coleridge termed 'multeity in unity'. As he states, "without assigning to nature as nature, a conscious purpose" we must still "distinguish her agency from a blind and lifeless mechanism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While man contains and is subject to the various laws of nature, man as a self-conscious being is also the summa of a process of creation leading to greater mind and consciousness, that is, a creative capacity of imagination. Instead of being a creature of circumstance, man is the creator of them, or at least has that potential.
 
:Naked and helpless cometh man into the world. Such has been the complaint from eldest time; but we complain of our chief privilege, our ornament, and the connate mark of our sovereignty. Porphyrigeniti summus! …Henceforth he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=29, fn 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30303">'''Homochirality''' is a uniformity of [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], or handedness. Objects are ''chiral'' when they cannot be superposed on their mirror images. For example, the left and right hands of a human are approximately mirror images of each other but are not their own mirror images, so they are ''chiral''. In [[biology]], 19 of the 20 natural [[amino acid]]s are homochiral, being &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (left-handed), while [[sugar]]s are &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (right-handed).&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson, Lehninger et al |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homochirality'' can also refer to ''enantiomerically pure'' substances in which all the constituents are the same [[enantiomer]] (a right-handed or left-handed version of an atom or molecule), but some sources discourage this use of the term.

It is unclear whether homochirality has a purpose, however, it appears to be a form of information storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=James D.|title=A new definition of life|journal=Chirality|date=March 2009|volume=21|issue=3|pages=354–358|doi=10.1002/chir.20590}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suggestion is that it reduces [[entropy]] barriers in the formation of large organized molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Julian|first1=Ryan R.|last2=Myung|first2=Sunnie|last3=Clemmer|first3=David E.|title=Do Homochiral Aggregates Have an Entropic Advantage?|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=January 2005|volume=109|issue=1|pages=440–444|doi=10.1021/jp046478x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been experimentally verified that amino acids form large aggregates in larger abundance from [[enantiopure]] substrates than from [[racemic]] ones.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It is not clear whether homochirality emerged before or after life, and many mechanisms for its origin have been proposed.&lt;ref name=jafarpour2017 /&gt; Some of these models propose three distinct steps: ''mirror-symmetry breaking'' creates a minute enantiomeric imbalance, ''chiral amplification'' builds on this imbalance, and ''chiral transmission'' is the transfer of chirality from one set of molecules to another.

==In biology==

Amino acids are the building blocks of [[peptide]]s and [[enzyme]]s while sugar-peptide chains are the backbone of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Peptides &amp; Proteins|url=https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/protein2.htm|website=Natural Products|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lam|first1=Eric|chapter=Nucleic acids and proteins|editor-last1=Dey|editor-first1=P.M.|editor-last2=Harborne|editor-first2=J.B.|title=Plant Biochemistry.|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080525723|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological organisms, amino acids appear almost exclusively in the left-handed form (&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids) and sugars in the right-handed form (R-sugars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zubay |first1=Geoffrey |title=Origins of Life: On Earth and in the Cosmos |date=2000 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780080497617 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=August 2018}} Since the enzymes catalyze reactions, they enforce homochirality on a great variety of other chemicals, including [[hormone]]s, toxins, fragrances and food flavors.&lt;ref name=Seckbach&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seckbach|first1=edited by Joseph|title=Genesis - in the beginning : precursors of life, chemical models and early biological evolution|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789400729407}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|493&amp;ndash;494}} [[Glycine]] is achiral, as are some other non-[[proteinogenic]] amino acids are either achiral (such as [[dimethylglycine]]) or of the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomeric form.

Biological organisms easily discriminate between molecules with different chiralities. This can affect physiological reactions such as smell and taste. [[Carvone]], a [[terpenoid]] found in [[essential oil]]s, smells like mint in its L-form and [[caraway]] in its R-form.&lt;ref name=Seckbach/&gt;{{rp|494}}{{verify source|date=August 2018}} [[Limonene]] tastes like lemons when right-handed and oranges when left-handed.&lt;ref name=Hazen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|author-link=Robert Hazen|title=Genesis : the scientific quest for life's origins|date=2007|publisher=Joseph Henry|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309103107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}

Homochirality also affects the response to drugs. [[Thalidomide]], in its left-handed form, cures [[morning sickness]]; in its right-handed form, it causes birth defects.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;{{rp|168}} Unfortunately, even if a pure left-handed version is administered, some of it can convert to the right-handed form in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Silas|title=Chiral Toxicology: It's the Same Thing...

Chiral preferences can also be found at a macroscopic level. Snail shells can be right-turning or left-turning helices, but one  form or the other is strongly preferred in a given species.

==Origins==
===Symmetry breaking===
Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystal]]s, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis.&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, chirality would be selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Clark (author) |date=July–August 1999 |title=Polarized Starlight and the Handedness of Life |journal=[[American Scientist]] |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |publisher=[[Sigma Xi]] |volume=87 |issue=4 |page=336 |bibcode=1999AmSci..87..336C |doi=10.1511/1999.4.336 |issn=0003-0996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[enantiomeric excess]] can be amplified into a large one by [[Autocatalysis#Asymmetric autocatalysis|asymmetric autocatalysis]], such as in the [[Soai reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shibata |first1=Takanori |last2=Morioka |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Hayase |first3=Tadakatsu |last4=Choji |first4=Kaori |last5=Soai |first5=Kenso |display-authors=3 |date=17 January 1996 |title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=American Chemical Society |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=471–472 |doi=10.1021/ja953066g |issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other.&lt;ref name="Soai2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soai |first1=Kenso |last2=Sato |first2=Itaru |last3=Shibata |first3=Takanori |year=2001 |title=Asymmetric autocatalysis and the origin of chiral homogeneity in organic compounds |journal=The Chemical Record |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons on behalf of The Japan Chemical Journal Forum |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=321–332 |doi=10.1002/tcr.1017 |issn=1528-0691 |pmid=11893072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One supposition is that the discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the [[Murchison meteorite]] supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence for the existence of [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] originating from [[Mie scattering]] on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an [[enantiomeric excess]] within chiral material in space.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich/&gt;{{rp|123&amp;ndash;124}} Interstellar and near-stellar magnetic fields can align dust particles in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Helman |first=Daniel S |date=6 July 2018 |title=Galactic Distribution of Chirality Sources of Organic Molecules |journal=Acta Astronautica |publisher=Elsevier |volume=151 |pages=595–602 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.07.008 |issn=0094-5765|bibcode=2018AcAau.151..595H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see [[Parity (physics)|Parity violation]]) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules. Homochirality may also result from [[spontaneous absolute asymmetric synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel/courses/569/Essays_Fall2006/files/Rajan.pdf|title=How did protein amino acids get left-handed while sugars got right-handed?|first=Aruna|last=Rajan|publisher=Term Paper for Physics 569*|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soai_interview&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Highlights in Chemical Science |year= 2008 |issue= 5 |url= http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2008/05/Kenso_Soai_interview.asp |title= Interview: In the beginning... |accessdate=June 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that homochirality is simply a result of the natural autoamplification process of life—that either the formation of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ermann |first1=L |title=Homochirality: the key to unlocking the origin of life? |journal=Applied Theoretical Biology |date=2013 |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=21-37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cause of chirality consensus | author= Jaakkola, S., Sharma, V. and Annila, A.| journal = Curr.

====Theory====
[[File:Frank's model phase portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Phase portrait of Frank's model: starting from almost everywhere in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; plane (except &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; = &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; line), the system approaches to one of the homochiral states]]
In 1953, [[Frederick Charles Frank|Charles Frank]] proposed a model to demonstrate that homochirality is a consequence of [[autocatalysis]].&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |publisher=Elsevier |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomers of a chiral molecule are autocatalytically produced from an achiral molecule A

:A + &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;,{{pad}}A + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;

while suppressing each other through a reaction that he called ''mutual antagonism''

:&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → ∅.
In this model the racemic state is unstable in the sense that the slightest enantiomeric excess will be amplified to a completely homochiral state. This can be shown by computing the reaction rates from the [[law of mass action]]:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d[\ce L]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce L] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]}\\
\frac{d[\ce D]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce D] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for the autocatalytic reactions, &lt;math&gt;k_d&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for mutual antagonism reaction, and the concentration of A is kept constant for simplicity. By defining the enantiomeric excess &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math chem&gt;\Phi = \frac{[\ce D] - [\ce L]}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]},&lt;/math&gt;
we can compute the rate of change of enatiomeric excess using [[chain rule]] from the rate of change of the concentrations of enantiomeres &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.
:&lt;math chem&gt;
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = \left(\frac{2k_d \ce{[L] [D]}}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]}\right)\Phi.
&lt;/math&gt;
Linear stability analysis of this equation shows that the racemic state &lt;math&gt;\Phi = 0&lt;/math&gt; is unstable. Starting from [[almost everywhere]] in the concentration space, the system evolves to a homochiral state.

It is generally understood that autocatalysis alone does not yield to homochirality, and the presence of the mutually antagonistic relationship between the two enantiomers is necessary for the instability of the racemic mixture. However, recent studies show that homochirality could be achieved from autocatalysis in the absence of the mutually antagonistic relationship, but the underlying mechanism for symmetry-breaking is different.&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |publisher=APS |volume=95 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |publisher=APS |volume=115 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Experiments====
There are several laboratory experiments that demonstrate how a small amount of one enantiomer at the start of a reaction can lead to a large excess of a single enantiomer as the product. For example, the Soai reaction is [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]]. If the reaction is started with some of one of the product enantiomers already present, the product acts as an [[Enantioselective synthesis|enantioselective]] catalyst for production of more of that same enantiomer.&lt;ref name=shibata&gt;{{cite journal|title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol|author1=Takanori Shibata |author2=Hiroshi Morioka |author3=Tadakatsu Hayase |author4=Kaori Choji |author5=Kenso Soai | journal = [[J.

This finding may have consequences for the development of the [[Mars Organic Detector]] scheduled for launch in 2013 which aims to recover trace amounts of amino acids from the Mars surface exactly by a sublimation technique.

A high asymmetric amplification of the [[enantiomeric excess]] of sugars are also present in the [[amino acid]] catalyzed asymmetric formation of [[carbohydrates]]&lt;ref name=Engqvist&gt;{{cite journal| title=Plausible origins of homochirality in the amino acid catalyzed neogenesis of carbohydrates|author1=Armando Córdova |author2=Magnus Engqvist |author3=Ismail Ibrahem |author4=Jesús Casas |author5=Henrik Sundén | journal=[[Chem.

One classic study involves an experiment that takes place in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=kondepudi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Sodium Chlorate Crystallization| author= Kondepudi, D. K., Kaufman, R. J. &amp; Singh, N.| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 250 | pages = 975–976|year=1990|doi=10.1126/science.250.4983.975|pmid=17746924|issue=4983|bibcode = 1990Sci...250..975K }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sodium chlorate]] is allowed to [[crystallization|crystallize]] from water and the collected crystals examined in a [[polarimeter]], each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the [[Levorotation|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;]] form or the [[Dextrorotation|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;]] form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; crystals collected equals the amount of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium chlorate solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; or exclusively &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;. In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-crystals and 18 others &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to [[autocatalysis]] taking place in the [[nucleation]] process.

In a related experiment, a crystal suspension of a racemic [[amino acid]] derivative continuously stirred, results in a 100% crystal phase of one of the enantiomers because the enantiomeric pair is able to equilibrate in solution  (compare with [[dynamic kinetic resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noorduin|first1=Wim L.|last2=Izumi|first2=Toshiko|last3=Millemaggi|first3=Alessia|last4=Leeman|first4=Michel|last5=Meekes|first5=Hugo|last6=Van Enckevort|first6=Willem J.

===Transmission===
Many strategies in [[asymmetric synthesis]] are built on chiral transmission. Especially important is the so-called [[organocatalysis]] of organic reactions by proline for example in [[Mannich reaction]]s.

==Optical resolution in racemic amino acids==
There exists no theory elucidating correlations among &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. If one takes, for example, [[alanine]], which has a small [[methyl]] group, and [[phenylalanine]], which has a larger [[benzyl]] group, a simple question is in what aspect, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-alanine resembles &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine more than &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine, and what kind of mechanism causes the selection of all &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and phenylalanine was &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.

It was reported&lt;ref name=kojo&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Kojo |author2=H. Uchino |author3=M. Yoshimura |author4=K. Tanaka |title = Racemic D,L-asparagine causes enantiomeric excess of other coexisting racemic D,L-amino acids during recrystallization: a hypothesis accounting for the origin of L-amino acids in the biosphere.| journal = [[Chem. Comm.]] | pages= 2146–2147 | year= 2004|doi = 10.1039/b409941a|pmid=15467844|issue=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 that excess racemic [[asparagine|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-asparagine]] (Asn), which spontaneously forms crystals of either isomer during recrystallization, induces asymmetric resolution of a co-existing racemic amino acid such as [[arginine]] (Arg), [[aspartic acid]] (Asp), [[glutamine]] (Gln), [[histidine]] (His), [[leucine]] (Leu), [[methionine]] (Met), [[phenylalanine]] (Phe), [[serine]] (Ser), [[valine]] (Val), [[tyrosine]] (Tyr), and [[tryptophan]] (Trp). The [[enantiomeric excess]] {{math|ee {{=}} 100 &amp;times;(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)/(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;+&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)}} of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly with that of the inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized.&lt;ref name=kojo/&gt; It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;- or &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee was reported to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.

This is the first study elucidating reasonably the formation of chirality from racemic amino acids with experimental evidences.

==History of term==
This term was introduced by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in 1904, the year that he published his Baltimore Lecture of 1884. Kelvin used the term homochirality as a relationship between two molecules, i.e. two molecule are homochiral if they have the same chirality.&lt;ref name=Engqvist/&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=David G.|title=Stereochemistry|date=2001|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84755-194-8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, homochiral has been used in the same sense as [[enantiomer]]ically pure. This is permitted in some journals (but not encouraged),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anslyn|first1=Eric V.|last2=Dougherty|first2=Dennis A.|title=Modern physical organic chemistry|date=2006|publisher=University Science Books|location=Sausalito, Calif.|isbn=9781891389313}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|342}}&lt;ref&gt;However, the message can be confusing. In {{cite journal|last1=Moss|first1=G. P.|title=Basic terminology of stereochemistry (IUPAC Recommendations 1996)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1 January 1996|volume=68|issue=12|pages=2193–2222|doi=10.1351/pac199668122193|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/pac.1996.68.issue-12/pac199668122193/pac199668122193.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2018}}, the entry for ''Enantiomerically Pure/Enantiopure'' says "Use of homochiral as a synonym is strongly discouraged"; but the entry for ''Homochiral'' says "See ''enantiomerically pure/enantiopure''."&lt;/ref&gt; its meaning changing into the preference of a process or system for a single [[optical isomer]] in a pair of isomers in these journals.

'''Life''' is a characteristic that distinguishes [[physical body|physical entities]] that have [[biological process]]es, such as [[Cell signaling|signaling]] and [[self-sustainability|self-sustaining]] processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (they have [[Death|died]]), or because they never had such functions and are classified as [[wikt:inanimate|inanimate]]. Various forms of life exist, such as [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and [[bacteria]]. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define [[virus]]es, [[viroid]]s, or potential [[Synthetic biology#Synthetic life|synthetic life]] as "living". [[Biology]] is the science concerned with the study of life.

The definition of life is controversial. The current definition is that [[organism]]s are [[Open system (thermodynamics)|open systems]] that maintain [[homeostasis]], are composed of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], have a [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], undergo [[metabolism]], can [[cell growth|grow]], [[Adaptation|adapt]] to their environment, respond to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], [[reproduction|reproduce]] and [[Evolution|evolve]]. However, several other biological definitions have been proposed, and there are some borderline cases of life, such as viruses or viroids. In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by "life" through obsolete concepts such as [[odic force]], [[hylomorphism]], [[spontaneous generation]] and [[vitalism]], that have now been disproved by [[Biological research|biological discoveries]]. [[Abiogenesis]] describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple [[organic compounds]]. Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core [[chemical element]]s to sustain [[biochemical]] functions.

Life on Earth [[Earliest known life forms|first appeared]] as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after [[Origin of water on Earth#Water in the development of Earth|ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago]], and not long after the [[Age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]] 4.54 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="NAT-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="4.3b oldest" /&gt; Earth's current life may have descended from an [[RNA world]], although [[RNA]]-based life may not have been the first. The mechanism by which [[abiogenesis|life began on Earth]] is unknown, though many hypotheses have been formulated and are often based on the [[Miller–Urey experiment]]. The [[earliest known life forms]] are microfossils of bacteria. 3.45 billion year old [[Australia]]n rocks are reported to have contained [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name="WU-20171218"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyrell |first=Kelly April |title=Oldest fossils ever found show life on Earth began before 3.5 billion years ago |url=https://news.wisc.edu/oldest-fossils-ever-found-show-life-on-earth-began-before-3-5-billion-years-ago/ |date=18 December 2017 |website=[[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] |accessdate=18 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schopf |first1=J.

Since its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a [[geologic time scale]]. To survive in most [[ecosystem]]s, life must often adapt to a wide range of conditions. Some microorganisms, called [[extremophile]]s, thrive in physically or geochemically [[extreme environment]]s that are detrimental to most other life on Earth. [[Aristotle]] was the first person to [[taxonomy (biology)|classify]] organisms. Later, [[Carl Linnaeus]] introduced [[Linnean taxonomy|his system]] of [[binomial nomenclature]] for the classification of [[species]]. Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms. The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/14425949/Cell-The-Fundamental-Unit-of-Life Chapter-5, The Fundamental Unit of Life]. Monika Mehan. Scribd.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of cells, [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]], both of which consist of [[cytoplasm]] enclosed within a [[membrane]] and contain many [[biomolecules]] such as [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acid]]s. Cells reproduce through a process of [[cell division]], in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.

Though currently only known on [[Earth]], life need not be restricted to it, and many scientists speculate in the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]]. [[Artificial life]] is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life. Death is the permanent termination of all [[Biological process|biological functions]] which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life. [[Extinction]] is the process by which an entire group or [[taxon]], normally a [[species]], dies out. [[Fossil]]s are the preserved remains or [[trace fossil|traces]] of organisms.

[[File:Characteristics of life.svg|thumb|The characteristics of life]]
Since there is no unequivocal definition of life, most current definitions in biology are descriptive. Life is considered a characteristic of something that preserves, furthers or reinforces its existence in the given environment. This characteristic exhibits all or most of the following traits:&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Koshland&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Seven Pillars of Life |journal=Science |date=22 March 2002 |first=Daniel E. |last=Koshland, Jr. |volume=295 |issue=5563 |pages=2215–16 |doi=10.1126/science.1068489 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5563/2215 |accessdate=25 May 2009 |pmid=11910092 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228202918/http://sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5563/2215 |archivedate=28 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |last= |first= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-618-70173-5 |edition=4th |location= |pages= |chapter=life |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life|title=Life|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110042620/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life|archivedate=10 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars141.php |title=Habitability and Biology: What are the Properties of Life? |accessdate=6 June 2013 |website=Phoenix Mars Mission |publisher=The University of Arizona |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6P58Tsw9q?url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars141.php |archivedate=24 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JBS-2012Feb"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trifonov |first=Edward N. |title=Definition of Life: Navigation through Uncertainties |url=http://www.jbsdonline.com/mc_images/category/4317/21-trifonov-jbsd_29_4_2012.pdf |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Structure &amp; Dynamics |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=647–50 |issn=0739-1102 |accessdate=12 January 2012 |doi=10.1080/073911012010525017 |pmid=22208269 |date=2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127142426/http://www.jbsdonline.com/mc_images/category/4317/21-trifonov-jbsd_29_4_2012.pdf |archivedate=27 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45963181/ns/technology_and_science/#.WCcX-snQf0w |title=Can scientists define 'life' ... using just three words? |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |date=11 January 2012 |work=NBC News |access-date=12 November 2016 |via= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414085107/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45963181/ns/technology_and_science#.WCcX-snQf0w |archivedate=14 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Homeostasis]]''': regulation of the internal environment to maintain a constant state; for example, sweating to reduce temperature
# '''[[Biological organization|Organization]]''': being structurally composed of one or more [[cell (biology)|cells]]&amp;nbsp;– the basic units of life
# '''[[Metabolism]]''': transformation of energy by converting chemicals and energy into cellular components ([[anabolism]]) and decomposing organic matter ([[catabolism]]). Living things require [[bioenergetics|energy]] to maintain internal organization (homeostasis) and to produce the other phenomena associated with life.
# '''[[Cell growth|Growth]]''': maintenance of a higher rate of anabolism than catabolism. A growing organism increases in size in all of its parts, rather than simply accumulating matter.
# '''[[Adaptation]]''': the ability to change over time in response to the environment. This ability is fundamental to the process of [[evolution]] and is determined by the organism's [[heredity]], diet, and external factors.
# '''Response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]''': a response can take many forms, from the contraction of a [[unicellular organism]] to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of [[multicellular organisms]]. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant turning toward the sun ([[phototropism]]), and [[chemotaxis]].
# '''[[Reproduction]]''': the ability to produce new individual organisms, either [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] from a single parent organism or [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] from two parent organisms.

These complex processes, called [[Physiology|physiological functions]], have underlying physical and chemical bases, as well as [[Signalling (biology)|signaling and control mechanisms]] that are essential to maintaining life.

===Living systems theories===
Living systems are open [[self-organization|self-organizing]] living things that interact with their [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. These systems are maintained by flows of information, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy]], and matter.

Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woodruff |first=T. Sullivan |authorlink= |author2=John Baross |title=Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=8 October 2007 |location= |pages= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=}}
Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." [...] "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; Such a general theory would arise out of the ecological and [[Biology|biological sciences]] and attempt to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patterns, Flows, and Interrelationship |url=http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |accessdate=2009-06-27 |first=Molly Young |last=Brown |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108122526/http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |archivedate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gaia hypothesis====

The idea that the Earth is alive is found in philosophy and religion, but the first scientific discussion of it was by the Scottish scientist [[James Hutton]]. In 1785, he stated that the Earth was a superorganism and that its proper study should be [[physiology]].

====Nonfractionability====
The first attempt at a general [[living systems]] theory for explaining the nature of life was in 1978, by American biologist [[James Grier Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woodruff |first=T. Sullivan |author2=John Baross |title=Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-82421-7 |date=8 October 2007}} Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory."...&amp;nbsp;"Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] (1991) built on this by defining a system component as "a unit of organization; a part with a function, i.e., a definite relation between part and whole." From this and other starting concepts, he developed a "relational theory of systems" that attempts to explain the special properties of life. Specifically, he identified the "nonfractionability of components in an organism" as the fundamental difference between living systems and "biological machines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life |first1=Rosen |last1=Robert |date=November 1991 |isbn=978-0-231-07565-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Life as a property of ecosystems====
A systems view of life treats environmental [[flux]]es and biological fluxes together as a "reciprocity of influence,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calresco.org/fiscus/esl.htm |title=The Ecosystemic Life Hypothesis |last=Fiscus |first=Daniel A. |date=April 2002 |website= |publisher=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806015449/http://www.calresco.org/fiscus/esl.htm|archive-date=6 August 2009|dead-url=yes |accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a reciprocal relation with environment is arguably as important for understanding life as it is for understanding ecosystems. As [[Harold J. Morowitz]] (1992) explains it, life is a property of an [[ecosystem|ecological system]] rather than a single organism or species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morowitz |first1=Harold J. |date=1992 |title=Beginnings of cellular life: metabolism recapitulates biogenesis |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-05483-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmQDSHN_UrIC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905030901/https://books.google.com/books?id=CmQDSHN_UrIC |archivedate=5 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that an ecosystemic definition of life is preferable to a strictly [[biochemical]] or physical one. [[Robert Ulanowicz]] (2009) highlights mutualism as the key to understand the systemic, order-generating behavior of life and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert W. |last1=Ulanowicz |first2=Robert E. |last2=Ulanowicz |title=A third window: natural life beyond Newton and Darwin |publisher=Templeton Foundation Press |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-59947-154-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAQKAQAAMAAJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903180028/https://books.google.com/books?id=gAQKAQAAMAAJ |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complex systems biology====
{{main|Complex systems biology}}{{See also|Mathematical biology}}
Complex systems biology (CSB) is a field of science that studies the emergence of complexity in functional organisms from the viewpoint of [[dynamic systems]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baianu |first1=I. C. |date=2006 |title=Robert Rosen's Work and Complex Systems Biology |url= |journal=Axiomathes |volume=16 |issue=1–2 |pages=25–34 |doi=10.1007/s10516-005-4204-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is also often called [[systems biology]] and aims to understand the most fundamental aspects of life. A closely related approach to CSB and systems biology called relational biology is concerned mainly with understanding life processes in terms of the most important relations, and categories of such relations among the essential functional components of organisms; for multicellular organisms, this has been defined as "categorical biology", or a model representation of organisms as a [[category theory]] of biological relations, as well as an [[algebraic topology]] of the [[functional organization]] of living organisms in terms of their dynamic, complex [[Biological network|networks]] of metabolic, genetic, and [[epigenetic]] processes and [[signaling pathway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |last1=Rosen |first1=R. |date=1958a |title=A Relational Theory of Biological Systems |url= |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=245–60 |doi=10.1007/bf02478302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |last1=Rosen |first1=R. |date=1958b |title=The Representation of Biological Systems from the Standpoint of the Theory of Categories |url= |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=317–41 |doi=10.1007/bf02477890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative but closely related approaches focus on the interdependance of constraints, where constraints can be either molecular, such as enzymes, or macroscopic, such as the geometry of a bone or of the vascular system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Montévil |first=Maël |last2=Mossio |first2=Matteo |date=2015-05-07 |year= |title=Biological organisation as closure of constraints |url=https://www.academia.edu/11705712 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=372 |pages=179–91 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.02.029 |pmid=25752259 |via= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117143806/http://www.academia.edu/11705712/Biological_organisation_as_closure_of_constraints |archivedate=17 November 2017 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.701.3373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Darwinian dynamic====
It has also been argued that the evolution of order in living systems and certain physical systems obeys a common fundamental principle termed the Darwinian dynamic.&lt;ref name="Harris Bernstein, Henry C. Byerly, Frederick A. Hopf, Richard A. Michod and G. Krishna Vemulapalli 185"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Darwinian Dynamic |volume=58 |issue=2 |author1=Harris Bernstein |author2=Henry C.

The underlying order-generating process was concluded to be basically similar for both types of systems.&lt;ref name="Harris Bernstein, Henry C. Byerly, Frederick A. Hopf, Richard A. Michod and G. Krishna Vemulapalli 185"/&gt;

====Operator theory====
Another systemic definition called the operator theory proposes that "life is a general term for the presence of the typical closures found in organisms; the typical closures are a membrane and an autocatalytic set in the cell"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Pursuit of Complexity: The Utility of Biodiversity from an Evolutionary Perspective |last=Jagers |first=Gerard |publisher=KNNV Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=978-90-5011-443-1 |location= |pages= |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that an organism is any system with an organisation that complies with an operator type that is at least as complex as the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Towards a Hierarchical Definition of Life, the Organism, and Death |journal=Foundations of Science |volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Explaining the Origin of Life is not Enough for a Definition of Life |journal=Foundations of Science |volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The role of logic and insight in the search for a definition of life |journal=J.

Some of the earliest theories of life were materialist, holding that all that exists is matter, and that life is merely a complex form or arrangement of matter. [[Empedocles]] (430 BC) argued that everything in the universe is made up of a combination of [[Classical element|four eternal "elements"]] or "roots of all": earth, water, air, and fire. All change is explained by the arrangement and rearrangement of these four elements. The various forms of life are caused by an appropriate mixture of elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Parry |date=4 March 2005 |title=Empedocles |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/empedocles/ |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Democritus]] (460 BC) thought that the essential characteristic of life is having a [[soul]] (''psyche''). Like other ancient writers, he was attempting to explain what makes something a ''living'' thing. His explanation was that fiery atoms make a soul in exactly the same way atoms and void account for any other thing. He elaborates on fire because of the apparent connection between life and heat, and because fire moves.&lt;ref name=democritus&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Parry |date=25 August 2010 |title=Democritus |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/#4 |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] materialism that originated in ancient Greece was revived and revised by the French philosopher [[René Descartes]], who held that animals and humans were assemblages of parts that together functioned as a machine. In the 19th century, the advances in [[cell theory]] in biological science encouraged this view. The [[evolution]]ary theory of [[Charles Darwin]] (1859) is a mechanistic explanation for the origin of species by means of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul |last1=Thagard |title=The Cognitive Science of Science: Explanation, Discovery, and Conceptual Change |publisher=MIT Press |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-262-01728-2 |pages=204–05 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJIV19_nZYC&amp;pg=PA204 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903184310/https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJIV19_nZYC&amp;pg=PA204 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hylomorphism===
{{Main|Hylomorphism}}
[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Soul#Aristotle|structure of the souls]] of plants, animals, and humans, according to [[Aristotle]]]]
Hylomorphism is a theory first expressed by the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (322 BC). The application of hylomorphism to biology was important to Aristotle, and [[Aristotle's biology|biology is extensively covered in his extant writings]]. In this view, everything in the material universe has both matter and form, and the form of a living thing is its [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''psyche'', Latin ''anima''). There are three kinds of souls: the ''vegetative soul'' of plants, which causes them to grow and decay and nourish themselves, but does not cause motion and sensation; the ''animal soul'', which causes animals to move and feel; and the ''rational soul'', which is the source of consciousness and reasoning, which (Aristotle believed) is found only in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=On the Soul |last=Aristotle |first= |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=Book II |nopp=y |chapter= |quote= |via=|title-link=On the Soul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each higher soul has all of the attributes of the lower ones. Aristotle believed that while matter can exist without form, form cannot exist without matter, and that therefore the soul cannot exist without the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Don |last1=Marietta |page=104 |title=Introduction to ancient philosophy |publisher=M.

This account is consistent with [[teleological]] explanations of life, which account for phenomena in terms of purpose or goal-directedness. Thus, the whiteness of the polar bear's coat is explained by its purpose of camouflage. The direction of causality (from the future to the past) is in contradiction with the scientific evidence for natural selection, which explains the consequence in terms of a prior cause. Biological features are explained not by looking at future optimal results, but by looking at the past [[evolutionary history]] of a species, which led to the natural selection of the features in question.&lt;ref name=stewert_williams2010&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Steve |last1=Stewart-Williams |date=2010 |title=Darwin, God and the meaning of life: how evolutionary theory undermines everything you thought you knew of life |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-76278-6 |pages=193–94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBp69los_-oC&amp;pg=PA193 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903134432/https://books.google.com/books?id=KBp69los_-oC&amp;pg=PA193 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spontaneous generation ===
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
Spontaneous generation was the belief that living organisms can form without descent from similar organisms. Typically, the idea was that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust or the supposed seasonal generation of mice and insects from mud or garbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Origines Sacrae |last=Stillingfleet |first=Edward |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1697 |isbn= |location= |pages= |quote= |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitalism is the belief that the life-principle is non-material. This originated with [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] (17th century), and remained popular until the middle of the 19th century.

All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, reflecting their [[common descent]]; based on these observations, hypotheses on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a [[universal common ancestor]], from simple [[organic molecule]]s via pre-cellular life to [[protocell]]s and metabolism. Models have been divided into "genes-first" and "metabolism-first" categories, but a recent trend is the emergence of hybrid models that combine both categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coveney |first1=Peter V. |first2=Philip W. |last2=Fowler |title=Modelling biological complexity: a physical scientist's perspective |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |date=2005 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=267–80 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2005.0045|pmc=1578273 |pmid=16849185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no current [[scientific consensus]] as to how life originated. However, most accepted scientific models build on the [[Miller–Urey experiment]] and the work of [[Sidney W. Fox|Sidney Fox]], which show that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesize [[amino acid]]s and other organic compounds from inorganic precursors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars145.php |title=Habitability and Biology: What are the Properties of Life? |accessdate=6 June 2013 |website=Phoenix Mars Mission |publisher=The University of Arizona |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417155949/http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars145.php |archivedate=17 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[phospholipid]]s spontaneously form [[lipid bilayer]]s, the basic structure of a [[cell membrane]].

Living organisms synthesize [[proteins]], which are [[polymer]]s of amino acids using instructions encoded by [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA). [[Protein synthesis]] entails intermediary [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) polymers. One possibility for how life began is that genes originated first, followed by proteins;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Senapathy |first1=Periannan |authorlink=Periannan Senapathy |title=Independent birth of organisms |location=Madison, Wisconsin |publisher=Genome Press |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-9641304-0-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hJFAQAAIAAJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905095531/https://books.google.com/books?id=3hJFAQAAIAAJ |archivedate=5 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative being that proteins came first and then genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eigen |first1=Manfred |first2=Ruthild |last2=Winkler |title=Steps towards life: a perspective on evolution (German edition, 1987) |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1992 |page=31 |isbn=978-0-19-854751-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Steps_towards_life.html?id=R7QTAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because genes and proteins are both required to produce the other, the problem of considering which came first is like that of the [[chicken or the egg]]. Most scientists have adopted the hypothesis that because of this, it is unlikely that genes and proteins arose independently.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2009/05/13/how-rna-got-started-scientists-examine-the-origins-of-life |title=How RNA Got Started: Scientists Look for the Origins of Life |last=Barazesh |first=Solmaz |date=13 May 2009 |work=U.

Therefore, a possibility, first suggested by [[Francis Crick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=James D. |title=Prologue: early speculations and facts about RNA templates |pages=xv–xxiii |work=The RNA World | editor1-first=R.

F. | editor2-last=Atkins |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |location=Cold Spring Harbor, New York |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that the first life was based on [[RNA]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which has the DNA-like properties of information storage and the [[catalysis|catalytic]] properties of some proteins. This is called the [[RNA world hypothesis]], and it is supported by the observation that many of the most critical components of cells (those that [[Evolution|evolve]] the slowest) are composed mostly or entirely of RNA. Also, many critical cofactors ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Acetyl-CoA]], [[NADH]], etc.) are either nucleotides or substances clearly related to them.

One issue with the RNA world hypothesis is that synthesis of RNA from simple inorganic precursors is more difficult than for other organic molecules. One reason for this is that RNA precursors are very stable and react with each other very slowly under ambient conditions, and it has also been proposed that living organisms consisted of other molecules before RNA.&lt;ref name=Cech&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cech |first1=T.R. |date=2011 |title=The RNA Worlds in Context |url= |journal=Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol |volume=4 |issue=7 |page= |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a006742 |pmid=21441585 |pages=a006742 |pmc=3385955}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the successful synthesis of certain RNA molecules under the conditions that existed prior to life on Earth has been achieved by adding alternative precursors in a specified order with the precursor [[phosphate]] present throughout the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Powner |first1=Matthew W. |first2=Béatrice |last2=Gerland |first3=John D. |last3=Sutherland |title=Synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides in prebiotically plausible conditions |journal=Nature |volume=459 |pages=239–42 |date=14 May 2009 |doi=10.1038/nature08013 |pmid=19444213 |bibcode=2009Natur.459..239P |issue=7244}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study makes the RNA world hypothesis more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szostak |first1=Jack W. |title=Origins of life: Systems chemistry on early Earth |journal=Nature |volume=459 |pages=171–72 |date=14 May 2009 |doi=10.1038/459171a |bibcode=2009Natur.459..171S |issue=7244 |pmid=19444196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DNA====
{{Main|DNA}}
Deoxyribonucleic acid is a [[molecule]] that carries most of the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and [[reproduction]] of all known living [[organism]]s and many viruses. DNA and [[RNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s; alongside [[protein]]s and [[Polysaccharide|complex carbohydrates]], they are one of the three major types of [[macromolecules|macromolecule]] that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two [[biopolymer]] strands coiled around each other to form a [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]]. The two DNA strands are known as [[polynucleotide]]s since they are composed of [[monomer|simpler units]] called [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna |title=DNA |date=5 February 2016 |website=Basic Biology |publisher= |access-date=15 November 2016 |last1=Purcell |first1=Adam |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/ |archivedate=5 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each nucleotide is composed of a [[nitrogenous base|nitrogen-containing]] [[nucleobase]]—either [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G), [[adenine]] (A), or [[thymine]] (T)—as well as a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]] and a [[phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. According to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T, and C with G), [[hydrogen bond]]s bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA [[base pair]]s on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;, and weighs 50 billion [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150718-rn"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nuwer |first=Rachel |date=18 July 2015 |title=Counting All the DNA on Earth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2015-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718153742/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |archivedate=18 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- PLOS paper cited by NYT used 'tonne' unit. ---&gt; In comparison, the total [[Biomass (ecology)|mass]] of the [[biosphere]] has been estimated to be as much as 4 [[tonnes#Derived units|TtC]] (trillion tons of [[carbon]]).&lt;ref name="AGCI-2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agci.org/classroom/biosphere/index.php |title=The Biosphere: Diversity of Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Aspen Global Change Institute |location=Basalt, CO |accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- Aspen Global Change Institute (US-based) defined TtC as 'trillion tons of C'. ---&gt;

DNA stores biological information. The DNA backbone is resistant to cleavage, and both strands of the double-stranded structure store the same biological information. Biological information is replicated as the two strands are separated. A significant portion of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.

The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. Under the [[genetic code]], [[RNA]] strands are translated to specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins. These RNA strands are initially created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

Within cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. During [[cell division]] these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] (animals, plants, [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some of their DNA in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondria]] or [[chloroplasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Peter |title=iGenetics |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8053-4553-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s (bacteria and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]]. Within the chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins such as [[histone]]s compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

DNA was first isolated by [[Friedrich Miescher]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dahm R |title=Discovering DNA: Friedrich Miescher and the early years of nucleic acid research |journal=Hum.

==Classification==
{{Main|Biological classification}}
{{Biological classification}}
Life is usually classified by eight levels of taxa—domains, kingdoms, phyla, class, order, family, genus, and species. In May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion [[species]] are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.&lt;ref name="NSF-2016002" /&gt;

The first known attempt to classify organisms was conducted by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC), who classified all living organisms known at that time as either a plant or an animal, based mainly on their ability to move. He also distinguished animals with blood from animals without blood (or at least without red blood), which can be compared with the concepts of [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s respectively, and divided the blooded animals into five groups: viviparous quadrupeds ([[mammal]]s), oviparous quadrupeds (reptiles and [[amphibian]]s), birds, fishes and [[Cetacea|whales]]. The bloodless animals were also divided into five groups: [[cephalopod]]s, [[crustacean]]s, insects (which included the spiders, [[scorpion]]s, and [[centipede]]s, in addition to what we define as insects today), shelled animals (such as most [[mollusc]]s and [[echinoderm]]s), and "[[zoophyte]]s" (animals that resemble plants). Though Aristotle's work in zoology was not without errors, it was the grandest biological synthesis of the time and remained the ultimate authority for many centuries after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html|title=Aristotle|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|via=|accessdate=15 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120124920/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html|archivedate=20 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploration of the Americas revealed large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification. In the latter part of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, careful study of animals commenced and was gradually extended until it formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for classification. In the late 1740s, [[Carl Linnaeus]] introduced his system of [[binomial nomenclature]] for the classification of species. Linnaeus attempted to improve the composition and reduce the length of the previously used many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetoric, introducing new descriptive terms and precisely defining their meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Knapp S, Lamas G, Lughadha EN, Novarino G |title=Stability or stasis in the names of organisms: the evolving codes of nomenclature |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B]] |volume=359 |issue=1444 |pages=611–22 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15253348 |pmc=1693349 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1445 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0962-8436&amp;volume=359&amp;issue=1444&amp;spage=611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fungi were originally treated as plants. For a short period Linnaeus had classified them in the taxon [[Vermes]] in Animalia, but later placed them back in Plantae. [[Herbert Copeland|Copeland]] classified the Fungi in his Protoctista, thus partially avoiding the problem but acknowledging their special status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Kingdoms of Organisms |journal=Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=13|issue=4 |doi=10.1086/394568 |year=1938 |page=383 | last1 = Copeland | first1 = Herbert F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was eventually solved by [[Robert Whittaker|Whittaker]], when he gave them their own [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] in his [[five-kingdom system]]. [[Evolutionary history of life|Evolutionary history]] shows that the fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Whittaker |first1=R.

As new discoveries enabled detailed study of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and microorganisms, new groups of life were revealed, and the fields of [[cell biology]] and [[microbiology]] were created. These new organisms were originally described separately in [[protozoa]] as animals and [[thallophyte|protophyta/thallophyta]] as plants, but were united by [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]] in the kingdom [[Protista]]; later, the [[prokaryote]]s were split off in the kingdom [[Monera]], which would eventually be divided into two separate groups, the Bacteria and the [[Archaea]]. This led to the [[six-kingdom system]] and eventually to the current [[three-domain system]], which is based on evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref name="Woese1990"/&gt; However, the classification of eukaryotes, especially of protists, is still controversial.&lt;ref name="Adl 05"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Adl SM, Simpson AG, Farmer MA, etal |title=The new higher level classification of eukaryotes with emphasis on the taxonomy of protists |journal=J.

As microbiology, [[molecular biology]] and [[virology]] developed, non-cellular reproducing agents were discovered, such as viruses and [[viroid]]s. Whether these are considered alive has been a matter of debate; viruses lack characteristics of life such as cell membranes, metabolism and the ability to grow or respond to their environments. Viruses can still be classed into "species" based on their biology and [[genetics]], but many aspects of such a classification remain controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Van Regenmortel MH |title=Virus species and virus identification: past and current controversies |journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=133–44 |date=January 2007 |pmid=16713373 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2006.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s a trend called [[cladistics]] emerged, arranging [[taxa]] based on [[clade]]s in an [[phylogenetic tree|evolutionary or phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Pennisi E |title=Taxonomy.

There are two primary types of cells. [[Prokaryote]]s lack a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s, although they have circular DNA and [[ribosome]]s. Bacteria and [[Archaea]] are two [[domain (biology)|domains]] of prokaryotes. The other primary type of cells are the [[eukaryote]]s, which have distinct nuclei bound by a nuclear membrane and membrane-bound organelles, including [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[lysosomes]], rough and smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]], and [[vacuoles]]. In addition, they possess organized chromosomes that store genetic material. All species of large complex organisms are eukaryotes, including animals, plants and fungi, though most species of eukaryote are [[protist]] [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Whitman |first1=W. |last2=Coleman |first2=D. |last3=Wiebe |first3=W. |title=Prokaryotes: The unseen majority |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=12 |pages=6578–83 |date=1998 |pmid=9618454 |pmc=33863 |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.6578W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventional model is that eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes, with the main organelles of the eukaryotes forming through [[endosymbiosis]] between bacteria and the progenitor eukaryotic cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Norman R. |last1=Pace |title=Concept Time for a change |journal=Nature |volume=441 |page=289 |date=18 May 2006 |doi=10.1038/441289a |url=http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/NAS/Kang/BIOL3231/Week3-Pace_2006.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68GROFAbU?url=http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/NAS/Kang/BIOL3231/Week3-Pace_2006.pdf |archivedate=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2 June 2012 |pmid=16710401 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..289P |issue=7091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The molecular mechanisms of [[cell biology]] are based on [[protein]]s. Most of these are synthesized by the ribosomes through an [[Enzyme catalysis|enzyme-catalyzed]] process called [[protein biosynthesis]]. A sequence of amino acids is assembled and joined together based upon [[gene expression]] of the cell's nucleic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific background |website=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 |publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/advanced.html |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150754/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/advanced.html |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In eukaryotic cells, these proteins may then be transported and processed through the [[Golgi apparatus]] in preparation for dispatch to their destination.&lt;ref name="pmid20605430"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Passage through the Golgi |journal=Curr Opin Cell Biol |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=471–78 |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2010.05.003 |pmid=20605430 |vauthors=Nakano A, Luini A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells reproduce through a process of [[cell division]] in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. For prokaryotes, cell division occurs through a process of [[Fission (biology)|fission]] in which the DNA is replicated, then the two copies are attached to parts of the cell membrane. In [[eukaryote]]s, a more complex process of [[mitosis]] is followed. However, the end result is the same; the resulting cell copies are identical to each other and to the original cell (except for [[mutations]]), and both are capable of further division following an [[interphase]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joseph |last1=Panno |title=The Cell |series=Facts on File science library |publisher=Infobase Publishing |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-8160-6736-7 |pages=60–70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sYgKY6zz20YC&amp;pg=PA60 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904151747/https://books.google.com/books?id=sYgKY6zz20YC&amp;pg=PA60 |archivedate=4 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multicellular organism]]s may have first evolved through the formation of [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] of identical cells. These cells can form group organisms through [[cell adhesion]]. The individual members of a colony are capable of surviving on their own, whereas the members of a true multi-cellular organism have developed specializations, making them dependent on the remainder of the organism for survival. Such organisms are formed [[Clone (cell biology)|clonally]] or from a single [[germ cell]] that is capable of forming the various specialized cells that form the adult organism. This specialization allows multicellular organisms to exploit resources more efficiently than single cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |display-authors=1 |first1=Bruce |last1=Alberts |first2=Dennis |last2=Bray |first3=Julian |last3=Lewis |first4=Martin |last4=Raff |first5=Keith |last5=Roberts |first6=James D. |last6=Watson |chapter=From Single Cells to Multicellular Organisms |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Garland Science |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-8153-1620-6 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28332/ |accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306165115/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28332/ |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, scientists reported that, [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|about 800 million years ago]], a [[Evolutionary developmental biology|minor genetic change]] in a single [[molecule]], called GK-PID, may have allowed [[organism]]s to go from a [[Unicellular organism|single cell organism]] to [[Multicellular organism|one of many cells]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20160107"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Genetic Flip Helped Organisms Go From One Cell to Many |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/science/genetic-flip-helped-organisms-go-from-one-cell-to-many.html |date=7 January 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=7 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107204432/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/science/genetic-flip-helped-organisms-go-from-one-cell-to-many.html |archivedate=7 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells have evolved methods to perceive and respond to their microenvironment, thereby enhancing their adaptability. [[Cell signaling]] coordinates cellular activities, and hence governs the basic functions of multicellular organisms. Signaling between cells can occur through direct cell contact using [[juxtacrine signalling]], or indirectly through the exchange of agents as in the [[endocrine system]]. In more complex organisms, coordination of activities can occur through a dedicated [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name=alberts2002&gt;{{cite book |display-authors=1 |first1=Bruce |last1=Alberts |first2=Alexander |last2=Johnson |first3=Julian |last3=Lewis |first4=Martin |last4=Raff |first5=Keith |last5=Roberts |first6=Peter |last6=Walter |chapter=General Principles of Cell Communication |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |location=New York |publisher=Garland Science |date=2002 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26813/ |accessdate=12 June 2012 |isbn=978-0-8153-3218-3 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904000612/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26813/ |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the Solar System, the region around another [[main sequence|main-sequence star]] that could support Earth-like life on an Earth-like planet is known as the [[habitable zone]]. The inner and outer radii of this zone vary with the luminosity of the star, as does the time interval during which the zone survives. Stars more massive than the Sun have a larger habitable zone, but remain on the Sun-like "main sequence" of [[stellar evolution]] for a shorter time interval. Small [[red dwarf]]s have the opposite problem, with a smaller habitable zone that is subject to higher levels of magnetic activity and the effects of [[tidal locking]] from close orbits. Hence, stars in the intermediate mass range such as the Sun may have a greater likelihood for Earth-like life to develop.&lt;ref name=selis2006&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Frank |last1=Selis |date=2006 |chapter=Habitability: the point of view of an astronomer |title=Lectures in Astrobiology |volume=2 |editor1-first=Muriel |editor1-last=Gargaud |editor2-first=Hervé |editor2-last=Martin |editor3-first=Philippe |editor3-last=Claeys |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-33692-1 |pages=210–14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uYmP0K5PXEC&amp;pg=PA210 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903233938/https://books.google.com/books?id=3uYmP0K5PXEC&amp;pg=PA210 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the star within a galaxy may also affect the likelihood of life forming.

After death, the remains of an organism re-enter the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Organisms may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]] and leftover [[organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms that recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]].

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. Death would seem to refer to either the moment life ends, or when the state that follows life begins.&lt;ref name=define_death/&gt; However, determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071129/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |archivedate=1 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing conceptual lines between life and death. This is problematic, however, because there is little consensus over how to define life. The nature of death has for millennia been a central concern of the world's religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry. Many religions maintain faith in either a kind of [[afterlife]] or [[reincarnation]] for the [[soul]], or [[resurrection]] of the body at a later date.

===Extinction===
{{Main|Extinction}}
Extinction is the process by which a group of [[taxa]] or [[species]] dies out, reducing biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Extinction&amp;nbsp;– definition |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861609974/extinction.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwseRB80?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861609974/extinction.html |archivedate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moment of extinction is generally considered the death of the last individual of that species. Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively after a period of apparent absence. Species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing [[habitat]] or against superior competition. In [[History of the Earth|Earth's history]], over 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Triassic/extinction.htm |title=What is an extinction? |website=Late Triassic |publisher=Bristol University |accessdate=27 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901011807/http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/palaeofiles/triassic/extinction.htm |archivedate=1 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book-Biology"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Kunin, W.E. |editor2=Gaston, Kevin |title=The Biology of Rarity: Causes and consequences of rare—common differences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=31 December 1996 |isbn=978-0-412-63380-5 |accessdate=26 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905164104/https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StearnsStearns2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearns |first=Beverly Peterson |last2=Stearns |first2=S.

===Fossils===
{{Main|Fossils}}
Fossils are the preserved remains or [[trace fossil|traces]] of animals, plants, and other organisms from the remote past. The totality of fossils, both discovered and undiscovered, and their placement in fossil-containing [[rock (geology)|rock]] formations and [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] layers ([[stratum|strata]]) is known as the ''fossil record''. A preserved specimen is called a fossil if it is older than the arbitrary date of 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/science/paleontology/resources/frequent/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum|accessdate=25 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510101706/http://sdnhm.org/science/paleontology/resources/frequent/|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, fossils range in age from the youngest at the start of the [[Holocene]] Epoch to the oldest from the [[Archean|Archaean]] Eon, up to 3.4 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Brian |last1=Vastag |title=Oldest 'microfossils' raise hopes for life on Mars |date=21 August 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-microfossils-hail-from-34-billion-years-ago-raise-hopes-for-life-on-mars/2011/08/19/gIQAHK8UUJ_story.html?hpid=z3 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019000458/http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-microfossils-hail-from-34-billion-years-ago-raise-hopes-for-life-on-mars/2011/08/19/gIQAHK8UUJ_story.html?hpid=z3 |archivedate=19 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=Geological Team Lays Claim to Oldest Known Fossils |date=21 August 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/science/earth/22fossil.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig |work=The New York Times |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501085118/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/science/earth/22fossil.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig |archivedate=1 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Life extension''' is the idea of extending the human [[life expectancy|lifespan]], either modestly &amp;ndash; through improvements in medicine &amp;ndash; or dramatically by increasing the [[maximum lifespan]] beyond its generally settled limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name=turner&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner BS |title=Can We Live Forever? A Sociological and Moral Inquiry |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2009 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to achieve such dramatic changes, however, does not currently exist.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;

Some researchers in this area, and "life extensionists", "immortalists" or "longevists" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]], [[stem cell]]s, [[regenerative medicine]], [[molecular]] repair, [[gene therapy]], pharmaceuticals, and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] replacement (such as with artificial organs or [[xenotransplantation]]s) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|agerasia}}&lt;/ref&gt;) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition. The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by [[bioethicist]]s.

The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50&amp;nbsp;billion of revenue a year in 2009.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt; The use of such products has not been proven to be effective or safe.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holliday&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9170-6 |pmid=18726707 |title=The extreme arrogance of anti-aging medicine |journal=Biogerontology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=223–8 |year=2008 |last1=Holliday |first1=Robin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"/&gt;&lt;ref name= EMBOSENS/&gt;

==Average and maximum lifespan==
{{Main|Senescence}}
During the process of [[aging]], an organism accumulates damage to its [[macromolecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[biological tissue|tissues]], and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. Specifically, aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by "genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2013 | title = The hallmarks of aging | journal = Cell | volume = 153 | issue = 6| pages = 1194–1217 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039 | pmid = 23746838 | pmc = 3836174 | author1 = López-Otín | first1 = C | last2 = Blasco | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Partridge | first3 = L | last4 = Serrano | first4 = M | last5 = Kroemer | first5 = G }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxidation]] damage to cellular contents caused by [[free radicals]] is believed to contribute to aging as well.&lt;ref name="Halliwell B 2007"&gt;Halliwell B, Gutteridge JMC (2007). Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, USA, {{ISBN|019856869X}}, {{ISBN|978-0198568698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1383772 | volume=275 | issue=3–6 | title=Oxidative and other DNA damages as the basis of aging: a review | date=September 1992 | pages=305–15 | doi=10.1016/0921-8734(92)90034-M | journal=Mutation Research/DNAging| author1=Holmes | first1=G. E. | last2=Bernstein | first2=C | last3=Bernstein | first3=H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest a human has ever been proven to live is 122 years, the case of [[Jeanne Calment]] who was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a [[wildtype]] [[mouse]], commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years.&lt;ref name="Mouse Genome Informatics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/other/mouse_facts1.shtml|title=Mouse Facts|publisher=informatics.jax.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of [[DNA repair]], [[antioxidant]] defenses, [[energy metabolism]], [[proteostasis]] maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as [[autophagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senescence.info/causes_of_aging.html|title=What Causes Aging? Damage-Based Theories of Aging|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average lifespan in a population is lowered by [[infant mortality|infant]] and [[child mortality]], which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age-related [[chronic disease]] such as [[cancer]] or [[cardiovascular disease]] play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, [[vaccinations]], good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]].

[[Maximum lifespan]] is determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as [[nematode]]s, fruit flies, and mice include [[caloric restriction]], [[gene manipulation]], and administration of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Aging biology: a new frontier for drug discovery | journal = Expert Opin Drug Discov | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 217–229 | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2012.660144 | pmid = 22468953 | author1 = Verdaguer | first1 = E | last2 = Junyent | first2 = F | last3 = Folch | first3 = J | last4 = Beas-Zarate | first4 = C | last5 = Auladell | first5 = C | last6 = Pallàs | first6 = M | last7 = Camins | first7 = A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = The evolution of late life | journal = Ageing Res Rev. | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 14–32 | doi = 10.1016/j.arr.2005.06.003 | pmid = 16085467 | author1 = Rauser | first1 = C.

===Diets and supplements===
Much life extension research focuses on nutrition—[[diet (nutrition)|diets]] or [[dietary supplement|supplements]]— although there is little evidence that they have an effect. The many diets promoted by anti-aging advocates are often contradictory. {{original research inline|date=January 2015}}

In some studies [[calorie restriction]] has been shown to extend the life of mice, yeast, and rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=redmanCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Metabolic and behavioral compensations in response to caloric restriction: implications for the maintenance of weight loss | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 2| page = e4377 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004377 | pmid=19198647 | pmc=2634841 | author=[[Leanne Redman|Redman LM]], Heilbronn LK, Martin CK, de Jonge L, Williamson DA, Delany JP, Ravussin E| bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4377R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=source6&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holloszy JO|author2= Fontana L | year = 2007 | title = Caloric restriction in humans | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 42 | issue = 8| pages = 709–12 | doi=10.1016/j.exger.2007.03.009 | pmid=17482403 | pmc=2020845}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent study did not find calorie restriction to improve survival in rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=mattisonCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Impact of caloric restriction on health and survival in rhesus monkeys from the NIA study | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7415| pages = 318–321 | doi=10.1038/nature11432 | pmid=22932268 | pmc=3832985 | author=Mattison JA, Roth GS, Beasley TM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2012Natur.489..318M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans the long-term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown.&lt;ref name='Spindler, 2010'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spindler |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Future of Aging |pages=367–438 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3999-6_12 |chapter=Biological Effects of Calorie Restriction: Implications for Modification of Human Aging |isbn=978-90-481-3998-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[free-radical theory]] of [[aging]] suggests that [[antioxidant]] supplements might extend human life. However, evidence suggest that [[beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] supplements and high doses of vitamin&amp;nbsp;E increase mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bjelakovic, Goran|author2= Nikolova, Dimitrinka|author3= Lotte Gluud, Lise|author4= Simonetti Rosa G.|author5= Gluud Christian | year = 2007 | title = Mortality in Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for Primary and Secondary Prevention, a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 8| pages = 842–857 | doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 | pmid=17327526}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resveratrol]] is a [[Sir2|sirtuin]] stimulant that has been shown to extend life in animal models, but the effect of resveratrol on lifespan in humans is unclear as of 2011.&lt;ref name=Fer2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernández AF|author2= Fraga MF | title = The effects of the dietary polyphenol resveratrol on human healthy aging and lifespan | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 870–4 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21613817 | doi = 10.4161/epi.6.7.16499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hormone treatment===
The anti-aging industry offers several [[hormone therapies]]. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers and a lack of proven effect. For example, the [[American Medical Association]] has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{Cite news |first=Bruce |last=Japsen |date=15 June 2009 |title=AMA report questions science behind using hormones as anti-aging treatment |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-15/news/0906140132_1_anti-aging-hormones-ama-council |work=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[growth hormone]] (GH) decreases with age, the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies. There are mixed reports that GH or [[IGF-1]] modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative.&lt;ref name=AgingMaleRev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sattler FR | title = Growth hormone in the aging male | journal = Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–55 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 24054930 | doi = 10.1016/j.beem.2013.05.003 | quote = In animal models, alterations in GH/IGF-1 signaling with reductions in these somatotrophs appear to increase life span. &amp;nbsp;... Administration of IGF-1Eb (mechanogrowth factor) stimulates proliferation of myoblasts and induces muscle hypertrophy. Increases in GH and IGF-1 during adolescence are beneficial for brain and cardiovascular function during the aging process and GH administration during adolescence is vasoprotective and increases life-span.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;... Studies relating GH and IGF-1 status to longevity provide inconsistent evidence as to whether decreased (somatopause) or high levels (e.g. acromegaly) of these hormones are beneficial or detrimental to longevity.&amp;nbsp;...

The extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history, from the Sumerian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the Egyptian [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Smith medical papyrus]], all the way through the [[Taoists]], [[Ayurveda]] practitioners, [[alchemists]], [[hygienist]]s such as [[Luigi Cornaro]], Johann Cohausen and [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], and philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[René Descartes]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and Nicolas [[Condorcet]]. However, the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, to the so-called "[[fin-de-siècle]]" (end of the century) period, denoted as an "end of an epoch" and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism, entailing the pursuit of life extension (or life-extensionism). Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist [[Elie Metchnikoff]] (1845-1916) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris, and [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] (1817-1894) -- the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Ilia|title=A History of Life-Extensionism in the Twentieth Century|date=2014|publisher=Longevity History|isbn=1500818577|url=http://www.longevityhistory.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He cites [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life, noting Bacon's novel ''[[New Atlantis]]'', wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691), founding member of the [[Royal Society]], also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension, according to Hughes, and proposed such experiments as "to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young". Biologist [[Alexis Carrel]] (1873–1944) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with [[Cell (biology)|cells]], says Hughes.&lt;ref name="HughesTranshumanism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=James|author-link=James Hughes (sociologist)|title=Leadership in Science and Technology: A Reference Handbook|date=October 20, 2011|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=1452266522|page=587|chapter=Transhumanism|editor1-last=Bainbridge|editor1-first=William|editor1-link=William Sims Bainbridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the [[American Aging Association]] was formed under the impetus of [[Denham Harman]], originator of the [[free radical theory]] of [[aging]]. Harman wanted an organization of [[biogerontologist]]s that was devoted to research and to the sharing of information among scientists interested in extending human lifespan.

In 1976, futurists Joel Kurtzman and Philip Gordon wrote ''No More Dying. The Conquest Of Aging And The Extension Of Human Life'', ({{ISBN|0-440-36247-4}}) the first popular book on research to extend human lifespan. Subsequently, Kurtzman was invited to testify before the House Select Committee on Aging, chaired by [[Claude Pepper]] of Florida, to discuss the impact of life extension on the Social Security system.

[[Saul Kent]] published ''The Life Extension Revolution'' ({{ISBN|0-688-03580-9}}) in 1980 and created a [[nutraceutical]] firm called the [[Life Extension Foundation]], a non-profit organization that promotes dietary supplements. The Life Extension Foundation publishes a periodical called ''Life Extension Magazine''. The 1982 bestselling book ''[[Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach]]'' ({{ISBN|0-446-51229-X}}) by [[Durk Pearson]] and [[Sandy Shaw (writer)|Sandy Shaw]] further popularized the phrase "life extension".

Regulatory and legal struggles between the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the Life Extension Foundation included seizure of merchandise and court action. In 1991, [[Saul Kent]] and Bill Faloon, the principals of the Foundation, were jailed. The LEF accused the FDA of perpetrating a "Holocaust" and "seeking gestapo-like power" through its regulation of drugs and marketing claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ty |last=Clevenger |date=Summer 2000 |title=Internet pharmacies: cyberspace versus the regulatory state |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |journal=Journal of Law and Health |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918191534/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |archivedate=18 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] published "The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging," by [[Michael D. West]]. West emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=West, Michael D. |title=The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZnuAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0-385-50928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern life extensionists include writer [[Gennady Stolyarov II|Gennady Stolyarov]], who insists that death is "the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology";&lt;ref name="stolyarov"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Stolyarov|first1 = Gennady|title = Death is Wrong|date = November 25, 2013|publisher = Rational Argumentator Press|isbn = 978-0615932040|url = http://rationalargumentator.com/Death_is_Wrong_Second_Edition_Full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[Zoltan Istvan]], who proposes that the "transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else";&lt;ref name="istvan"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Istvan|first1=Zoltan|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/the-three-laws-of-transhu_b_5853596.html |title=The Morality of Artificial Intelligence and the Three Laws of Transhumanism |publisher=Huffington Post |date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; futurist [[George Dvorsky]], who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved;&lt;ref name=aja&gt;{{cite web|title=Futurist: 'I will reap benefits of life extension'|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/fault-lines/articles/2015/5/7/futurist-itll-start-to-become-ridiculous-not-to-talk-about-curing-aging.html|website=Al Jazeera America|date=May 7, 2015|quote=To Dvorsky, aging is a problem that’s desperately in need of solving.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording artist [[Steve Aoki]], who has been called "one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension".&lt;ref name=tez&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tez|first1=Riva Melissa|title=Steve Aoki, Dan Bilzerian, a giraffe and the search for eternal life|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/steve-aoki-dan-bilzerian-a-giraffe-and-the-search-for-eternal-life|website=i-D|publisher=VICE|date=May 11, 2015|quote=Unknown to most, Steve is both an undeniable champion of life expansion as well as one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension.

[...] Set up by the Steve Aoki Charitable Fund, the profits from the Dan Bilzerian party went to life extension research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===

In 1991, the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M) was formed. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] recognizes neither anti-aging medicine nor the A4M's professional standing.&lt;ref name="NYTPoison"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alex |last= Kuczynski |date=12 April 1998 |title=Anti-Aging Potion Or Poison? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/style/anti-aging-potion-or-poison.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Aubrey de Grey]] and [[David Gobel]] formed the [[Methuselah Foundation]], which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects. In 2009, de Grey and several others founded the [[SENS Research Foundation]], a California-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sens.org/files/pdf/2011_Research_Report.pdf research report 2011]. Sens Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Google]] announced [[Calico (company)|Calico]], a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/tech/innovation/google-calico-aging-death/|title=How Google's Calico aims to fight aging and 'solve death'|author=Arion McNicoll, Arion |date=3 October 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by [[Arthur D.

Barron]], [[David Botstein]], and [[Cynthia Kenyon]]. In 2014, biologist [[Craig Venter]] founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy. They received funding with the goal of compiling a comprehensive human genotype, microbiome, and phenotype database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/human-longevity-inc-hli-launched-to-promote-healthy-aging-using-advances-in-genomics-and-stem-cell-therapies-248379091.html|title=Human Longevity Inc.

Aside from private initiatives, aging research is being conducted in university laboratories, and includes universities such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. University researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/05/health/young-blood-mice-aging/|title=Young blood makes old mice more youthful|author=Landau, Elizabeth |date=5 May 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/gdf11-protein-aging-mice-harvard/31929/ "Harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process"].

==Ethics and politics ==
Politics relevant to the substances of life extension pertain mostly to communications and availability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;!--Need some clarification here. The title implies the discussion is on the politics/ethics of all life extension practices, not just marketing of pharma/surgery--&gt;

In the [[United States]], product claims on food and drug labels are strictly regulated. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] ([[freedom of speech]]) protects third-party publishers' rights to distribute fact, opinion and speculation on life extension practices. Manufacturers and suppliers also provide informational publications, but because they market the substances, they are subject to monitoring and enforcement by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), which polices claims by marketers. What constitutes the difference between truthful and false claims is hotly debated and is a central controversy in this arena.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}&lt;!--This is just the opening paragraph, describing the political arena and stage of conflict. More to follow.--&gt;

===Scientific controversy===
Some critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example, [[Leonard Hayflick]], who determined that [[fibroblast]]s are limited to around 50&amp;nbsp;cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of [[entropy]]. Hayflick and fellow [[biogerontologist]]s [[S. Jay Olshansky|Jay Olshansky]] and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging [[dietary supplement|supplements]].&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Position statement on human aging |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=B292–7 |date=1 August 2002 |pmid=12145354 |doi=10.1093/gerona/57.8.B292|author1=Olshansky |first1=S. J. |last2=Hayflick |first2=L |last3=Carnes |first3=B. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This may be a good place to link into the broader social debate on life extension ethics. Hayflick is not the only one to object to the portrayal/treatment of aging as a disease. Many doctors, social scientists, feminists, etc. do too--&gt;

===Consumer motivations ===
Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. When product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 | title = Feedback Information and Consumer Motivation.

===Political parties===
Though many scientists state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging |publisher=Imminst.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that life extension and radical life extension are possible, there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension. There are political forces staying for and against life extension. By 2012, in Russia, the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, the Longevity political parties started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies, and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension, and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php |title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science |publisher=Fightaging.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon Valley===
Some tech innovators and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti-aging research. This includes [[Larry Ellison]] (founder of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]), [[Peter Thiel]] (former [[Paypal]] CEO),&lt;ref&gt;Veritas Forum Q&amp;A with Peter Thiel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQHrJvwnOzo&amp;list=PLCNNepS_4NcyOSlUdWOcTUCeUbK8nuywQ&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Page]] (co-founder of [[Google]]), and [[Peter Diamandis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/silicon-valleys-quest-to-live-forever&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Leon Kass]] (chairman of the US [[President's Council on Bioethics]] from 2001 to 2005) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] problems would make life extension unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Smith |date=3 December 2002 |title=Killing Immortality |url=http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040607195722/http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archivedate=7 June 2004 |publisher=Betterhumans |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states his opposition to life extension with the words:
{{Quote|"simply to covet a prolonged life span for ourselves is both a sign and a cause of our failure to open ourselves to procreation and to any higher purpose ... [The] desire to prolong youthfulness is not only a childish desire to eat one's life and keep it; it is also an expression of a childish and [[narcissistic]] wish incompatible with devotion to posterity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Leon |last=Kass |authorlink= Leon Kass |year=1985 |title=Toward a more natural science: biology and human affairs |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-02-918340-3 |oclc=11677465 |page= 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Harris, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues that as long as life is worth living, according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2007) ''Enhancing Evolution: The ethical case for making better people''. Princeton University Press, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanist]] [[philosopher]] [[Nick Bostrom]] has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"&gt;{{Cite news |first=John |last=Sutherland |date=9 May 2006 |title=The ideas interview: Nick Bostrom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/09/academicexperts.genetics |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 17 July 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an extended metaphor entitled "The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant", Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Bostrom, N |title=The fable of the dragon tyrant |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=273–7 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15863685 |pmc=1734155 |doi= 10.1136/jme.2004.009035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overpopulation concerns===

Controversy about life extension is due to fear of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and possible effects on society.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2005/02/superlongevity-without-overpopulation-1.php|title=Superlongevity Without Overpopulation|work=Fight Aging!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogerontologist [[Aubrey De Grey]] counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate [[menopause]], allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus ''decreasing'' the yearly population growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-ethics-of-anti-aging-by-peter-singer|title=Peter Singer on Should We Live to 1,000? – Project Syndicate|work=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the philosopher and futurist [[Max More]] argues that, given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling, superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"/&gt;

===Opinion polls===

A Spring 2013 [[Pew Research]] poll in the United States found that 38% of Americans would want life extension treatments, and 56% would reject it. However, it also found that 68% believed most people would want it and that only 4% consider an "ideal lifespan" to be more than 120 years. The median "ideal lifespan" was 91 years of age and the majority of the public (63%) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. 41% of Americans believed that radical life extension (RLE) would be good for society, while 51% said they believed it would be bad for society.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; One possibility for why 56% of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude, and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Magalhães JP | year = 2014 | title = The scientific quest for lasting youth: prospects for curing aging | journal = Rejuvenation Res | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 458–67 | doi = 10.1089/rej.2014.1580 | pmid = 25132068 | pmc = 4203147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated,&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/|title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans’ Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension|date=6 August 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some variation exists between religious denominations.

==Aging as a disease==
Mainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. [[David Sinclair (biologist)|David Sinclair]] says: "I&amp;nbsp;don't see aging as a disease, but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hayden EC | year = 2007 | title = A new angle on 'old' | journal = Nature | volume = 450 | issue = 7170| pages = 603–603 | doi = 10.1038/450603a | pmid=18046373| bibcode = 2007Natur.450..603H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not.&lt;ref&gt;Hamerman D. (2007) ''Geriatric Bioscience: The link between aging &amp; disease''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody, director of academic affairs for [[AARP]], notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depend on a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moody HR|title=Who's afraid of life extension?|journal= Generations|volume=25|issue= 4 |year=2002|pages= 33–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Gems, assistant director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing, argues that aging should be viewed as a disease.&lt;ref name=Gems1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Aging: To Treat, or Not to Treat? The possibility of treating aging is not just an idle fantasy | journal = American Scientist | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 278–80 | doi = 10.1511/2011.91.278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the universality of aging, David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that [[Basenji]] are not dogs because they do not bark.&lt;ref name=Gems2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Tragedy and delight: the ethics of decelerated ageing | journal = Philos Trans R Soc B | volume = 366 | issue = 1561| pages = 108–112 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0288| pmc = 3001315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the universality of aging he calls it a "special sort of disease". Robert M. Perlman, coined the terms "aging syndrome" and "disease complex" in 1954 to describe aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Perlman RM | year = 1954 | title = The aging syndrome | journal = J Am Geriatr Soc | volume = 2 | pages = 123–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. One view is, this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.&lt;ref name=Gems2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 15197284| year = 2004| author1 = Mehlman| first1 = M.

==Research==
Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues, reversal of harmful epigenetic changes, or the enhancement of enzyme [[telomerase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rando TA|author2= Chang HY|authorlink2=Howard Y.

Research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through [[genetic engineering]] and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and [[caloric restriction]].&lt;ref name=Shmookle&gt;{{cite journal | date = 2009 | title = Extreme-longevity mutations orchestrate silencing of multiple signaling pathways| journal = Biochim Biophys Acta | volume = 1790 | issue = 10| pages = 1075–83 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.05.011 | pmid = 19465083 | pmc=2885961| author1 = Shmookler Reis| first1 = R. J.| last2 = Bharill| first2 = P| last3 = Tazearslan| first3 = C| last4 = Ayyadevara| first4 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 review of longevity research noted: "Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a "life-extension factor" that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology."&lt;ref name=Shmookle/&gt;

===Anti-aging drugs===

There are a number of chemicals intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Childs et al. (2015). [http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v21/n12/full/nm.4000.html Cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease: from mechanisms to therapy] Nature Medicine {{doi|10.1038/nm.4000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of research is related to the observed effects of a [[calorie restriction]] (CR) diet, which has been shown to extend lifespan in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last2 = Shanmuganayagam| first1 = M. | first2 = D.| last1 = Anderson| title = Caloric restriction and aging: studies in mice and monkeys| last3 = Weindruch | first3 = R.| journal = Toxicologic pathology| volume = 37| issue = 1| pages = 47–51| year = 2009| pmid = 19075044| doi = 10.1177/0192623308329476| pmc = 3734859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that research, there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a caloric restriction diet, which are known as [[Caloric restriction mimetic]] drugs.  Some drugs that are already approved for other uses have been studied for possible longevity effects on laboratory animals because of a possible CR-mimic effect; they include [[rapamycin]],&lt;ref name=source25&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Rapamycin fed late in life extends lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice | journal = Nature | volume = 460 |pages = 392–5 | doi=10.1038/nature08221 | pmid=19587680 | pmc=2786175 | author=Harrison DE, Strong R, Sharp ZD, ''et al.''| bibcode=2009Natur.460..392H }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[metformin]] and other [[geroprotector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2005 | title = Identification of Potential Caloric Restriction Mimetics by Microarray Profiling | journal = Physiological Genomics | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 343–50 | pmid = 16189280 | doi=10.1152/physiolgenomics.00069.2005 | author=Dhahbi JM, Mote PL, Fahy GM, Spindler SR}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MitoQ]], [[resveratrol]] and [[pterostilbene]] are [[dietary supplements]] that have also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Kaeberlein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaeberlein|first=Matt|title=Resveratrol, pterostilbene and rapamycin:are they anti-aging drugs?|journal=BioEssays|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=96–99|doi=10.1002/bies.200900171|pmid=20091754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Low Dose of Dietary Resveratrol Partially Mimics Caloric Restriction and Retards Aging Parameters in Mice | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 3| issue = 6| pages = e2264| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002264 | pmid=18523577 | pmc=2386967 | year=2008 | author=Barger JL, Kayo T, Vann JM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2264B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23691264 | doi=10.1155/2013/575482 | volume=2013 | title=A review of pterostilbene antioxidant activity and disease modification | pmc=3649683 | year=2013 | journal=Oxid Med Cell Longev | page=575482 | author=McCormack D, McFadden D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attempts to create anti-aging drugs have taken different research paths. One notable direction of research has been research into the possibility of using the enzyme [[telomerase]] in order to counter the process of [[telomere shortening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Telomeres and Telomerase Basic Science Implications for Aging | journal = American Geriatrics Society | volume = 49 | issue = 8| pages = 1105–1109 | doi = 10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49217.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are potential dangers in this, since some research has also linked telomerase to cancer and to tumor growth and formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0147| pmid = 16179494| title = Telomerase and Cancer: Kirk A.

===Nanotechnology===
Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated [[Cell (biology)|cell]] repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular [[computers]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical [[nanomachines]] (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Cloning and body part replacement===
Some life extensionists suggest that [[therapeutic cloning]] and [[stem cell]] research could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as [[reproductive cloning]]) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Donald |last=Melanson |date=April 22, 2008 |title=DoD establishes institute tasked with regrowing body parts |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/04/22/dod-establishes-institute-tasked-with-regrowing-body-parts/ |publisher=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to [[transplant rejection|rejection]] and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Roxanne |last=Khamsi |date=April 4, 2006 |title=Bio-engineered bladders successful in patients |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8939-bioengineered-bladders-successful-in-patients.html |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.

The use of human [[stem cells]], particularly [[embryonic stem cells]], is controversial. Opponents' objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Christine |last=White |date=19 August 2005 |title=Umbilical stem cell breakthrough |url=http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720054316/http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |archivedate=20 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversies over cloning are similar, except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to [[reproductive cloning]]. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies, lacking consciousness, for eventual brain transplantation.

===Cyborgs===
{{Main|Cyborg}}
Replacement of biological (susceptible to diseases) organs with mechanical ones could extend life. This is the goal of the [[2045 Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;David Segal for the New York Times. 1 June 2013 [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/dmitry-itskov-and-the-avatar-quest.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 This Man Is Not a Cyborg. Yet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryonics===
{{Main|Cryonics}}
For cryonicists (advocates of [[cryopreservation]]), storing the body at low temperatures after death may provide an "ambulance" into a future in which advanced medical technologies may allow resuscitation and repair. They speculate [[cryogenic]] temperatures will minimize changes in biological tissue for many years, giving the medical community ample time to cure all disease, rejuvenate the aged and repair any damage that is caused by the [[cryopreservation]] process.

Many cryonicists do not believe that [[legal death]] is "[[Medical definition of death|real death]]" because stoppage of [[heart rate|heartbeat]] and [[breath]]ing—the usual medical criteria for legal death—occur before biological death of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Even at room [[temperature]], cells may take hours to die and days to [[decompose]]. Although [[neurological]] damage occurs within 4–6 minutes of cardiac arrest, the irreversible [[neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] processes do not manifest for hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Neuronal necrosis after middle cerebral artery occlusion in Wistar rats progresses at different time intervals in the caudoputamen and the cortex |journal=Stroke |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=636–42; discussion 643 |date=1995 |pmid=7709411 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.26.4.636 |author=Garcia JH, Liu KF, Ho KL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryonicists {{who|date=July 2017}}state that rapid cooling and [[heart|cardio]]-[[lung|pulmonary]] support applied immediately after certification of death can preserve [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] for long-term preservation at [[cryogenic]] [[temperature]]s. People, particularly children, have survived up to an hour without heartbeat after submersion in ice water. In one case, full recovery was reported after 45 minutes underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Full recovery after 45 min accidental submersion |journal=Intensive Care Medicine |volume=28 |issue=4 |page=524 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11967613 |doi=10.1007/s00134-002-1245-2 |author=Perk L, Borger van de Burg F, Berendsen HH, van't Wout JW}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate rapid preservation of cells and tissue, cryonics "standby teams" are available to wait by the bedside of patients who are to be cryopreserved to apply cooling and cardio-pulmonary support as soon as possible after declaration of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/standby.html |title=Comprehensive Member Standby |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[mammal]] has been successfully cryopreserved and brought back to life, with the exception of [[embryo cryopreservation|frozen human embryos]]. Resuscitation of a postembryonic human from [[cryonics]] is not possible with current science. Some scientists still support the idea based on their expectations of the [[technological singularity|capabilities of future science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imminst.org/cryonics_letter/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Cryonics |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html |title=Advances in Cryonics |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategies for engineered negligible senescence===
{{Main|Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|Genetics of aging}}
Another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of [[stem cell]]s and [[tissue engineering]], [[telomere]]-lengthening machinery, [[allotopic expression]] of [[mitochondrial]] proteins, targeted ablation of cells, [[immunotherapy|immunotherapeutic]] clearance, and novel [[lysosome|lysosomal]] [[hydrolases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Aubrey |last=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |author2=Michael Rae |title=[[Ending Aging|Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime]] |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2007 |location=[[New York City]] |isbn= 978-0-312-36706-0 |oclc=132583222}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic editing===
{{Main|Genome editing}}
[[Genome editing]], in which [[nucleic acid]] polymers are delivered as a [[Biologic medical product|drug]] and are either [[gene expression|expressed]] as proteins, interfere with the expression of proteins, or correct genetic mutations, has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Neuroendocrinology of Aging: The Potential of Gene Therapy as an Interventive Strategy |journal=Gerontology |date=2001-01-08 |first=Rodolfo G. |last=Goya |author2=Federico Bolognani |author3=Claudia B.

A large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, and mice. As of 2013, the longest extension of life caused by a single gene manipulation was roughly 50% in mice and 10-fold in [[nematode]] worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks1155| pmid = 23193293| pmc = 3531213| title = Human Ageing Genomic Resources: Integrated databases and tools for the biology and genetics of ageing| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| volume = 41| issue = Database issue| pages = D1027–33| year = 2012| last1 = Tacutu | first1 = R.| last2 = Craig | first2 = T.| last3 = Budovsky | first3 = A.| last4 = Wuttke | first4 = D.| last5 = Lehmann | first5 = G.| last6 = Taranukha | first6 = D.| last7 = Costa | first7 = J.| last8 = Fraifeld | first8 = V.

===Fooling genes===
In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] describes an approach to life-extension that involves "fooling genes" into thinking the body is young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | pages = 41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to [[Peter Medawar]]. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on, and we should be able to do so by "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind uploading===
{{Main|Mind uploading}}
One hypothetical future strategy that, as some suggest,{{who|date=July 2017}} "eliminates" the complications related to a physical body, involves the copying or transferring (e.g. by progressively replacing neurons with transistors) of a conscious mind from a biological brain to a non-biological computer system or computational device. The basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail, and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Anders|last=Sandberg| author1-link=Anders Sandberg|first2=Nick|last2=Boström| author2-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap|quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.''|url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2013|series= Technical Report #2008‐3|year=2008| publisher = Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not an exact copy of one's mind constitutes actual life extension is matter of debate.

===Young blood injection===

'''Living systems''' are open self-organizing life forms that interact with their environment. These systems are maintained by flows of information, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy]] and matter.

Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of [[life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Woodruff | first = T.

Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." [...] "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; Such a general theory, arising out of the [[Ecology|ecological]] and [[Biology|biological sciences]], attempts to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patterns, Flows, and Interrelationship |url=http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |accessdate=2009-06-27 |first=Molly Young |last=Brown |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108122526/http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Living systems theory is a general theory about the existence of all living systems, their [[structure]], [[interaction]], [[behavior]] and [[developmental biology|development]]. This work is created by [[James Grier Miller]], which was intended to formalize the concept of life. According to Miller's original conception as spelled out in his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Living Systems'', a "living system" must contain each of twenty "critical subsystems", which are defined by their functions and visible in numerous systems, from simple cells to organisms, countries, and societies. In ''Living Systems'' Miller provides a detailed look at a number of systems in order of increasing size, and identifies his subsystems in each. 
Miller considers living systems as a subset of all [[system]]s. Below the level of living systems, he defines [[space]] and [[time]], [[matter]] and [[energy]], [[information]] and [[entropy]], levels of [[organization]], and physical and conceptual factors, and above living systems ecological, planetary and solar systems, galaxies, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen, 1998, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Living systems according to Parent (1996) are by definition "open self-organizing [[system]]s that have the special characteristics of life and interact with their [[social environment|environment]]. This takes place by means of information and material-energy exchanges. Living systems can be as simple as a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] or as complex as a supranational [[organization]] such as the European Union. Regardless of their [[complexity]], they each depend upon the same essential twenty subsystems (or processes) in order to survive and to continue the propagation of their species or types beyond a single generation".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Parent, [http://projects.isss.org/the_living_systems_theory_of_james_grier_miller ''The Living Systems Theory of James Grier Miller''], Primer project ISSS, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller said that systems exist at eight "nested" hierarchical levels: cell, organ, organism, group, organization, community, society, and supranational system. At each level, a system invariably comprises twenty critical subsystems, which process matter–energy or information except for the first two, which process both matter–energy and information: reproducer and boundary.

The processors of matter–energy are: 
* ingestor, distributor, converter, producer, storage, extruder, motor, supporter

The processors of information are:
* input transducer, internal transducer, channel and net, timer (added later), decoder, associator, memory, decider, encoder, output transducer.

==Miller's living systems theory==
James Grier Miller in 1978 wrote a 1,102-page volume to present his living systems theory. He constructed a general theory of living [[system]]s by focusing on concrete systems—nonrandom accumulations of matter–energy in physical space–time organized into interacting, interrelated [[subsystem]]s or components. Slightly revising the original model a dozen years later, he distinguished eight "nested" hierarchical levels in such complex structures. Each level is "nested" in the sense that each higher level contains the next lower level in a nested fashion.

His central thesis is that the systems in existence at all eight levels are [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] composed of twenty critical subsystems that process inputs, throughputs, and outputs of various forms of matter–energy and information. Two of these subsystems—reproducer and boundary—process both matter–energy and information. Eight of them process only matter–energy. The other ten process information only. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;All nature is a continuum. The endless complexity of life is organized into patterns which repeat themselves—theme and variations—at each level of system. These similarities and differences are proper concerns for science. From the ceaseless streaming of protoplasm to the many-vectored activities of supranational systems, there are continuous flows through living systems as they maintain their highly organized steady states.&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Seppänen (1998) says that Miller applied [[general systems theory]] on a broad scale to describe all aspects of living systems.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen 1998, pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics in living systems theory===
Miller's theory posits that the mutual interrelationship of the components of a system extends across the hierarchical levels. Examples: Cells and organs of a living system thrive on the food the organism obtains from its suprasystem; the member countries of a supranational system reap the benefits accrued from the communal activities to which each one contributes. Miller says that his eclectic theory "ties together past discoveries from many disciplines and provides an outline into which new findings can be fitted".&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller says the concepts of space, time, matter, energy, and information are essential to his theory because the living systems exist in space and are made of matter and energy organized by information. Miller's theory of living systems employs two sorts of spaces: physical or geographical space, and conceptual or abstracted spaces. Time is the fundamental "fourth dimension" of the physical space–time continuum/spiral. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies physical space. Mass and energy are equivalent as one can be converted into the other. Information refers to the degrees of freedom that exist in a given situation to choose among signals, symbols, messages, or patterns to be transmitted.

Other relevant concepts are system, structure, process, type, level, echelon, suprasystem, subsystem, transmissions, and steady state. A system can be conceptual, concrete or abstracted. The structure of a system is the arrangement of the subsystems and their components in three-dimensional space at any point of time. Process, which can be reversible or irreversible, refers to change over time of matter–energy or information in a system. Type defines living systems with similar characteristics. Level is the position in a hierarchy of systems. Many complex living systems, at various levels, are organized into two or more echelons. The suprasystem of any living system is the next higher system in which it is a subsystem or component. The totality of all the structures in a system which carry out a particular process is a subsystem. Transmissions are inputs and outputs in concrete systems. Because living systems are open systems, with continually altering fluxes of matter–energy and information, many of their equilibria are dynamic—situations identified as steady states or flux equilibria.

Miller identifies the comparable matter–energy and information processing critical subsystems. Elaborating on the eight hierarchical levels, he defines society, which constitutes the seventh hierarchy, as "a large, living, concrete system with [community] and lower am levels of living systems as subsystems and components".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt; Society may include small, primitive, totipotential communities; ancient city–states, and kingdoms; as well as modern nation–states and empires that are not supranational systems. Miller provides general descriptions of each of the subsystems that fit all eight levels.

A supranational system, in Miller's view, "is composed of two or more societies, some or all of whose processes are under the control of a decider that is superordinate to their highest echelons".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 903&lt;/ref&gt; However, he contends that no supranational system with all its twenty subsystems under control of its decider exists today. The absence of a supranational decider precludes the existence of a concrete supranational system. Miller says that studying a supranational system is problematical because its subsystems
&lt;blockquote&gt;...tend to consist of few components besides the decoder. These systems do little matter-energy processing. The power of component societies [nations] today is almost always greater than the power of supranational deciders. Traditionally, theory at this level has been based upon intuition and study of history rather than data collection. Some quantitative research is now being done, and construction of global-system models and simulations is currently burgeoning.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1978, p. 1043.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the supranational system level, Miller's emphasis is on international organizations, associations, and groups comprising representatives of societies (nation–states). Miller identifies the subsystems at this level to suit this emphasis. Thus, for example, the reproducer is "any multipurpose supranational system which creates a single purpose supranational organization" (p.&amp;nbsp;914); and the boundary is the "supranational forces, usually located on or near supranational borders, which defend, guard, or police them" (p.&amp;nbsp;914).

===Strengths of Miller's theory===
Not just those specialized in international communication, but all communication science scholars could pay particular attention to the major contributions of living systems theory (LST) to social systems approaches that [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]], (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out:
* The specification of the twenty critical subsystems in any living system.
* The specification of the eight hierarchical levels of living systems.
* The emphasis on cross-level analysis and the production of numerous cross-level hypotheses.
* Cross-subsystem research (e.g., formulation and testing of hypotheses in two or more subsystems at a time).
* Cross-level, cross-subsystem research.

[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] says that LST, perhaps the "most integrative" social systems theory, has made many more contributions that may be easily overlooked, such as: providing a detailed analysis of types of systems; making a distinction between concrete and abstracted systems; discussion of physical space and time; placing emphasis on information processing; providing an analysis of entropy;  recognition of totipotential systems, and partipotential systems; providing an innovative approach to the structure–process issue; and introducing the concept of joint subsystem—a subsystem that belongs to two systems simultaneously; of dispersal—lateral, outward, upward, and downward; of inclusion—inclusion of something from the environment that is not part of the system; of artifact—an animal-made or human-made inclusion; of adjustment process, which combats stress in a system; and of critical subsystems, which carry out processes that all living systems need to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. Bailey 2006, pp.292–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

LST's analysis of the twenty interacting subsystems, [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] adds, clearly distinguishing between matter–energy-processing and information-processing, as well as LST's analysis of the eight interrelated system levels, enables us to understand how social systems are linked to biological systems. LST also analyzes the irregularities or "organizational pathologies" of systems functioning (e.g., system stress and strain, feedback irregularities, information–input overload). It explicates the role of entropy in social research while it equates [[negentropy]] with information and order. It emphasizes both structure and process, as well as their interrelations.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. bailey, 1994, pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
It omits the analysis of subjective phenomena, and it overemphasizes concrete Q-analysis (correlation of objects) to the virtual exclusion of R-analysis (correlation of variables). By asserting that societies (ranging from [[Totipotent#Totipotency|totipotential]] communities to nation-states and non-supranational systems) have greater control over their subsystem components than supranational systems have, it dodges the issue of transnational power over the contemporary social systems. Miller's supranational system bears no resemblance to the modern world-system that [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (1974) described, although both of them were looking at the same living (dissipative) structure.

The primary candidates for non-cellular life are viruses. A minority of biologists consider viruses to be living [[organism]]s, but most do not.

Engineers sometimes use the term "[[artificial life]]" to refer to [[software]] and [[robot]]s inspired by biological processes, but these do not satisfy any biological definition of life.

== Viruses as non-cellular life ==
{{Life timeline}}{{Further|Virus|Girus|Viral evolution}}
The nature of viruses was unclear for many years following their discovery as [[pathogen]]s. They were described as [[poison]]s or [[toxin]]s at first, then as "infectious proteins", but with advances in microbiology it became clear that they also possessed [[genetic material]], a defined structure, and the ability to spontaneously assemble from their constituent parts. This spurred extensive debate as to whether they should be regarded as fundamentally organic or inorganic — as very small biological [[organism]]s or very large biochemical [[molecule]]s — and since the 1950s many scientists have thought of viruses as existing at the border between chemistry and life; a gray area between living and nonliving.&lt;ref name="Villarreal 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forterre 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lwoff|first=A.|date=1957-01-01|title=The Concept of Virus|url=http://mic.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-17-2-239;jsessionid=j7YU0LkUikNMC-na5q7Hg5R8.x-sgm-live-02|journal=Microbiology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=239–253|doi=10.1099/00221287-17-2-239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent discovery of [[giant viruses]] (aka giruses, [[nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses]], NCLDVs) has reignited this debate, since they are not only physically larger than previously known viruses, but also possess much more extensive [[genome]]s, including [[gene]]s coding for [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]]s, key proteins involved in [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which were previously thought to be exclusive to cellular organisms. This raises the prospect that the giant viruses may have had extinct ancestors (or even undiscovered ones) capable of engaging in life processes (such as [[evolution]] and [[Self-replication|replication]]) independent of cells, and that modern viruses lost those abilities [[Secondary loss|secondarily]]. The viral lineage including this ancestor would be ancient and may have originated alongside the earliest [[archaea]] or before the [[Last universal common ancestor|LUCA]]. If such a virus is discovered, or its past existence supported by further genetic evidence, most biologists agree that it would constitute a ''bona fide'' lifeform, and its descendants (at least the giant viruses, and possibly including all known viruses) could be [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] classified in a fourth [[Domain (biology)|domain]] of life. Discovery of the [[pandoravirus]]es, with genomes are even larger than the other giant viruses and exhibiting particularly low [[Homology (biology)|homology]] with the three existing domains, further discredited the traditional view that viruses simply "pick-pocketed" all of their genes from cellular organisms, and further supported the "complex ancestors" hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Villarreal 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/science/changing-view-on-viruses-not-so-small-after-all.html|title=Changing View on Viruses: Not So Small After All|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|date=2013-07-18|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nasir|first=Arshan|last2=Kim|first2=Kyung Mo|last3=Caetano-Anolles|first3=Gustavo|date=2012-08-24|title=Giant viruses coexisted with the cellular ancestors and represent a distinct supergroup along with superkingdoms Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=12|pages=156|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-12-156|issn=1471-2148|pmc=3570343|pmid=22920653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing research is being conducted in this area, using techniques such as [[phylogenetic bracketing]] on the giant viruses to infer characteristics of their proposed progenitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colson|first=Philippe|last2=Gimenez|first2=Gregory|last3=Boyer|first3=Mickaël|last4=Fournous|first4=Ghislain|last5=Raoult|first5=Didier|date=2011-04-29|title=The giant Cafeteria roenbergensis virus that infects a widespread marine phagocytic protist is a new member of the fourth domain of Life |journal=PLoS One|volume=6|issue=4|pages=e18935|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018935|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3084725|pmid=21559486|bibcode=2011PLoSO...618935C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viroids ==
{{Main|Viroid}}
Viroids are the smallest infectious pathogens known to biologists, consisting solely of short strands of circular, single-stranded RNA without protein coats. They are mostly plant pathogens and some are animal pathogens, from which some are of commercial importance. Viroid genomes are extremely small in size, ranging from 246 to 467 nucleobases. In comparison, the genome of the smallest known viruses capable of causing an infection by themselves are around 2,000 nucleobases in size. Viroids are the first known representatives of a new biological realm of sub-viral pathogens.&lt;ref name="pmid5095900"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diener TO | title = Potato spindle tuber "virus".

Some viroids are [[ribozymes]], having catalytic properties which allow self-cleavage and ligation of unit-size genomes from larger replication intermediates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=593–8|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400706|pmid=16741503|pmc=1479586|year=2006|author1=Daròs|first1=J.

== Taxonomy ==
In discussing the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[domain (biology)|domains]] of life, the terms "Acytota" or "Aphanobionta" are occasionally used as the name of a [[virus|viral]] [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], domain, or [[empire (biology)|empire]]. The corresponding [[cellular life]] name would be [[Cytota]]. Non-cellular organisms and cellular life would be the two top-level subdivisions of life, whereby life as a whole would be known as organisms, [[Nature|Naturae]], or [[Vitae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Crucial steps to life: From chemical reactions to code using agents|journal=Biosystems|volume=140|pages=49–57|doi=10.1016/j.biosystems.2015.12.007|pmid=26723230|author1=Witzany|first1=G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taxon Cytota would include three top-level subdivisions of its own, the domains [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and [[Eukarya]].

__TOC__

== Background: ''C. elegans'' ==
The roundworm ''C. elegans'' has one of the simplest nervous systems of any organism, with its [[hermaphrodite]] type having only 302 neurons. Furthermore, the structural [[connectome]] of these neurons is fully worked out. There are fewer than one thousand cells in the whole body of a ''C. elegans'' worm, and because ''C. Elegans'' is a [[model organism]], each has a unique identifier and comprehensive supporting literature. Being a model organism, the genome is fully known, along with many well characterized mutants readily available, a comprehensive literature of behavioural studies, etc. With so few neurons and new calcium 2 photon microscopy techniques it should soon be possible to record the complete neural activity of a living organism. By manipulating the neurons through optogenetic techniques, combined with the above recording capacities the project is in an unprecedented position to be able to fully characterize the neural dynamics of an entire organism.

In the process of trying to build an "in silico" model of a relatively simple organism like ''C. elegans'', new tools are being developed which will make it easier to model progressively more complex organisms.

===NemaLoad===

Project Nemaload &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121007022842/http://nemaload.davidad.org/ NemaLoad]&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a research program trying to empirically establish the relevant biological facts which are necessary for a true bottom-up simulation. The project founder, [[David Dalrymple (computer scientist)|David Dalrymple]], is a collaborator on the OpenWorm project.

==OpenWorm project==

Although the ultimate goal is to simulate all features of ''C. elegans''' behaviour, the project is new and the first behaviour the Open Worm community decided to simulate is a simple motor response: teaching the worm to crawl. To do so, the virtual worm must be placed in a virtual environment. A full feedback loop must be established: Environmental Stimulus &gt; Sensory Transduction &gt; Interneuron Firing &gt; Motor Neuron Firing &gt; Motor Output &gt; Environmental Change &gt; Sensory Transduction.

There are two main technical challenges here: modelling the neural/electrical properties of the brain as it processes the information, and modelling the mechanical properties of the body as it moves. The neural properties are being modeled by a [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]], and the mechanical properties are being modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic algorithm.

The OpenWorm team built an engine called Geppetto which could integrate these algorithms and due to its modularity will be able to model other biological systems (like [[digestion]]) which the team will tackle at a later time.

The team also built an environment called NeuroConstruct which is able to output neural structures in [[NeuroML]]. Using NeuroConstruct the team reconstructed the full connectome of ''C. elegans''.

Using NeuroML the team has also built a model of a muscle cell. Note that these models currently only model the relevant properties for the simple motor response: the neural/electrical and the mechanical properties discussed above.

The next step is to connect this muscle cell to the six neurons which synapse on it and approximate their effect.

The rough plan is to then both:
* Approximate the synapses which synapse on those neurons
* Repeat the process for other muscle cells

===Progress===
As of January 2015, the project is still awaiting peer review, and researchers involved in the project are reluctant to make bold claims about its current resemblance to biological behavior; project coordinator Stephen Larson estimates that they are "only 20 to 30 percent of the way towards where we need to get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/tech/mci-lego-worm/ |title=Scientists upload a worm's mind into a Lego robot |work=CNN |last=Shadbolt |first=Peter |date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Japanese researchers announced the Perfect C. elegans Project. A proposal was submitted, but the project appears to have been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitano|first=Hiroaki|last2=Hamahashi|first2=Shugo|last3=Luke|first3=Sean|date=April 1998|title=The Perfect C.

In 2004 a group from Hiroshima began the Virtual C. elegans Project. They released two papers which showed how their simulation would retract from virtual prodding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf |title=A dynamic body model of the Nematode C. elegans with neural oscillators |journal=Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=2005 |first1=Michiyo |last1=Suzuki |first2=Takeshi |last2=Goto |first3=Toshio |last3=Tsuji |first4=Hisao |last4=Ohtake |pages=318–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Michiyo|last2=Tsuji|first2=Toshio|last3=Ohtake|first3=Hisao|date=September 2005|title=A model of motor control of the nematode C. elegans with neuronal circuits|url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine|volume=35|issue=1-2|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2005.01.008|issn=0933-3657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a Texas researcher described a simplified C. elegans simulator based on a 1-wire network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a 1-wire temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a "sense-process-react" operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Paul |last=Frenger |title=Simple C. elegans Nervous System Emulator |conference=Houston Conference for Biomedical Engineering Research |date=2005 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early attempts of simulation have been criticized for not being biologically realistic. Although we have the complete structural connectome, we do not know the [[synaptic weight]]s at each of the known synapses. We do not even know whether the synapses are inhibitory or excitatory. To compensate for this the Hiroshima group used machine learning to find some weights of the synapses which would generate the desired behaviour. It is therefore no surprise that the model displayed the behaviour, and it may not represent true understanding of the system.

==Open science==
The Open Worm community is committed to the ideals of [[open science]]. Generally this means that the team will try to publish in open access journals and include all data gathered (to avoid the file drawer problem). Indeed, all the biological data the team has gathered is publicly available, and the five publications the group has made so far are available for free on their website. All the software that OpenWorm has produced is completely free and open source.

Open Worm is also trying a radically open model of scientific collaboration. The team consists of anyone who wishes to be a part of it. There are over one hundred "members" who are signed up for the high volume technical mailing list. Of the most active members who are named on a publication there are collaborators from Russia, Brazil, England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. To coordinate this international effort, the team uses "virtual lab meetings" and other online tools that are detailed in the resources section.

'''The Seven Pillars of Life''' are the essential principles of [[life]] described by [[Daniel E. Koshland, Jr.|Daniel E. Koshland]] in 2002 in order to create a universal definition of life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/biology/2002-03-29-life-pillars.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One stated goal of this universal definition is to aid in understanding and identifying [[artificial life|artificial]] and [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref&gt;Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216&lt;/ref&gt; The seven pillars are Program, Improvisation, Compartmentalization, Energy, Regeneration, Adaptability, and Seclusion. These can be abbreviated as PICERAS.

== The Seven Pillars ==

=== Program ===
Koshland defines "Program" as an "organized plan that describes both the ingredients themselves and the kinetics of the interactions among ingredients as the living system persists through time."&lt;ref&gt;Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216&lt;/ref&gt; In natural life as it is known on Earth, the program operates through the mechanisms of [[nucleic acids]] and [[amino acids]], but the concept of program can apply to other imagined or undiscovered mechanisms.

=== Improvisation ===
"Improvisation" refers to the living system's ability to change its program in response to the larger [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which it exists. An example of improvisation on earth is [[natural selection]].

=== Compartmentalization ===
"Compartmentalization" refers to the separation of spaces in the living system that allow for separate environments for necessary chemical processes. Compartmentalization is necessary to protect the concentration of the ingredients for a reaction from outside environments.

=== Energy ===
Because living systems involve net movement in terms of chemical movement or body movement, and lose energy in those movements through [[entropy]], [[energy]] is required for a living system to exist. The main source of energy on Earth is the sun, but other sources of energy exist for life on Earth, such as hydrogen gas or methane, used in [[chemosynthesis]].

=== Regeneration ===
"Regeneration" in a living system refers to the general compensation for losses and degradation in the various components and processes in the system. This covers the thermodynamic loss in chemical reactions, the wear and tear of larger parts, and the larger decline of components of the system in [[ageing]]. Living systems replace these losses by importing molecules from the outside environment, synthesizing new molecules and components, or creating new generations to start the system over again.

=== Adaptability ===
"Adaptability" is the ability of a living system to respond to needs, dangers, or changes. It is distinguished from improvisation because the response is timely and does not involve a change of the program. Adaptability occurs from a molecular level to a behavioral level through [[feedback]] and [[Feedforward neural network|feedforward]] systems. For example, an animal seeing a predator will respond to the danger with hormonal changes and escape behavior.

=== Seclusion ===

== Criticism ==
Y. N. Zhuravlev and V. A. Avetisov have analyzed Koshland's seven pillars from the context of [[primordial life]] and, though calling the concept "elegant," point out that the pillars of compartmentalization, program, and seclusion don't apply well to the non-differentiated earliest life.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuravlev, Y. N. and V. A. Avetisov."The definition of life in the context of its origin"''[[Biogeosciences]]'', 2006-07-10. Retrieved on 2008-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt;
