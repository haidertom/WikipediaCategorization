      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3141">An '''action alert''' is a message that an organization sends to mobilize people, often members of the group and supporters of a specific point of view, calling on them to take action to influence public policy.&lt;ref name="one hour"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=nN3RMP-BcnkC ''The one-hour activist: the 15 most powerful actions you can take to fight for the issues and candidates you care about''] Christopher Kush, John Wiley and Sons, 2004; {{ISBN|0-7879-7300-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7879-7300-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhRh1LH8tOMC ''Cybercitizen: How to Use Your Computer to Fight for All the Issues You Care about''] Christopher Kush, Macmillan, 2000; {{ISBN|0-312-26305-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-26305-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, action alerts are in reference to a timely issue, where prompt action is needed in order to affect upcoming decisions.&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt;

==Description==
Action alerts are considered a cost-effective and efficient grassroots organizing tool and are employed widely by many advocacy organizations.&lt;ref name="one hour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt; A well-designed action alert can be a "powerful way to invite people to participate in the processes of a democracy."&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=v5H1-i6LHu0C ''The Nonprofit Manager's Resource Directory''], Ronald A. Landskroner, John Wiley and Sons, 2001; {{ISBN|0-471-39242-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-471-39242-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Action alerts may, for instance, ask supporters to:
*Contact their legislator to highlight the issue or argue for/against proposed legislation; or
*Write a [[letter to the editor]] about a specific item in the news.
Action alerts commonly begin by explaining the public policy issue to the recipients, and then tell the reader how they can impact the decision. Action alerts go by many other names. [[Amnesty International]], for instance, refers to them as "Urgent actions".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403121614/http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |archivedate=2005-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[analogy]] typically includes reference to the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] head of [[government]] as [[head of state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Body politic: political metaphor and political violence |author=A. D. Harvey |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84718-272-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the analogy may also be extended to other anatomical parts, as in political readings of [[Aesop's fable]] of "[[The Belly and the Members]]".

A later [[Europe]]an reference to the concept appears in ''The Book of the Body Politic'' (1407) by poet and court writer [[Christine de Pizan]], in which she admits having borrowed the concept from a letter of [[Plutarch]]'s to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] but does not mention [[John of Salisbury]]'s work, ''[[Policraticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christine de Pizan]] ''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.xviii-xx Kate Langdon Forhan 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.3-5 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The metaphor appears in the French language as the ''corps-état''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Baecque|first1=Antoine|others=Trans.

The metaphor was elaborated in the [[Renaissance]], and subsequently, as medical knowledge based on [[Galen]] was challenged by thinkers such as [[William Harvey]].  Analogies were drawn between supposed causes of disease and disorder and their equivalents in the political field, viewed as [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s or infections that might be remedied with [[purgative|purges]] and [[Patent medicine|nostrums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Foreign bodies and the body politic: discourses of social pathology in early modern England |author=Jonathan Harris |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval origins==
{{Anchor|In statehood}} The term "Body politic" (the political body of [[society]]) derives from the mediæval political concept of the '''King's two bodies''' first noted by mediaeval historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]], as a point of theology as much as statehood. However, the person to give the concept some legal bite and codified reality, as much as legitimacy as well as Sovereignty, was the 14th century judge Sir [[William de Shareshull]] in 1351 for the offence of high treason&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration what Offences shall be adjudged Treason. Compassing the Death of the King, Queen, or their eldest Son; violating the Queen, or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or his eldest Son’s Wife; levying War; adhering to the King’s Enemies; killing the Chancellor, Treasurer, or Judges in Execution of their Duty.

ITEM, Whereas divers Opinions have been before this Time in what Case Treason shall be said, and in what not; the King, at the Request of the Lords and of the Commons, hath made a Declaration in the Manner as hereafter followeth, that is to say; When a Man doth compass or imagine the Death of our Lord the King, or of our Lady his [Queen or of their eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do violate the King’s Companion or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or the Wife  the King’s eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do levy War against our Lord the King in his Realm, or be adherent to the King’s Enemies in his Realm, giving to them Aid and Comfort in the Realm, or elsewhere, and thereof be probably] attainted of open Deed by the People] of their Condition: . . . , and if a Man slea the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the King’s Justices of the one Bench or the other, Justices in Eyre, or Justices of Assise, and all other Justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their Places, doing their Offices: And it is to be understood, that in the Cases above rehearsed, that ought to be judged Treason which extends to our Lord the King, and his Royal Majesty" Treason Act 1351 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''1351 Treason''' Act 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the [[First Barons' War|Barons war]]. However, by the time of the fifteenth-century judge [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] the concept moves away from theology to [[jurisprudence]] in his ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy'', written from exile in about 1462 . Fortescue explains that the ''character angelus'' (divine character) of the king is his royal power, derived from angels and separate from the frail physical powers of his body.  However, he uses the phrase ''body politic'' itself only in its modern sense, to describe the realm, or shared rule, of [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], mythical first king of England, and how he and his fellow exiles had covenanted to form a body politic. Unusually for the time, Fortescue was writing in English and not Latin: "made a body pollitike callid a reawme." The early medieval period (13th century) saw a general and radical shift in the idea of the political body and sovereignty and who was to be ultimate ruler of humankind.This constant shift in [[Translatio imperii]] and ''The Halo of perpetuity''(Kantorowicz reasoning)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kings Two Bodies|last=Ernst|first=Kantorowicz|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=78–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; transformed the king's persona from [[Liturgy]] to legal science, argues Kantorowicz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The King's Two Bodies|last=Kantorowicz|first=|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=87–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] proved one thing, quite surprisingly enough, the king wasn't the ultimate and major landowner with just 20% of land ownership as [[William the Conqueror]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Doomsday Of Crown Lands|last=Sidney J|first=Madge|publisher=Routledge|year=1938|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21|quote="Before the Norman conquest, therefore, it is possible to find a feudal edifice of at least four stages-first, the king as supreme lord;then the holders of "bocland"with their "courts", and the power of making separate grants; next the owners of "laenland", rendering military service and special dues;and lastly, the cultivators of the land (Feudal serfs) of two types, free and unfree.This division of the land before and after the (Norman) Conquest, worked out so carefully in 1867, but expressed in percentage form for the first time, reveals the curious fact that the Church(29.6%) alone gained by the Conquest, relatively speaking, the Crown(19.9%) and the Baronage(50.5%) showing proportionate losses in the new triangular balance of power."}}&lt;/ref&gt; found out to his disgust and chagrin, which ultimately led to the [[Domesday Book|Domesday book]] being compiled. With [[Plenitudo potestatis]], [[Unam sanctam]] (a [[Papal bull]]) [[extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]] and the [[Sun and moon allegory]] now part of the armoury of jurisdictional power of the papacy with both [[Canon law]], and medieval political theology now becoming(part of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] movement beginning with [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[John of Salisbury]]) a standard bearer for medieval political power which then descended into the infamous [[Inquisition]] and [[heresy]] (deviation from truth)as the ultimate legal reality which meant both the [[Roman catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Papal supremacy]] couldn't be ignored(not without fear of [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]] and in some cases judicial execution). The church, which ultimately had powerful claims to sovereignty due to their immense wealth and vast monetary resources which included a clever taxation system establishing the legal validity of the [[tithe]] system which baffled legal experts of the day of its historical lineage and origin, such as Sir [[William Blackstone]], for example, not its legal validity; such as their (the church's) enormous network and ownership of land, law making and the then-University and education system.

==Literal manifestation==
In 1550 the jurist [[Edmund Plowden]] merged Fortescue's concepts, at the same time removing them from abstraction into a real, physical manifestation in the body of the king. Plowden reports how lawyers codified this notion in an examination of a case of land-ownership turning on a disputed gift by an earlier monarch; they determined that the "Body politic…that cannot be seen or handled…[is] constituted for the direction of the People…[and] these two bodies are incorporated in one person…the Body politic includes the [king's] Body natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kantorowicz|first=Ernst H|authorlink=Ernst Kantorowicz|title=The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political Theology|year=1957|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691071209|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1609 [[Attorney General]] [[Edward Coke]] pronounced his dissenting opinion,  that mortal power was God-made while the immortality of royal power existed only as a man-made concept; Coke later succeeded in limiting the royal power of both [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I]] with his now infamous judgements of [[Case of Proclamations]]&lt;ref&gt;'''England and Wales High Court (King's Bench Division)''' ''Decisions Case of Proclamations [1610] EWHC KB J22 November 1610''&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[Petition of Right]]'', which triggered off the [[English Civil War]] and would have reverberations right across the country for the next 100 years. When the monarchy, in the person of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was [[Restoration (England)|restored]] at the end of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] the idea remained current and royalty continued to use the notion, as a buttress to its authority, until an assertion of the rights of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] brought about the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Kantorowicz (1957: 423)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olwig (2002: 102)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century English [[Barrister]] and judge Sir [[William Blackstone]] developed further the medieval idea and the legal argument  (which still stands today) of the monarch in legal terms "immortal" with added emphasis of a quasi divine (''character angelus'') status.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] (1765) ''Commentaries On The Laws of England: In Four Books'' p.196 Volume 1 "But, fourthly; however the crown may be limited or transferred, it still retains its descendible quality, and becomes hereditary in the wearer of it. And hence in our law the king is said never to die, in his political capacity; though,in common with other men, he is subject to mortality in his natural: because immediately upon the natural death of Henry,William, or Edward, the king survives in his successor.
For the right of the crown vests, eo instanti, upon his heir; either the ''hares natus'', if the course of descent remains unimpeached,or the ''hares factus'', if the inheritance be under any particular settlement. So that there can be no interregnum (7); but,as [[Sir Matthew Hale]] (b) observes, the right of sovereignty is fully invested in the successor by the very descent of the crown.And therefore, however acquired, it becomes in him absolutely hereditary, unless by the rules of the limitation it is otherwise ordered and determined. 
In the same manner as landed estates,to continue our former comparison, are by the law here hereditary, or descendible to the heirs of the owner; but still there exists a power, by which the property of those lands may be transferred to another person. If this transfer be made simply and absolutely (8), the lands will be hereditary in the new owner, and descend to his heir-at-law; but if the transfer be clogged with any limitations, conditions, or entails, the lands must descend in that channel, so limited and prescribed,and no other". 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ancient legal maxim is that ‘the King never dies’. According to Blackstone,”the King survives in his successor” and “the right of the Crown ''vests, eo instanti'', upon his heirs”. Thus in legal theory the monarch is regarded as immortal and there is no moment in which the throne is vacant”. [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] Fifth Edition ''Crown and Crown Proceedings'' pp.8-9 Volume 29 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=John Anthony|title=James I and Divine Right|publisher=Sophia University|location=Tokyo|oclc=41418652|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Revolution monarchs of France also claimed legitimacy on this principle, and extended it to include the idea that the king's heir assimilated the "body politic" of the old king, in a physical "transfer of corporeality", on accession.&lt;ref&gt;de Baecque (1997: 100–102)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">A '''comeback''', in terms of [[publicity]], is a return by a well-known person to the activity in which they initially obtained their fame. Comebacks can occur in all walks of life, and have been noted to occur in entertainment, sports, and politics.

A comeback may occur after a public figure has been forced to withdraw from the public eye due to a real or perceived scandal.

==Entertainment==
An entertainer may make a comeback after having been absent from their area of entertainment for a time.

In South Korea, [[Comeback (K-pop)]], talent agencies stage-manage the debut of new acts in order to create anticipation for the new act, which will often officially debut live on one of the main television music programs with a "debut stage". For the debut [[Single (music)|single]], acts will have an overall "[[gimmick|concept]]", a marketing hook, which influences the name of the act, clothes, choreography, catch phrases and how they are presented; within bands individual members will have a personal concept, this being a role that they will play within the band, e.g. leader, visual, maknae, rapper e.t.c. Once a rookie act's debut cycle has ended they enter their second promotional cycle with a "comeback", called as such even when the musician or group in question did not go on hiatus.&lt;ref name="ramstadwsj"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramstad|first=Evan|title=Korea Counts Down Not Just To New Year, But to New Girls' Album|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2012/12/31/korea-counts-down-not-just-to-new-year-but-to-new-girls-album/|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=5 January 2013|quote=One of the unique things about album releases by K-pop artists is that they are routinely called 'comebacks' even when there's been no evidence that the musician or group went away or, in the conventional sports usage of the term, experienced a setback or loss.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each promotional cycle will be presented with its own concept.

==Sports==
{{distinguish|Comeback (sports)}}
In sports, a comeback occurs where an athlete or a team returns to success after a period of poor performance or inactivity. "The comeback may be the most compelling phenomenon in sports. ... Comebacks in individual sports like tennis, boxing, or golf occur more commonly than in team sports, as athletes in these games have more control over their destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Rick Swaine, ''Baseball's Comeback Players: Forty Major Leaguers Who Fell and Rose Again'' (2014), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
A politician may make a comeback after having left public life, either voluntarily or through loss of an election.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Shlomit Barnea, "Chronicles of the Comeback that Was and the One that Almost Was", in Asher Arian, Michal Shamir, ''The Elections in Israel 2009'' (2011), p. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

'''Criminalization''' or '''criminalisation''', in [[criminology]], is "the process by which behaviors and individuals are transformed into [[crime]] and criminals".&lt;ref&gt;Michalowski p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously legal acts may be transformed into crimes by [[legislation]] or judicial decision. However, there is usually a formal presumption in the rules of [[statutory interpretation]] against the [[Ex post facto law|retrospective application of laws]] and only the use of express words by the legislature may rebut this presumption. The power of judges to make new law and retrospectively criminalise behaviour is also discouraged. In a less overt way, where laws have not been strictly enforced, the acts prohibited by those laws may also undergo ''de facto'' criminalization through more effective or committed legal enforcement.

==The problems==
There has been some uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the contribution to be made by the victims of crime. But, as Garkawe (2001) indicates, the relationship between [[victimology]] and [[criminology]] has become problematic. The concern is that, within the [[dialectic]] of [[Right Realism]] and [[Left realism|Left Realism]],&lt;ref&gt;Walklate (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; a focus on the victim promotes rights selectively for certain victims, and advocates the assumption that some victim rights are more important than competing rights or values in society.&lt;ref&gt;Elias (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[Islamic]] [[feminism|feminist]] might seek consistency of treatment for women as victims and, therefore, demand the decriminalization of abortion, adultery, and seduction ([[Zina]] is a [[Hudud]] offense in [[sharia|sharia law]]), and the criminalization of [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual harassment]].

In formal academically published theory, the real ruling class of a society reaches a temporary view on whether certain acts or behavior are harmful or criminal. Historically this one theory will be modified by scientific, medical evidence, by political change, and the criminal justice system may or may not treat those matters as crimes.

Conversely, when local politics determines that it is no longer a crime, they may be decriminalized. For example, Recommendation No. R (95) 12 adopted by the [[Council of Europe Committee of Ministers|Committee of Ministers]] of the Council of Europe on the management of criminal justice, advocates that crime policies such as decriminalization, depenalisation or diversion, and mediation should be adopted wherever possible. But the law and order debate between right and left politicians is often superficial and unscientific, formulating policies based on their appeal to an uniformed electorate rather than properly conducted research.&lt;ref&gt;Currie (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Several principles may underpin decisions about criminalization. These include the ''[[de minimis]]'' principle, that of the minimum criminalization.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this principle, the general harm principle fails to consider the possibility of other sanctions and the effectiveness of criminalization as a chosen option. Those other sanctions include civil courts, laws of [[tort]] and [[regulation]]. Having criminal remedies in place is seen as a "last resort" since such actions often infringe personal liberties &amp;ndash; [[incarceration]], for example, prevents the freedom of movement. In this sense, law making that places a greater emphasis on human rights. Most crimes of direct actions ([[murder]], [[rape]], [[assault]], for example) are generally not affected by such a stance, but it does require greater justification in less clear cases.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"/&gt;

The policy of "social defense" can be seen as an opposing view. It argues that criminalization is used against "any form of activity which threatens good order or is thought reprehensible". The minimization principle may unwittingly prevent the adaptation of the law to new situations.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"/&gt; In general, worldwide policy makers have created a myriad of smaller offences, in contradiction to the minimization principle and more in keeping with the [[social defence]].&lt;ref name="ashworth68"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harm===
{{see also|Victimless crimes}}
Leading criminal law philosophers, such as Dennis Baker and Joel Feinberg have argued that conduct should only be criminalized when it is fair to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate 2011) at chapter 3; Dennis J. Baker Dennis, "The Moral Limits of Criminalizing Remote Harms", (2007) 11(3) New Criminal Law Review 371, Joel Feinberg, Harm to Others: The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law, OUP, 1984: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, such theorists assert that objective reasons are needed to demonstrate that it is fair to criminalize conduct in any given case. The commonly cited objective justification for invoking the criminal law is harm to others, but it cannot deal with all situations. For example, people are not necessarily harmed by public nudity. Feinberg suggests that offence to others also provides an objective reason for invoking the criminal law, but it clearly does not as offence is determined according to conventional morality. Prostitution is another grey area, as some countries allow it in different forms, and it is hard to say whether or not it specifically harms the public in general.  One argument may be that prostitution perpetuates the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, and therefore harms the public which partakes in the act of prostitution.  However, the legalization of prostitution would change the way it is regulated, and law enforcement could find a way to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted disease, thus eliminating the health issue and the question of the morality of the profession would be weakened.

People experience a range of physical and social injuries in different contexts which will vary according to the level of economic and political development of their country. Some will be injured out of [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]], others by [[violence]] which might stem from a major conflict such as [[war]] or from the personal violence in a [[robbery]]. The [[natural environment|environment]] may be damaged by [[pollution]], there may be hazards at work. Many of these sources of injury will be ignored while the state may delegate powers of control to a number of different agencies within an international framework where [[supranationalism|supranational]] agencies and [[human rights]] organisations may offer assistance in responding to the causes of those injuries.

===Moral approaches and autonomy===
The extent to which behaviours considered [[morally wrong]] in a given jurisdiction should be criminalized is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 42&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; Lying or breaking promises are not in general criminalised, for example. [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]] believed that moral behaviour was essential in maintaining the cohesion of a state, and so lawmakers should be entitled to criminalise immoral behaviour.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; However, opponents of this approach typically suggest use of a harm principle only and that immorality is not a reason in itself since outcomes of such activity can be used to come to a conclusion alone. Devlin's argument uses the disgust of the general public as a definition of morality; however, issues involving [[prejudice]] have shown this to be flawed and opponents push for a much stricter definition if this approach is to be used.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"/&gt; Devlin suggested a jury to give an indication of immoral behaviour. As well as prejudice, views were likely to vary widely on issues such as [[homosexuality]], [[contraception]] and other matters, particularly those influenced by religion. Agreement would be hard to find.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"/&gt; Other opposition has been from liberal groups which favour approaches which maximise individual rights.&lt;ref name="ashworth44"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; A moral basis for criminalization would be [[paternalistic]], thereby contrasting with personal autonomy. The [[European Convention of Human Rights]], in the most part supporting individual rights from government interferences, still includes a provision for interference "for the protection of health and morals"&lt;ref name="ashworth44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm |title=Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Measures |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |year=2010 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as legally requiring [[seat belt]]s to be worn (in some jurisdictions) are hard to justify if an individualistic approach is taken, since, if public health provision is ignored, little harm is caused to others.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 44&amp;ndash;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Raz]] argues that the state cannot and should not enforce morality; rather, any attempt to limit individual autonomy should be done only to limit harm. Certain moral ideals may be justifiable if they extend autonomy. If the immoral conduct of others impinges on someone else's autonomy, then that can be legislated against.&lt;ref name="ashworth45"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some groups for whom the principle of autonomy is weakened: those under an [[age of majority]] and those people who are impaired by, for example, a [[mental disorder]].&lt;ref name="ashworth45"/&gt; In general, these people are protected from activities with significant consequences, if they are not in a position to make reasoned decisions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 45&amp;ndash;46.&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve the criminalization of [[under-age drinking]], [[smoking]], [[gambling]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]]. Such criminalization is rarely challenged.&lt;ref name="ashworth45"/&gt;

In [[British law]], a distinction between public and private acts was made in the [[Wolfenden report]], which examined sexual activities (particularly homosexuality and [[prostitution]]). Some acts would effectively become legal within private settings, but illegal in public settings.&lt;ref name="ashworth46"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The justification for this was the concept of shock or offensive to the public. Such a line was favoured by [[Joel Feinberg]], who argued that it was a good reason in support of legislation if it effectively prevented "serious offence" to persons other than the [[actor (law)|actor]].&lt;ref name="ashworth46"/&gt; Philosophers such as Feinberg struggle to quantify the ideology behind the illegality of acts which in another setting would be acceptable (that acts themselves not causing harm, for example), for example [[nudity]]. Since such acts publicly are made illegal on the basis of shock, then whether to criminalise depends on a shifting body of public opinion, which varies from place to place and from time to time. The concept of "insult" rather than "offensive" may be more specific.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omission===
{{main|Omission (criminal law)}}
[[Common law]] does not often find an actor liable for omission &amp;ndash; failing to do something required by the law. Where this has applied it has typically been in industrial [[regulation]], in matters of [[social security]] or some personal regulated activity such as driving (for example, in the case of a [[hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 47&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt; These form conditions placed upon operating in a particular manner and are thus understood in that context. There are few general duties in common law jurisdictions, although these do include the responsibility of a parent to safeguard their children, to a landowner to prevent offences being carried out there, and to someone creating a dangerous situation to attempt to limit that danger.&lt;ref name="ashworth48"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of limited liability for omissions suggest that the wording for such a law would be vague, possibly involving "reasonable" care or action, and so would be hard to enforce. This would give prosecutors wide discretion, which may be opposed to justice.&lt;ref name="ashworth48"/&gt; Morally, omission is viewed by many as a far lesser problem than act; compared to murder, allowing someone to die is seen as much smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 48&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement to spend one's time and energy helping others would seem to contradict the autonomy many other laws aim to provide the individual with.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents point out these arguments fail to consider the harm that such omissions may cause, in contradiction to the harm principle many legal systems start out with. Life and physical integrity are often the highest priorities of a legal system.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"/&gt; Difficulties in definition are in common with many other areas, theorists such as Feinburg point out. A non-burdensome rescue is likely to be less valuable than freedom of action.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"/&gt; Limited liability is considered as article 223 of the [[French Penal Code]], which criminalises: "(1) a person who voluntarily neglects to prevent a serious crime of offense against that person, if that crime could be prevented without personal risk or risk to others; and (2) a person who voluntarily neglects to give, to a person in peril,  assistance which could be rendered without personal risk or risk to others."&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 49&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt; This is common with several other European jurisdictions. Whilst open to the criticisms of vagueness and prosecutor discretion, it has not been seen as overly oppressive.&lt;ref name="ashworth50"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedure===
When a state debates whether to respond to a source of injury by criminalising the behaviour that produces it, there are no pre-set criteria to apply in formulating social policy. There is no ontological reality to crime. The criminal justice system responds to a substantial number of events that do not produce significant hardship to individual citizens. Moreover, events which do cause serious injuries and perhaps should be dealt with as crimes, e.g. situations of [[corporate manslaughter]], are either ignored or dealt with as civil matters.

The criminalization process defines and classifies behaviour. It broadcasts the laws so that no-one may have the [[excuse]] of [[ignorantia juris non excusat|ignorance]], and disposes of those who will not obey. There are now more criminal laws and they are penetrating deeper into the social structures of modern societies. Crime control has become an industry, yet it remains ineffective in providing protection to all its citizens from harm. Such as it is, the process is made up of three components:
#Creation of a social order. This is both a socio-economic process, a "...fundamental ordering of social relations so that those things necessary for social survival can be produced and distributed in some predictable fashion" and an ideological process so that there can be a "...development of values, beliefs, and ideas related to the concrete tasks of production and distribution."(p.&amp;nbsp;6). Thus, society must develop the apparatus of law creation, law enforcement and [[punishment]] and the system must be acceptable to the majority of those who live in the community. If the laws do not match the general [[mores]], their enforcement will be a source of friction and disharmony. Conformity to the social order must, for the most part, be self-enforced.
#For the times when self-enforcement fails, society must create a legal order. This part of the process sees the centralisation of power within the institutions of the political state.  Some states justified the criminalization process as demonstrating their concerns about safety and security, the policy of control, policing, criminal justice, and penal practice. The modern state is [[decentralisation|decentralising]] and [[privatisation|privatising]] its functions. This is changing the character and content of the remaining institutions of the state which must now work co-operatively with other for-profit agencies.
#The political order must realign so that the remaining political entities such as [[legislature]]s and [[judge]]s set agreed targets for state control and then produce actual outputs of the legal order, i.e. of people defined as criminal and processed through that system.

==Ontological basis of crime==

Put in the most simple terms, ontology deals with or establishes the clear grounds for being. (Heidegger, Martin, Being and Time, introduction, referencing Plato's Parmenides.) In some of the traditional schools, such as those of the post-1688 English or Americans (many of the writings of the American Founding Fathers, but especially The Federalist) and their Dutch predecessors (see Kossmann, E. H. Political Thought in the Dutch Republic, 2004) ontology proper is deemed beyond the scope of legal thought, in accord with the modern distinction between society and state (which some consider based in the distinction the Romans made between themselves and their Italian allies, the socii, but not given the theoretical articulation we recognize today until emphasized by Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan. See [[State (polity)|state]].) However, some classical theorists, such as Aristotle, in his Politics and Metaphysics, and to a lesser degree in his Topics,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} suggest that the distinction is at least problematic. One need consider no further than the claim that man is a political animal to see this is so.

As a political animal, man has come to see himself as possessed of rights,&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council, http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/&lt;/ref&gt; whether these are the [[Rights of Englishmen]] of old, or the universal human rights advocated vigorously toward establishment today through the matrix of commercialism.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; At least in the today dominant American model, deprivation of right amounts to injury (consider especially Justice Stevens dissenting opinion in [[Castle Rock v. Gonzales]]), and injury—so goes the prevailing theory—amounts, when coupled with requisite intent, in most cases, to crime, when it does not admit of civil redress. Thus, again in simple terms, and to the extent that human beings are indeed political beings, crime does seem to have an ontological basis. (For one approach to the question of criminal ontology, see "Understanding Crime and Social Control in Market Economies: Looking Back and Moving Forward" by Robert Bohm in Jeffrey Ian Ross, ed. Cutting the Edge: Current Perspectives in Radical/Critical Criminology and Criminal Justice. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1998.) This, further, seems to hold if ontology itself is divided into political and trans- or supra- or meta- political ontology—i.e., what once was the realm of Christian theology. Of course, it does not matter whether that theology is Christian or belonging to some other apolitical belief. The point is that one may, with some justice, argue persuasively that being is divided. This need not, however, force the question of meta-political crimes. Our purposes here, in this article, are limited to the political. For the question in general see [[Ontology]].

Baker  argues that only objective harms and other objective bad consequences (or actions in the case of inchoate and endangerment offenses) are prima facie criminalizable. By other bad consequences Baker means privacy violations and conduct that does not necessarily result in tangible harm, but does result in unwanted consequences. Baker argues that the privacy violations that result from being forced to receive unwanted obscene information in public places (exhibitionism) would amount to a sufficient bad consequence for the purposes of invoking the criminal law,  but argues that proportionate punishment means that such conduct should only be punished with fines rather than jail terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6322">[[File:Australian Senate - Parliament of Australia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Australian Senate]], like other parliaments based on the Westminster system, uses a divided chamber]]

In [[politics]], '''crossing the floor''' is when a politician changes their allegiance or votes against their party in a [[Westminster system]] parliament. Crossing the floor may be voting against the approved party lines, or changing to another party after being elected while a member of a first party. While these practices are legally permissible, crossing the floor can lead to controversy and media attention. As well, voting against party lines may lead to consequences such as losing a position (e.g., as minister or a portfolio critic) or being ejected from the party caucus.  [[Maldives]] and [[Bangladesh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=367&amp;sections_id=24624 |title= Article 70(b) of Constitution of People's Republic of Bangladesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; have laws which removes the member from parliament due to floor-crossing.

==Etymology==
The term originates from the [[British House of Commons]], which is configured with the Government and [[Parliamentary Opposition|Opposition]] facing each other on rows of benches. In consequence, an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] who switches from the governing party to one in opposition (or vice versa) also changes which side of the chamber they sit on. A notable example of this is [[Winston Churchill]], who crossed the floor from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] to the [[Liberal party (UK)|Liberals]] in 1904, before later crossing back in 1924.

==Voting against party lines==
The term has passed into general use in other [[Westminster System|Westminster]] parliamentary democracies (such as [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Australia|Australia]], [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Politics of South Africa|South Africa]]) even if many of these countries have semicircular or horseshoe-shaped debating chambers and mechanisms for voting without [[Members of Parliament]] leaving their seats. In most countries, it is most often used to describe members of the government party or parties who defect and vote with the opposition against some piece of government-sponsored legislation, but that usage is not widespread in Canada, where the term's usage is restricted to the original definition.

Most political parties let their members have a free vote on some matters of personal conscience.

In Australia, one of the major parties (the [[Australian Labor Party]]) requires its members to pledge their support for the collective decisions of the Caucus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22library%2Fprspub%2F31KH6%22 |title=Crossing the floor in the Federal Parliament 1950 – August 2004 |work=Research Note no. 11 2005–06 |publisher=Australian Parliament |date=October 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which theoretically prohibits them from crossing the floor; however, in practice, some Labor members disregard this pledge despite the disciplinary action which may result. Among other parties, crossing the floor is rare although former Senator [[Barnaby Joyce]] of the [[National Party of Australia]] crossed the floor 19 times under the Howard coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/independently-inclined-20080530-2jzv.html?page=2 |title=Independently inclined |publisher=The Age |first=Penelope |last=Debelle |date=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the record for crossing the floor in the Australian Parliament goes to Tasmanian Senator Sir [[Reg Wright]], who voted against his own party (the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]) on 150 occasions.

==Changing parties==
In the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries, the term is also used to describe leaving one's party entirely and joining another party, such as leaving an opposition party to support the government (or vice versa), or even leaving one opposition party to join another. In both Canada and the United Kingdom, the term carries only this meaning and is not used for a simple vote against the party line on a bill.

In April 2006, the premier of [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], [[Gary Doer]] of the [[New Democratic Party of Manitoba]], proposed a ban on crossing the floor of the Manitoba legislature in response to "the concern some voters have expressed over the high-profile defections of three federal MPs from their parties in just over two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323022203/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864 |archivedate=March 23, 2007|title=Proposed reforms would ban floor-crossing in Man. |first=Michelle |last=Macafee |publisher=Canadian Press |date=April 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting legislation, which amended the provincial ''Legislative Assembly Act'', mandated that Members of the Legislature who quit their political party must serve out the remainder of their term as independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/2006/c01506ee.php |title=The Elections Reform Act - Schedule E |work=Statutes of Manitoba |publisher=Manitoba Laws |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extraordinary example occurred in Alberta, Canada in December 2014 when [[Danielle Smith]], the leader of the official opposition [[Wildrose Party]], and eight of her MLAs crossed the floor together to join the governing [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnews.ca/news/1737886/danielle-smiths-move-to-pcs-unprecedented/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">A '''death in office''' is the death of a person who was [[incumbent]] of an office-position until the time of death. Such deaths have been usually due to natural causes, but they are also caused by [[accident]]s and murders.

The death of most [[monarch]]s and [[pope]]s have been deaths in office, since they have usually held their papacy/reign for the rest of their lives. Otherwise as most office positions require that the person is constantly competent in performing the associated duties, deaths in office are usually premature deaths.

==Consequences==
{{see also|Order of succession|Casual vacancy}}
Systems differ in how they deal with the death of an office holder. In some death results in a [[casual vacancy]], whereby the office is unfilled for a time. The office may subsequently be filled by a [[by-election]] or by appointment. A person may temporarily take the powers and responsibilities of the deceased in an "acting" capacity before a permanent replacement is made. In other systems there may be a legally defined [[order of succession]]. For example, in [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchies]] reigns are typically expected to end with death and the transition of power to an heir. Many presidential systems have offices of [[Vice president#In government|vice president]], whose principle responsibility is to immediately assume the presidency if the president dies or otherwise leaves the office.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63481">An '''extrajudicial killing''' (also known as '''extrajudicial execution''') is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any [[Judiciary|judicial proceeding]] or legal process. [[Extrajudicial punishment]]s are mostly seen by humanity to be unethical, since they bypass the [[due process]] of the legal jurisdiction in which they occur.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade union, dissident, religious, and social figures and are only those carried out by the [[State (polity)|state]] government or other state authorities like the armed forces or police, as extra-legal fulfillment of their prescribed role.

Section 3(a) of the [[United States]] [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] contains a definition of extrajudicial killing:

{{quote|a deliberate killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regular constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, however, does not include any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Congressional Record, V. 147, Pt. 6, May 9, 2001 to May 21 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCYK7X_SqHIC&amp;pg=PA7897|date=October 2005|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|page=7897|id=GGKEY:2126SDPKSFJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The legal exclusion in the sentence that starts "Such term, however ..." covers the killing of [[enemy combatant]]s and others who are not protected under international law from extrajudicial killing.}} }}

[[Argentina]]'s dictatorial government during the 1976–1983 period used extrajudicial killings systematically as way of crushing the opposition in the so-called "[[Dirty War]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-131783-2009-09-15.html Veinticinco años del informe de la Conadep] {{sp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or what is known in Spanish as ''La Guerra Sucia''.

In 1999 [[Belarus]]ian opposition leaders [[Yury Zacharanka]] and [[Viktar Hanchar]] together with his business associate [[Anatol Krasouski]] disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on “opposition scum”. Although the [[State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus]] (KGB) had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The disappearance of journalist [[Dzmitry Zavadski]] in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=16 Years of Silence: Enforced Disappearances in Belarus Must Be Investigated |url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/europe/16-years-of-silence-enforced-disappearances-in-belarus-must-be-investigated/  | newspaper=[[Amnesty International]]|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] claims that Zacharanka, Hanchar, Krasouski and Zavadski likely became victims of extrajudicial executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Report: Belarus:

These included Manuel Contreras, the former head of Chile's [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|National Intelligence Directorate]] (DINA), which served as Pinochet's [[Secret police|secret police.]] He was behind numerous assassinations and human rights abuses such as the 1974 abduction and [[forced disappearance]] of Socialist Party leader [[Victor Olea Alegria]]. Some of the killings were also coordinated with other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone in the so-called [[Operation Condor]]. There were reports of United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement, particularly within its activities in Central and South America that promoted anti-Communist coups.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Ops: The Rise of Special Forces in the CIA, the SAS, and Mossad|last=Geraghty|first=Tony|publisher=Pegasus Books|year=2012|isbn=9781605987613|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While CIA's complicity was not proven, American dollars supported the regimes that carried out extrajudicial killings such as the Pinochet administration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; CIA, for instance, helped create DINA and the agency admitted that Contreras was one of its assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America|last=McSherry|first=Patrice|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=9780742536876|location=Lanham, MD|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== El Salvador ==
During the [[El Salvador Civil War|Salvadoran civil war]], death squads achieved notoriety when far-right vigilantes assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] for his social activism in March 1980. In December 1980, [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|four Americans—three nuns and a lay worker—were raped and murdered]] by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of peasants and activists, including such notable priests as [[Rutilio Grande]]. Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and training from American advisors during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, these events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} although death squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well.

== Honduras ==
Honduras also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was [[Battalion 316]].  Hundreds of people, including teachers, politicians and union bosses, were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-negroponte1a-story.html|title=When a wave of torture and murder staggered a small U.S. ally, truth was a casualty.|first=Gary Cohn and Ginger|last=Thompson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran ==
{{See also|Chain Murders of Iran}}

In 1953 a regime was installed through the efforts of the American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the British [[MI6]] in which the Shah (hereditary monarch) [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] used [[SAVAK]] death squads (also trained by the CIA) to imprison, torture and/or kill hundreds of dissidents.  After the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] death squads were used to an even greater extent by the new Islamic government. In 1983, the CIA gave the Supreme Leader of Iran—[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]—information on [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was probably used. The Iranian government later used death squads occasionally throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; however by the 2000s it seems to have almost entirely, if not completely, ceased using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/the-chain-murders-1988-1998.html|title=The Chain Murders|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=October 29, 2018|website=Tehran Bureau|publisher=PBS|last=Sahim|first=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iraq ==
[[Iraq]] was formed by the partition and domination of various tribal lands by the British in the early 20th century. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. [[King Ghazi]] of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), for fear that the government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the [[Axis powers]]. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from [[Baghdad]] made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad-hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/9/13/14133/1410/|title=History of Iraq: 1933 - 1939|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has since become increasingly partitioned following the [[Iraq War]] into three zones: a [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish ethnic zone]] to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] ethnic zone to the south. The [[Secularism|secular]] [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] [[Ba'ath Party|Baathist]] leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia (Prime Minister) and Kurdish (President of the Republic) peoples of the nation. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish ([[Peshmerga]]).

There were [[death squad]]s formed by members of every ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. cracks down on Iraq death squads |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/24/iraq.main/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now-Shia police department and army (and militia members posing as members of police or armed forces) formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long-tolerated death squads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1869439,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=US patrols to weed out militias posing as Iraqi police |first=Peter |last=Beaumont |date=September 11, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They possibly had links to the Interior Ministry and were popularly known as the 'black crows'.

The victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni [[insurgency]]. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. These killings are not limited to men; women and children have also been arrested and/or killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='25,000 civilians' killed in Iraq |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4692589.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2005-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these killings have also been part of simple robberies or other criminal activities.

A feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of the ''New York Times'' claimed that the U.S. military had modelled the "Wolf Brigade", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads used in the 1980s to crush the left-wing insurgency in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=Nytimes050501&gt;{{cite news |title=The Way of the Commandos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ARMY.html?ei=5088&amp;en=f0604488a64924cd&amp;ex=1272686400&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-05-01 |first=Peter |last=Maass |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western news organizations such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and [[People (magazine)|''People'']] disassembled this by focusing on aspects such as probable [[militia]] membership, religious ethnicity, as well as uniforms worn by these squads rather than stating the [[United States]]-backed Iraqi government had death squads active in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4719252.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Iraq 'death squad caught in act' |date=February 16, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soviet Union and Russia ==
In [[Bolshevist Russia|Soviet Russia]] since 1918 [[Cheka]] was authorized to execute "counterevolutionaries" without trial. Hostages were also executed by Cheka during the [[Red Terror]] in 1918–1920.

The [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|successors of Cheka]] also had the authority for extrajudicial executions. In 1937–38 hundreds of thousands where executed extrajudicially during the [[Great Purge]] under the lists approved by [[NKVD troika]]s. In some cases the Soviet special services did not arrest and then execute their victims but just secretly killed them without any arrest. For example, [[Solomon Mikhoels]] was murdered in 1948 and his body was run over to create the impression of a traffic accident. The Soviet special services also conducted extrajudicial killings abroad, most notably of [[Leon Trotskiy]] in 1940 in [[Mexico]], [[Stepan Bandera]] in 1959 in Germany, [[Georgi Markov]] in 1978 in London.

In the [[Russian Federation]], a number of journalist murders were attributed to public administration figures, usually where the publications would reveal their involvement in large corruption scandals.

It has been regarded that the [[Alexander Litvinenko assassination theories|Alexander Litvinenko]] murder was linked to Russian special forces.

USA and UK intelligence agents reportedly claim that Russian assassins, some possibly at orders of the government, are behind at least fourteen [[targeted killing]]s on British soil that police called non-suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-police-evidence-russian-assassins-behind-14-suspicious-deaths-british-soil-boris-berezovsky-scot-a7793151.html|title=UK authorities 'overlooked' evidence linking Russia to deaths on British soil|date=16 June 2017|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report, [[Amnesty International]] documented incidents that "appear to have been extrajudicial executions" against Palestinian civilians.&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/israeli-forces-must-end-pattern-of-unlawful-killings-in-west-bank/|title=Israeli forces in Occupied Palestinian Territories must end pattern of unlawful killings|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those incidents occurred after Palestinians attempted to attack, and murder, Israelis, but even though the attackers did not pose a serious threat due to soldiers' armor, they were shot without ensuring that the threat was real and without attempt to arrest suspects before resorting to the use of lethal force.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;

Reportedly thousands of [[Human rights in Thailand#Deaths relating to the 2003 war on drugs|extrajudicial killings occurred during the 2003 anti-drug effort]] of [[Thailand]]'s prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7057">'''Global policeman''' is an informal term for a [[State (polity)|state]] which seeks or claims [[global hegemony]].{{according to whom?|date=April 2018}} It has been used, firstly, of the [[British Empire]] and, since 1945, of the [[United States]], the most influential of the [[Four Policemen]] victorious in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Colley]], 'Britain and the US once ran the world. Now they're all at sea', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Rachman]], 'The world would miss the American policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'', 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been speculation that [[China]] may take over the role&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"&gt;[[Jonas Parello-Plesner]] and [[Parag Khanna]], 'Stop fretting about Beijing as a global policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'',  28 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as it reaches out to protect [[shipping lanes]], protect its overseas workers, and 'creeps into the superpower league'. The [[Western world|West]], according to two columnists of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', 'should view this as an opportunity, not a threat.'&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"/&gt;

==In international law==

No formal recognition of this position exists. Theoretically, in [[international law]], all nations are equal; 'par in parem non habet imperium', no authority between equals, is the principle applied. In reality, international law is decentralised, unpoliced, unenforceable, unclear and frequently broken. States are [[Sovereign state#Ontological status of the state|'immortal' and cannot be indicted]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], [[Power Politics (Wight book)]], 1978, p 98- 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with state policing==

Within states, law restrains and limits power; between states, the opposite is true.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, Power Politics, 1978 , p 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peelian principles]] of policing include: the duty to prevent crime, keep the peace and uphold the law, with the consent of the public, and with minimal use of force and restraint; to act impartially; and not to usurp the powers of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reith]], A new study of police history, Oliver and Boyd, 1956, appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter standard requires a [[presumption of innocence]]. Candidates for police recruitment and promotion are appointed on merit, whereas a 'global policeman' is self-appointed faute de mieux.

Within states, a [[monopoly on violence]] is the norm; the police may carry weapons, but few others do so (the US is an exception, prompting [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] to ask if it is 'really a state'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-the-us-who-has-the-monopoly-on-force/2016/07/13/fbcd45da-490d-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html 'In the US, who has the  monopoly on force?'], [[Washington Post]], 13th July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) Internationally, a 'global policeman' is but one heavily armed state among two hundred others.

To confer the  role of 'global policeman' on any self-interested, expansionary state implies a [[conflict of interest]]. States wage war with maximum force; engage in arms sales; form alliances and thus lack impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the 'world police' analogy gets wrong,' [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The comparatively peaceful years 1815–1914 came to be known as [[Pax Britannica]]. The UK made efforts to control the [[Slave trade]] through the [[West Africa Squadron]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&gt;pdf&gt;britain-and-the-trade.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Britain, jointly with France and Russia, intervened on the side of [[Greek independence]], destroying the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]]. In 1854, Britain, jointly with France, prevented Russia from destroying the [[Ottoman empire]]. Russia had to withdraw from [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]], and [[Sebastopol]] was besieged in the [[Crimean war]].

From 1914–1945 no one state was hegemonic. In an era of [[multipolarity]] and [[diffused responsibility]], fascist dictators arose and Europe sank into two world wars. The authoritarian German challenge to democratic Britain then, is comparable to the authoritarian Chinese challenge to democratic America now, according to [[Richard J Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;'Before the first world war: what can 1914 tell us about 2014?' [[New Statesman]], 23/1/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 promised assistance to anticommunist allies. 'The right of neutrality was abolished...it was an era of aggressive peacetime policy which marked the beginning of America's role as global policeman.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]], 'How America became the World's Policeman', [[The Daily Bell]], 19/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]] 'The enemy is terrorism not communism'.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,&lt;/ref&gt; But after a disastrous intervention in [[Somalia]] in 1993, the US was reluctant to engage in [[humanitarian intervention]] in [[Bosnia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Connor Murphy]], 'World Police Force?' psu.edu, 31/10/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Baldauf]], 'Why the US didn't intervene in the Rwandan massacre', [[Christian Science Monitor]] 7/4/2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US-led [[Invasion of Iraq]], officially a policing mission to find [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]], has been accused of being an illegal cover for ulterior, unethical motives: the need to secure US regional bases, oil supplies, and the loyalty of key allies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], 'Top judge: US and UK acted as vigilantes in Iraq invasion, Guardian, 17/11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Usborne]], 'WMD just an excuse for war, admits Wolfowitz', Independent, 29/5/2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, serious doubts have been raised about the validity of US overseas intervention and destabilization in Iraq, Libya and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tariq Ali]], 'America's selective vigilantism will make as many enemies as friends', [[The Guardian]], 6/9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nathan Gardels]] and [[Hans Blix]], 'America is not the world's policeman - in Syria or Iraq', [[Christian Science Monitor]], 27/8/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Americans accept no law other than their own on US soil, yet expect other nations to submit to the rule of US troops; a [[double standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the World Police Analogy gets wrong', [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[drone strikes]] on terrorists in Pakistan and Afghanistan goes against the presumption of innocence. The CIA, exempt from the [[Geneva Convention]], is 'secretly sentencing people to death for an unproven crime, without trial or inquest.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Robertson]], 'Drone attacks go against every Human Right in the book', [[New Statesman]], 13/6/2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] is not a state, so 'war law' which permits killing of combatants, does not apply.

The '''hypodermic needle model''' (known as the '''hypodermic-syringe model''', '''transmission-belt model''', or '''magic bullet theory''') is a model of [[communication]] suggesting that an intended message is directly received and wholly accepted by the receiver. The model was originally rooted in 1930s [[behaviorism]] and largely considered obsolete for a long time, but [[big data]] analytics-based [[mass customization]] has led to a modern revival of the basic idea.

==Concept==
The "magic bullet" or "hypodermic needle theory" of direct influence effects was based on early observations of the effect of mass media, as used by [[Nazi propaganda]] and the effects of [[Hollywood]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Commmunication Theory; Mass Communication: MAGIC BULLET OR HYPODERMIC NEEDLE THEORY OF COMMUNICATION http://communicationtheory.org/magic-bullet-or-hypodermic-needle-theory-of-communication/&lt;/ref&gt; People were assumed to be "uniformly controlled by their biologically based 'instincts' and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever 'stimuli' came along".&lt;ref&gt;Lowery, Shearon (1995). ''Milestones in Mass Communication Research: Media Effects'' (en inglés). USA: Longman Publishers. p. 400. {{ISBN|9780801314377}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Magic Bullet" theory graphically assumes that the media's message is a bullet fired from the "media gun" into the viewer's "head".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Asa (1995). Essentials of Mass Communication Theory. Londres: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "Hypodermic Needle Model" uses the same idea of the "shooting" paradigm. It suggests that the media injects its messages straight into the passive audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Croteau, W. Hoynes (1197). ''Media/society: industries, images, and audiences''. Pine Forge Press. {{ISBN|9780803990654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This passive audience is immediately affected by these messages. The public essentially cannot escape from the media's influence, and is therefore considered a "sitting duck".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both models suggest that the public is vulnerable to the messages shot at them because of the limited communication tools and the studies of the media's effects on the masses at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, D.K. &amp; Baron, S.J. (1981). ''A History of Our Understanding of Mass Communication''. Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; It means the media explores information in such a way that it injects in the mind of audiences as bullets.

The "magic bullet" and "hypodermic needle" models originate from [[Harold Lasswell]]'s 1927 book, ''Propaganda Technique in the World War''.&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H. (1927) "Propaganda Technique in the World War"&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work in the history of communication studies have documented how the two models may have served as strawman theory or fallacy&lt;ref&gt;Lubken, Deborah. (2008). Remembering the Straw Man: The Travels and Adventures of Hypodermic. In D. W. Park &amp; J. Pooley (Eds.), The history of media and communication research: contested memories: Peter Lang Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; or even a "myth".&lt;ref&gt;Sproule, J. M. (1989). Progressive Propaganda Critics and the Magic Bullet Myth. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 6(3), 225-246. doi:citeulike-article-id:9472331&lt;/ref&gt; Others have documented the possible medical origins of the metaphor of the magic bullet model.&lt;ref&gt;Thibault, Ghislain. (2016). Needles and Bullets: Media Theory, Medicine, and Propaganda, 1910-1940. In K. Nixon &amp; L. Servitje (Eds.), Endemic: Essays in Contagion Theory (pp. 67-91). Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-step flow==
{{main|Two-step flow of communication}}
The phrasing "hypodermic needle" is meant to give a mental image of the direct, strategic, and planned infusion of a message into an individual. But as research methodology became more highly developed, it became apparent that the media had selective influences on people.

The most famous incident often cited as an example for the hypodermic needle model was the 1938 broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and the subsequent reaction of widespread panic among its [[United States|American]] mass audience. However, this incident actually sparked the research movement, led by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and [[Herta Herzog]], that would disprove the magic bullet or hypodermic needle theory, as [[Hadley Cantril]] managed to show that reactions to the broadcast were, in fact, diverse, and were largely determined by situational and attitudinal attributes of the listeners.

In the 1940s, Lazarsfeld disproved the "magic bullet" theory and "hypodermic needle model theory" through elections studies in "The People's Choice".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Felix Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, Hazel Gaudet (1948). ''The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign''. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Lazarsfeld and colleagues executed the study by gathering research during the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The study was conducted to determine voting patterns and the relationship between the media and political power. Lazarsfeld discovered that the majority of the public remained unfazed by propaganda surrounding Roosevelt's campaign. Instead, interpersonal outlets proved more influential than the media. Therefore, Lazarsfeld concluded that the effects of the campaign were not all powerful to the point where they completely persuaded "helpless audiences", a claim that the Magic Bullet, Hypodermic Needle Model, and Lasswell asserted. These new findings also suggested that the public can select which messages affect and don't affect them.

Lazarsfeld's debunking of these models of communication provided the way for new ideas regarding the media's effects on the public. Lazarsfeld introduced the idea of the [[two-step flow of communication]]&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' [[Two-step flow model]]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1944. [[Elihu Katz]] contributed to the model in 1955 through studies and publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, E.]], [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Lazarsfeld, P.F.]] (1955) ‘Personal influence: The part played by people in the flow of mass communications‘, The Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The model of the two-step flow of communication assumes that ideas flow from the mass media to opinion leaders and then to the greater public. They believed the message of the media to be transferred to the masses via this [[opinion leadership]]. Opinion leaders are categorized as individuals with the best understanding of media content and the most accessibility to the media as well. These leaders essentially take in the media's information, and explain and spread the media's messages to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1957|title=The Two-Step Flow of Communication: An Up-To-Date Report on an Hypothesis|doi=10.1086/266687|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=61–78|last1=Katz|first1=Elihu|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1279&amp;context=asc_papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the two step flow model and other communication theories suggest that the media does not directly have an influence on viewers anymore. Instead, interpersonal connections and even [[selective exposure]] play a larger role in influencing the public in the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Joseph Severin, James W. Tankard (1979). ''Communication Theories: Origins, Methods, Uses''. Hastings House. {{ISBN|9780803812741}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary one-step flow==
More recently, the use of [[big data]] analytics to identify user preferences and to send tailor-made messages to individuals led back to the idea of a "one-step flow of communication", which is in principle similar to the hypodermic needle model.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, W. L., &amp; Manheim, J. B. (2006). The One-Step Flow of Communication. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 608(1), 213–232. http://doi.org/10.1177/0002716206292266&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that today's massive databases allow for the [[mass customization]] of messages. So it is not one generic [[mass media]] message, but many individualized messages, coordinated by a massive algorithm. For example, [[empirical studies]] have found that in [[Twitter]] networks, traditional mass media outlets receive 80–90% of their Twitter mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from average Twitter users.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"&gt;Hilbert, M., Vasquez, J., Halpern, D., Valenzuela, S., &amp; Arriagada, E. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1177/0894439316639561 One Step, Two Step, Network Step? Complementary Perspectives on Communication Flows in Twittered Citizen Protests]. [[Social Science Computer Review]]. Freely available at http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0nn4p7mv&lt;/ref&gt; However, these same studies also argue that there is a multitude of step-flow models at work in today's digital communication landscape.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Choi, S. (2014). The Two-Step Flow of Communication in Twitter-Based Public Forums. Social Science Computer Review, 0894439314556599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stansberry, K. (2012).

This is a list of political topics, including political science terms, political philosophies, political issues, etc.

'''[[Politics]]''' is the process by which groups of people make decisions. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within civil [[government]]s, politics is observed in all human group interactions, including [[corporation|corporate]], [[academia|academic]], and [[religion|religious]] institutions. Politics consists of "social relations involving authority or power"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.die.net/politics/ Definition of politics from die.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the regulation of a political unit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=303454 Politics (definition)@Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply [[policy]].&lt;ref name="freedict"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/politics Definition of politics from "The Free Dictionary"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Political science]]''' (also known as political studies) is the study of political behavior and examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]]. Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behavior, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.

      <comment>On the sections regarding the Second and Third Island Chains, both of them use capitals for the word 'Island', the section on the First Island Chain does not do this, reflecting a break in the English scheme in the majority of cases in this article.</comment>

The '''Island Chain Strategy''' is a strategy first mentioned by American foreign policy commentator [[John Foster Dulles]] in 1951 during the [[Korean War]]. It suggests surrounding the [[Soviet Union]] and [[PRC|China]] by sea.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroyuki Umetsu,  "Communist China’s entry into the Korean hostilities and a US proposal for a collective security arrangement in the Pacific offshore island chain." ''Journal of Northeast Asian Studies'' (1996) 15#2 pp: 98–118.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The island chain concept did not become a major theme in American policy, however it has become a major fixation of Chinese analysts to this day. The concept heightens Chinese fears that they will be encircled by American forces, and emphasizes the geographical and strategic importance of [[Taiwan]]. It helps shape Chinese naval options and strategies, as well as playing a role in economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Toshi Yoshihara, "China's Vision of Its Seascape: The First Island Chain and Chinese Seapower." ''Asian Politics &amp; Policy'' (2012) 4#3 pp. 293–314. DOI: 10.1111/j.1943-0787.2012.01349.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Chinese writings the Island Chain Strategy is divided into 3 parts, namely [[First island chain|First Island Chain]], the [[Second Island Chain]] and the [[Third Island Chain]].

== First Island Chain ==
{{Main|First island chain}}

The First Island Chain begins at the [[Kuril Islands]], and finishes towards [[Borneo]] and the northern portion of the [[Philippines]]. It is the first chain to block [[socialism|socialist]] countries aligned with the USSR, and after Soviet Russia is dealt with the chain would then turn its focus on China. The key part of the first chain would be [[Taiwan]].

Because the island chain is built up of a series of landmasses, it is also called the "[[unsinkable aircraft carrier]]", especially in reference to Taiwan.

== Second Island Chain ==
The Second Island Chain can refer to two different interpretations, but the version most commonly used refers to the island chain which is formed by the [[Ogasawara Islands]] and [[Volcano Islands]] of Japan, in addition to [[Mariana Islands]] which is United States territory.

As it is located within the middle portion of the Pacific Ocean, it acts as a second strategic defense line for the United States.

==Third Island Chain ==
The Third Island Chain is the final part of the strategy. Its island chain begins at the [[Aleutian Islands]], and finishes up in [[Oceania]]. The key part of the Third Island Chain would be the [[Hawaii]]an Islands of the United States.

== Target and events ==
The primary target of the doctrine was the USSR; however, additional targets also included the People's Republic of China and Vietnam. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR collapsed]] in 1991, China soon became the major target of the doctrine.

: ''This article is about the history of ethnic Jews and political radicalism. For the antisemitic canard, see [[Jewish Bolshevism]].''

The historical contribution of Jews to the political Left has been well documented. Both as individual theorists and activists of the stature of [[Karl Marx]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Léon Blum]] and [[Emma Goldman]], and as organised mass labour movements in, for example, revolutionary Russia and early-mid twentieth century Warsaw, Amsterdam, Paris, Toronto, New York and London, Jews have been conspicuous for their socialist and communist affiliations.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Historical analysis of the dynamics of this Jewish/Left alliance, however, has been far less conclusive. Considerable dissonance exists, for example, concerning the factors which attracted Jews to the Left, the extent to which leading Jewish Left activists were originally motivated by or subsequently influenced by explicitly Jewish concerns, and the degree to which one can reasonably speak of a specific or unique Jewish contribution to the international Left. In addition, discussion of these factors has often been inhibited by concerns regarding the use of the alleged Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy by the Nazis and other anti-Semitic groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==History==

According to Paul Johnson, Jewish society in the last 1,500 years has been designed to produce and support intellectuals who largely focused their talents on rabbinical studies.  Johnson asserts that "quite suddenly, around the year 1800, this ancient and highly efficient social machine for the production of intellectuals began to shift its output. Instead of pouring all its products into the closed circuit of rabbinical studies, . . . it unleashed a significant and ever-growing proportion of them into secular life. This was an event of shattering importance in world history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Jews |first=Paul |last=Johnson |year=1988 |pages=340–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Revolution|French Revolution of 1789]] promised equality, freedom, and an end to discrimination for all including the Jews. The subsequent political emancipation of the Jews in most of Western and Central Europe provoked an anti-modern and specifically anti-Jewish backlash from traditional conservative groupings. In response, Jews allied themselves with the modern liberalist forces, and played an important role in the 1848 European revolutions which sought to entrench the gains of liberalism. However, the ensuing failure of liberalism to protect Jewish rights led many Jews to seek new allies within the growing working-class movement. The international character of the socialist movement seemingly offered Jews protection from old religious and national hatreds. Thus in contrast to most other national groups, Jews had a double reason to join the proletarian revolution. They were discriminated against both on class grounds and on racial grounds.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Not surprisingly, many Jews made a rational decision to join a movement which promised to defend and extend the equal rights granted by the French Revolution. The prominence of Jews in the Left can, therefore, be attributed to reasons of self-interest as much as to any idealistic motivation. Equally, the subsequent decline of Jewish involvement in the Left can be attributed to relatively objective factors such as the creation of the State of Israel which transformed Jewish dependence from international to national forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==20th century==
Many young Jews rejected the Orthodoxy of their parents and turned to the great Jewish secular movements of [[Zionism]], [[socialism]], and [[Bundism]] [a Jewish labor movement founded in Eastern Europe in the 19th century]. They viewed their parents' faith in the eventual coming of the Messiah as a dangerous passivity in the face of imminent danger to the Jewish people. They took their fate into their own hands and created new forms of secular Jewish messianic activity. Their concern for changing the world by rejecting their religious background shows how deeply they were immersed in the Jewish search for redemption.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Jewish Bolshevism===
A persistent theme among critics of Jews—particularly those on the pre-World War II right—has been that the [[Bolshevik]] revolution was a Jewish revolution and that the Soviet Union was dominated by Jews. This theme appears in a wide range of writings, from Henry Ford's [[The International Jew|International Jew]], to published statements by a long list of British, French, and American political figures in the 1920s (Sir [[Winston Churchill]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], and [[David Lloyd George]]), and, in its most extreme form, by [[Adolf Hitler]], who wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Now begins the last great revolution. By wresting political power for himself, the Jew casts off the few remaining shreds of disguise he still wears. The democratic plebeian Jew turns into the blood Jew and the tyrant of peoples. In a few years he will try to exterminate the national pillars of intelligence and, by robbing the peoples of their natural spiritual leadership, will make them ripe for the slavish lot of a permanent subjugation. The most terrible example of this is Russia."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Legislation''' (or "[[statutory law]]") is law which has been [[promulgation|promulgated]] (or "[[enactment of a bill|enacted]]") by a [[legislature]] or other [[Government|governing body]] or the process of making it.&lt;ref&gt;See Article 289(3) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]], and may be broadly referred to as "legislation", while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict. It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act which is adopted by an [[Executive (government)|executive]] or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act or for implementing a legislative act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is the European Legislator after Lisbon a real Legislature?  |author=Wim Voermans |journal=Legislacao Cadernos de Ciencia de Legislacao |volume=50 |pages=391–413 [402] |date=December 2009  |quote=Within the category of legal acts provided for by the TFEU, a distinction is made between legislative acts and non-legislative acts. Legislative acts are decisions adopted under the ordinary or special legislative procedure (Article 289(3) of the TFEU) and non-legislative acts are decisions that are adopted pursuant to delegation or for the purpose of implementing a legislative act (Articles 35 See Article 288 of the TFEU, last 290 and 291 of the TFEU)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Westminster system]], an item of primary legislation is known as an [[Act of Parliament]] after enactment.

Legislation is usually proposed by a member of the legislature (e.g. a member of Congress or Parliament), or by the executive, whereupon it is debated by members of the legislature and is often amended before [[passage (legislature)|passage]]. Most large legislatures enact only a small fraction of the bills proposed in a given [[Session (parliamentary procedure)|session]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/Resumes.htm Senate.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a given bill will be proposed and is generally a matter of the legislative priorities of government.

Legislation is regarded as one of the three main functions of government, which are often distinguished under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]]. Those who have the formal power to ''create'' legislation are known as [[legislator]]s; a [[judiciary|judicial branch]] of government will have the formal power to ''interpret'' legislation (see [[statutory interpretation]]); the [[executive branch]] of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law.

== Latest revision ==
The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when [[constitutional law]] or [[secondary legislation]] is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include [[referendum]]s, [[Order in Council|orders in council]] or [[regulations]]. The term ''legislation'' is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term ''[[primary legislation]]'' may be used to exclude these other forms.

==Dead letter==
{{Expand section|date=September 2016}}
The phrase "dead letter" refers to legislation that has not been revoked, but that has become inapplicable or obsolete or is no longer enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/dead-letter Dead Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Autarchism]], a political philosophy that upholds the principle of individual liberty, rejects compulsory government and supports the elimination of government in favor of ruling oneself and no other
* [[Free-market anarchism]], a political philosophy that advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property and open markets
** [[Agorism]], a revolutionary form of free-market anarchism that focuses on employing counter-economic activity to undermine the state
** [[Anarcho-capitalism]], a political philosophy that advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property and open markets (many anarchists dispute this as a form of anarchism and argue it is a misuse of the term)
** [[Left-wing market anarchism]], a political philosophy that strongly affirms the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support "anti-capitalist" positions

'''Libertarian conservatism''' or '''conservative libertarianism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring ''[[laissez faire|laissez-faire]]'' [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], but harnesses this to a belief in a more traditional and conservative social philosophy emphasizing authority and duty.{{sfn|Heywood|2015|p=37}} Libertarian conservatism prioritizes [[liberty]] as its main emphasis, promoting [[free expression]], [[freedom of choice]] and [[free market capitalism]] to achieve [[Social conservatism|socially]] and [[Cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] ends as they reject [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]],&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;J. Richard Piper, ''Ideologies and Institutions: American Conservative and Liberal Governance Prescriptions Since 1933'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u93Mj3A-tH8C&amp;pg=PA110 pp. 110–111], {{ISBN|0847684598}}, {{ISBN|978-0847684595}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the opposite way but not excluding the above, libertarian conservatism could be understood as promoting [[civil society]] through conservative institutions and authority - as family, fatherland, religion, education - in the quest of libertarian ends for less state power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/getting-libertarianism-right Getting Libertarianism Right]. [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]]. {{ISBN|978-1-61016-690-4}}. [[Mises Institute]] Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Larry Johnston, in [[political science]], the term "libertarian conservatism" is used to refer to ideologies that combine the advocacy of economic principles such as [[fiscal discipline]], respect for [[contract]]s, defense of [[private property]] and [[free market]]s{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–56}} and the [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservative]] stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society with social tenets such as the importance of [[religion]] and the value of [[Religious morality|traditional morality]]{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=154}} through a framework of [[Limited government|limited]], [[Constitutional government|constitutional]], [[representative government]].{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–155}}

For Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of [[individualism]] and the demand for [[personal freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.|title=The Rise of the City: 1878-1898|publisher=The Academy of Political Science|date=September 1933|orig-year=1st pub. 1933|pages=454–456|chapter=Vol. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Randall|title=Sandino's Daughters: Testimonies of Nicaraguan Women in Struggle|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=January 14, 2018|orig-year=1st pub. 1995|pages=ii|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate'', edited by George W. Carey, contains essays which describe "the tension between liberty and morality" as "the main fault line dividing the two philosophies".&lt;ref&gt;George W. Carey (Editor), ''Freedom &amp; Virtue: The Conservative Libertarian Debate,'' Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1998. {{ISBN|1-882926-19-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson Hultberg wrote that there is "philosophical common ground" between libertarians and conservatives. "The true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers". He said that such libertarian conservatism was "hijacked" by [[neoconservatism]], "by the very enemies it was formed to fight – [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], [[New Deal]]ers, [[Welfare state|welfarists]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]], globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Hultberg, [http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html "True Conservatism vs. Neo-Conservatism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820085956/http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html|date=August 20, 2008}}, [http://afr.org "Americans for a Free Republic"] website, December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]] wrote that libertarian conservative [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the [[United States Constitution]]. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing: "The fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary". He wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the [[American Civil War]] overthrew the Constitution of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo74.html|title=Constitutional Futility|last=DiLorenzo|first=Thomas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], a prominent contributor to the ''[[National Review]]'', called his own combination libertarianism and conservatism as "[[fusionism]]".&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;Edward Feser, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/feser2.html "What Libertarianism Isn't"], [[Lew Rockwell.com]], December 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Raico, [https://mises.org/story/1784 "Is Libertarianism Amoral?"], ''New Individualist Review'', Volume 3, Number 3, Fall 1964, 29–36; republished by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], April 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Lew Rockwell]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and others described their libertarian conservative views as [[paleolibertarianism]].&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockwell|first1=Lew|title=The Case for Paleo-libertarianism|journal=Liberty|issue=January 1990|pages=34–38|url=http://www.pericles.press/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Liberty_Magazine.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued libertarian opposition to "all forms of government intervention – economic, cultural, social, international", but also upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. They opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated "freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority".&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; Rockwell later stated that they dropped that self-description because people confused it with [[paleoconservatism]], which they rejected.&lt;ref name=lewinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/liberal-post-interview.html|title=Do You Consider Yourself a Libertarian?|last=Johnsson|first=Kenny|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paleoism.html|title=What I Learned From Paleoism|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn H.|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence M. Vance wrote: "Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy... They apparently don't know the difference between libertarianism and [[libertinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Richard Epstein]] and [[Albert Jay Nock]] have been described as libertarian conservatives.&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/cultural-thought-ludwig-von-mises-0 Cultural Thought of Ludwig von Mises]. [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]. 1991. Lew Rockwell and Jeffrey Tucker.

In 1975, [[Ronald Reagan]] stated: "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism". However, some libertarians criticized Reagan for un-libertarian policy positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html "Inside Ronald Reagan"], a ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Feser]] emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of [[liberty]], [[privacy]] and ending the [[War on drugs|war on marijuana]] at the legal level without changing personal values.&lt;ref name="Feser"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
Libertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of [[free market capitalism]], advocating minimal to no government interference in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. A number of libertarian conservatives favor [[Austrian economics]] and are critical of [[fiat money]], with many supporting policies like [[pay what you want]] cafes. Libertarian conservatives also advocate for ways to [[Privatization|privatize]] services run by the government, from airports to toll booths.

{{Monarchism |expanded=concepts}}
A '''monarch''' is a [[potentate|sovereign]] [[head of state]] in a [[monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=monarch | website=Oxford Dictionaries | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/monarch?q=monarch | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;Webster's II New College Dictionary. [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/monarch?q=monarch Monarch]. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 2001. p. 707. {{ISBN|0-395-96214-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the [[Sovereign state|state]], or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Typically a monarch either personally [[inheritance|inherits]] the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as ''the throne'' or ''[[the Crown|the crown]]'') or is [[elective monarchy|selected]] by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, [[acclamation]] or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns [[Life tenure|for life]] or until [[abdication]].

If a young child is crowned the monarch, a [[regent]] is often appointed to govern until the monarch reaches the requisite adult age to rule. Monarchs' actual powers vary from one monarchy to another and in different eras; on one extreme, they may be [[autocracy|autocrats]] ([[absolute monarchy]]) wielding genuine sovereignty; on the other they may be [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] [[head of state|heads of state]] who exercise little or no direct power or only [[reserve power]]s, with actual [[authority]] vested in a [[parliament]] or other body ([[constitutional monarchy]]).

A monarch can reign in multiple monarchies simultaneously. For example, the [[monarchy of Canada]] and the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]] are separate states, but they share the same monarch through [[personal union]].

==Characteristics==
Monarchs, as such, bear a variety of titles – [[king]] or [[Queen regnant|queen]], [[prince]] or [[princess]] (e.g., [[Sovereign Prince of Monaco]]), [[emperor]] or [[Emperor|empress]] (e.g., [[Emperor of China]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Emperor of India]]), [[archduke]], [[duke]] or [[grand duke]] (e.g., [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]), [[emir]] (e.g., [[Emir of Qatar]]) or [[sultan]] (e.g., [[Sultan of Oman]]). ''Prince'' is sometimes used as a generic term to refer to any monarch regardless of title, especially in older texts.&lt;ref name="pine"&gt;{{cite book | title=Titles: How the King became His Majesty | publisher=Barnes  &amp; Noble | author=[[L.G. Pine|Pine, L.G.]] | year=1992 | location=New York | page=86 | isbn=978-1-56619-085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A king can also be a queen's husband and a queen can be a king's wife. If both of the couple reign, neither person is generally considered to be a consort. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Monarchy]] is political or sociocultural in nature, and is generally (but not always) associated with [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary rule]]. Most monarchs, both historically and in the present day, have been born and brought up within a [[royal family]] (whose rule over a period of time is referred to as a [[dynasty]]) and trained for future duties. Different systems of [[Order of succession|succession]] have been used, such as [[proximity of blood]] (male preference or absolute), [[primogeniture]], [[agnatic seniority]], [[Salic law]], etc. While traditionally most monarchs have been male, female monarchs have also ruled, and the term [[queen regnant]] refers to a ruling monarch, as distinct from a [[queen consort]], the wife of a reigning king.

Some monarchies are non-hereditary. In an [[elective monarchy]], the monarch is [[election|elected]] but otherwise serves as any other monarch. Historical examples of elective monarchy include the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s (chosen by [[prince-elector]]s, but often coming from the same dynasty) and the [[royal elections in Poland|free election]] of kings of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Modern examples include the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]], who is appointed by the [[Conference of Rulers]] every five years or after the king's death, and the [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who serves as sovereign of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] and is elected to a life term by the [[College of Cardinals]].

In recent centuries, many states have abolished the monarchy and become [[republic]]s (however see, e.g., [[United Arab Emirates#Government and politics|United Arab Emirates]]). Advocacy of government by a republic is called [[republicanism]], while advocacy of monarchy is called [[monarchism]]. A principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of national leadership, as illustrated in the classic phrase "[[:The King is dead. Long live the King.|The [old] King is dead. Long live the [new] King!]]". In cases where the monarch serves mostly as a ceremonial figure (e.g. most modern constitutional monarchies) real leadership does not depend on the monarch.

A form of government may in fact be hereditary without being considered monarchy, such as a [[family dictatorship]].

==Classification==
Monarchies take a wide variety of forms, such as the two [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes of Andorra]], positions held simultaneously by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Urgel (Spain) and the elected [[President of France]] (although strictly Andorra is a [[diarchy]]). Similarly, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] is considered a monarch despite only holding the position for five years at a time.

Hereditary succession within one [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] family has been most common (although, see the [[Rain Queen]]), with preference for children over siblings, sons over daughters. In Europe, some peoples practiced equal division of land and regalian rights among sons or brothers, as in the Germanic states of the Holy Roman Empire, until after the [[medieval era]] and sometimes (e.g., [[Ernestine duchies]]) into the 19th century. Other European realms practice one form or another of [[primogeniture]], whereunder a [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son or, if he had none, by his brother, his daughters or sons of daughters.

The system of [[tanistry]] was semi-elective and gave weight also to ability and merit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The [[Salic law]], practiced in France and in the Italian territories of the [[House of Savoy]], stipulated that only men could inherit the crown. In most [[fief]]s, in the event of the demise of all legitimate male members of the [[patrilineality|patrilineage]], a female of the family could succeed (semi-Salic law). In most realms, daughters and sisters were eligible to succeed a ruling kinsman before more distant male relatives (male-preference primogeniture), but sometimes the husband of the heiress became the ruler, and most often also received the title, ''[[jure uxoris]]''. Spain today continues this model of succession law, in the form of [[cognatic primogeniture]]. In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood|proximity]] and [[primogeniture]] battled, and outcomes were often idiosyncratic.

As the average life span increased, an eldest son was more likely to reach majority age before the death of his father, and primogeniture became increasingly favoured over proximity, tanistry, seniority and election.

In 1980, [[Sweden]] became the first monarchy to declare ''equal primogeniture'', ''absolute primogeniture'' or ''full cognatic primogeniture'', meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations have since adopted this practice: [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, and [[Luxembourg]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15489544&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/new-ducal-succession-rights-for-grand-duchy-4f60cf15e4b047833b93fca0&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] adopted absolute (equal) primogeniture on April 25, 2013, following [[Perth Agreement|agreement by the prime ministers of the sixteen Commonwealth Realms]] at the 22nd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

In some monarchies, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother and so on through his other brothers, and only after them to the monarch's children (''agnatic seniority''). In some other monarchies (e.g. [[Jordan]]), the monarch chooses who will be his successor within the royal family, who need not necessarily be his eldest son.

Whatever the rules of succession, there have been many cases of a monarch being overthrown and replaced by a usurper who would often install his own family on the throne.

===Monarchs in Africa===
{{Further|Monarchies in Africa}}
[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ramesses II]], the third [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]]]]
A series of [[Pharaoh]]s ruled [[Ancient Egypt]] over the course of three millennia (circa 3150 BC to 31 BC), until it was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. In the same time period several kingdoms flourished in the nearby [[Nubia]] region, with at least one of them, that of the so-called [[A-Group]] culture, apparently influencing the customs of Egypt itself. From the 6th to 19th centuries, Egypt was variously part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Islamic Empire, [[Mamluk]] Sultanate, [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[British Empire]] with a distant monarch. The [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was a short lived protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] from 1914 until 1922, when it became the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and Sultan [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] changed his title to King. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] the monarchy was dissolved and Egypt became a republic.

[[West Africa]] hosted the [[Kanem Empire]] (700–1376) and its successor, the [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] principality which survives to the present day as one of the [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of [[Nigeria]].
[[File:Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shire 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohamoud Ali Shire]], the 26th Sultan of the [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali]] [[Warsangali Sultanate]]]]
In the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and later the [[Zagwe Dynasty]], [[Ethiopian Empire]] (1270–1974), and [[Aussa Sultanate]] were ruled by a series of monarchs. [[Haile Selassie]], the last Emperor of Ethiopia, was deposed in a [[communist]] [[coup]]. Various [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali Sultanates]] also existed, including the [[Adal Sultanate]] (led by the [[Walashma dynasty]] of the [[Ifat Sultanate]]), [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], [[Ajuran Sultanate]], [[Warsangali Sultanate]], [[Geledi Sultanate]], [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] and [[Sultanate of Hobyo]].

[[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]] were largely isolated from other regions until the modern era, but they did later feature kingdoms like the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] (1400–1914).

The [[Zulu people]] formed a powerful [[Zulu Kingdom]] in 1816, one that was subsequently absorbed into the [[Colony of Natal]] in 1897. The [[List of Zulu kings|Zulu king]] continues to hold a hereditary title and an influential cultural position in contemporary South Africa, although he has no direct political power. Other tribes in the country, such as the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and the [[Tswana people|Tswana]], have also had and continue to have a series of kings and chiefs whose local precedence is recognised, but who exercise no legal authority.

As part of the [[Scramble for Africa]], Europeans conquered, bought, or established African kingdoms and styled themselves as monarchs due to them.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Currently the African nations of [[Morocco]], [[Lesotho]] and [[Swaziland]] are sovereign monarchies under dynasties that are native to the continent. Places like [[St. Helena]], [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] are ruled by the [[Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] or the [[King of Spain]]. So-called "sub-national monarchies" of varying sizes can be found all over the rest of the continent, e.g. the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city-state of [[Akure Kingdom|Akure]] in south-western [[Nigeria]] is something of an elective monarchy: its reigning [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] having to be chosen by an electoral college of nobles, from amongst a finite collection of royal princes of the realm.

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] different titles were used by nobles exercising various degrees of sovereignty within their borders (see below). Such titles were granted or recognised by the Emperor or Pope. Adoption of a new title to indicate sovereign or semi-sovereign status was not always recognized by other governments or nations, sometimes causing [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] problems.

During the nineteenth century many small monarchies in Europe merged with other territories to form larger entities, and following [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], many [[Monarchy abolishment|monarchies were abolished]], but of those remaining all except Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Vatican City and Monaco were headed by a king or queen.

{{As of|2015}} in Europe there are twelve monarchies: seven [[monarchy|kingdom]]s ([[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]), one [[grand duchy]] ([[Luxembourg]]), one [[papacy]] ([[Vatican City]]), and two [[principalities]] ([[Liechtenstein]] and [[Monaco]]), as well as one [[diarchy]] principality ([[Andorra]]).

===Monarchs in Asia===
{{Further|Monarchies in Asia}}
[[File:Crown Prince &amp; Princess &amp; Emperor Showa &amp; Empress Kojun wedding 1959-4.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|From left to right, Japanese [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]], [[Akihito|Crown Prince Akihito]], [[Empress Michiko|Crown Princess Michiko]] and [[Empress Kōjun|Empress Nagako]], 1959]]
In China, before the abolition of the monarchy in 1912, the [[Emperor of China]] was traditionally regarded as the ruler of "[[Tianxia|All under heaven]]". "King" is the usual translation for the term ''wang'' 王, the sovereign before the [[Qin dynasty]] and during the [[Ten Kingdoms]] period. During the early [[Han dynasty]], China had a number of kingdoms, each about the size of a [[province]] and subordinate to the Emperor.
In Korea, ''Daewang'' (great king), or ''Wang'' (king), was a Chinese royal style used in many states rising from the dissolution of [[Gojoseon]], [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], [[Silla]] and [[Balhae]], [[Goryeo]], [[Joseon]]. The legendary [[Dangun]] Wanggeom founded the first kingdom, Gojoseon. Some scholars maintain that the term ''Dangun'' also refers to a title used by all rulers of Gojoseon, and that ''Wanggeom'' is the proper name of the founder. ''Gyuwon Sahwa'' (1675) describes The Annals of the Danguns as a collection of nationalistic legends. The monarchs of Goguryeo and some monarchs of Silla used the title "[[Taewang]]", meaning the "Great king". The early monarchs of Silla have used the title of "Geoseogan", "Chachaung", "Isageum", and finally "Maripgan" until 503. The title "Gun" (prince) can refer to the dethroned rulers of Joseon dynasty as well. Under the [[Korean Empire]] (1897–1910), the rulers of Korea were given the title of "Hwangje", meaning the "Emperor". Today, Members of the Korean Imperial Family continue to participate in numerous traditional ceremonies, and groups exist to preserve Korea's lmperial heritage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The [[Imperial House of Japan|Japanese monarchy]] is now the only monarchy to still use the title of [[Emperor]].

In modern history, between 1925 and 1979, Iran was ruled by two Emperors from the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] that used the title of "Shahanshah" (or "King of Kings"). The last Iranian Shahanshah was King [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], who was forced to abdicate the throne as a result of a revolution in Iran. In fact Persian (Iranian) kingdom goes back to about 2,700 BC (see [[Kings of iran#Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC)|List of Kings of Persia]]), but reached its ultimate height and glory when King [[Cyrus the Great]] (Known as "The Great Kourosh" in Iran) started the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid dynasty]], and under his rule, the [[empire]] embraced all the previous civilized states of [[Ancient Near East|the ancient Near East]], expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of [[Southwest Asia]] and much of [[Central Asia]] and the Caucasus. From the [[Mediterranean sea]] and [[Hellespont]] in the west to the [[Indus River]] in the east, Cyrus the Great created the largest empire the world had yet seen.

[[Thailand]] and Bhutan are like the United Kingdom in that they are constitutional monarchies ruled by a King. [[Jordan]] and many other Middle Eastern monarchies are ruled by a [[Malik]] and parts of the [[United Arab Emirates]], such as [[Dubai]], are still ruled by monarchs.

[[Saudi Arabia]] is the largest Arab state in Western Asia by land area and the second-largest in the Arab world (after Algeria). It was founded by [[Ibn Saud|Abdul-Aziz bin Saud]] in 1932, although the conquests which eventually led to the creation of the Kingdom began in 1902 when he captured [[Riyadh]], the ancestral home of his family, the [[House of Saud]]; succession to the throne was limited to sons of Ibn Saud until 2015, when [[Muhammad bin Nayef|a grandson]] was elevated to Crown Prince. The Saudi Arabian government has been an absolute monarchy since its inception, and designates itself as [[Islamic]]. The King bears the title "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques" in reference to the two holiest places in Islam: [[Masjid al-Haram]] in [[Mecca]], and [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] in [[Medina]].

[[File:Sultan Mehmet III of the Ottoman Empire.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Sultan [[Mehmed III]] from [[Ottoman Dynasty]]]]
[[Oman]] is led by Monarch Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said Al Said]]. The [[Kingdom of Jordan]] is one of the [[Middle East]]'s more modern monarchies is also ruled by a [[Malik]]. In Arab and arabized countries, [[Malik]] (absolute King) is absolute word to render a monarch and is superior to all other titles. [[Nepal]] abolished their monarchy in 2008. [[Sri Lanka]] had a complex system of monarchies from 543BC to 1815. Between 47BC-42BC Anula of Sri Lanka became the country's first female head of state as well as Asia's first head of state.{{dubious|date=September 2010}}

In [[Malaysia]]'s constitutional monarchy, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (The Supreme Lord of the Federation) is ''de facto'' rotated every five years among the nine Rulers of the Malay states of Malaysia (those nine of the thirteen states of Malaysia that have hereditary royal rulers), elected by ''Majlis Raja-Raja'' ([[Conference of Rulers]]).

Under [[Brunei]]'s 1959 constitution, the [[Sultan of Brunei]] is the head of state with full executive authority, including emergency powers, since 1962. The Prime Minister of Brunei is a title held by the Sultan. As the prime minister, the Sultan presides over the cabinet.

[[Cambodia]] has been a kingdom since the 1st century. The power of the absolute monarchy was reduced when it became the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia]] from 1863 to 1953. It returned to an absolute monarchy from 1953 until the establishment of a republic following the [[Cambodian coup of 1970|1970 coup]]. The monarchy was restored as a constitutional monarchy in 1993 with the king as a largely symbolic figurehead.

In the [[Philippines]], the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|pre-Colonial]] [[Filipino people|Filipino]] nobility, variously titled the ''harì'' (today meaning "king"), ''[[Lakan]]'', ''[[Raja]]'' and ''[[Datu]]'' belonged to the caste called ''Uring [[Maharlika]]'' (Noble Class). When the islands [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|were annexed]] to the [[Spanish Empire]] in the late 16th century, the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarch]] became the sovereign while local rulers often retained their prestige as part of the [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianised]] nobility called the ''[[Principalía]]''. After the [[Spanish–American War]], the country was ceded to the United States of America and made into a territory and eventually a [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]], thus ending monarchism. While the Philippines is currently a republic, the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]] and [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Sultan of Maguindanao]] retain their titles only for ceremonial purposes, but are considered ordinary citizens by the [[1987 Constitution]]. [[Bhutan]] has been an independent kingdom since 1907. The first [[Druk Gyalpo]] (''Dragon King'') was elected and thereafter became a hereditary absolute monarchy. It became a constitutional monarchy in 2008.

[[Tibet]] was a monarchy since the [[Tibetan Empire]] in the 6th century. It was ruled by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] following the Mongol invasion in the 13th century and became an effective [[diarchy]] with the [[Dalai Lama]] as co-ruler. It came under the rule of the Chinese [[Qing Dynasty]] from 1724 until 1912 when it gained de facto independence. The [[Dalai Lama]] became absolute temporal monarch until [[incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China]] in 1951.

[[Nepal]] was a monarchy for most of its history until becoming a federal republic in 2008.

Globo Livros. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; had a royal house ruling as emperor between 1822 and 1889, under Emperors [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] and [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]].

Between 1931 and 1983 nine other previous British colonies attained independence as kingdoms. All, including Canada, are in a [[personal union]] relationship under a shared monarch. Therefore, though today there are legally ten American monarchs, one person occupies each distinct position.

In addition to these sovereign states, there are also a number of sub-national ones. In [[Bolivia]], for example, the [[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|Afro-Bolivian king]] claims descent from an African dynasty that was taken from its homeland and sold into slavery. Though largely a ceremonial title today, the position of ''king of the Afro-Bolivians'' is officially recognized by the government of Bolivia.

[[Polynesia]]n societies were ruled by an ''[[ariki]]'' from ancient times. The title is variously translated as "supreme chief", "paramount chief" or "king".

The [[Kingdom of Tahiti]] was founded in 1788. Sovereignty was ceded to [[France]] in 1880 although descendants of the [[Pōmare Dynasty]] claim the title of King of Tahiti.

The [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was established in 1795 and overthrown in 1893.

An independent [[Kingdom of Rarotonga]] was established in 1858. It became a protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] at its own request in 1893.

[[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] ruled the short lived [[Kingdom of Fiji]], a constitutional monarchy, from 1871 to 1874 when he voluntarily ceded sovereignty of the islands to the [[United Kingdom]]. After independence in 1970, the [[Dominion of Fiji]] retained the British monarch as head of state until it became a republic following a [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|military coup in 1987]].

[[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] (including the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]), [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Tuvalu]] are sovereign states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that currently have [[Elizabeth II]] as their reigning constitutional monarch.

The [[Pitcairn Islands]] are part of the [[British Overseas Territories]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as the reigning constitutional monarch.

[[Tonga]] is the only remaining sovereign kingdom in Oceania. It has had a monarch since the 10th century and became a constitutional monarchy in 1875. In 2008, King [[George Tupou V]] relinquished most of the powers of the monarchy and the position is now largely ceremonial.

In [[New Zealand]] the position of [[Māori King Movement|Māori King]] was established in 1858. The role is largely cultural and ceremonial, and has no legal power.

[[Wallis Island|Uvea]], [[Alo (Wallis and Futuna)|Alo]] and [[Sigave]] in the [[France|French]] territory of [[Wallis and Futuna]] have non-sovereign elective monarchs.

==Titles and precedence in Europe==
{{For|commonly used names for specific monarchs|List of monarchs by nickname}}

The usage and meaning of a monarch's specific title has historically been defined by tradition, law and diplomatic considerations.

Note that some titles borne by monarchs have several meanings and may not exclusively designate a monarch. A [[Prince]] may be a [[prince du sang|person of royal blood]] (some languages uphold this distinction, see [[Fürst]]). A [[Duke]] may belong to a [[peerage]] and hold a dukedom (title) but no duchy (territory). In [[Imperial Russia]], a [[Grand Duke]] was a son or patrilineal grandson of the [[Tsar]] or [[Tsarina]]. Holders of titles in these alternative meanings did not enjoy the same status as monarchs of the same title.

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], there were numerous titles used by noblemen whose authority within their territory sometimes approached [[sovereignty]], even though they acknowledged the Holy Roman Emperor as [[suzerain]]; [[Prince-elector|Elector]], [[Grand Duke]], [[Margrave]], [[Landgrave]] and [[Count Palatine]], as well as secular princes like kings, dukes, princes and "princely counts" (''Gefürstete Grafen''), and ecclesiastical princes like Prince-Archbishops, [[Prince-bishop|Prince-Bishops]] and Prince-Abbots. A ruler with a title below emperor or king might still be regarded as a monarch, outranking a nobleman of the same ostensible title (e.g., [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]], a reigning sovereign, and his younger brother, [[Claude, Duke of Guise]], a nobleman in the [[peerage of France]]).

The table below lists titles in approximate [[order of precedence]]. According to [[protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] any holder of a title indicating sovereignty took precedence over any non-sovereign titleholder.

|[[Pope]]
| ''[[Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women|Women cannot hold the office of Pope]]''
|[[Papacy]]
|Successor of St. Peter, Bishop of Rome, Head of the Roman Catholic Church, Monarch of the [[Papal States]] and later Sovereign of the State of [[Vatican City]]. As senior ruler in Medieval Christendom, the Pope held precedence over all other titles and offices. The Papacy is a celibate office always forbidden to women; in English however, reports of female popes such as ([[Pope Joan]]) refer to them as ''pope'' and ''[[Popess]]''; the term is used, among other things, for the second trump in the [[Tarot]] deck''; some European languages also have a feminine form of the word pope, such as the Italian ''papessa'', the French ''papesse'', the Portuguese ''papisa'' and the German ''Päpstin''.

The German title [[Kaiser]] and the Bulgarian/Serbian title [[Tsar]] were both derived from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', intended to mean Emperor. One of the titles of the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire]] was ''Kaysar-i-Rûm'' (Emperor of Rome), Kaysar being a rough transliteration of ''Caesar'' (Emperor) into [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. ''Kaisar-i-Hind'', derived from the German word ''Kaiser'', was the [[Urdu]] translation of "Emperor of India".

==Use of titles by non-sovereigns==
It is not uncommon that people who are not generally seen as monarchs nevertheless use monarchical titles. There are at least five cases of this:
* Claiming an existing title, challenging the current holder. This has been very common historically. For centuries, the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] used, among his other titles, the title [[King of France]], despite the fact that he had had no authority over mainland French territory since the sixteenth century. Other cases include the numerous [[antipope]]s who have claimed the [[Holy See]].
* Retaining the title of an extinct monarchy. This can be coupled with a claim that the monarchy was in fact never, or should never have been, extinct. An example of the first case is the [[Seborga|Prince of Seborga]]. Examples of the second case are several [[List of monarchs who lost their thrones or abdicated in the 20th century|deposed monarchs]] or otherwise [[pretender|pretenders to thrones of abolished monarchies]], e.g., [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1982)|Leka, Crown Prince of Albania]] who is styled by some as the "King of The Albanians". Retaining the title of an extinct monarchy can, however, be totally free of claims of sovereignty, for example it was customary in numerous European monarchies to include "King of Jerusalem" in their full titles. When it comes to deposed monarchs, it is customary to continue the usage of their monarchical title (e.g., [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II, King of the Hellenes]]) as a [[courtesy title]], not a constitutional position, for the duration of their lifetime. However the title then dies with them and is not used by subsequent heirs or claimants unless the crown is restored constitutionally. Monarchs who have ''freely'' [[abdicate]]d are sometimes addressed by a lesser style (although, see [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] and [[Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]. However, where a monarch abdicated under duress (e.g., [[Michael I of Romania]]), it is usual (especially outside their former realm) to continue to use their monarchical style for their lifetime as a traditional courtesy.
* Inventing a new title. This is common among founders of [[micronation]]s, and also may or may not come with a claim of sovereignty, not usually recognised abroad. A notable example is [[Paddy Roy Bates]], styling himself the "Prince of Sealand", but not recognized as such by any national government, thus failing at least the [[constitutive theory of statehood|constitutive condition for statehood]] (see [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] for a fuller discussion of his claims). Another known example is that of [[Emperor Norton|Norton I]], who invented the title "Emperor of the United States of America" and later declared himself "Protector of Mexico".
* Usage of a monarchical title by a fictional character. This is common in [[fairy tale]]s and other works geared to children, as well as works of [[fantasy]]. Examples include [[Princess Leia]] and [[Princess Summerfall Winterspring]].
* [[Honorific nicknames in popular music]] and other aspects of popular culture, such as "King of Rock and Roll", [[Count Basie]] or [[Emperor Norton]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21083">'''New Public Management''' (NPM) is an approach to running [[public service]] organizations that is used in government and public service institutions and agencies, at both sub-national and national levels. The term was first introduced by academics in the UK and Australia &lt;ref&gt;Hood 1991 and Hood and Jackson 1991&lt;/ref&gt; to describe approaches that were developed during the 1980s as part of an effort to make the public service more "businesslike" and to improve its efficiency by using private sector management models. As with the private sector, which focuses on "[[customer service]]", NPM reforms often focused on the "...centrality of citizens who were the recipient of the services or customers to the public sector." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm &lt;/ref&gt; NPM reformers experimented with using decentralized service delivery models, to give local agencies more freedom in how they delivered programs or services. In some cases, NPM reforms that used [[e-government]] consolidated a program or service to a central location to reduce costs. Some governments tried using [[quasi-market]] structures, so that the public sector would have to compete against the private sector (notably in the UK, in [[health care]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm &lt;/ref&gt; Key themes in NPM were "...financial control, value for money, increasing efficiency...,identifying and setting targets and continuance monitoring of performance, handing over.. power to the senior management" [[Senior management|executives]]. Performance was assessed with audits, benchmarks and performance evaluations. Some NPM reforms used private sector companies to deliver what were formerly public services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

NPM advocates in some countries worked to remove "...collective agreements [in favour of]...individual rewards packages at senior levels combined with short term contracts" and introduce private sector-style [[corporate governance]], including using a [[Board of Directors]] approach to strategic guidance for public organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm &lt;/ref&gt; While NPM approaches have been used in many countries around the world, NPM is particularly associated with the most industrialized [[OECD]] nations such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States of America]]. NPM advocates focus on using approaches from the private sector–the [[corporation|corporate]] or business world–which can be successfully applied in the public sector and in a [[public administration]] context. NPM approaches have been used to reform the public sector, its policies and its programs. NPM advocates claim that it is a more efficient and effective means of attaining the same outcome. 

In NPM, citizens are viewed as "customers" and public servants are viewed as public managers. NPM tries to realign the relationship between public service managers and their political superiors by making a parallel relationship between the two. Under NPM, public managers have incentive-based motivation such as pay-for-performance, and clear performance targets are often set, which are assessed by using [[performance evaluation]]s. As well, managers in an NPM paradigm may have greater discretion and freedom as to how they go about achieving the goals set for them. This NPM approach is contrasted with the traditional [[public administration]] model, in which institutional decision-making, policy-making and public service delivery is guided by regulations, legislation and [[administrative law|administrative procedures]]. 

NPM reforms use approaches such as disaggregation, customer satisfaction initiatives, [[customer service]] efforts, applying an [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial spirit]] to public service, and [[innovation|introducing innovations]]. The NPM system allows "the expert manager to have a greater discretion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance, and Public Administration|date=Feb 2, 2006|pages=888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Public Managers under the New Public Management reforms can provide a range of choices from which customers can choose, including the right to opt out of the service delivery system completely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first practices of New Public Management emerged in the United Kingdom under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Thatcher played the functional role of “policy entrepreneur" and the official role of prime minister.{{fact|date=November 2016}} Thatcher drove changes in public management policy in such areas as organizational methods, civil service, labor relations, expenditure planning, financial management, audit, evaluation, and procurement. Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]], kept public management policy on the agenda of the Conservative government, leading to the implementation of the Next Steps Initiative. Major also launched the programs of the Citizens Charter Initiative, Competing for Quality, Resource Accounting and Budgeting, and the Private Finance Initiative.

A term was coined in the late 1980s to denote a new (or renewed) focus on the importance of management and ‘production engineering’ in public service delivery, which often linked to doctrines of economic rationalism (Hood 1989, Pollitt 1993). During this timeframe public management became an active area of policy-making in numerous other countries, notably in New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden.  At the same time, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ]] (OECD) established its Public Management Committee and Secretariat (PUMA), conferring to public management the status normally accorded more conventional domains of policy. In the 1990s, public management was a major item on President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]’s agenda. Early policy actions of the Clinton administration included launching the [[National Partnership for Reinventing Government|National Partnership]] and signing into law the [[Government Performance and Results Act]]. Currently there are few indications that public management issues will vanish from governmental policy agendas. A recent study showed that in Italy, municipal directors are aware of a public administration now being oriented toward new public management where they are assessed according to the results they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|last2=Bolzan|first2=Mario|title=Skills and training requirements of municipal directors: A statistical assessment|journal=Quality and Quantity|date=2015|doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term New Public Management (NPM) expresses the idea that the cumulative flow of policy decisions over the past twenty years has amounted to a substantial shift in the governance and management of the “state sector” in the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[North America]]. A benign interpretation is that these decisions have been a defensible, if imperfect, response to policy problems. Those problems as well as their solutions were formulated within the policy-making process. The agenda-setting process has been heavily influenced by electoral commitments to improve macro- economic performance and to contain growth in the public sector, as well as by a growing perception of public bureaucracies as being inefficient. The alternative-generation process has been heavily influenced by ideas coming from economics and from various quarters within the field of management.

== Globalization ==
Although the origins of NPM came from Westernized countries it expanded to a variety of other countries in the 1990s. Before the 1990s, NPM was largely associated to an idea utilized by developed countries that are particularly Anglo-Saxon. However the 1990s have seen countries in Africa, Asia and other countries looking into using this method. In Africa, downsizing and decrease of user fees have been widely introduced. These autonomous agencies within the public sectors have been established in these areas. Performance contracting became a common policy in crisis states worldwide. Contracting out of this magnitude can be used to do things such as waste management, cleaning, laundry, catering and road maintenance.

== Aspects  ==

NPM was accepted as the "gold standard for administrative reform"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management: Theory, Ideology, and Practice|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance and Public Administration|date=Jan 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s. The idea for using this method for government reform was that if the government guided private-sector principles were used rather than rigid hierarchical bureaucracy, it would work more efficiently. NPM promotes a shift from bureaucratic administration to business-like professional management. NPM was cited as the solution for management ills in various organizational context and policy making in education and health care reform.

The basic principles of NPM is can best be described when split into seven different aspects elaborated by Christopher Hood in 1991. Hood also invented the term NPM itself. &lt;ref&gt;in "A Public Management for all seasons?", Public Administration Review, Voæl 69, Spring1991 (3-19).&lt;/ref&gt; They are the following:

=== Management ===
Because of its belief in the importance and strength of privatizing government, it is critical to have an emphasis on management by engaging in hands-on methods. This theory allows leaders the freedom to manage freely and open up discretion.

=== Performance standards ===
Its important to maintain explicit standards and measures of performance in a workforce. Using this method promotes clarification of goals/intent, targets, and indicators for progression.

=== Output controls ===
The third point acknowledges the "shift from the use of input controls and bureaucratic procedures to rules relying on output controls measured by quantitive performance indicators".&lt;ref&gt;Yamaoto, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect requires using performance based assessments when looking to outsource work to private companies/groups.

=== Decentralization ===
NPM advocates often shifted from a unified management system to a decentralized system in which managers gain flexibility and are not limited to agency restrictions.

=== Competition ===
This characteristic focuses on how NPM can promote competition in the public sector which could in turn lower cost, eliminate debate and possibly achieve a higher quality of progress/work through the term contacts. Competition can also be found when the government offers contracts to the private sectors and the contract is given in terms of the ability to deliver the service effectively, quality of the goods provided, hence this will increase competition because the other private sector which did not get the contract will make strides to improve the quality and ability thereby facilitating competition.

=== Private-sector management ===
This aspect focuses on the necessity to establish short-term labor contracts, develop corporate plans or [[business plan]]s, performance agreements and [[mission statement]]s. It also focuses on establishing a workplace in which public employees or contractors are aware of the goals and intention that agencies are trying to reach.

=== Cost reduction ===
The most effective one which has led to its ascent into global popularity, focuses on keeping cost low and efficiency high. "Doing more with less" &lt;ref&gt;Hood, 1991: 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;
moreover cost reduction stimulates efficiency and is one way which makes it different from the traditional approach of management&lt;ref&gt;Deffy, 1999:67-78&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between public and private sectors ==
New Public Management draws practices from the private sector and uses them in the public sector of management. NPM reforms use market forces to hold the public sector accountable and the satisfaction of preferences as the measures of accountability.  In order for this system to proceed, certain conditions, such as the existence of competition, must exist and information about choices must be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms that promise to reinvent government by way of focusing on results and customer satisfaction as opposed to administrative and political processes fail to account for legislative self-interest. Institutions other than federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinvention would not even be announced, except perhaps on hallway bulletin boards.

== Issues ==

===Criticisms===
There are blurred lines between policymaking and providing services in the New Public Management system. Questions have been raised about the potential politicization of the public service, when executives are hired on contract under pay-for-performance systems.  There are concerns that public managers may move away from trying to meet citizens' needs. NPM brings to question integrity and compliance when dealing with incentives for public managers. Questions such as managers being more or less faithful arise. The public interest is at risk and could undermine the trust in government. Accountability can be a big issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relevance  ====

Although NPM had a dramatic impact in the 1990s on managing and policymaking, many scholars believe that NPM has hit its prime. Scholars like Frank Dunleavy believe New Public Management is phasing out because of disconnect with “customers” and their institutions. Scholars cite the Digital Era and the new importance of technology that kills the necessity of NPM. In countries that are less industrialized the NPM concept is still growing and spreading. This trend has much to do with a country's ability or inability to get their public sector in tune with the Digital Era. New Public Management was created in the Public Sector to create change based on: disaggregation, competition, and incentives. Using incentives to produce the maximum services from an organization is largely stalled in many countries and being reversed because of increased complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===
Post-NPM, many countries explored [[digital era governance]] (DEG). Dunleavy believes this new way of governance should be heavily centered upon information and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology will help re-integrate with digitalization changes. Digital Era Governance provides a unique opportunity for self- sustainability however, there are various factors that will determine whether or not DEG can be implemented successfully. When countries have proper technology, NPM simply can't compete very well with DEG. DEG does an excellent job of making services more accurate, prompt and remove most barriers and conflicts. DEG also can improve the service quality and provide local access to outsourcers.

===Comparisons to New Public Administration===

New Public Management is often mistakingly compared to [[New Public Administration]]. The ‘New Public Administration’ movement was one established in the USA during the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pfiffner|first1=James|title=Public Administration versus The New Public Management|url=http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Book_Chapters/NewPublicMgt.doc.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there may be some common features, the central themes of the two movements are different. The main thrust of the New Public Administration movement was to bring academic public administration into line with a radical egalitarian agenda that was influential in US university campuses. By contrast, the emphasis of the New Public Management movement a decade or so later was firmly managerial in the sense that it stressed the difference that management could and should make the quality and efficiency of public services. It focuses on public service production functions and operational issues contrasted with the focus on public accountability, ‘model employer’ public service values, ‘due process,’ and what happens inside public organizations in conventional public administration. That meant New Public Management doctrines tended to be opposed to egalitarian ideas of managing without managers, juridical doctrines of rigidly rule-bound administration and doctrines of self-government by public-service professionals like teachers and doctors.

Federalism is a system based upon democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments, creating what is often called a '''federation'''.

[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The mid-19th century [[Scandinavism]] political movement led to the modern use of the term [[Scandinavia]].]]

In the [[social science]]s, a '''political movement''' is a [[social group]] that operates together to obtain a [[political]] [[goal]],&lt;ref&gt;[[dict:political movement|Political movement]]. dict.org&lt;/ref&gt; on a local, regional, national, or international scope. Political [[Political process theory|movements develop]], [[Coordination game|coordinate]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Coordination failure (political science)|Coordination failure]]&lt;/ref&gt; promulgate,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[decree]]s, [[Speech_act#Classifying_illocutionary_speech_acts|declaration]]s, and [[wikt:announcement|announcement]]s&lt;/ref&gt; revise,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[Historical revisionism|political revisionism]] and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amendment|amend]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Constitutional amendment]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermeneutics|interpret]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Judicial interpretation]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Propaganda|produce materials]] that are intended to address the goals of the [[Identity politics|base of the movement]]. A [[social movement]] in the area of [[politics]] can be organized around a single issue or set of issues, or around a set of shared concerns of a [[social group]]. In a [[political party]], a [[political organization]] seeks to influence, or control, [[government policy]], usually by nominating their candidates and seating candidates in politics and governmental offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mc Donald|first=Neil|title=The Study of Political Parties|year=1963|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parties participate in [[elections|electoral campaigns]] and educational outreach or protest actions aiming to convince citizens or governments to take action on the issues and concerns which are the focus of the movement. Parties often espouse an [[ideology]], expressed in a party program, bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [coalition] among [[disparate]] interests.

==Examples==
Some political movements have aimed to change government policy, such as the [[Peace movement|anti-war movement]], the [[ecology movement]], and the [[anti-globalization movement]].  Many have aimed to establish or broaden the rights of subordinate groups, such as [[abolitionism]], the [[women's suffrage]] movement, the [[civil rights movement]], [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]], the [[disability rights movement]], or the inclusive [[human rights]] movement.  Some have represented class interests, such as the [[Labour movement]], [[socialism]], and [[communism]], others have expressed national aspirations, such as [[Anticolonialism|anticolonialist]] movements, [[Ratana]], [[Zionism]], and [[Sinn Féin]].  Political movements can also involve struggles to decentralize or centralize state control, as in [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], and [[Nazism]].

With [[globalization]], [[global citizens movement]]s may have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Global Citizens Movement. A New Actor For a New Politics | publisher=TransNational Institute | date=2001-10-18 | accessdate=2013-06-05 | author=George, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements may be named by outsiders, as with the [[levellers]] political movement in 17th century England was so named as a [[term of disparagement]]. Yet admirers of the movement and its aims later came to use the term, and it is the term by which they are known to history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Plant, David | url = http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm | title = The Levellers | accessdate = 2013-06-05| date = 2005-12-14 | work = British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Politics''' (from {{lang-gr|πολιτικά|''Politiká''}}, meaning "affairs of the cities") is the process of [[Decision-making|making decisions]] that apply to  members of a group.&lt;ref name="HagueHarrop2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rod Hague|author2=Martin Harrop|title=Comparative Government and Politics: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUEdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=31 May 2013|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1137317865|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance—organized control over a human community, particularly a [[state (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/political|title=Political &amp;#124; Definition of Political by Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-webster.com|date=|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The academic study focusing on just politics, which is therefore more targeted than all [[Political science]], is sometimes referred to as [[Politology]] (not to be confused with [[Politicology]]).

In modern nation-states, people have formed political parties to represent their ideas. They agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Sartori|title=Parties and Party Systems: A Framework for Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2005|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0954796617|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[election]] is usually a competition between different parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Rose|author2=Neil Munro|title=Parties and Elections in New European Democracies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfxMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=1 April 2009|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0955820328|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of political parties worldwide are: the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in [[South Africa]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) in [[Germany]] and the [[Indian National Congress]] in [[India]].

Politics is a multifaceted word. It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as "the art or science of government" and "political principles"), but often does carry a connotation of dishonest malpractice.&lt;ref name="HagueHarrop2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rod Hague|author2=Martin Harrop|title=Comparative Government and Politics: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUEdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=31 May 2013|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1137317865|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

Sharpe|isbn=978-0765627315|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been used negatively for many years: the [[God Save the Queen|British national anthem]] as published in 1745 calls on God to "Confound their politics",&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Gstk.png|God save our lord the king]], ''The Gentleman's Magazine'' 15 October 1745&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase "play politics", for example, has been in use since at least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: "We do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iKyaxXvPYcQC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=We+do+not+play+politics;+anti-slavery+is+no+half-jest+with+us#v=onepage&amp;q=We%20do%20not%20play%20politics%3B%20anti-slavery%20is%20no%20half-jest%20with%20us&amp;f=false|title=American Orations: V.

A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, [[negotiation]] with other political subjects, making [[law]]s, and exercising [[force (law)|force]], including [[warfare]] against adversaries.&lt;ref name="Hammarlund1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bo Hammarlund|title=Politik utan partier: studier i Sveriges politiska liv 1726-1727|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnRlAAAAIAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda P.

It is very often said that politics is about power.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Painter|first1=Joe|last2=Jeffrey|first2=Alex|title=Political Geography|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/oculyork/reader.action?docID=10870263}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[political system]] is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. The [[history of political thought]] can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' and the works of [[Confucius]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Women voter outreach 1935 English Yiddish.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Women voter outreach from 1935.]]
The word comes from the same [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word from which the title of [[Aristotle]]'s book ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (Πολιτικά, ''Polis'') also derives; ''polis'' means "affairs of the cities". The book title was rendered in [[Early Modern English]] in the mid-15th century as "Polettiques"&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;''The Diets and Sayings of the Philosophers'' (Early English Text Society, Original Series [https://books.google.com/books?id=M7G0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q= No. 211], 1941; reprinted 1961), p. 154: "the book of Etiques&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; and of Polettiques&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt; it became "politics" in [[Modern English]]. The singular ''politic'' first attested in English 1430 and comes from [[Middle French]] ''politique'', in turn from [[Latin]] ''politicus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dpoliticus|title=A Latin Dictionary|author= Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[Latinisation of names|Latinization]] of the Greek πολιτικός (''politikos''), meaning amongst others "of, for, or relating to citizens", "civil", "civic", "belonging to the state",&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolitiko%2Fs|author=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|accessdate=19 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924203856/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolitiko%2Fs|archive-date=24 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from πολίτης (''polites''), "citizen"&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"/&gt; and that from πόλις (''[[polis]]''), "city".&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"/&gt;

===Classifications===
Formal politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt; Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt; Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt;

Semi-formal politics is politics in government associations such as neighborhood associations, or student governments where [[Students' union|student government political party]] politics is often important.

Informal politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt; Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that "politics is everywhere".&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt;

==History of state politics==
The history of politics is reflected in the origin, development, and [[economics]] of the institutions of [[government]].

===The state===
{{main article|State (polity)}}

The origin of the [[State (polity)|state]] is to be found in the development of the ''[[Ancient warfare|art of warfare]]''. Historically speaking, all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Robert L.|title=A Theory of the Origin of the State|journal=Science|date=21 August 1970|volume=169|issue=3947|doi=10.1126/science.169.3947.733|pmid=17820299|pages=733–738|bibcode=1970Sci...169..733C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings, emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including China and Japan, were considered divine. Of the institutions that ruled states, that of [[kingship]] stood at the forefront until the American  Revolution put an end to the "[[divine right of kings]]".  Nevertheless, the monarchy is among the longest-lasting political institutions, dating as early as 2100 BC in Sumeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sumerian King List|url=http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/Sumerian-King-List-chronology.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the 21st century AD British Monarchy. Kingship becomes an institution through the institution of [[hereditary monarchy]].

The king often, even in [[Monarchy|absolute monarchies]], ruled his kingdom with the aid of an elite group of advisors, a [[Privy council|council]] without which he could not maintain power. As these advisors and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power, [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] emerged, which may be considered the germ of [[constitutional government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://history-world.org/absolutism.htm|work=International World History Project|title=European Absolutism And Power Politics|date=1998|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monarchist.org.uk/constitutional-monarchy.html|title=Constitutional Monarchy|publisher=British Monarchist League Ltd|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest of the king's subordinates, the [[earl]]s and [[duke]]s in England and Scotland, the dukes and [[count]]s in the Continent, always sat as a right on the council. A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts [[tribute]]. One of the functions of the council is to keep the coffers of the king full. Another is the satisfaction of [[military service]] and the establishment of [[lordship]]s by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenks|first=Edward|title=A history of politics|pages=73–96|quote=The origin of the State, or Political Society, is to be found in the development of the art of military warfare.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:2017.07.26 Protest Trans Military Ban, White House, Washington DC USA 7646 (36056769341).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Activism is a form of politics.]]
===Forms of political organization===
There are many forms of [[political organization]], including states, non-government organizations (NGOs) and international organizations such as the [[United Nations]]. States are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance, where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the [[regime]] in power.

According to Aristotle, states are classified into [[monarchies]], [[aristocracy|aristocracies]], [[Timocracy|timocracies]], [[democracies]], [[oligarchies]], and [[tyrannies]]. Due to changes across the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned.

All states are varieties of a single organizational form, the sovereign state. All the [[great powers]] of the modern world rule on the principle of [[sovereignty]]. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an [[autocracy|autocratic government]] or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. [[Constitutions]] are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate. England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] but after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] abandoned them to be taken up later by the [[American Colonies]] after their [[American Revolution|emancipation]] and then [[France]] after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are many forms of government. One form is a strong central government as in France and China. Another form is local government, such as the ancient divisions in England that are comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the practice of [[federal government]], first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, [[Australia]]. Federal states introduced the new principle of agreement or [[contract]]. Compared to a [[federation]], a [[confederation]] has a more dispersed system of [[judicial power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Confederation_vs_Federation|title=Confederation vs Federation – Difference and Comparison|publisher=Diffen|date=|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[American Civil War]], the argument by the Confederate States that a State could [[secede]] from the Union didn't stand because of the Federal government's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5EUNr295pgcC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=In+the+American+Civil+War,+the+contention+of+the+Confederate+States+that+a+State+could+secede+from+the+Union+was+untenable+because+of+the+power+enjoyed+by+the+Federal+government+in+the+executive,+legislative+and+judiciary+branches#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20the%20American%20Civil%20War,%20the%20contention%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20that%20a%20State%20could%20secede%20from%20the%20Union%20was%20untenable%20because%20of%20the%20power%20enjoyed%20by%20the%20Federal%20government%20in%20the%20executive,%20legislative%20and%20judiciary%20branches&amp;f=false|title=Social Sciences|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to professor [[A. V. Dicey]] in ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenks|first=Edward|title=A history of politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z3gCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=politics+history#v=onepage&amp;q=|pages=1–164|year=1900|publisher=J. M. Dent &amp; Co.|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global politics===
{{main article|Global politics}}
'''Global politics''' include different '''practices''' of political [[globalization]] in relation to questions of social power: from global patterns of governance to issues of globalizing conflict. The 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the [[Third Reich]] but also the rise and relative fall of [[communism]]. The development of the [[atomic bomb]] gave the United States a more rapid end to its conflict in Japan in [[World War II]]. Later, the [[hydrogen bomb]] became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction.

Global politics also concerns the rise of global and international '''organizations'''. The [[United Nations]] has served as a forum for peace in a world threatened by nuclear war, "The invention of nuclear and space weapons has made war unacceptable as an instrument for achieving political ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabinowitch|first=Eugene|authorlink=Eugene Rabinowitch|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-QsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=World+politics+final+nuclear+holocaust&amp;q=World%20politics%20final%20nuclear%20holocaust|date=June 1973|page=13|issn=0096-3402|quote=...the rationale of traditional patterns of world politics.|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an all-out final nuclear holocaust is radically undesirable for man, "[[nuclear blackmail]]" comes into question not only on the issue of world peace but also on the issue of national sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dulles|first=Allen|authorlink=Allen Dulles|title=The Craft of Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mH3qdHK6_EsC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=the+craft+of+intelligence+April+1963#v=onepage&amp;q=|page=224|year=2006|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-1599215778|quote=...using 'nuclear blackmail' as a threat to intimidate other countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a Sunday in 1962, the world stood still at the brink of nuclear war during the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] from the implementation of U.S. vs [[Soviet Union]] nuclear blackmail policy.

According to [[political science]] professor [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], global politics is affected by ''values'': norms of [[human rights]], ideas of [[human development (humanity)|human development]], and beliefs such as [[cosmopolitanism]] about how we should relate to each:
{{quote|Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2014|last1=James|first1=Paul|authorlink=Paul James (academic)|title=Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global|url=https://www.academia.edu/7547819|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|pages=x|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Political corruption===
{{main article|Political corruption}}
[[William Pitt the Elder]], speaking before the British [[House of Lords]], 9 January 1770, observed: "Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|editor-first=William|editor-last=Safire|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was echoed more famously by [[John Dalberg-Acton]] over a century later: "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."&lt;ref name="lmcone"&gt;Dalberg-Acton, John (Lord Acton). [http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165acton.html Letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, April 5, 1887]. Published in ''Historical Essays and Studies'', edited by J. N. Figgis and R. V. Laurence (London: Macmillan, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political corruption''' is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties and/or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Corruption Law &amp; Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/political-corruption|website=USLegal|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of corruption vary, but include [[corruption]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[patronage]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. While corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking|trafficking]], it is not restricted to these activities. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title= African corruption 'on the wane'|publisher=BBC News – Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning "rule by thieves".{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Political parties===
{{main article|Political party}}

A '''political party''' is a [[political organization]] that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within [[government]], usually by participating in [[elections|electoral campaigns]], educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed [[ideology]] or vision bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [[coalition]] among disparate interests.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Politics as an academic discipline===
[[Political science]], the study of politics, examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC&amp;pg=PA566&amp;dq=power+corrupts+and+absolute+power+corrupts+absolutely#v=onepage&amp;q=power%20corrupts%20and%20absolute%20power%20corrupts%20absolutely|page=566|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0195343342|quote=Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Harold Lasswell]] defined politics as "who gets what, when, and how".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Barbara A.|last2=Bardes|first2=Mack C.|last3=Shelley|first3=Steffen W.|title=American Government and Politics Today: The Essentials|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Boston|isbn=978-0538497190|edition=2011–2012 Student|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour, as well as examining the preconditions for the formation of political communities;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community|first1=Timothy|last1= Laurie|first2=Hannah|last2= Stark|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|volume=22|issue=4|pages=69–79|year= 2017|url=https://www.academia.edu/35349930}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[political economy]], which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two; and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], who has defined politics as "responding to conflict with dialogue," offers an account which distinguishes political philosophies from political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blattberg|first=Charles|title=Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies|journal=Public Affairs Quarterly|date=July 2001|volume=15|issue=3|pages=193–217|ssrn=1755117|accessdate=|issn=0887-0373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first academic chair devoted to politics in the United States was the chair of history and political science at [[Columbia University]], first occupied by Prussian émigré [[Francis Lieber]] in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farr|first1=James|last2=Seidelman|first2=Raymond|title=Discipline and history|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e9_jbbroRHsC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Discipline+and+history+Francis+Lieber+Karl+Marx&amp;q=|year=1993|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0472065127|quote=...a chair at Columbia in 1857 as professor of history and political science, the very first of its kind in America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political values==
[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Political views differ on average across nations. A recreation of the [[Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map of the World]] based on the [[World Values Survey]].]]
{{main article|Political spectrum}}

Several different [[political spectrum|political spectra]] have been proposed.

===Left–right===
Political analysts and politicians divide politics into [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] politics, often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is comparatively recent (it was not used by [[Aristotle]] or [[Hobbes]], for instance), and dates from the [[French Revolution]] era, when those members of the [[National Assembly]] who supported the [[republic]], the common people and a [[secular society]] sat on the left and supporters of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privilege and the Church sat on the right.&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years. A particularly influential event was the publication of the [[Communist Manifesto]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1848. The ''Manifesto'' suggested a course of action for a [[proletarian]] revolution to overthrow the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society and abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a [[classless]] and [[Stateless communism|stateless]] society.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CY3b0mcDF9QC|title=The Communist Manifesto|last=Marx|first=Karl|last2=Engels|first2=Friedrich|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0140447576|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that the right wing often values [[tradition]] and [[social stratification|inequality]] while the left wing often values [[Social progress|progress]] and [[egalitarianism]], with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with [[social democracy]], [[libertarianism]] or [[Regulated market|regulated capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045000932.html#C|author=Daniel J. Levinson|title=Conservatism and Radicalism|publisher=''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Norberto Bobbio]], one of the major exponents of this distinction, the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality – believing it to be unethical or unnatural&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.&lt;ref name="Bobbio"&gt;[[Norberto Bobbio|Bobbio]], Norberto, ''Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction'' (translated by Allan Cameron), 1997, [[University of Chicago Press]]. {{ISBN|0226062465}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some ideologies, notably [[Christian Democracy]], claim to combine left and right wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, "In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts and Hogwood, ''European Politics Today'', [[Manchester University Press]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include [[Fascist]] [[Terza Posizione]] economic politics in Italy, [[Peronism]] in Argentina, and [[National Action Party (Mexico)#"National Action" politics|National Action Party]] in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.miis.edu/media/view/18971/original/balenouvelleresarticle.pdf|title=bale|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Authoritarian–libertarian===
[[Authoritarianism]] and [[civil libertarianism|libertarianism]] refer to the amount of individual [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where "individual [[rights]] and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Markus Kemmelmeier|authorlink=Markus Kemmelmeier|title=Individualism, Collectivism, and Authoritarianism in Seven Societies|year=2003|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=304–322|doi=10.1177/0022022103034003005|display-authors=1|last2=Burnstein|first2=Eugene|last3=Krumov|first3=Krum|last4=Genkova|first4=Petia|last5=Kanagawa|first5=Chie|last6=Hirshberg|first6=Matthew S.|last7=Erb|first7=Hans-Peter|last8=Wieczorkowska|first8=Grazyna|last9=Noels|first9=Kimberly A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while libertarians generally oppose the [[Sovereign state|state]] and hold the [[individual]] as sovereign. In their purest form, libertarians are [[anarchism|anarchists]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/150-years-of-libertarian|title=150 years of Libertarian|author=afaq|website=Anarchists Writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who argue for the total abolition of the state, of [[political parties]] and of [[Political organisation|other political entities]], while the purest authoritarians are, by definition, [[totalitarianism|totalitarians]] who support state control over all aspects of society. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/totalitarian?s=t Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, [[classical liberalism]] (also known as ''[[laissez-faire]] liberalism'',&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Ian Adams, ''Political Ideology Today'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and [[limited government]]. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual [[property rights]], [[free market]]s, [[natural rights]], the protection of [[civil liberties]], constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of [[John Locke]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Voltaire]], [[Montesquieu]] and others. According to the libertarian [[Institute for Humane Studies]], "the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp What Is Libertarian?], Institute for Humane Studies {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324231417/http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp|date=24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchist political philosopher [[L. Susan Brown]] "Liberalism and [[anarchism]] are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual [[Freedom of will|freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[L. Susan Brown]].
