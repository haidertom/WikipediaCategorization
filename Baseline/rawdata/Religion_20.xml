      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34647">'''Aniconism''' is the absence of material representations of the natural and [[supernatural]] world in various [[culture]]s, particularly in the [[monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic religions]]. This ban may extend from only [[God]] and deities to [[saint]] characters, all living beings, and everything that exists. The phenomenon is generally codified by the religious traditions and as such becomes a [[taboo]]. When enforced by the physical destruction of images, aniconism becomes [[iconoclasm]]. The word itself derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] εικων 'image' with the negative prefix ''an-'' (Greek [[privative alpha]]) and the suffix ''-[[-ism|ism]]'' (Greek -ισμος).

==General aspects==
'''Monotheist religions''' – Aniconism was shaped in monotheist religions by theological considerations and historical contexts. It emerged as a corollary of seeing God's position as the ultimate power holder, and the need to defend this unique status against competing external and internal forces, such as pagan idols and critical humans. Idolatry was seen as a threat to uniqueness, and one way that prophets and missionaries chose to fight it was through the prohibition of physical representations.  The same solution worked against the pretension of humans to have the same power of creation as God (hence their banishment from the Heavens, the destruction of [[Tower of Babel|Babel]], and the Second Commandment in the biblical texts).

'''Aniconism as a construction''' – Some modern scholars, working on various cultures, have gathered material showing that the idea of aniconism is in many cases an intellectual construction, suiting specific intents and historical contexts, rather than a fact of the tangible reality (Huntington for Buddhism, Clément for Islam and Bland for Judaism – see below in notes and references).

==In Buddhism==
{{Main article|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the [[Buddha]], 2nd century CE, [[Amravati|Amaravati]],  [[India]].]]
[[Buddhist art]] used to be aniconic: the [[Buddha]] was represented only through his symbols (an empty [[throne]], the [[Bodhi]] tree, the [[Buddha footprint|Buddha's footprints]], the [[prayer wheel]]). This reluctance toward anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha's sayings, reported in the [[Dighanikaya|Digha Nikaya]], that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Although there is still some debate, the first [[anthropomorphic]] representations of the [[Buddha]] himself are often considered a result of the [[Greco-Buddhist]] interaction. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the late 20th century, the well-established theory of aniconism in Buddhist art had been criticized by one art historian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm|title=Early Buddhist art and the theory of aniconism|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the question has been the subject of continuing debate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629413 "Aniconism and the Multivalence of Emblems"], Vidya Dehejia, ''Ars Orientalis'', Vol. 21 (1991), pp. 45-66 (Dehejia 1991); [https://www.academia.edu/4194715/In_the_Absence_of_the_Buddha_Aniconism_and_the_Contentions_of_Buddhist_Art_History(Thompson 2011)]; DeCaroli, Robert 2014: Image Problems: Art, Text, and the Development of the Buddha Image in Early South Asia.(DeCaroli 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hinduism==
[[Image:Aikya Linga in Varanasi.jpg|thumb|Traditional flower offering to the aniconic [[Shiva linga]] in [[Varanasi]]]]
Although aniconism is better known in connection to [[Abrahamic religions]], basic patterns are shared between various religious beliefs including Hinduism, which also has aniconistic beliefs. For example, although Hinduism is commonly represented by such [[anthropomorphic]] religious [[murti]]s, aniconism is equally represented with such abstract symbols of God such as the [[Shiva linga]] and the [[saligrama]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, by Jeanne Fowler, pgs. 42-43, at [https://books.google.com/books?id=RmGKHu20hA0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Hinduism+murtis+shiva+linga&amp;lr=&amp;cd=18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Books.Google.com] and Flipside of Hindu symbolism, by M. K. V. Narayan at pgs. 84-85 at [https://books.google.com/books?id=ewRfp4qpvt4C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Hinduism+murtis+saligrama&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Hindus have found it easier to focus on anthropomorphic icons, because god [[Krishna]] said in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], chapter 12, verse 5, that it is much more difficult to focus on God as the unmanifested than God with form, because human beings have a need to perceive via the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-12-04.html|title=Bhagavad-Gita: Chapter 12, Verse 5|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Christianity==
{{main article|Aniconism in Christianity}}

===Byzantine iconoclasm===
{{main article|Byzantine iconoclasm}}
There were two periods of iconoclasm, or icon-destruction, in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in the mid eighth and early ninth centuries. The political aspects of the conflicts are complex, dealing with the relationship between the Byzantine Emperors, the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Church]] councils, and the [[Pope]]. Theologically, the debate, as with most in Orthodox theology at the time, revolved around the two natures of [[Jesus]]. Iconoclasts believed that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of the Messiah at the same time, but separately. Because an icon which depicted Jesus as purely physical would be [[Nestorianism]], and one which showed Him as both human and divine would not be able to do so without confusing the two natures into one mixed nature, which was [[Monophysitism]], all icons were thus heretical. Reference was also made to the prohibitions on the worship of graven images in the [[Mosaic Law]].

===During the Protestant Reformation===
{{main article|The Reformation and art}}
Aniconism was also prevalent during the [[Protestant Reformation]], when some Protestants began to preach rejection of what they perceived as idolatrous Catholic practices which filled its churches with pictures, statues, or relics of saints. The Reformed (Calvinist) churches and certain sects (most notably the Puritans and some of the Baptist churches) began to prohibit the display of religious images.  A famous example of this comes from [[Oliver Cromwell]], who expelled [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], and who once destroyed a golden relic placed in his church.

===Among Christians today===
In the [[Church of the East]], also known as the Nestorian church, opposition to religious images eventually became the norm due to the [[rise of Islam]] in the region, where it forbade any type of depictions of Saints and [[biblical prophets]]. As such, the Church was forced to get rid of their icons. This tradition is still in practice today, with many [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] churches lacking artistic depictions of biblical figures, including those of Jesus and Mary.&lt;ref name="Nestorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=21-05-027-f|title=The Shadow of Nestorius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amish]] continue to avoid photographs or any depictions of people; their children's dolls usually have blank faces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishnews.com/amisharticles/amishand%20photos.htm "The Amish &amp; Photographs" ''Amish Country'' News Article by Brad Igou, (1991, 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], followers are prohibited from wearing religious themed jewelry displaying icons such as the cross, as idol worship is prohibited. Having images or sculptures of Jesus, Jehovah (God), and angels are also considered a taboo according to their interpretation of Exodus 20:4,5 and 1 Corinthians 10:14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2009094|title=Why Do Jehovah's Witnesses Not Use Images in Their Worship? — Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY|website=wol.jw.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followers are also admonished to avoid any objects portraying depictions of the supernatural. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/101974120?q=images+of+supernatural&amp;p=par#h=20|title=You, Too, Can Become Free — Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY|website=wol.jw.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
{{main article|Aniconism in Islam}}

===Theological views===
The [[Qur'an]], the Islamic holy book, does not explicitly prohibit the depiction of human figures; it merely condemns idolatry (ex.: [[wikisource:Quran 5:87|5:92]], [[wikisource:Quran 21:51|21:52]]). Interdictions of figurative representation are present in the [[Hadith]], among a dozen of the hadith recorded during  the latter part of the period when they were being written down.  Because these hadith are tied to particular events in the life of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], they need to be interpreted in order to be applied in any general manner. [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] exegetes, from the 9th century onward, increasingly saw in them categorical prohibitions against producing and using any representation of living beings. There are variations between religious [[Madhhab|schools]] and marked differences between different [[Divisions of Islam|branches]] of Islam. Aniconism is common among [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Sunni sects such as [[Salafis]] and [[Wahhabis]] (which are also often [[iconoclastic]]), and less prevalent among [[liberal movements in Islam]]. [[Shia|Shi'a]] and [[Sufi|mystical orders]] also have less stringent views on aniconism.  On the individual level, whether or not specific Muslims believe in aniconism may depend on how much credence is given to hadith (e.g. [[Submitters]] do not believe in any hadith), and how liberal or strict they are in personal practice.

Aniconism in Islam not only deals with the material image, but touches upon mental representations as well. It is a thorny question, discussed by early theologians, as to how to describe God, Muhammad and other prophets, and, indeed, if it is permissible at all to do so. [[Allah|God]] is usually represented by immaterial attributes, such as "holy" or "merciful", commonly known from His "[[99 Names of God|Ninety-nine beautiful names]]". Muhammad's physical appearance, however, is amply described, particularly in the traditions on his life and deeds ''[[Sira al-Nabi]]''. Of no less interest is the validity of sightings of holy personages made during dreams.

===Aniconism in practice===
[[File:Miraj by Sultan Muhammad.jpg|thumb|[[Persian miniature]] painting from the 16th century CE, depicting Muhammad, his face veiled, ascending on the [[Buraq]] into the Heavens, a journey known as the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]].]]
'''Religious core''' – In practice, the core of normative religion in [[Islam]] is consistently aniconic. Its embodiment are spaces such as the [[mosque]] and objects like the [[Qur'an]] or the white dress of pilgrims entering [[Mecca]], deprived of figurative images. Other spheres of religion – schisms, mysticism, popular piety, private level – exhibit in this regard significant variability. Profane aniconism is even more fluctuating. Generally speaking aniconsim in Islamic societies is restricted in modern times to specific religious contexts, while its prevalence in the past wasn't enforced in numerous areas and during extended periods.

'''Present''' – Depending on which segment of Islamic societies are referred to, the application of aniconism is characterized with noteworthy differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.nl/m_catalogue_sub6_id7561.htm |title=See 'Sura' and 'Taswir' in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929230552/http://www.brill.nl/m_catalogue_sub6_id7561.htm |archive-date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors are the epoch considered, the country, the religious orientation, the political intent, the popular beliefs, the private benefit or the dichotomy between reality and discourse.  Today, the concept of an aniconic Islam coexists with a daily life for Muslims awash with images.  TV stations and newspapers (which do present still and moving representations of living beings) have an exceptional impact on public opinion, sometimes, as in the case of [[Al Jazeera|Al-Jazira]], with a global reach, beyond the Arabic speaking and Muslim audience. Portraits of secular and religious leaders are omnipresent on banknotes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html |title=Petroleum-related banknotes: Saudi Arabia: Oil Refinery|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720014731/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html |archive-date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html |title=Petroleum-related banknotes: Iran: Abadan Refinery, Iahanshahi-Amouzegar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015444/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html |archive-date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and coins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://njmark0.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/bahrain500fills00000.jpg.w300h295.jpg}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in streets and offices (e.g.: presidents like [[Nasser]] and [[Mubarak]], [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]], [[Hafiz Al-Asad|Al-Asad]] or [[Hezbollah]]'s [[Hasan Nasrallah|Nasrallah]] and ayatollah [[Khomeini]]). Anthropomorphic statues in public places are to be found in most Muslim countries  ([[Saddam|Saddam Hussain]]'s are infamous &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Jul/05/mn/mn03a.html |author=David Zucchino |title=U.S. military, not Iraqis, behind toppling of statue|newspaper=Honolulu Advertiser|date=July 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as Arts schools training sculptors and painters.  In the Egyptian countryside, it is fashionable to celebrate and advertise the returning of pilgrims from Mekka on the walls of their houses. Sometimes those who profess aniconism will practice figurative representation (cf. portraits of [[Taliban]]s from the [[Kandahar]] photographic studios during their imposed ban on photography&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Anderson, Thomas Dworzak, ''Taliban'', London (UK), Trolley, 2003, {{ISBN|0954264851}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). For [[Shia|Shi'a]] communities, portraits of the major figures of Shi'ite history are important elements of religious devotion. Portraits of '[[Ali]] – with veiled and unveiled face alike – can be bought in [[Iran]] around shrines and in the streets, to be hung in homes or carried with oneself, while in [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] they notoriously ornate trucks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/masterpieces.to.go.the.trucks.of.pakistan.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World : Masterpieces to Go: The Trucks of Pakistan|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008035126/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/masterpieces.to.go.the.trucks.of.pakistan.htm|archive-date=2014-10-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; buses and rickshas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpak.net/~ricksha/|title=www.webpak.net|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021211125/http://www.webpak.net/~ricksha/|archivedate=21 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the [[Sunni]] tradition, a photographic picture of the deceased can be placed on the [[Shia|Shi'ite]] tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/golestaneshohada2.shtml |title=Picture of Golestan e Shohoda cemetery Esfahan -Esfahan, Iran|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018075410/http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/golestaneshohada2.shtml |archive-date=October 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestirantravel.com/sights/mashad/martyrscemetry.html|title=Mashad MARTYRS CEMETERY at Best Iran Travel.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A curiosity in Iran is a [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] photography supposed to represent Prophet Muhammad as a young boy.

&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Past''' – Neither is the representation of living beings in Islamic countries a modern phenomenon or due to current technology, westernization or the cult of the personality. Statues of humans and animals adorned palaces of the [[Ummayad]] era,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonic.net/~tallen/palmtree/fe2.htm|title=Aniconism and Figural Representation in Islamic Art, by Terry Allen|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while frescoes were common under the Ummayads,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/educational_site/arch_sites/qamra.shtml|title=Educational Site: Archaeological Sites: Qusayr 'Amra|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in many countries of [[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam .28House of Islam.29|Dar al-Islam]], notably under the [[Safavid]]s and various Central Asian dynasties. Figurative miniatures from Medieval Arabic countries, India, Persia and Turkey are one of the fleuron of Islamic Arts and a good deal of its attraction power for non-Muslim societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rezaabbasimuseum.ir/|title=Reza Abbasi Museum|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~history/portraits.html|title=Portraits|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potent rulers like Shah Tahmasp in Persia and Akbar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/article/mughal|title=Mughal Miniature Painting - An Alternative Source of History|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in India, patrons of some of the most beautiful figurative miniatures in arts from Islamic countries, migrated during their life between an extravagant 'figurative' and an extremist 'aniconic' period. During the 15th and 17th century representations of Muhammad (veiled,&lt;ref name="expositions1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/012.htm|title=BNF - Torah, Bible, Coran|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; unveiled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/sup-turc_190_015.htm|title=BNF - Torah, Bible, Coran|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and other prophets or Biblical characters, like Adam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/anderson/gaa/iblis.jpg |title=Angels Kneeling before Adam |work=Stories of the Prophets}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/sup-pers_776_011v.htm|title=BNF - Torah, Bible, Coran|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/013.htm|title=BNF - Torah, Bible, Coran|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Jesus;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/sup-pers_1567_163.htm|title=BNF - Torah, Bible, Coran|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Solomon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/splendeurs/grand/6-146.htm|title=BNF - Splendeurs Persanes - Ferdowsi  - Le Livre des rois|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alexander the Great,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.bnf.fr|title=Consultation de la base des clichés Daguerre|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; became common in painted manuscripts from Persia, India and Turkey. Extreme rarities are an illustrated Qur'an depicting Muhammad and, in a Spanish-Muslim manuscript datable from the 16th century, five Ummayad and Abbasid caliphs. [[Iblis]] too is present in various illustrated manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiqillum.com/slideshows/Nativities/|title=antiqillum.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There aren't, however, known figurative depictions of God.

'''Circumvention methods''' – Medieval Muslim artists found various ways not to infringe any prohibition of the image, while still representing living beings. It can be argued that since God is absolute, the act of depiction  is his own and not that of a human; and miniatures are obviously very crude representations of the reality, so the two can't be mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2011/07/07/les-choses-comme-elles-sont-une-initiation-au-bouddhisme-ordinaire-d-herve-clerc-et-bouddha-mode-d-emploi-de-jack-kornfield_1545789_3260.html|title=Hervé Clerc et Jack Kornfield : championnats de Bouddha libre|first=Roger-Pol|last=Droit|date=7 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016|via=Le Monde|newspaper=Le Monde.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the material level, prophets in manuscripts can have their face covered by a veil&lt;ref name="expositions1"/&gt; or all humans have a stroke drawn over their neck, a symbolical cut defending them to be alive. [[Islamic calligraphy|Calligraphy]], the most Islamic of arts in the Muslim world, has also its figurative side due to anthropo- and zoomorphic [[Islamic calligraphy#Calligrams|calligrams]].

==In Judaism==
{{main article|Aniconism in Judaism}}

===The Tanakh===
A number of verses in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]) refer to prohibitions against the creation of various forms of images, invariably linked directly with [[idolatry]]. The strongest over-all source is based on what [[Judaism]] counts as the second of the [[Ten Commandments]]:

:Do not have any other gods before Me. ''Do not represent [such] gods by any carved statue or picture of anything in the heaven above, on the earth below, or in the water below the land''. Do not bow down to [such gods] or worship them. I am God your Lord, a God who demands exclusive worship.  Where My enemies are concerned, I keep in mind the sin of the fathers for [their] descendants, to the third and fourth [generation]. But for those who love Me and keep My commandments, I show love for thousands [of generations]. ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20:3-6)

This prohibition is widespread. For instance, [[Leviticus]] 26:1 reads:

:[Therefore,] do not make yourselves false gods. ''Do not raise up a stone idol or a sacred pillar for yourselves.'' Do not place a kneeling stone in your land so that you can prostrate yourselves on it. I am God your Lord.

Similar injunctions appear in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 33:52, [[Deuteronomy]] 4:16, and 27:15; in all cases, the creation of the image is associated with idolatry, and indeed, the words commonly translated as "image" or some variant thereof (פסל ''pesel'', שקוץ ''shikuts'') are generally used interchangeably with words typically translated as "idol" (e.g., אליל ''elil'').&lt;ref&gt;See http://search.  freefind.com/find.html?id=6433772&amp;pageid=r&amp;mode=ALL&amp;query=image&amp;n=0&amp;s=et for a list of all verses containing the word ''image'' as translated by the [[Jewish Publication Society of America Version|JPS edition]].&lt;/ref&gt; (An important exception is צלם ''tselem'', used in such verses as Genesis 1:26: "let us make man in our image". This word was not associated with idols.)

Based on these prohibitions, the Hebrew prophets, such as [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] and others, preached very strongly against idolatry.  In many of their sermons, as recorded in the biblical books bearing their names, the prophets regarded the use of religious images as a negative sign of assimilation into the surrounding [[pagan]] cultures of the time.

===The Halakha===
Despite the semantic association with idols, [[Halakha]] ("Jewish law") as taught by the [[Shulkhan Arukh]] ("Code of Jewish Law") and still practiced and applied by [[Orthodox Judaism]] today, interprets the verses as prohibiting the creation of certain types of graven images of people, angels, or astronomical bodies, whether or not they are actually used as idols. The Shulkhan Arukh states: "It is forbidden to make complete solid or raised images of people or angels, or any images of heavenly bodies except for purposes of study".&lt;ref name="Torah.org 2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shulchan-Aruch - Chapter 11 |website=Torah.org |url=http://torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/chapter11.html# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401043629/http://torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/chapter11.html%23 |archive-date=2016-04-01 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Heavenly bodies" are included here because the stars and planets were worshipped by some religions in human forms.  Astronomical models for scientific purposes are permitted under the category of "study.")

The fleeing Jews are depicted with birds' heads, while Pharaoh and most of the pursuing Egyptians have blank circles with or without eyes as heads; two of them, however, have bird's heads.  The [[Judenhut]] hats are typical of 14th-century Germany.]]

===Differences across media===
Although the prohibition applies mainly to sculpture, there are some authorities who prohibit two-dimensional full-face depictions.  Some base this upon their understanding of the [[Talmud]], and others based it upon [[Kabbalah]].  Of note is the portrait of Rabbi Tzvi Ashkenazi (known as "the Hakham Tzvi"),  which is housed in the  [http://www.jewishmuseum.org.uk/ Jewish Museum in London].  Based on his interpretation of this prohibition, the Hakham Tzvi refused to sit for his portrait.  However, the London Jewish Community wanted a portrait, so they commissioned the portrait to be done without the Hakham Tzvi's knowledge.  The Hakham Tzvi's son, Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]], says it was a perfect likeness.

Additionally, there is one type of representation, namely, [[bas-relief]] or raised representation on a flat surface, that is particularly problematic.  Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] discusses a medal struck in honor of Rabbi [[Eliezer Horowitz]] that features Horowitz's portrait.  Emden ruled this violated the injunction against depictions.  Furthermore, many hold that such representations in the synagogue either violate this injunction or are not permitted, as they give the appearance of violating this injunction.  Most notably, Rabbi David ibn Zimra and Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]] hold that carvings of lions (e.g., representing the [[Lion of Judah]]) are inappropriate in synagogues.
[[File:Dura Europos fresco Jews cross Red Sea.jpg|thumb|''Crossing the Red Sea'', from [[Dura Europos synagogue]], with two [[Hand of God (art)|Hands of God]], 3rd century]]

On the other hand, some authorities hold that Judaism has no objection to photography or other forms of two-dimensional art, and depictions of humans can be seen in religious books such as the [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]], as well as children's books about biblical and historical personages.  Although most [[Hasidic]] Jews object to having televisions in their homes, this is not related to prohibitions against idolatry, but, rather, to the content of network and cable programming.  Hasidim of all groups regularly display portraits of their [[Rebbe]]s, and, in some communities, the children trade "rabbi cards" that are similar to [[baseball cards]].  In both [[Hasidic]] and [[Orthodox Judaism]], taking photographs or filming are forbidden on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and [[Jewish holiday|Jewish holy days]], but this prohibition has nothing to do with idolatry.  Rather, it is related to the prohibition against [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|working or creating]] on these days.

===In modern times===
Although, in biblical times, Jews were actively [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]], physically tearing down and destroying idols of other religions located within their political jurisdiction, today there is more tolerance for other cultures.  In the state of [[Israel]], all religious sites, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, are protected by law.  Even though Jewish Law teaches that idolatry is forbidden to all of humanity as one of the seven [[Noahide Laws]], Jews today combat it through discussion, debate, and education, rather than the physical destruction of statues and shrines.  However, many traditional Jews still follow the prohibitions against entering places of idolatry, and will not attend functions held in buildings where there are religious statues.

In a refutation of the belief in an aniconic Judaism, and more generally in an underestimation of Jewish visual arts, the historian of ideas Kalman Bland recently proposed that the phenomenon is a modern construction, and that "Jewish aniconism crystallized simultaneously with the construction of modern Jewish identities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i6833.pdf|title=(Bland 2001:8)|website=princeton.edu|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bahá'í Faith==
{{Main article|Aniconism in the Bahá'í Faith}}
For the followers of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], the photographs and depictions of the [[Báb]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]], who are considered [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]], are considered very precious.  They are viewed and handled with reverence and respect, and their existence itself is not considered offensive.  However, [[Shoghi Effendi]], the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, stated that believers should only view the images when they can be treated with the utmost respect, and not let them be exposed to the public or displayed in their private homes:
:"There is no objection that the believers look at the picture of Bahá'u'lláh, but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes."
::(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, December 6, 1939, republished in ''Lights of Guidance'', p. 540)

Shoghi Effendi has also written in the ''Directives from the Guardian'' regarding the portrait of the [[Báb]]:
:"The portrait of the Báb should be regarded as an inestimable privilege and blessing to behold, as past generations were denied a glimpse of the Face of the Manifestation, once He had passed on."&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi: ''Directives from the Guardian'' Published in 1973.  Accessed on February 2, 2006 from http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-115.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Jelle:  ''The Babi Question You Mentioned?The Origins of the Bahá'í Community of the Netherlands'', pg. 243.  Peeters Publishers, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
::(Shoghi Effendi, Directives from the Guardian, p. 43)

Two pictures of Bahá'u'lláh and a portrait of the Báb are on display at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] in the [[International Archives]] building, where the Bahá'ís view it as part of an organized [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|pilgrimage]].

==Other religions==
In [[African art|Africa]] aniconism varies from culture to culture from elaborate masks and statues of humans and animals to their total absence. A common feature, however, across the continent is that the "High God" is not given material shape. On the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] writes the following: "They don't consider it mighty enough for the Heavens to depict Gods on walls or to display them in some human shape."&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}}/{{la icon}} [[Publius Cornelius Tacitus]], "9. Götterverehrung", ''Germania (De origine et situ Germanorum liber)'', Reclam, Stuttgart, 2000, {{ISBN|3-15-009391-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His observation is not general to all German people as documentary evidence suggests (see [[Ardre image stone]]s).

In [[Australian Aboriginal culture]] there is a prohibition and tribal lore and custom contravening the depiction of the newly or recently dead, including photographs, because it is believed that depicting them will inhibit their passage to the [[Dreamtime|Great Dreaming]] of the Ancestors. This has led some Australian newspapers to publish apologies alongside [[obituaries]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9049">'''Astrolatry''' is the worship of [[stars]] and other  [[heavenly body|heavenly bodies]] as [[deity|deities]], or the association of deities with heavenly bodies.
The most common instances of this are [[sun god]]s and [[moon god]]s in polytheistic systems worldwide. Also notable is the association of the [[planet]]s with deities in [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]], and hence in Greco-Roman religion, viz. [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].

The term '''astro-theology''' is used in the context of 18th- to 19th-century scholarship aiming at the discovery of the [[Urreligion|original religion]], particularly [[Urmonotheismus|primitive monotheism]]. Unlike ''astrolatry'', which usually implies [[polytheism]], frowned upon as [[idolatry|idolatrous]] by Christian authors since [[Eusebius]], astrotheology is any "religious system founded upon the observation of the heavens",&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', citing Derham (1714) as the first attestation of the term.&lt;/ref&gt;   and in particular, may be [[monotheism|monotheistic]]. Gods, goddesses, and demons may also be considered personifications of astronomical phenomena such as lunar eclipses, planetary alignments, and apparent interactions of planetary bodies with stars. '''Astro-theology''' is used by Jan Irvin, [[Jordan Maxwell]] and Andrew Rutajit (2006) in reference to "the earliest known forms of religion and nature worship", advocating the [[entheogen]] theory of the [[origin of religion]].

==Etymology==
''Astrolatry'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἄστρον ''astron'', "star" and the suffix -λάτρης, itself related to [[wikt:λάτρις|λάτρις]] ''latris'', "worshipper" or λατρεύειν ''latreuein'', "to worship" from λάτρον ''latron'', "payment".

==History==
[[Babylonian astronomy]] from early times associates stars with deities, but the [[heaven]]s as the residence of an anthropomorphic pantheon, and later of monotheistic [[God]] and his retinue of angels, is a later development, gradually replacing the notion of the pantheon residing or convening on the summit of high mountains. Sayce (1913) argues a parallelism of the "stellar theology" of Babylon and Egypt, both countries absorbing popular star-worship into the official pantheon of their respective state religions by identification of gods with stars or planets.&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Henry Sayce, The religion of ancient Egypt, Adamant Media Corporation, 1913, 237f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrolatry does not appear to have been common in the [[Levant]] prior to the [[Iron Age]], and becomes popular under [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] influence.
The [[Sabaeans]] were notorious for their astrolatry, for which reason the practice is also known as "Sabaism" or "Sabaeanism".
Similarly, the [[Chaldea]]ns came to be seen as the prototypical astrologers and star-worshippers by the Greeks.

The term ''astro-theology'' appears in the title of a 1714 work by [[William Derham]],  ''Astro-theology: or, A demonstration of the being and attributes of God, from a survey of the heavens'' based on the author's observations by means of "Mr. [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]]' Glass". Derham thought that the stars were openings in the [[firmament]] through which he thought he saw the [[Empyrean]] beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Crowe, ''Modern theories of the universe: from Herschel to Hubble'', Courier Dover Publications, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-486-27880-3}}, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1783 issue of ''The New Christian's magazine'' had an essay entitled ''Astro-theology'' which argued the "demonstration of sacred truths" from "a survey of heavenly bodies" in the sense of the [[watchmaker analogy]]. [[Edward Higginson]] (1855) argues a compatibility of "Jewish Astro-theology" of the [[Hebrew Bible]], which places God and his angelic hosts in the heavens, with a "Scientific Astro-theology" based on observation of the cosmos.

[[Manly P Hall]] (1901–1990), mystic and a [[33rd degree]] mason, taught that each of the  three Abrahamic faiths has a planet that governs that religion. Judaism is Saturn: the symbol of Judaism is a hexagram symbol of Saturn, and the day of worship is on Saturday, day of Saturn. Christianity is the Sun: the symbol of Christianity is the cross symbol of the Sun, and the day of worship is Sunday, day of the Sun. Islam is Venus: the symbol of Islam is the star and  crescent (the star commonly thought to represent Venus), and the day of worship is on Friday.

==Prohibition in Abrahamic religions==
The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains repeated reference to astrolatry. Thus, Deuteronomy 4:19, 17:3 contains a stern warning against worshipping the sun, moon, stars or any of the [[heavenly host]]. Relapse into worshipping the host of heaven, i.e. the stars, is said to have been the cause of the fall of the [[kingdom of Judah]] in II Kings 17:16. King [[Josiah]] in 621 BC is recorded as having abolished all kinds of [[idolatry]] in Judah, but astrolatry was continued in private (Zeph. 1:5; Jer. 8:2, 19:13). [[Ezekiel]] (8:16) describes sun-worship practiced in the court of the temple of Jerusalem, and Jeremiah (44:17) claims that even after the destruction of the temple, women in particular insisted on continuing their worship of the "queen of heaven".

[[Augustine of Hippo]] criticized sun- and star-worship in ''De Vera Religione''  (37.68) and  ''De civitate Dei'' (5.1–8). Pope [[Leo the Great]] also denounced astrolatry, and the cult of ''[[Sol Invictus]]'', which he contrasted with the Christian nativity.

Despite such prohibitions, [[Dorothy M. Murdock]], a proponent of the study,&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Casey Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? T&amp;T Clark 2014 p21-22&lt;/ref&gt; has released books on the subject and teaches the connections between the solar allegory and the life of Christ. She also goes beyond the astronomical comparisons and postulates ties between the origins of many of the early Abrahamic religions to ancient mythologies of that in Egypt, Rome, and Greece.

The [[Qur'an]] contains strong prohibitions against astrolatry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Strong prohibition of Astrolatry is mentioned in the Quran through Prophet Abrahim observation of celestial bodies whose worship was common in Babylonian religion of that time.

Below is the reference from Al-Quran, Surah Anaam, chapter 6, verses 75–80
 
75. Thus did we show Ibrahim (Abraham) the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he be one of those who have Faith with certainty.

76. When the night covered him over with darkness he saw a star. He said: "This is my lord." But when it set, he said: "I like not those that set."

77. When he saw the moon rising up, he said: "This is my lord." But when it set, he said: "Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among the erring people."

78. When he saw the sun rising up, he said: "This is my lord. This is greater." But when it set, he said: "O my people! I am indeed free from all that you join as partners in worship with Allah.

79. Verily, I have turned my face towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth Hanifa (Islamic Monotheism, i.e. worshipping none but Allah Alone) and I am not of Al-Mushrikun (see V.2:105)".

80. His people disputed with him. He said: "Do you dispute with me concerning Allah while He has guided me, and I fear not those whom you associate with Allah in worship. (Nothing can happen to me) except when my Lord (Allah) wills something. My Lord comprehends in His Knowledge all things. Will you not then remember?

Al-Quran, Surah Anaam (chapter 6, verse 75–80)

Some movements or sects within traditionally [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] or [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] religions recognize that it is possible to practice religious faith, spirituality and adherence to tenets without a belief in deities. People with what would be considered religious or spiritual belief in a supernatural controlling power are defined by some as adherents to a religion; the argument that atheism is a religion has been described as a contradiction in terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |credits=[[Bill Maher]] |series=Real Time with Bill Maher |serieslink=Real Time with Bill Maher |network=HBO |date=2012-02-03 |quote=Religion is defined as the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, and atheism is — precisely not that. Got it? Atheism is a religion like abstinence is a sex position.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abrahamic religions==

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish atheism}}
In general, formulations of [[Jewish principles of faith]] require a belief in God (represented by Judaism's paramount prayer, the [[Shema]]). In many modern [[Jewish religious movements]], rabbis have generally considered the behavior of a Jew to be the determining factor in whether or not one is considered an adherent of [[Judaism]]. Within these movements it is often recognized that it is possible for a Jew to strictly practice Judaism as a faith, while at the same time being an agnostic or atheist. [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] does not require any belief in a deity, and certain popular [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] prayer books, such as ''[[Gates of Prayer]]'', offer some services without mention of God. Jewish atheists who practice [[Humanistic Judaism]] embrace Jewish culture and history, rather than belief in a supernatural god, as the sources of their Jewish identity. One study found that only 48% of self-identified Jews believe in God.&lt;ref name="harrisinteractive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris-Interactive-Poll-Research-While-Most-Americans-Believe-in-God-Only-36-pct-A-2003-10.pdf |title=While Most Americans Believe in God, Only 36% Attend a Religious Service Once a Month or More Often |author=Taylor, Humphrey. |year=2003 |quote=Protestants (90%) are more likely than Roman Catholics (79%) and much more likely than Jews (48%) to believe in God. Protestants (47%) are also more likely than Catholics (35%) to attend church once a month or more often. Only 16% of Jews go to synagogues once a month or more often. |accessdate=January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109031643/http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris-Interactive-Poll-Research-While-Most-Americans-Believe-in-God-Only-36-pct-A-2003-10.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], first Chief Rabbi of the Jewish community in Palestine, held that atheists were not actually denying God: rather, they were denying one of man's many images of God. Since any man-made image of God can be considered an [[Cult image|idol]], Kook held that, in practice, one could consider atheists as helping true religion burn away false images of God, thus in the end serving the purpose of true monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rachmani|2002a}}; {{harvnb|Rachmani|2002b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian atheism}}
High rates of atheism have been found among self-identified [[Christian]]s in the United States. For example, 10% of self-identified [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and 21% of self-identified [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] were found to be atheists in a [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] survey from 2003.&lt;ref name="harrisinteractive" /&gt;

There is no single [[Christianity|Christian]] approach toward atheism. The approach taken varies between [[Christian denomination]]s, and Christian ministers may intelligently distinguish an individual's claims of atheism from other nominal states of personal perspective, such as plain disbelief, an adherence to science, a misunderstanding of the nature of religious belief, or a disdain for organized religion in general.

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] makes this explicit. While it identifies atheism as a violation of the [[Ten Commandments|First Commandment]], calling it "a sin against the virtue of religion", it is careful to acknowledge that atheism may be motivated by [[virtue|virtuous]] or [[moral]] considerations, and admonishes the followers of Roman Catholicism to focus on their own role in encouraging atheism by their religious or moral shortcomings:
:(2125) [...] The imputability of this offense can be significantly diminished in virtue of the intentions and the circumstances. "Believers can have more than a little to do with the rise of atheism. To the extent that they are careless about their instruction in the faith, or present its teaching falsely, or even fail in their religious, moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than to reveal the true nature of God and of religion."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, English version, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7E.HTM section 3.2.1.1.3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628151746/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7E.HTM |date=June 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous idiosyncratic atheist belief is that of [[Thomas J. J. Altizer]]. His book ''The Gospel of Christian Atheism'' (1967) proclaims the highly unusual view that God has literally died, or self-annihilated. According to Altizer, this is nevertheless "a Christian confession of faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Altizer|1967|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Making clear the difference between his position and that of both [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] notion of the [[God is dead|death of God]] and the stance of theological non-realists, Altizer says, "To confess the death of God is to speak of an actual and real event, not perhaps an event occurring in a single moment of time or history, but notwithstanding this reservation an event that has actually happened both in a cosmic and in a historical sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Altizer|1967|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 survey by "Faith Communities Today"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/news/011205.html Surveys: 'Uuism' unique Churchgoers from elsewhere, Christian Century Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122075528/http://www.uua.org/news/011205.html |date=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 18% of [[Unitarian Universalist]]s (UU) consider themselves to be atheists, with 54% considering themselves humanist. According to this study 16% of UUs consider themselves Buddhist, 13% Christian, and 13% [[Paganism|Pagan]].

===Islam===
{{See also|Discrimination against atheists in Islamic countries|Cultural Muslim}}
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2015}}
In [[Islam]], atheists are categorized as ''[[kafir]]'' ([[Wiktionary:كافر|كافر]]), a term that is also used to describe [[Shirk (Islam)|polytheists]] (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''), and that translates roughly as "denier" or "concealer". ''Kafir'' carries connotations of blasphemy and disconnection from the Islamic community. In Arabic, "atheism" is generally translated ''ilhad'' ([[Wiktionary:إلحاد|إلحاد]]), although this also means "heresy".

The [[Quran]] is silent on [[Apostasy in Islam#Punishment for apostasy|the punishment for apostasy]], though not the subject itself. The Quran speaks repeatedly of people going back to unbelief after believing, and gives advice on dealing with "hypocrites":
Sura 9:73,74 {{quote|"O Prophet, strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm against them.  Their abode is Hell,-- an evil refuge indeed.  They swear by God that they said nothing [evil], but indeed they uttered blasphemy, and they did it after accepting Islam; and they meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out: this revenge of theirs was [their] only return for the bounty which God and His Apostle had enriched them!  If they repent, it will be best for them; but if they turn back [to their evil ways], God will punish them with a grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter.  They shall have none on this earth to protect or help them."| Qur'an, sura 9 ([[At-Tawba]]), ayat 73-73&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|73|e=74|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Hadith]] expound upon dealing with apostates:
{{quote|Narrated Abdullah: Allah's Messenger said, 'The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Messenger, cannot be shed except in three cases:  in Qisas (equality in punishment) for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (Apostate) and leaves the Muslims."|{{hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|9|83|17}}}}

{{quote|Narrated Abu Qilaba: Once Umar bin Abdul Aziz sat on his throne in the courtyard of his house so that the people might gather before him....He replied 'By Allah, Allah's messenger never killed anyone except in one of the following three situations:  1)  A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed (in Qisas,)  2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and,  3) a man who fought against Allah and His messenger, and deserted Islam and became an apostate....'|{{hadith-usc|bukhari|9|83|37}}}}

{{quote|Narrated Ikrima: Some Zanadiqa ([[Zindiq|Zanadiqa]] refers to those who innovate within Islam, adding rules to Islam which didn't previously exist) were brought to 'Ali and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn 'Abbas who said, "If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Allah's Apostle forbade it, saying, 'Do not punish anybody with Allah's punishment (fire). I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Apostle, "Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him."|{{hadith-usc|bukhari|9|84|57}}}}

The Qur'an refers to atheism in this verse:
The term commonly used for atheists is "Dahriyyah" from the Arabic word for "time" in a verse which speaks of people "who says that our death and Decimation are caused only by the passing of time".  (in [[Al-Jathiya|aljathiah]],)  24)

[045:024] And they say: "There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except Ad-Dahr (time)." And they have no knowledge of it, they only conjecture.

Other relevant Hadithic verses include Bukhari, volume 9, #58, 64, 271.

Muslims are not at liberty to [[Apostasy in Islam|change their religion]] or become atheists. Atheists in Islamic countries and communities frequently [[Persecution of atheists in Islamic countries|conceal their non-belief]] (as do people with other condemned qualities, such as homosexuality).

In recent times, capital punishment for atheism is almost never applied, and convicted atheists may be jailed with an opportunity to recant or be stripped of certain civil rights. Religiosity in the Arab world is seen to be essential for morality and atheism is widely associated with immorality. Religious attitudes grew more conservative since the 1980s, compared to the preceding decades when secular socialism was politically dominant. Nonetheless, atheism is tolerated if it is not conspicuous and a worldwide support network for ex-Muslims has existed since 2007. Some commentators believe that the number of undeclared atheists in the Arab world is substantial. According to 2012 WIN/Gallup poll of Saudi citizens, 5 percent of Saudis identify as "convinced atheists", the same percentage as in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Invisible Atheists|author=AHMED BENCHEMSI|date=April 23, 2015|newspaper=New Republic|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/121559/rise-arab-atheists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasingly large [[Ex-Muslim|ex-Muslim communities]] in the [[Western world]] that adhere to no religion have been well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Losing their religion: the hidden crisis of faith among Britain’s young Muslims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/may/17/losing-their-religion-british-ex-muslims-non-believers-hidden-crisis-faith|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Pan, ''[http://www.cfr.org/publication/8252/europe.html Europe: Integrating Islam]'', [[Council on Foreign Relations]], 2005-07-13&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification.&lt;ref name="Losing Their Religion"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/2015-06-22/losing-their-religion|title=Losing Their Religion|date=17 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that about half of the 4.2 million persons from Muslim background in Germany no longer embrace Islam in adulthood.&lt;ref name="fowid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fowid.de/fileadmin/datenarchiv/Religionszugehoerigkeit/Religionszugehoerigkeit_Bevoelkerung_Deutschland_2014.pdf |title=Religionszugehörigkeit Bevölkerung Deutschland |publisher=Forschungsgruppe Weltanschauungen in Deutschland |date= |accessdate=24 January 2016 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115132325/http://fowid.de/fileadmin/datenarchiv/Religionszugehoerigkeit/Religionszugehoerigkeit_Bevoelkerung_Deutschland_2014.pdf |archivedate=15 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian religions==
Atheism is often considered acceptable within [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Atheism in Hinduism}}
[[Atheism]] is a valid form of belief in [[Hinduism]]. Certain Hindu schools however view the path of the atheist as a very difficult to follow in matters of spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chakravarti| first = Sitansu| title = Hinduism, a way of life| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.| year = 1991| page = 71| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&amp;pg=PA71| isbn =  978-81-208-0899-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the six fundamental ''[[Āstika and nāstika|Astika]]'' schools of Hindu philosophy, the [[Samkhya]] do not accept God and the early [[Mimamsa]] also rejected the notion of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Dasgupta| first = Surendranath| title = A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 1| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.| year = 1992| page = 258| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA258| isbn = 978-81-208-0412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samkhya lacks the notion of a 'higher being' that is the ground of all existence. It proposes a thoroughly dualistic understanding of the cosmos, in which two parallel realities ([[Purusha]], the spiritual, and [[Prakriti]], the physical) coexist and the aim of life is the gaining of liberating self-knowledge of the Purusha.  Here, no God (better stated ''theos'') is present, yet Ultimate Reality in the form of the Purusha exists.

[[Cārvāka]] (also ''Charvaka'') was a [[materialist]] and atheist school of thought in [[India]], which is now known principally from fragments cited by its [[Astika]] and [[Buddhist]] opponents. The proper aim of a Cārvākan, according to these sources, was to live a prosperous, happy, productive life in this world (cf [[Epicureanism]]). There is some evidence that the school persisted until at least 1578.

===Jainism===
{{See also|Transtheism}}
[[Jainism]] believes that the emancipated soul is itself God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Sangave| first = Vilas| title = Aspects of Jaina religion – Issue 12 of Jñānapīṭha Mūrtidevī granthamālā: English series| publisher = Bhartiya Jnanpith| year = 2006| page = 27| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8UhvGRoyAqMC&amp;pg=PA27| isbn = 978-81-263-1273-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jains do not believe in a creator God, but there is belief in numerous gods within the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chambliss| first = Joseph| title = Philosophy of education: an encyclopedia – Volume 1671 of Garland reference library of the humanities| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| year = 1996| page = 38| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-YJlpiTbckgC&amp;pg=PA38| isbn = 978-0-8153-1177-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Buddhism]] is often described as [[Nontheism|non-theistic]], since Buddhist authorities and canonical texts do not affirm, and sometimes deny, the following:

* The existence of a [[Creation myth|creation]], and therefore of a [[creator deity]]
* That a god (deva), gods, or other divine beings are the source of moral imperatives. Instead, the [[Dharma]] is an attribution of the universe
* That human beings or other creatures are responsible to a god or gods for their actions

All canonical Buddhist texts that mention the subject accept the ''existence'' (as distinct from the ''authority'') of a great number of spiritual beings, including the Vedic deities. From the point of view of Western theism, certain concepts of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] found in the [[Mahayana]] school of Buddhism, e.g. of [[Amitabha]] or the Adibuddha may seem to share characteristics with Western concepts of God, but [[Gautama Buddha]] himself denied that he was a god or divine.

==Chinese religions==
Some forms of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] do not explicitly affirm, nor are they founded upon a faith in, a higher being or beings. However, Confucian writings do have numerous references to ''[[Tian]]'' (Heaven), which denotes a transcendent power, with a personal connotation. [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] writings, such as that of [[Chu Hsi]], are vague on whether their conception of the Great Ultimate is like a personal deity or not. Although the Western translation of the [[Tao]] as "god" in some editions of the [[Tao te Ching]] is highly misleading, it is still a matter of debate whether the actual descriptions of the [[Tao]] by [[Laozi]] has theistic or nontheistic undertones. Religious forms of Taoism do believe in a variety of cosmological beings, which are analogies to the cosmic forces within the universe.

==Other religions==
Religions that can be described as grey areas, and do not belong in the aforementioned categories, such as [[Unitarian Universalism]].

===Unitarian Universalism===
Unitarian Universalism (UU) is a liberal religion, first founded when Unitarians and Universalists came together in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uua.org/central-east/regionalization/regi |title= Regionalization FAQ - Background Questions &amp; Nuts and Bolts |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Unitarian Universalist Association, atheists and agnostics are accepted and welcomed into the UU religion. 'People with atheist and agnostic beliefs find a supportive community in our congregations. We are pro-science, pro-reason, and pro-Evolution...Unitarian Universalism honors the differing paths we each travel. Our congregations are places where we celebrate, support, and challenge one another as we continue on these journeys.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uua.org/beliefs/who-we-are/beliefs/atheist-agnostic|title= Atheist and Agnostic Unitarian Universalists|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UU also accepts Christians, and many other religions who believe in a higher being, but it is not restricted - the UUA says that 'Unitarian Universalists are agnostic, theist, atheist, and everything in between.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/higher-power |title= Existence of a Higher Power in Unitarian Universalism|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satanism==
{{See also|Satanism|Theistic Satanism}}
[[LaVeyan Satanism]] is atheistic, rejecting belief in God and all other deities, including, to the surprise of many, Satan. "Satanism begins with atheism," said [[Church of Satan]] High Priest [[Peter H. Gilmore]] in an interview. "We begin with the universe and say, 'It’s indifferent. There’s no God, there’s no Devil. No one cares!'"&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Satanism: An interview with Church of Satan High Priest Peter Gilmore|Interview with Peter H. Gilmore]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]', November 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The function of God is performed and satisfied by the satanist him/herself. The needs of worship, ritual, and religious/spiritual focus are directed inwards towards the satanist, as opposed to outwards, towards a deity. It rejects concepts such as prayer, the afterlife, and divine forces.

==Legal status of atheism==

Legal treatment of atheism has in the past and continues to vary tremendously across different jurisdictions.  Three major types of national regime exist: [[state atheism]], where atheism is supported by the government; [[state religion]], where a specific religion or sect is supported by the state, and a [[secular state]] which supports neither.  Most ancient civilizations (from city-states to empires) had state religions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Law|author=Henry James Sumner Maine|publisher=Cosimo Classics (New York, 2005)|isbn=978-1596052260}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern countries are secular.  State atheism is currently practiced in China and Vietnam, but unlike the strongly enforced bans on religious worship in the early Soviet Union and after the Communist Revolution in China, [[freedom of religion]] is currently established by law in both China and Vietnam, and respected in practice to some degree (see [[Freedom of religion in China]] and [[Freedom of religion in Vietnam]]).  The minority of modern countries with state religions have established interpretations of either Christianity, Islam, or Buddhism.

Countries with state religions range from those with extremely tolerant laws, like the [[Freedom of religion in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], to those where the police enforce daily prayer, like [[Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]].  Under the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system of the Ottoman Empire]], separate systems of family law are enforced by religious authorities for their separate communities. This system was inherited by and is still in use to various degrees in various Middle Eastern countries, including [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian Authority]], [[Egypt]], and [[Greece]] (for religious minorities).  Similar separate systems are used in [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]].  These systems sometimes create legal problems for atheists and couples of different religions.  Atheists may be forced to declare an approved religion, or may be assigned one based on their ethnicity.

Even in counties where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution or other fundamental law, practices or beliefs of a specific religion might be reflected in ostensibly secular codes.  For example, [[blue law]]s in some Christian countries have enforced certain observances of the [[Sabbath]] on Sunday, for example by banning alcohol sales or forcing businesses to close.  Laws surrounding [[nudity]], [[pornography]], [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[homosexuality]], [[gambling]], [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]] often track religious sensibilities, though some argue that these are cultural rather than religious prohibitions, though there may be an influence of religious thinking on culture.  Major early transitions from state religions to secular states in Western Christiandom were noted in [[Colonial North America]], the [[American Revolution]], and the [[French Revolution]]. Prohibitions against state support for any particular religion or against required participation are not always enforced, particularly early in this transition process, and local laws in strongly religious communities may conflict with higher-level law.  For example, official [[school prayer]] was allowed in the United States until 1962.  Freedom of religion was affirmed in nearly all countries in 1966 by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].  Despite having no state religion, the German government collects religious taxes for the constituents of several religions; the fee for leaving a religious body has been [[Freedom_of_religion_in_Germany#Fee_for_leaving_a_religious_corporate_body_under_public_law|challenged by atheists]].

Some states, regardless of state endorsement of a religion, protect major religions against insult (which may include profession of atheism or criticism of religion by atheists), including [[Freedom of religion in Indonesia|Indonesia]].  Other religious crimes which may cause legal problems for atheists include 
[[heresy]], [[blasphemy]], [[apostasy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Abraham's Children: Liberty and Tolerance in an Age of Religious Conflict |editor=Kelly James Clark |publisher=Yale University Press (USA)|year=2012|isbn=978-0300179378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain (English Law) ===
The chief law officer is called [[Lord Chancellor]] and holds the [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|title]] of 'the [[conscience]] of the [[monarch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780192839756/English-Constitution-Bagehot-Walter-0192839756/plp |author= Walter Bagehot|year=1867|publisher=Oxford University Press (USA 2001) |isbn=978-0192839756 |title=The English Constitution (Oxford World's Classics) |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; British subjects have a long history of religious upheaval from the time when [[Henry VIII of England]] ordered the [[English Reformation]]. There followed a long period of alternate suppressions and liberalizations until, following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] when common law became progressively more descriptive than prescriptive, judges were allowed some latitude in determining guilt (which is why [[English law]] is so ambiguous).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English Religious Tradition and the Genius of Anglicanism|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publisher|author=Most Reverend Rowan Williams Archbishop of Canterbury|year=2009|isbn=978-1606082096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British "religious atheists" are numerous and might include [[George Fox]], [[John Wesley]] and, notably [[Jeremy Bentham]], whose body is displayed in the South Cloister of [[University College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=John Tyndall's Transcendental Materialism and the Conflict Between Religion and Science in Victorian England (Distinguished Dissertations)|editor=Stephen  Kim|year=1996|isbn=978-0773422780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Atheism in the United States is protected under the [[First Amendment]]'s [[Free Exercise Clause]]. There are also online churches that have been created by atheists to secure legal rights, to ordain atheist clergy to hold ceremonies, as well as for parody, education, and advocacy.&lt;ref name=firstchurchofatheism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstchurchofatheism.com/index.php/about/ |title=About First Church of Atheism |accessdate=July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110711004751/http://firstchurchofatheism.com/index.php/about/| archivedate= 11 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchoffreethought.org/ |title=North Texas Church of Freethought |accessdate=July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716080425/http://www.churchoffreethought.org/| archivedate= 16 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcof.org/Content-Public/Page-Edit/Page.asp?iID=-1145332288 |title=Houston Church of Freethought |accessdate=July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716080916/http://www.hcof.org/Content-Public/Page-Edit/Page.asp?iID=-1145332288| archivedate= 16 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/46214/ |title=Do Atheists Need a Church? |accessdate=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1797, the United States Senate ratified a treaty with Tripoli that stated in Article 11: 
{{quote|As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Matt Dillahunty]] |url=http://www.atheist-community.org/library/articles/read.php?id=742 |title=Atheism and the Law |format= |publisher=Atheist Community of Austin |accessdate=20 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615213106/http://atheist-community.org/library/articles/read.php?id=742 |archivedate=15 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Food is cooked and served to the people sitting right outside the temple. Usually this is done on festival occasions as a part of worshipping the lord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theindianawaaz.com/govt-launches-seva-bhoj-yojnato-give-gst-rebate-on-langar-prasad-bhandara/ Rebates for bhandara] The Indian Awaaz&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
It is a  [[Marathi language|marathi]] word in origin but is being used in other languages also.

== History ==
Bhandara is actually a district in [[Maharashtra]] which is known as the “Rice bowl of the country”. Practice of bhandara is mostly done by rich people as an offering to the god they worship. It can also be organized by any individual (referred to as the yajamana) who wishes to worship the lord. This practice was first started by the founder of the sikh religion. After performing the rituals and worshipping the almighty, the yajamana serves food to the poor and the needy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God's Gateway: Identity and Meaning in a Hindu Pilgrimage Place|last=James|first=Lochtefeld|publisher=oxford university press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New york|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhog usually  called khichdi-a dish made up of rice and moong daal are served to the people. Bhandara is also organized to celebrate a birthdays, anniversaries or weddings and to commemorate the death of the departed.

The indian government has introduced a scheme known as ‘'Seva Bhoj Yojna’' to reimburse the government share of the Central Goods and Services Tax and the Integrated Goods and Service Tax for purchases by religious institutions of certain products for providing free meals. It will cover the raw ingredients of meals and is expected to cost a total of Rs. 325.00 Crores in the 2018/2019 fiscal year. To qualify, an institution will need to serve food free of charge to over 5000 people in the year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/economy/110717/food-supplied-by-religious-places-exempted-from-gst-finance-min.html Food supplied by religious places exempted from GST finance] Deccan Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary developments ==
A number of ashrams across India, specially in [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] , bhandaras are offered on a daily basis to the devotees and other poor people.

{{Buddhism}}
Buddhist views, although varying on a series of [[Chinese Buddhist canon|canon]]s within the three branches of [[Buddhism]] ([[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]]), observe the concept of [[euthanasia]], or "mercy killing", in a denunciatory manner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umoar.mu.edu.mm/bitstream/handle/123456789/166/The%20Response%20to%20Euthanasia.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=The Response to Euthanasia from the Perspective of Buddhism, Mandalay University Research Journal 3, 188-195|last=Lin|first=Saw|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods of euthanasia include [[Voluntary euthanasia|voluntary]], [[Involuntary euthanasia|involuntary]], and [[Non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Perrett RW |title=Buddhism, euthanasia and the sanctity of life |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=309–13 |date=October 1996|pmid=8910785 |pmc=1377066 |doi=10.1136/jme.22.5.309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, as one school of Buddhism evolved into the next, their scriptures recorded through the oral messages of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself on Buddhist principles and values followed, guiding approximately 500 million Buddhists spanning the globe on their path to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the [[Monasticism|Monastic Rule]], or [[Vinaya]], a consensus is reached by the Buddha on euthanasia and [[assisted suicide]] that expresses a lack of fondness of its practice.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keown D, Keown J |title=Killing, karma and caring: euthanasia in Buddhism and Christianity |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=265–9 |date=October 1995|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/21/5/265.full.pdf |pmid=8558539 |pmc=1376772 |doi=10.1136/jme.21.5.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Buddhism does not confirm that life should be conserved by implementing whatever is necessary to prolong death, but instead expresses that the intentional precipitation of death is ethically inadmissible in every condition one is presented in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Vinaya ==
The Vinaya [[Tripiṭaka|Tripitaka]] is one of three Buddhist canonical sources that makes up the Tripitaka that most relates to euthanasia. It was created to encompass a series of case laws in which Buddha provided judgement on various matters, even though the term "euthanasia" is not specifically mentioned.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Monks and nuns are meant to follow the decorum that is relayed, which expresses what is considered to be wrongfully killing someone (prohibited by Buddhist precepts) by the actions of another who is conferred to follow holy orders and those who are not. Outside of Vinaya, there is no specific mention in early Buddhist texts on euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the life of Buddha, instances occurred when monks who practiced medicine were put in situations where they had to make a decision to assist in another's suicide by physically taking their life, providing the instrument used to take their life, or allowing the person to suffer, as observed in cases written in Vinaya. The Buddha, therefore, included a precept in Vinaya against the termination of another human life following the discovery that monks either took their own life or requested that others kill them because they were unhappy with their body. Buddha stated that:

{{Quote|text=Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (saying,): "My good man, what use is this evil, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/sv/bhikkhu-pati.html#pr|title=Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha (rules for male monks), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=access to insight|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

With this, Buddha later expanded the precept in the third [[parajika]], adding the punishment of excommunication for life from the [[Sangha]] after recognizing a number of monks provoking a patient to believe that he should choose death over life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this instance, the monks praised the idea that death was beautiful to a sick monk, persuading him to take an unrevealed measure to end his life. Because of the monk's expression of virtue, as he was informed by other monks, he would receive a good rebirth. As a result of these provocations, the monk stopped eating and later died.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues|last=Harvey|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge University Press,|year=2000|isbn=978-0-511-07584-1|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.295}}

== Death and karma ==
Buddhists believe that life begins at the point of birth and ends when the individual dies. Throughout the course of the individual's life, between life and death, they are to be respected with dignity, regardless of their state of mental capacity or [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] functions. What constitutes life in a body is [[Thermoregulation|usma]] (heat), [[Vitality|ayu]] (vitality), and [[Vinnana|vinanna]] (sentiency).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67323-0/abstract|title=End of life: The buddhist view. The Lancet 366, 952–955|journal=The Lancet|volume=366|issue=9489|pages=952–955|last=Keown|first=Damien|date=September 16, 2005|website=|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67323-0|pmid=16154024|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Buddhists, there is much confusion as to when one is truly dead. Some consider death to be when the brain loses its functionality. And there are those who disagree with this idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Buddha passed away, according to ancient texts, his 25-year personal attendant [[Ananda]] declared him as dead. However, Ananda was later corrected by a monk senior to him, claiming that Buddha was only in a severe state of yogistic stupor. During this yogic [[trance]], Buddha lacked any vital signs of life, making it unclear for future Buddhists to determine the point of death when such physiological states exist and are relayed in Buddhist literary texts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although at death one loses all physical possessions, leaving their family, loved ones, and achievements all behind, death does not destroy all that belongs to a person. The purification of their character through virtuous and meditative practices carries over into their next life and into their mental sequence of continuation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:Traditional bhavachakra wall mural of Yama holding the wheel of life, Buddha pointing the way out.jpg|thumb|[[Yama]], Lord of Death, holding the [[Bhavacakra|Bhavachakra]] or Wheel of Life]]Buddhists hold the belief that upon death, they are reborn and will experience life through a series of lifetimes called [[Saṃsāra|samsara]] until they can cease to desire and nirvana is obtained. In conjunction with a person's previously attained karma, their state of mind at the point of death holds great importance when the determining of what kind of rebirth is to take place.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are six realms of life in Buddhist cosmology: Hell realm ([[Naraka]]), hungry ghost ([[Preta]]) realm, animal realm ([[Animals in Buddhism|Tiracchānayoni]]), human realm ([[Human beings in Buddhism|Manussa]]), demi-god realm ([[Asura]]), and god realm ([[Deva (Buddhism)|Deva]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lecso PA |title=Euthanasia: a Buddhist perspective |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=51–7 |year=1986|pmid=11651853 |doi=10.1007/BF01533053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the realms that exist, the human realm is the most anticipated, yet the most difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on the level of [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] one garners in their current lifetime, it is determined at which realm one diverges to next upon death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first three realms (Hell realm, hungry ghost realm, and animal realm) are the most detested of the six and are meant to cause suffering, disallowing proper mental capabilities as a result of negative karma from negative acts performed during the previous life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; And although more acceptable than the former, the asura and god realm remain unfavorable as they permit one ultimate happiness but prevents the opportunity for the spirit to progress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Only through good karma can one's spirit reach the human realm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Euthanasia, although it can be considered a compassionate act, is not seen in Buddhism as an act of selflessness and benevolence, but rather an act of  damage masked as help, which in turn can result in negative karma.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If someone is suffering as a result of sickness, it could be a result of karma, and ending their life is not likely to end their adversity, as the suffering caused by karma will only follow them after death until its energy concludes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Compassion ==
[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 011 The Buddha and Ananda tend a Sick Monk (9244516966).jpg|thumb|306x306px|The Buddha and Ananda tend a sick monk]]
[[Compassion]] ([[karuṇā]]) is a Buddhist value that reinforces how Buddhism views standards in medicine, which is observed in all three schools of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|p.295}} Although it can be seen as morally good, committing an act through compassion is not always justified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking a life out of compassion to mitigate the affliction one experiences through illness or injury is an instance in which a person may feel he or she is vindicated to exploit euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in Buddhism and the [[Bodhisattva]], it can create incongruities through the infringement of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of an unjustified act of compassion is a case written in the Vinaya, where a convicted man is hastily executed after a monk requests the executioner to do so, as to not prolong his suffering and the sorrowful period he has to wait.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A morally good scenario of compassion would be if a patient in a hospital in his or her right mind feels that their ailment is using too much of a valuable resource in limited quantities, or causing their family to spend large sums of money that is not readily available on medical bills to keep them alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Out of morally good compassion, he or she might decide to cease the sources of life preservation without pressure from others.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Had those associations been pressuring the patient to forgo further life saving treatment, this could be observed as murderous.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If the patient were terminally ill and unable to eat on their own accord, it would be a requirement of his or her associations to assist them, even if intravenous feeding was necessary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism paints life in a way that is fundamentally valuable, and it should never be surrendered for any reason, whether compassion, amity, or anything of value.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It would be an ill-advised way to show compassion rooted in misconception to endorse death using compassion as the reasoning.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Vegetative state ==
According to Buddhist precepts, someone who is in a [[vegetative state]] is neither dead nor alive, but instead is said to be in some form of obscure state of mind and still a living individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They lack the necessity to rely on outside assistance to support their ability to stay alive other than being supplemented with nutrients to keep them functioning for a significant number of years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With this, Buddhism sees someone in a vegetative state as a living, breathing life form, because the value in which one's life holds is not observed through individualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although Buddhism views this state of being as damaged, the individual should be treated no different than before.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both animals and humans, prior to their birth as they await in the mother's womb, have value and therefore should not have their life taken from them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, some Buddhists are under the impression that an unconscious life, or one that lacks awareness, does not have value, which is highly debatable.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism shows that even with a damaged physical organ, such as the brain, someone is still deserving of compassion because they are still capable of causing varying emotions in someone who cares for them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To end a life because of a patient's state of mind and to deny them treatment would be an act of abandonment, which would be considered irrational and unfair because Buddhists have a strong belief in compassion for all living things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A vegetative state can be considered a varied form of meditation where the sentience of someone acts in a way not ordinary to what is regularly observed.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another form of consciousness where the body does not react is that of "formless" rebirths.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Due to these meditative states, it is often difficult to determine in a physical manner a state of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The state of consciousness, at the time, may be experiencing a demonstration of going through the processes of death in ultimate preparation so that once death does come, it can receive the best form of rebirth.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this process of preparation, the eyes and other sense-organs will cease to function, but the person's sense of touch, brain function, and life force lie in the heart.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, considering the conception of meditative states, some in a vegetative state are therefore still sentient.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Being in a continuous state of vegetation is not the same as the process by which one prepares for death, even though it does resemble it.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The possibility exists for one to lack the function to breathe and think, but still be alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Alternatives to euthanasia ==
[[File:San Francisco Zen Center.jpg|thumb|The San Francisco Zen Center]]
Moving someone who is terminally ill into [[hospice care]] to help mitigate physical pain with [[Analgesic|pain relievers]] that is not intended to end their life, allowing them to pass away painless and comfortable, is a highly considerable alternative to euthanasia. Hospice care is meant to assist a person to have, what is called a "good death."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When one nears death, they should be able to reflect on their life peacefully. Since 1971, the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] has offered assistance to terminally ill patients, with trained hospice employees since the inception of a hospice training program in 1987. The Buddhist Hospice Trust in the United Kingdom has been an alternative to this center since its founding in 1987. Not only does it provide volunteers to visit those nearing death, but it provides an avenue for those who lost someone they cared about to receive counsel and sympathy and is also used as a center into researching death and mourning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The purpose of such a center is to truly alleviate any amount of anxiety one could experience when approaching death, leaving known loved ones behind, and to ensure a clear and calm state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Hospice care employees therefore prefer not to allow a person to die in an anesthetized, unconscious state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A positive transition to a future life is best obtained when one dies with a clear conscience, free of anger, dissent, and anxiety, and in a relaxed state of being.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, a "good death" is facilitated by family and friends, who do their best to ensure the dying person is untroubled and uplifted.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5513">'''The Chandabhoy Galla Case''' is a celebrated case in the history of religion where a human being is challenged for representing God on earth being infallible and immaculate. The case was filed during British rule in India  by Sir Thomas Strangman, the Advocate General of Mumbai at the behest of Adamjee Pirbhai family members against [[Dawoodi Bohra]] 51st Dai Syedna [[Taher Saifuddin]]. The case was filed in 1917AD and decided in 1921AD. The claim was based on the belief of  Imam as representative of the Prophet, and through him the representative of God, having withdrawn from the world, someone must represent him, and so ultimately the Deity on earth.  The Dai, according to community religious belief, is that representative. The ownership of the Chandabhoy ‘Galla’( box kept for  religious offerings) was challenged on the plea of improper succession. Issues raised, however, were of far greater significance than the properties included in the case. The ownership was decided in favor of Syedna, arguing succession proper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0226056767]; Mullahs on the Mainframe: Islam and Modernity Among the Daudi Bohras; By Jonah Blank; p-236,year 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0857735268];  Modern History of the Ismailis: Continuity and Change in a Muslim Community; edited by Farhad Daftary;  2010 - Social Science; legal battle with dissidents:-chandbhai case, internal dissent: legitimacy of nass on abdul qadi nazmuddin –nazim dai 50 yearts&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was also historic in the sense that similar [[Dawoodi Bohra#Intra-Bohra schisms|case]] was put up in the court of Mughal emperor [[Akbar]], in year 1591AD,  where representation was challenged on the legal point of proper accountability and proper succession resulting in royal farman(order) issued in favor of 27th Dai [[Dawood Bin Qutubshah]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010210004257/http://www.bohra.net/archive/ahmedabad.html]; History of Duat Mutlakin's of Ahmedabad&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, similar [[53rd Syedna succession controversy (Dawoodi Bohra)#Court cases|case]] moved to the high court in Mumbai to decide, valid succession of 53rd Syedna (Dai) of the Dawoodi Bohra community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/unique-case-from-akbar-s-court-in-1591-to-bombay-hc/story-u4QNPgu4wyYETNUSa2mjVN.html]; Unique case: From Akbar’s court in 1591 to Bombay HC&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Thomas Strangman observes in his book "Indian Courts and Characters",  the case is remarkable not only for its length, but for the amazing claims put forward on behalf of the 'Mullaji'(Syedna Taher), the like of which have never been put forward in any Court of Law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Indian_Courts_and_Characters.html?id=4JRCAAAAIAAJ]; Indian_Courts_and_Characters&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the Chandabhoy Galla Case, It was contended that 47th Dai Syedna [[Abdul Qadir Najmuddin]]  was not validly appointed as Dai al Mutlaq. If this contention was upheld by the court, then the position of all subsequent Dai al Mutlaqs would be put into question. Syedna [[Taher Saifuddin]]'s  claim to be the Dai al Mutlaq was dependent upon the court deciding that Syedna Najmuddin  was validly appointed. The court upheld the succession of [[Taher Saifuddin]] proper. Considering all the circumstances, the judge held that all the properties in respect of which the declaration was sought were devoted to charitable purposes and that the Mullaji(Syedna Taher) was a trustee thereof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/historicalcases/cases/MULLAJI_CASE.html]; MULLAJI CASE  (CHANDABHOY GULLA CASE)-19l8-19l9&lt;/ref&gt;

During the proceeding of the case, the remark of British judge Mr. Justice Marten is important on clarifying religious trust. The judge observed that "high-ranking people could be trusted not to commit criminal breach of trust; but that did not mean that they were beyond the pale of the law.  For example, His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, could not conceivably commit a criminal offence; but he was nevertheless subject to the criminal law, and this fact involved no slur.  So, too, in theory the Mullaji Saheb was amenable to the criminal and civil law of this country, though it was unthinkable that he would commit any offence. But the existence of this civil restraint is no more a slur upon an honest trustee, than the existence of criminal restraint is upon an honest citizen.  The test of a trust is not whether the alleged trustee can ever commit a breach of trust, which is what the defendants' contention in effect amounts to."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/historicalcases/cases/MULLAJI_CASE.html]; MULLAJI CASE  (CHANDABHOY GULLA CASE)-19l8-19l9&lt;/ref&gt;

During testimony of Syedna Taher, he clarified about knowledge classes of 'Zahir', 'Tavil' and, 'Hakikat' present in community. First two are known to many but third one namely 'Hakikat' content some religious truths known to very few. Some of which are known to only 2 or 3 persons in community, and there is also knowledge which is available with Dai only, and he gets it from his predecessor Dai.&lt;ref&gt; Record

The '''Coexist image''' (often styled as "CoeXisT" or "COEXIST") is an image created by Polish, [[Warsaw]]-based graphic designer {{Interlanguage link multi|Piotr Młodożeniec|pl}} in 2000 as an entry in an international art competition sponsored by the [[Museum on the Seam for Dialogue, Understanding and Coexistence]].  The original version was one of dozens of works displayed as large outdoor posters in [[Jerusalem]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mots /&gt;&lt;ref name=MotsLegal /&gt;

Variations of this artwork have been used as [[bumper stickers]] and elements in [[rock concert]]s.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TDB /&gt;

==Creation – ''COEXISTENCE'' art exhibition==

{{Interlanguage link multi|Piotr Młodożeniec|pl}}, a Polish graphic designer based in [[Warsaw]], had his original work chosen by a [[Juried (competition)|jury]] to be one of several dozen images to be displayed as {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} x {{convert|5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} outdoor posters as part of a touring exhibit sponsored by the [[Museum on the Seam]] in Jerusalem.  The exhibit opened to the public in Jerusalem in 2001.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mots /&gt;

His original image consisted of the word COEXIST in all capital letters, with the C replaced by an oversized [[Crescent#Pre-Islamic and Islamic uses|Muslim Crescent]], the X replaced by an oversized [[Star of David]], and the T replaced by an oversized [[Latin Cross]].&lt;ref name=Atu2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atu2.com/news/cant-we-all-just-coexist.html

==U2 Vertigo Tour==
[[File:U2 MexicoCity1.jpg|thumb|U2 in Mexico City on the ''Vertigo'' tour – photo taken during the playing of [[Sunday Bloody Sunday]] ]]
During the international 2005–2006 [[Vertigo Tour]] of the Irish rock band [[U2]], the original version of the image played a key role. Shortly after playing "[[Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own]]", the group would play politically-themed songs.  During the opening portion of "[[Love and Peace or Else]]", [[Bono]] wore a white headband bearing a handwritten version of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2015-05-28|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bonobaltimore/18007038/|others=Kurman, Mike|accessdate=2015-10-20|title=Bono, 5\28\05, Boston, MA, TD Banknorth Garden
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some venues, including Mexico City, the word was displayed on large electronic signs.&lt;ref name=MC1&gt;{{cite web

==Bumper sticker==
The image and variations of it are used as automobile [[bumper sticker]]s.&lt;ref name=TDB&gt;{{cite web|work=The Daily Beast|date=2014-12-21|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/21/coexist-s-bonehead-bumper-sticker-politics.html|title=COEXIST's Bonehead Bumper-Sticker Politics: America's simplistic adoption of the COEXIST bumper sticker signals a dangerous inability to understand the roots of religious conflict.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224214154/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/21/coexist-s-bonehead-bumper-sticker-politics.html|archivedate=2014-12-24|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bumper stickers first began to emerge in the United States in the early 2000s in partial response to the military involvement in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] which began after the events of [[September 11, 2001]]. The stickers signify the capability or desire of humans to live together in peace.&lt;ref name = "Wrasman" /&gt;

One common version of the bumper sticker spells "COEXIST" using an Islamic crescent moon for the "C", a [[peace sign]] for the "O", a combination of the [[male symbol]] and [[female symbol]] for the "E", a [[Star of David]] for the "X", a [[pentagram]] for the dot of the "I", a [[yin-yang symbol]] for the "S", and a Christian cross for the "T".&lt;ref name = "Wrasman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wrasman|first=Andy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=guGZAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|title=Contradict|year=2014|publisher=WestBow Press|pages=2–3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023043909/https://books.google.com/books?id=guGZAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBGoVChMIk5L4mL7MyAIVQvI-Ch2mqQEN#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|archivedate=2015-10-23|isbn=9781490819297}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version, designed by Jerry Jaspar, is perhaps the most common version of the bumper sticker.&lt;ref name = "Gharavi"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Lance|editor-last=Gharavi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0wjDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT289&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|title=Religion, Theatre, and Performance: Acts of Faith|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9781136483400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of the COEXIST bumper stickers has been noted in the [[Bay Area]] region centered on [[San Francisco]]. Users of the bumper stickers are often not practicing adherents of religion.&lt;ref name=Fish&gt;{{cite book|last=Fish|first=M.

==Legal disputes==
In 2005, Młodożeniec and U2 were unaware of each other.  They were also unaware that a company in [[Indiana]] already filed for a trademark in the United States in 2003.  At the time, as there was no official U2 merchandise carrying this image, U2 fans created their own.  The Indiana company filed suit against companies like Cafepress in May 2005 in an effort to stop unauthorized merchandise sales. Młodożeniec's attorneys maintained that he owned the copyright to the image.  Separately, The Museum on the Seam, which sponsored the competition in which the original image first appeared in public, claimed legal rights to the image.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MotsLegal /&gt;

==Versions and other variations==
The following table shows the individual characters of the more well-known versions, either as [[Unicode]] characters, icons, or descriptions.

&lt;!-- Editor instructions:
* Only add it to this table if it spells out Coexist,
  not other variants, spoofs, etc.  Variants in
  capitalization such as COEXIST are fine.  Translations are fine.
* Only add it if you have a reliable source that the
  image is in wide use.
  This can be a newspaper article, a legal proceeding, or,
  IF the image in question has been released under a "free" license
  by its creator, a link to a copy of the image uploaded to the Wikimedia Commons
  Put the source or a small version of the Commons image in the "notes" section.
* Only add it if it's in wide use – be aware that some versions may be "novelty"
  items created for a specific event and adding them here would likely clutter up
  the list or worse, invite the creators to "spam" this page for promotional purposes.
* A partial table of unicode symbols can be found at
  http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/So/list.htm
  and many other places on the Internet
* PREVIEW YOUR CHANGES BEFORE SAVING YOUR EDIT – it's really easy
  to mess up a table if you are not careful.
* Double-check that any "Note" links work in both directions.

==Parodies==

The popularity of the bumper stickers has spawned several anti-Muslim responses, including one with the image of the crescent altered with the addition of explosives.&lt;ref name = "Gharavi" /&gt;

There are several anti-religious parodies, spelling out words such as 'Toxic', 'Fiction' and 'Contradict'.

Other parodies include a Communist [[hammer and sickle]] for the "E" and a [[swastika]] for the "X", indicating the dangers inherent in all ideologies.&lt;ref name=Bowen&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=Jack|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9kj71CJ2-cwC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|title=If You Can Read This: The Philosophy of Bumper Stickers|publisher=Random House|year=2010|page=193|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023044358/https://books.google.com/books?id=9kj71CJ2-cwC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwATgKahUKEwiA2vu7uc3IAhUENz4KHY60Ano|archivedate=2015-10-23|isbn=9781588369505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6045">Most Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be [[sacramental character|neither repeated nor undone]]. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by [[irreligion|rejecting religion]] entirely. But some other organizations and individuals are practicing '''debaptism'''.

In addition to ''de facto'' renunciation through [[apostasy]], or [[heresy]], the Roman Catholic Church envisaged from 1983 to 2009 the possibility of [[formal act of defection from the Catholic Church|formal defection from the Church]] through a decision manifested personally, consciously and freely, and in writing, to the competent church authority, who was then to judge whether it was genuinely a case of "true separation from the constitutive elements of the life of the Church ... (by) an act of apostasy, heresy or schism."&lt;ref name=PCLT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/intrptxt/documents/rc_pc_intrptxt_doc_20060313_actus-formalis_en.html |title=Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, '&amp;#39;Actus formalis defectionis ab Ecclesia catholica'&amp;#39; |publisher=Vatican.va |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal defection of this kind was then noted in the register of the person's baptism, an annotation that, like those of marriage or ordination, was independent of the fact of the baptism and was not an actual "debaptism", even if the person who formally defected from the Catholic Church had also defected from the Christian religion. The fact of having been baptized remains a fact and the Catholic Church holds that baptism marks a person with a lasting [[sacramental character|seal or character]] that "is an ontological and permanent bond which is not lost by reason of any act or fact of defection."&lt;ref name=PCLT/&gt; Nonetheless, formal requests for debaptisms are made; in France, a man sued the French Catholic church for "its refusal to let him nullify his baptism." He had been "un-baptized" in 2000, and ten years later he demanded to have his name stricken from the baptismal records, a request granted by a judge in Normandy, a decision appealed by the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/29/146046428/on-the-record-a-quest-for-de-baptism-in-france|title=Off The Record: A Quest For De-Baptism In France : NPR|last=Beardsley|first=Eleanor|date=January 29, 2012|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Papa Benoît XVI.jpg|thumb|Pope Benedict XVI]]
'''Dehellenization''' refers to a disillusionment with forms of [[Greek philosophy]] that emerged in the [[Hellenistic Period]], and in particular to a  [[Faith and rationality|rejection of the use of reason]]. The term was first used in 2006 by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in a speech "Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections," to refer to attempts to separate Christianity from Greek philosophical thought.&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict XVI. "Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections," Lecture of the Holy Father at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the term figured prominently in [[Robert R. Reilly]]'s book ''[[The Closing of the Muslim Mind]]: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamist Crisis'', to refer to what Reilly characterized as "the religion of Islam's divorce from reason and rationality." The extent and significance of dehellenization in both the Christian and Islamic religious traditions continues to be widely disputed.

==Hellenization==
The Hellenistic Period begins with the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC and ends with the emergence of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Greece History. History of Greece: Hellenistic. http://www.ancient-greece.org/history/helleninstic.html, accessed April 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of defining dehellenization, the Hellenistic Period is known for the emergence of a number of philosophical theories, including [[Neoplatonism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Academic skepticism|Skepticism]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], [[Stoicism]], among others. An underlying element common to all of these schools of thought is an emphasis on human rationality and the ability to reason.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Robert: ''The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis''. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Of Christianity===
Pope Benedict XVI argues that several keys ideas in Christian thought reveal the hellenization of Christianity:
# According to the Pope, [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]]'s vision of the Macedonian man pleading with him to travel to [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] to help his people specifically foreshadows the necessary marriage of Biblical and Greek thought.
# To demonstrate the fusion of Greek and Biblical thought, the Pope refers to the opening verse of the [[gospel of John]]: "In the beginning was the word." Here "Word" translates the Greek word "logos" (λόγος), meaning not only "word" but also "reason", so the verse can be paraphrased as "in the beginning there was reason."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict XVI. "Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections," Lecture of the Holy Father at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Pope also points to the concept of ''voluntarism'', proposed by the Franciscan [[Duns Scotus|Blessed John Duns Scotus]] and developed by later scholars into the premise that we can only know God through a voluntary decision to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict XVI. "Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections," Lecture of the Holy Father at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jesus's followers were reluctant to succumb to the Hellenistic rulers' attempts to force them into Greek "idolatry" and customs, the Pope argues that they were nevertheless able to extract the most enriching element of Hellenistic thought, namely that man has not only the ability but also the obligation to think rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict XVI. "Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections," Lecture of the Holy Father at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Of Islam===
The conquest of Persia and parts of Central Asia by Alexander the Great beginning in 330 BC was accompanied by an extensive dissemination of Greek culture and thought beyond the Mediterranean area. Although Persia was eventually reclaimed by the Persians, Hellenistic influence continued in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Malik, Brigadier S.K. Quranic Concept of War. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Reilly, most of the fusion of Islamic and Greek philosophy occurred between 660 and 750 AD when the Umayyad dynasty came to possess Sassanid (Persian) and Byzantine territories that were heavily populated by Greco-Christians and contained many Hellenistic centers of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Robert: ''The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis''. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Initially attracted to Greek thought for medicinal and mathematic purposes, many Muslims began to explore other aspects of Hellenism, in particular philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Robert: ''The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis''. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of dehellenization==

===In Islam===
According to Reilly, the primary cause of the dehellenization of Islam was the rise of the [[Ash'arite]] sect and decline of the [[Mu'tazila]] sect in the ninth and tenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Robert: ''The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis''. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. x&lt;/ref&gt; The Mu’tazalites adopted the belief that man must be free, because without freedom, he would be unable to know God’s justice. Consequently, man was free and obligated to interpret sacred texts in the context of his time. The Mu’tazalite premise that the Qur'an was ''created'' implies that it is subject to reason, in contradiction to the orthodox belief that the Qur'an is eternal.

The Mu’tazalites produced the first Greek-inspired Islamic school of thought, championing the idea of reason and rational morality.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Robert: ''The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis''. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The Ash'arites evolved as a group in direct opposition to the Mu’tazalites. The Ash'arites opposed the Mu'tazalites on several levels. They argued that the Qur'an was coeternal with Allah, rendering it inalterable and uninterpretable by man. Whereas the Mu’tazalites held that God was reasonably required to reward and punish as he had promised, the Ash'arites argued that God is not required to do anything, since such requirements must necessarily limit him. Ash'arites insisted that any apparent inconsistencies in the Qur'an must not be questioned. In contrast, the Mu'tazalites believed that analyzing these inconsistencies is in accordance with man's necessity to reason: since God is not intuitive or physical, we must reason to his existence.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Robert: ''The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis''. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the reign of Caliph Ja'afar al-Mutawakkil (847–861), adopting the doctrine of the Mu'tazalites became a crime punishable by death. Most of Mu’tazalite works were destroyed and bookstores were told not to sell any of their works. By the 12th century, Mu'tazalite influence had been almost entirely eradicated from Islamic society. This suppression of rationalist thought and elevation of orthodoxy signaled the general dehellenization of Islamic society.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Robert: ''The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis''. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Christianity===
Pope Benedict XVI [[Regensburg lecture|proposes]] that a dehellenization of Christianity has stemmed from three different sources. The first stage of Christian dehellenization can be attributed to the [[Reformation]] in the sixteenth century. Reformers believed that faith had turned into a mere element in abstract philosophy, and that the religion needed to return to the idea of ''[[sola scriptura]]'' (scripture only).&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict XVI. "Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections," Lecture of the Holy Fatehr at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The second stage occurred in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries due to the theology of [[Adolf von Harnack]]. Harnack advocated focusing on the simple life of Jesus Christ, and his humanitarian message in particular. Theology and belief in a divine being, according to Harnack, was a scientific history completely separate from the modern reason of humanitarian aid.

The last stage, occurring currently in the twenty-first century, is a product of modern cultural pluralism. Cultural pluralism encourages other cultures to simply return to the simplicity of the [[New Testament]], and refuse it with their own culture. The Pope affirms that such a method cannot work because the New Testament "was written in Greek and bears the imprint of the Greek spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict XVI. "Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections," Lecture of the Holy Fatehr at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manifestations of dehellenization in Islam==
Reilly asserts that at least 80% of [[Sunni]] Muslims have adopted the Ash'arite school of thought. The current prominence of this school throughout the [[Umma]] (global Muslim community), according to Reilly, is manifested in the writings of the key Islamist leaders of the past century. [[Sayyid Qutb]]'s [[Milestones (book)|''Milestones'']], for instance, has been such an imperative document that its authority approaches that of a [[hadith]]. A divorce from reason or the ability to rationalize can be made apparent via the following excerpts:

"But if we are to walk in the footsteps of the first generation of Muslims, through whom God established His system and gave it victory over [[Jahiliyyah]], then we will not be masters of our own wills."&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, Sayyid. ''Milestones''. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

"The basis of the message is that one should accept the Shari’ah without any question and reject all other laws in any shape or form. This is Islam. There is no other meaning of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, Sayyid. ''Milestones''. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

"The question may be asked, "Is not the good of mankind the criterion for solving actual problems?" But again we will raise the question which Islam raises itself, and which it answers; that is, "Do you know better, or God?" and, "God knows, and you do not know."&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, Sayyid. ''Milestones''. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Reilly accepts that any Muslims who align themselves with the Mu'tazalite school have not been dehellenized, and may value and employ human reason the same as any other individual.

===Relevance===
Within the Muslim community, this presents the difficulty of hindering innovation. Because every occurrence in life is an intentional act of the will of [[Allah]], general scientific or mathematic principles are slow to be accepted—if accepted at all—by many.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Robert: ''The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis''. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, when a ball is dropped and it falls to the ground X amount of times in a row, Western society accepts a principle of gravity. Muslim society rejects this principle because they believe that each time the ball dropped (no matter how many times) it was a product of the direct will of Allah. If Allah wishes, on drop X+1, the ball will go sideways or turn into a foreign object. Reilly suspects that the Middle East's lack of scientific and technologic innovation stems directly from this prospect.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Robert: ''The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis''. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

At a policy level, Reilly proposes that the U.S. cannot fix the problems in the Arab world via politic or economic means because they are not politic and economic issues; they are theologic at heart. Until the religion of Islam re-adopts reason, Reilly accepts that they will be impossible to deal with on a diplomatic level.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Robert: ''The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis''. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffel (2011) in his review describes the book as "war literature", and "a Catholic refutation of Ash'arite Muslim theology", complaining that Reilly constructs an undue equation between Ash'arism and contemporary Jihadism, while most Jihadists in fact follow Salafism and are hostile towards Ash'arism.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Griffe, Review of Reilly's Closing of the Muslim Mind in ''American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences'' 28:4 (2011), Association of Muslim Social Scientists of North America and International Institute of Islamic Thought.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deistic evolution''' is a position in the [[origins debate]] which involves accepting the [[scientific]] evidence for [[evolution]] and age of the [[universe]] whilst advocating the view that a [[deist]]ic [[God]] created the universe but has not interfered since. The position is a counterpoint to [[theistic evolution]] and is endorsed by those who believe in both [[deism]] and the veracity of science.

==Various views on deistic evolution==

In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8birAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT398&amp;dq=deistic+evolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMI2NPFwPLdxgIViBo-Ch1TWwAE#v=onepage&amp;q=deistic%20evolution&amp;f=false Christian Theology]'', by Millard J. Erickson, 2013, is written:

{{quote|Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws its development has followed. Thus, he programmed the process and then withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator Emeritus. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution, for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process.
Deistic evolution has little difficulty with the scientific data. There is a definite conflict, however, between deism's view of an absentee God and the biblical picture of a God who has been involved in a whole series of creative acts. In particular, both Genesis accounts of the origin of human beings indicate that God definitely and distinctly willed and acted to bring them into existence. In addition, deistic evolution conflicts with the scriptural doctrine of providence, according to which God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation.}}

The [[psychologist]] Steve Stewart-Williams&lt;ref&gt;[http://psy.swan.ac.uk/staff/stewart-williams/ Homepage for Dr Steve Stewart-Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' (2010) states:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolutionists hold that God created the universe and the laws of nature... but that once the ball was rolling, he ceased to intervene in the day-today running of the world or in the course of natural law. God was like the ether after Einstein: he no longer had any role to play in the universe'''.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' 2010 p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stewart-Williams further writes that deistic evolution strips [[God]] of what most religious believers consider central. Any deistic God is not around for [[prayer]]s, [[miracles]] or to intervene in people's lives and that because of this it is unpopular with [[monotheistic]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic Evolution adheres to the concept of some form of God, but denies any personal God. A recent defender of deistic evolution was [[Michael Anthony Corey]], author of the book ''Back to Darwin: The Scientific Case for Deistic Evolution'' (1994).

Some scholars have written that [[Charles Darwin]] was an advocate of deistic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Christian C. Young, Mark A. Largent ''Evolution and Creationism: A Documentary and Reference Guide'' 2007, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic evolution is similarly the operative idea  in [[Pandeism]], which has been counted amongst the handful of spiritual beliefs which "are compatible with modern [[science]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=Some of us think that postmodernity represents a similar change of dominant worldviews, one which could turn out to be just as singular as modernity by being a stunning amalgam of James and Weber. If we are correct, then the changed attitudes, assumptions, and values might work together to change ways of life which in turn transform our geographies of mind and being, that is, both the actual physical landscapes and the mental valuescapes we inhabit. One increasingly common outcome of this ongoing transformation, itself a symptom perhaps of post-industrial secular societies, is the movement away from self-denial toward a denial of the supernatural. This development promises to fundamentally alter future geographies of mind and being by shifting the locus of causality from an exalted Godhead to the domain of Nature. How this Nature is ultimately defined has broad repercussions for the, at times, artificial distinction between religious and secular worldviews. For Levine (2011), "secularism is a positive, not a negative, condition, not a denial of the  world of spirit and of religion, but an affirmation of the world we're living in now ... such a world is capable of bringing us to the condition of 'fullness' that religion has always promised" (Levine quoted in Wood 2011). For others, this "fullness" is present in more religious-oriented pantheistic or pandeistic belief systems with, in the latter case, the inclusion of God as the ever unfolding expression of a complex universe with an identifiable beginning but no teleological direction necessarily present.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theistic predeterminism==
Deistic evolution is not the same as [[theistic evolution]], yet they are sometimes confused. The difference rests on the difference between a theistic god that is interested in, if not actively involved in, the outcome of his creation and humanity specifically and a [[deism|deistic god]] that is either disinterested in the outcome, and holds no special place for humanity, or will not intervene. Often, there is no discernible difference between the two positions—the choice of terminology has more to do with the believer and her or his need for a god, than fitting into a mostly arbitrary dictionary or academic definition.

==Criticism from Christian Creationists==

Deistic evolution has been criticised by Christian [[creationists]] as being incompatible with [[Christianity]] since it contradicts a literal reading of the [[Bible]] and more importantly, leaves no role for the "Christian personal God".&lt;ref&gt;James K. A. Smith, Amos Yong ''Science and the Spirit: A Pentecostal Engagement With the Sciences'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liberty: a magazine of religious freedom: Volumes 86-88, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

M. J. Erickson wrote that deistic evolution is in conflict with the scriptural doctrine of providence according to which "God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation."&lt;ref&gt;Erickson M.J., "Christian Theology", 1985, Baker, Grand Rapids, MI, pp. 480-481&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles P. Grannan wrote in 1894, "Another baseless assumption of negative critics is that the general principles of Atheistic and Deistic evolution, admitted by many scientists to account for the origin of the various species of plants and animals, should also be applied to explain the origin of the Christian religion."&lt;ref&gt;"Higher Criticism and the Bible," by Charles P. Grannan, DD, PhD, in ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review'', 1894, Volume 19, Page 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Wesley Rishell criticized the concept in 1899, comparing it to the notion (false, in his view), that [[gravity]] was a property of matter instead of a continued action of God:

{{quote|If evolution is God's method of creating he is still at work. Theistic Deism and evolution is possible, but deistic evolution is a contradiction in terms. Again, it is all a mere supposition that God created the world and endowed it with forces which will of necessity work out his will. It is impossible for us to say that God put forth energy in the beginning and then ceased. It is, to say the least, as probable that gravitation is a divine force constantly exerted on matter in a certain way as that it is a divine force deposited in matter once for all.&lt;ref&gt;''The Foundations of the Christian Faith'' by Charles Wesley Rishell, 1899, Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Science==

Deistic evolution does not oppose or contradict [[evolution]] or come into conflict with [[science]] as it says that a God started the process and then left it to natural processes. However deism is still a religious philosophy.

Stewart-Williams wrote regarding deistic evolution and science:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolution eliminates any immediate conflict between science and belief in God. Anyone who believes that God's role was merely to create the laws of nature can accept the scientific worldview in its totality; they simply add the proviso that 'God did it' - i.e., that God is responsible for the world that science describes'''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is considerable room for this "[[god of the gaps]]" view, since scientific observation is entirely unable to shed any light on what happened during the [[Planck epoch]], the earliest 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds in the history of the universe. All development since this initial creative act merely follows laws and principles which He created:

*God created the universe, perhaps using the "big bang" about 15,000 million years ago as his method. He set up basic laws to govern the running of the universe, and then left the scene entirely. God has not been seen since. The earth coalesced about 4 or 5 thousand million years ago without any input from God. Later, elementary life forms formed, which evolved into the animals and plant life that we see today through purely natural forces. It is essentially identical to naturalistic evolution, excepts that it reserves one action for God: that of initially creating the matter of the universe. This belief is common among Deists. [http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_world3.htm]
*Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws which its devel- opment has followed. Thus, he programmed the process. Then he withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator emeritus. The progress of the created order is free of direct influence by God. He is the Creator of everything, but only the first living form was directly created. All the rest of God's creating has been done indirectly. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process. [http://www.asa3.org/archive/evolution/199505-10/0171.html]

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] disagrees with the doctrine of deistic evolution. In November 2005, Pope Benedict addressed a general audience of 25,000 in [[St. Peter's Square]]:

:When the Pontiff finished his address, he put his papers to one side and commented on the thought of St. Basil the Great, a Doctor of the Church, who said that some, "deceived by the atheism they bear within them, imagined the universe deprived of a guide and order, at the mercy of chance. I believe the words of this fourth-century Father are of amazing timeliness," said Benedict XVI. "How many are these 'some' today? Deceived by atheism, they believe and try to demonstrate that it is scientific to think that everything lacks a guide and order," he continued.

'''Divine inspiration''' is the concept of a [[supernatural]] force, typically a [[deity]], causing a person or people to experience a [[Creativity|creative]] desire. It has been a commonly reported aspect of many [[religion]]s, for thousands of years. Divine inspiration is often closely tied to the concept of [[revelation]], the belief in information being revealed or disclosed through communication with a deity or other [[Non-physical entity|supernatural entity]] or entities.

==Examples==
Besides ancient mythology, the [[religious text]]s of traditions including [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Mormonism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are all claimed to be divinely inspired to some degree.
* Ancient [[Mesopotamia]]: In the Mesopotamian epic ''[[Atra-Hasis]]'', the writer describes his work as dictated by the Goddess in a dream-vision.
* Ancient Greece: The [[Muse|ancient Greek muses]] were said to be supernatural forces that gave artists their skill, while the [[Oracle|Ancient Greek oracles]] were said to be subject to supernatural forces. 
* Hinduism: [[Music]] has historically been considered a medium through which performers can become a vehicle for divine inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Bruce M. |last=Sullivan|title =Historical Dictionary of Hinduism|date =1997|page= 143|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cvhGP8NRx4QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Scarecrow Press|isbn = 9780810833272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess [[Saraswati]] is also sometimes invoked for assistance with inspiration.&lt;ref name=ar272&gt;{{Google books|IChFAAAAcAAJ|Asiatic Researches}}, - History and Antiquities, the Arts, Sciences and Literature of Asia, Volume 3, London, pages 272-273&lt;/ref&gt;
* Judaism and Christianity: Both religions claim [[Biblical inspiration]] for the parts of the [[Bible]] to which they adhere.
* Islam: Muslims believe the [[Quran]] was verbally revealed by God to [[Muhammad]] through the angel [[Gabriel]] (''Jibril''),&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lambert|first1=Gray|title=The Leaders Are Coming!|date=2013|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=9781449760137|page=287|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sV0mAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=%22Muslims+believe+that+the+Quran+was+verbally+revealed%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e8lCVMimDZS2yASeuYHgDg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Muslims%20believe%20that%20the%20Quran%20was%20verbally%20revealed%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams &amp; Drew"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roy H.

==Counterexample==

The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have at times disclaimed divine inspiration with respect to their doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Do We Need Help to Understand the Bible? | journal= The Watchtower | date = February 15, 1981 | page = 19 | quote = "True, the brothers preparing these publications are not infallible. Their writings are not inspired as are those of Paul and the other Bible writers. (2 Tim. 3:16) And so, at times, it has been necessary, as understanding became clearer, to correct views. (Prov. 4:18)"}}&lt;/ref&gt; although at other times they propose that "divine guidance" is provided to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"Do You See the Evidence of God's Guidance?", ''The Watchtower'', April 15, 2011, pages 3–5, "How, then, do we react when we receive divine direction? Do we try to apply it “right afterward”? Or do we continue doing things just as we have been accustomed to doing them? Are we familiar with up-to-date directions, such as those regarding conducting home Bible studies, preaching to foreign speaking people, regularly sharing in family worship, cooperating with Hospital Liaison Committees, and conducting ourselves properly at conventions? ... Do you clearly discern the evidence of divine guidance? Jehovah uses his organization to guide us, his people, through “the wilderness” during these last days of Satan’s wicked world."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plato's Manias==
[[Plato]] distinguishes four kinds of inspiration or "mania" in the dialogue [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]. The word "mania" signifying that a person is caught up in a state transcending the individual consciousness. In other dialogues, Plato identifies other manias besides the four given in Phaedrus. Anger, for example, is a mania because a man may become inspired by [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] in battle and perform deeds of superhuman strength. The four given in Phaedrus, however, are called Divine as they are the inspirations which perfect the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Shrine of Wisdom, "Plato and the Four Inspirations", in 3 parts, Vol 29 &amp; 30 (1926), Vol 31 (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;

# Poetic or Musicial, inspired by [[The Muses]], brings the disordered parts of the soul into harmony.
# Telestic, inspired by [[Dionysus]], purifies the soul and returns it to its ideal state of perfection and wholeness.
# Prophetic, inspired by [[Apollo]], concentrates the soul to a unity.
# Amatory, inspired by [[Eros]], conjoins the unified soul to the gods and to intelligible Beauty, effecting divine union.

{{Other uses|Dualism (disambiguation)}}
{{God}}
'''Dualism in cosmology''' is the moral or spiritual belief that two fundamental concepts exist, which often oppose each other. It is an umbrella term that covers a diversity of views from various religions, including both traditional religions and scriptural religions.

Moral dualism is the belief of the great complement of, or conflict between, the benevolent and the malevolent. It simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and independent of how these may be represented. Moral opposites might, for example, exist in a worldview which has one god, more than one god, or none. By contrast, duotheism, bitheism or ditheism implies (at least) two gods. While bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, or light and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system could be one in which one god is a creator, and the other a destroyer. In [[theology]], dualism can also refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe (see theistic dualism). This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of [[Christianity]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; Alternatively, in ontological dualism, the world is divided into two overarching categories. The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of [[yin and yang]] is a large part of Chinese philosophy, and is an important feature of [[Taoism]]. It is also discussed in [[Confucianism]].

Many [[Mythology|myths]] and creation [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] with dualistic cosmologies have been described in [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[Cultural anthropology|anthropological]] literature. These motifs conceive the world as being created, organized, or influenced by two [[demiurge]]s, [[culture hero]]es, or other mythological beings, who either compete with each other or have a complementary function in creating, arranging or influencing the world. There is a huge diversity of such cosmologies. In some cases, such as among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], the beings collaborate rather than competing, and contribute to the creation in a coequal way. In many other instances the two beings are not of the same importance or power (sometimes, one of them is even characterized as gullible). Sometimes they can be contrasted as good versus evil.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 42&lt;/ref&gt; They may be often [[Twin (mythology)|believed to be twins]] or at least brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966: 71, 181&lt;/ref&gt; Dualistic motifs in mythologies can be observed in all inhabited continents. Zolotaryov concludes that they cannot be explained by [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] or borrowing, but are rather of convergent origin: they are related to a dualistic organization of society ([[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]); in some cultures, this social organization may have ceased to exist, but mythology preserves the memory in more and more disguised ways.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral dualism==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Moral dualism is the belief of the great complement or conflict between the benevolent and the malevolent. Like ditheism/bitheism (see below), moral dualism does not imply the absence of [[Monism|monist]] or [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] principles. Moral dualism simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and—unlike ditheism/bitheism—independent of how these may be represented.

For example, Mazdaism (Mazdean [[Zoroastrianism]]) is both dualistic and monotheistic (but not monist by definition) since in that philosophy God—the Creator—is purely good, and the [[antithesis]]&lt;!-- Mazdaism's core tenet is truth/[[asha]] vs falsehood. --&gt;—which is also uncreated–is an absolute one. [[Zurvanism]] (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), [[Manichaeism]], and [[Mandaeism]] are representative of dualistic ''and'' [[monism|monist]] philosophies since each has a supreme and transcendental First Principle from which the two equal-but-opposite entities then emanate. This is also true for the lesser-known Christian [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] religions, such as [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Catharism]], and so on. More complex forms of monist dualism also exist, for instance in [[Hermeticism]], where ''[[Nous]]'' "thought"—that is described to have created man—brings forth both good and evil, dependent on interpretation, whether it receives prompting from the God or from the Demon. Duality with [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] is considered a logical fallacy.

===History===
Moral dualism began as a theological belief. Dualism was first seen implicitly in Egyptian religious beliefs by the contrast of the gods [[Set (deity)|Set]] (disorder, death) and [[Osiris]] (order, life).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/172631/dualism/38186/Egypt-and-Mesopotamia "Egypt and Mesopotamia"]&lt;/ref&gt; The first explicit conception of dualism came from the Ancient Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] around the mid-fifth century BC. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion that believes that [[Ahura Mazda]] is the eternal creator of all good things. Any violations of Ahura Mazda's order arise from ''[[druj]]'', which is everything uncreated. From this comes a significant choice for humans to make. Either they fully participate in human life for Ahura Mazda or they do not and give ''druj'' power. Personal dualism is even more distinct in the [[good and evil|beliefs]] of later religions.

The religious dualism of [[Christianity]] between good and evil is not a perfect dualism as God (good) will inevitably destroy [[Satan]] (evil). Early Christian dualism is largely based on Platonic Dualism (See: [[Neoplatonism and Christianity]]). There is also a personal dualism in Christianity with a soul-body distinction based on the idea of an immaterial Christian [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Knight | first = Kevin | title = Soul | encyclopedia = Catholic Encyclopedia | edition = Online | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm | accessdate = 13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duotheism, bitheism, ditheism==
When used with regards to multiple gods, ''dualism'' may refer to duotheism, bitheism, or ditheism. Although ditheism/bitheism imply moral dualism, they are not equivalent: ditheism/bitheism implies (at least) two gods, while moral dualism does not necessarily imply ''[[theism]]'' ([[god (word)|theos = god]]) at all.

Both bitheism and ditheism imply a belief in two equally powerful gods with complementary or antonymous properties; however, while bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, bright and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system would be one in which one god is creative, the other is destructive (cf. [[theodicy]]). In the original conception of [[Zoroastrianism]], for example, [[Ahura Mazda]] was the spirit of ultimate good, while Ahriman ([[Angra Mainyu]]) was the spirit of ultimate evil.

In a bitheistic system, by contrast, where the two deities are not in conflict or opposition, one could be male and the other female (cf. duotheism{{clarify|reason=where would one go to [[Cf.|confer]]?|date=December 2016}}). One well-known example of a bitheistic or duotheistic theology based on gender polarity is found in the [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]]. In Wicca, dualism is represented in the belief of a god and a goddess as a dual partnership in ruling the universe. This is centered on the worship of a [[Wiccan views of divinity|divine couple]], the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Moon Goddess]] and the [[Horned God]], who are regarded as lovers. However, there is also a ditheistic theme within traditional Wicca, as the Horned God has dual aspects of bright and dark - relating to day/night, summer/winter - expressed as the Oak King and the Holly King, who in Wiccan myth and ritual are said to engage in battle twice a year for the hand of the Goddess, resulting in the changing seasons. (Within Wicca, bright and dark do not correspond to notions of "good" and "evil" but are aspects of the natural world, much like [[yin and yang]] in [[Taoism]].)

===Radical and mitigated dualism===
* '''Radical Dualism''' – or absolute Dualism which posits two co-equal divine forces. [[Manichaeism]] conceives of two previously coexistent realms of light and darkness which become embroiled in conflict, owing to the chaotic actions of the latter. Subsequently, certain elements of the light became entrapped within darkness; the purpose of material creation is to enact the slow process of extraction of these individual elements, at the end of which the kingdom of light will prevail over darkness. Manicheanism likely inherits this dualistic mythology from [[Zoroastrianism]], in which the eternal spirit [[Ahura Mazda]] is opposed by his antithesis, [[Angra Mainyu]]; the two are engaged in a cosmic struggle, the conclusion of which will likewise see Ahura Mazda triumphant. '[[The Hymn of the Pearl]]' included the belief that the material world corresponds to some sort of malevolent intoxication brought about by the powers of darkness to keep elements of the light trapped inside it in a state of drunken distraction.
* '''Mitigated Dualism''' – is where one of the two principles is in some way inferior to the other. Such classical Gnostic movements as the Sethians conceived of the material world as being created by a lesser divinity than the true God that was the object of their devotion. The spiritual world is conceived of as being radically different from the material world, co-extensive with the true God, and the true home of certain enlightened members of humanity; thus, these systems were expressive of a feeling of acute alienation within the world, and their resultant aim was to allow the soul to escape the constraints presented by the physical realm.

However, bitheistic and ditheistic principles are not always so easily contrastable, for instance in a system where one god is the representative of summer and drought and the other of winter and rain/fertility (cf. the mythology of [[Persephone]]). [[Marcionism]], an early Christian sect, held that the Old and New Testaments were the work of two opposing gods: both were First Principles, but of different religions.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Riparelli, ''Il volto del Cristo dualista. Da Marcione ai catari'', Peter Lang, Bern - Berlin - Bruxelles - Frankfurt am Main - New York - Oxford - Wien 2008, 368 pp.  {{ISBN|978-3-03911-490-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theistic dualism ==
In theology, dualism can refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe. This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of Christianity and Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt;

===In Christianity===
[[Image:Cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|right|The Cathars being expelled from [[Carcassonne]] in 1209. The Cathars were denounced as heretics by the Roman Catholic Church for their dualist beliefs.]]
The dualism between God and Creation has existed as a central belief in multiple historical sects and traditions of Christianity, including [[Marcionism]], [[Catharism]], [[Paulicianism]], and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]]. Christian dualism refers to the belief that God and creation are distinct, but interrelated through an indivisible bond.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; In sects like the Cathars and the Paulicians, this is a dualism between the material world, created by an evil god, and a moral god. Historians divide Christian dualism into absolute dualism, which held that the good and evil gods were equally powerful, and mitigated dualism, which held that material evil was subordinate to the spiritual good.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Edward|title=Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe|year=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0680-7|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief, by Christian theologians who adhere to a libertarian or compatibilist view of free will, that [[Free will in theology|free will]] separates humankind from God has also been characterized as a form of dualism.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; The theologian Leroy Stephens Rouner compares the dualism of Christianity with the dualism that exists in Zoroastrianism and the [[Samkhya]] tradition of Hinduism. The theological use of the word dualism dates back to 1700, in a book that describes the dualism between good and evil.&lt;ref name="Rouner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rouner|first=Leroy|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology|year=1983|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22748-7|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tolerance of dualism ranges widely among the different Christian traditions. As a monotheistic religion, the conflict between dualism and monism has existed in Christianity since its inception.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Jeffrey|title=A History of Heaven: The Singing Silence|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00684-0|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1912 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' describes that, in the Catholic Church, "the dualistic hypothesis of an eternal world existing side by side with God was of course rejected" by the thirteenth century, but [[mind–body dualism]] was not.&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church|year=1912|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[problem of evil]] is difficult to reconcile with absolute monism, and has prompted some Christian sects to veer towards dualism. Gnostic forms of Christianity were more dualistic, and some Gnostic traditions posited that the Devil was separate from God as an independent deity.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; The Christian dualists of the Byzantine Empire, the [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], were seen as Manichean heretics by Byzantine theologians. This tradition of Christian dualism, founded by [[Constantine-Silvanus]], argued that the universe was created through evil and separate from a moral God.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton|first1=Janet |last2=Hamilton|first2=Bernard |last3=Stoyanov|first3=Yuri |title=Christian Dualist Heresies in the Byzantine World, C. 650-c. 1450: Selected Sources|year=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4765-7|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catharism|Cathars]], a Christian sect in southern France, believed that there was a dualism between two gods, one representing good and the other representing evil. The Roman Catholic Church denounced the Cathars as heretics, and sought to crush the movement in the 13th century. The [[Albigensian Crusade]] was initiated by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1208 to remove the Cathars from [[Languedoc]] in France, where they were known as Albigesians. The [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]], which began in 1233 under [[Pope Gregory IX]], also targeted the Cathars.&lt;ref name="Chidester"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chidester|first=David|title=Christianity: A Global History|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-251770-8|pages=266–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gnosticism====
[[Gnosticism]] is a diverse, [[syncretistic]] [[religious movement]] consisting of various [[belief systems]] generally united in the teaching that humans are divine [[soul]]s trapped in a [[Nature|material world]] created by an imperfect god, the [[demiurge]], who is frequently identified with the [[Abrahamic]] [[God]]. The demiurge may be depicted as an embodiment of evil, or in other instances as merely imperfect and as benevolent as its inadequacy permits. This demiurge exists alongside another remote and unknowable [[God|supreme being]] that embodies good.

[[Bogomils]], [[Paulicianism|Paulicans]] and [[Cathar]]s are typically seen as being imitative of Gnosticism. Whether or not the Cathari possessed direct historical influence from ancient Gnosticism is a matter of dispute. The basic conceptions of Gnostic cosmology are, however, to be found in Cathar beliefs (most distinctly in their notion of a lesser creator god). Unlike the second century Gnostics, they did not apparently place any special relevance upon knowledge (''gnosis'') as an effective [[Salvation|salvific]] force.

===In Hinduism===
The [[Dvaita Vedanta]] school of [[Indian philosophy]] espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate [[realities]]. The first and the more important reality is that of [[Shiva]] or [[Shakti]] or [[Vishnu]] or [[Brahman]]. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme [[Self]], God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul ([[Jiva]]), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[monistic]] conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Etter, Christopher. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jW2pcWpXY8wC&amp;pg=PA59 A Study of Qualitative Non-Pluralism]. iUniverse Inc. P. 59-60. {{ISBN|0-595-39312-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2018}} Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. [[Moksha|Salvation]] therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Jeaneane D. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8dRZ4E-qgz8C&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=dualism+dvaita+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VoXnT_6RH8qtrAeO3qmJCQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dualism%20dvaita%20vedanta&amp;f=false Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism]. Sussex Academic Press. P. 340-344. {{ISBN|1-898723-93-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontological dualism==
[[Image:Yin yang.svg|right|100px|thumb|The yin and yang symbolizes the duality in nature and all things in the Taoist religion.]]

Alternatively, ''dualism'' can mean the tendency of humans to perceive and understand the world as being divided into two overarching [[categorization|categories]]. In this sense, it is dualistic when one perceives a tree as a thing separate from everything surrounding it. This form of ontological dualism exists in Taoism and Confucianism, beliefs that divide the universe into the complementary oppositions of [[yin and yang]].&lt;ref name="Girardot"&gt;{{cite book|last=Girardot|first=N.J.|title=Myth and Meaning in Early Taoism: The Theme of Chaos (hun-tun)|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06460-7|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditions such as classical Hinduism, [[Zen]] Buddhism or [[Islam]]ic [[Sufi]]sm, a key to enlightenment is "transcending" this sort of dualistic thinking, without merely substituting dualism with [[monism]] or [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]].

===In Chinese philosophy===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of [[yin and yang]] is a large part of [[Chinese philosophy]], and is an important feature of [[Taoism]], both as a philosophy and as a religion, although the concept developed much earlier. Some argue that yin and yang were originally an earth and sky god, respectively.&lt;ref name="Yin and Yang"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Jeremy|title=Yin and Yang|url=http://online.infobase.com/HRC/Search/Details/239492?q=yin%20and%20yang|website=Ancient and Medieval History|publisher=Facts on File|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the oldest principles in Chinese philosophy, yin and yang are also discussed in [[Confucianism]], but to a lesser extent.

Some of the common associations with yang and yin, respectively, are: male and female, [[light]] and [[darkness|dark]], active and passive, motion and stillness. Some scholars believe that the two ideas may have originally referred to two opposite sides of a mountain, facing towards and away from the sun.&lt;ref name="Yin and Yang"/&gt; The yin and yang symbol in actuality has very little to do with Western dualism; instead it represents the philosophy of balance, where two opposites co-exist in harmony and are able to transmute into each other. In the yin-yang symbol there is a dot of yin in yang and a dot of yang in yin. In Taoism, this symbolizes the inter-connectedness of the opposite forces as different aspects of Tao, the First Principle. Contrast is needed to create a distinguishable reality, without which we would experience nothingness. Therefore, the independent principles of yin and yang are actually dependent on one another for each other's distinguishable existence.

The complementary dualistic concept seen in yin and yang represent the reciprocal interaction throughout nature, related to a [[feedback loop]], where opposing forces do not exchange in opposition but instead exchange reciprocally to promote stabilization similar to [[homeostasis]]. An underlying principle in Taoism states that within every independent entity lies a part of its opposite. Within sickness lies health and vice versa. This is because all opposites are manifestations of the single Tao, and are therefore not independent from one another, but rather a variation of the same unifying force throughout all of nature.

== In traditional religions ==

=== Uralic peoples ===
In a [[Nenets people|Nenets]] myth, Num and [[Nga (god)|Nga]] collaborate and compete with each other, creating land,&lt;ref name=land&gt;Vértes 1990: 104, 105&lt;/ref&gt; there are also other myths about competing-collaborating demiurges.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparative studies of Uralic peoples and Kets ===
Among others, also dualistic myths were investigated in researches which tried to compare the mythologies of Siberian peoples and settle the problem of their origins. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]] compared the [[mythology]] of [[Ket people]] with those of [[Uralic peoples]], assuming in the studies, that there are modelling [[Semiotics|semiotic]] systems in the compared mythologies; and they have also made typological comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov &amp; Toporov 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984:390, in editorial afterword by Hoppál&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, from possibly Uralic mythological analogies, those of [[Ob-Ugric languages|Ob-Ugric]] peoples&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 225, 227, 229&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samoyedic peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229, 230&lt;/ref&gt; are mentioned. Some other discussed analogies (similar folklore [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and purely typological considerations, certain binary pairs in symbolics) may be related to dualistic organization of society—some of such dualistic features can be found at these compared peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229–231&lt;/ref&gt; It must be admitted that, for Kets, neither dualistic organization of society&lt;ref name=noket2org&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 39&lt;/ref&gt; nor cosmological dualism&lt;ref name=ket2cosm&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 48&lt;/ref&gt; has been researched thoroughly: if such features existed at all, they have either weakened or remained largely undiscovered;&lt;ref name=noket2org/&gt; although there are some reports on division into two exogamous patrilinear moieties,&lt;ref&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 37&lt;/ref&gt; folklore on conflicts of mythological figures, and also on cooperation of two beings in creating the land:&lt;ref name=ket2cosm/&gt; the diving of the water fowl.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229&lt;/ref&gt; If we include dualistic cosmologies meant in broad sense, not restricted to certain concrete motifs, then we find that they are much more widespread, they exist not only among some Uralic peoples, but there are examples in each inhabited continent.&lt;ref name="Zolotarjov"&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 56&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chukchi ===
A [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] myth and its variations report the creation of the world; in some variations, it is achieved by the collaboration of several beings ([[bird]]s, collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator and the [[raven]], collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator alone, using the birds only as assistants).&lt;ref&gt;"Zolotarjov 1980: 40–41"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anyiszimov 1981: 92 – 98&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fuegians ===
{{see also|Fuegians#Spiritual culture}}
All three [[Fuegians|Fuegian]] tribes had dualistic myths about [[culture hero]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966:71&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yámana]] have dualistic myths about the two {{IPA-xx|joalox|}} brothers. They act as culture heroes, and sometimes stand in an antagonistic relation with each other, introducing opposite laws. Their figures can be compared to the Kwanyip-brothers of the [[Selk'nam]].&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966:181&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the presence of dualistic myths in two compared cultures does not imply relatedness or [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] necessarily.&lt;ref name="Zolotarjov" /&gt;

{{refimprove|date=February 2012}}

'''Earthseed''' is a [[religion]] based on the idea that "[[God]] is Change."  It is the creation of [[Octavia E. Butler]], as revealed by her character Lauren [[Oya]] Olamina in the books: ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'' and ''[[Parable of the Talents (novel)|Parable of the Talents]]''.  (A third book of the trilogy, ''Parable of the Trickster'', was not completed before Butler's death.)

== Background ==

''Parable of the Sower'' is a futuristic, dystopian, science-fiction novel.  In its reality, the United States has devolved into states and/or city-states warring for the few remaining resources.  Life is cheap, and the economy is becoming reborn as [[company towns]].

The main character in ''Parable of the Sower'', Lauren Olamina, is the daughter of a Baptist minister who serves their walled-in neighborhood.  Because of her mother's addiction to a prescription  drug, Olamina suffers from ''hyperempathy'', which causes her to share pain or perceived pain with any living creature she sees.  When her community is attacked, burned, and looted, seventeen-year-old Olamina barely escapes with her life.  She travels, at great danger, into northern California in search of a haven where she and others can build the first Earthseed community.

The beliefs of Earthseed are recorded in the fictional book ''Earthseed: The Books of the Living''.  Olamina "writes" in short, poetic passages.  Portions of this text are presented at the beginning of each section, some chapters, and occasionally throughout the text.  The philosophy of Earthseed also underlies the motivations of some of the characters in these novels.

== Central tenets ==

The word "Earthseed" comes from the idea that the seeds of all life on Earth can be transplanted, and through adaptation will grow, in many different types of situations or places.  "The Books of the Living" is chosen in direct contrast to many other religions' use of the phrase "The Books of the Dead".  Earthseed is a religion of the present and the future, of the living, not of the dead or the past.

Although Olamina is raised as a Baptist, she does not feel comfortable with "her father's God."  Instead, she develops ideas that seem to better fit the reality she knows.

Because "God is Change", humans are able to direct God's malleability. Believers are enjoined to "shape God".  By shaping themselves, they can save themselves.  Believers are to accept the central tenet that "God is Change" primarily so that they will recognize their own power to affect and direct Change/God.  Only by conscious effort can they avoid being God's victims.

Earthseed also promotes the belief that "The Destiny of Earthseed / '''Is''' to take root among the stars" (''The Parable of the Sower'', Octavia E. Butler).  The Destiny is necessary because, eventually, we will outgrow [[Earth]] (i.e., use up its natural resources).

The central verse of Earthseed is given in the following:

{{quote|
Consider:  Whether you're a human being, an insect, a microbe, or a stone, this verse is true.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;All that you touch
You Change.

All that you Change
Changes you.

The only lasting truth
Is Change.

God
Is Change.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|Octavia E. Butler|''Parable of the Sower''
}}

The central paradox of Earthseed is:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Why is the universe?
To shape God.

Why is God?
To shape the universe.&lt;/poem&gt;
|Octavia Butler|''Parable of the Sower''
}}

== Influence ==

While the religion began as fiction, it has inspired several real-world movements.

The [[Terasem Movement]] seeks the development of humanity through technology, and to bridge the gap between science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/66536/terasem-trascendence-religion-technology/ |title=The Rapture of the Nerds|first=Jessica |last=Roy |work=Time |date=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Terasem'' comes from the Latin ''[[wikt:Terra|Terra]]'' ('earth') and ''[[wikt:semen#Latin|sēmen]]'' ('seed').  Like the fictional Earthseed, Terasem Movement attempts to "shape God", but through technology.

There is also a [[Modern Paganism|humanistic pagan]] website called Earthseed, and a social movement named SolSeed.

[[File:RELIGIONES.png|thumb|Religious symbols in clock-wise order from top: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Bahá'í Faith]],  [[Hinduism]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]],  [[Slavic neopaganism]], [[Celtic polytheism]], [[Germanic neopaganism|Heathenism (Germanic paganism)]], [[Semitic neopaganism]], [[Wicca]], [[Kemetism]] (Egyptian paganism), [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism (Greek paganism)]], [[Italo-Roman neopaganism]].]]
While [[religion]] is hard to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who defined it as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."&lt;ref&gt;(Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;}} A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category."&lt;ref&gt;(Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and [[sacred history|sacred histories]] that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[origin of life]] or the universe. They tend to derive [[morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s, or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]]. According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com|title=World Religions Religion Statistics Geography Church Statistics|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''religion'' is sometimes used interchangeably with "[[faith]]" or "belief system", but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect. Most religions have organized [[religious behaviour|behaviours]], including [[clergy|clerical hierarchies]], a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, [[local church|congregations]] of [[laity]], regular meetings or services for the purposes of [[veneration]] of a [[deity]] or for [[prayer]], [[shrine|holy places]] (either natural or architectural) or [[religious text]]s. Certain religions also have a [[sacred language]] often used in [[liturgy|liturgical]] services. The practice of a religion may also include [[sermon]]s, commemoration of the activities of a [[god]] or gods, [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]], [[ritual]]s, [[rite]]s, [[ceremonies]], [[worship]], [[initiation]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[marriage]]s, [[meditation]], [[invocation]], [[mediumship]], [[religious music|music]], [[religious art|art]], [[sacred dance|dance]], [[Community service|public service]] or other aspects of human culture. Religious beliefs have also been used to explain [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] [[phenomena]] such as [[out-of-body experience]]s, [[near-death experience]]s and [[reincarnation]], along with many other [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]] experiences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parapsych.org/base/about.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iands.org/about-ndes/key-nde-facts.html|title=Key Facts about Near-Death Experiences|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics [[Religious studies|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories: [[major religious groups|world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], international faiths; [[Ethnic religion|indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and [[new religious movement]]s, which refers to recently developed faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. Page 06.&lt;/ref&gt; One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings,&lt;ref&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; and thus religion, as a concept, has been [[Reification (fallacy)|applied inappropriately]] to non-Western cultures that are not based upon such systems, or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct.{{further information|Prehistoric religion|History of religion}}

Certain Christian groups are difficult to classify as "Eastern" or "Western." Many Gnostic groups were closely related to early Christianity, for example, [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinism]].  [[Irenaeus]] wrote polemics against them from the standpoint of the then-unified Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/irenaeus.html|title=Irenaeus of Lyons|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Latin language|Latin]] term ''religiō'', origin of the modern [[lexeme]] ''[[religion]]'' (via [[Old French]]/[[Middle Latin]]&lt;ref&gt;The medieval usage alternates with ''order'' in designating bonded communities like those of [[monastic orders]]: "we hear of the 'religion' of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]], of a knight 'of the [[Order of Aviz|religion of Avys]]'".[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919) 1924:75.&lt;/ref&gt;) is of ultimately obscure etymology. It is recorded beginning in the 1st century BC, i.e. in [[Classical Latin]] at the beginning of the [[Roman Empire]], notably by [[Cicero]], in the sense of "scrupulous or strict observance of the [[mos maiorum|traditional ''cultus'']]".

==Etymology==
The classical explanation of the word,  traced to [[Cicero]] himself, derives it from  ''re-'' (again) + ''lego'' in the sense of "choose", "go over again" or "consider carefully".
Modern scholars such as [[Tom Harpur]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] favor the derivation from ''{{lang|la|ligo}}'' "bind, connect", probably from a prefixed ''{{lang|la|re-ligare}}'', i.e. ''re-'' (again) + ''ligare'' or "to reconnect," which was made prominent by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], following the interpretation of [[Lactantius]].&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light.'' Toronto. Thomas Allen, 2004. {{ISBN|0-88762-145-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Power of Myth]],'' with Bill Moyers, ed. Betty Sue Flowers, New York, Anchor Books, 1991.  {{ISBN|0-385-41886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The problem with these etymologies, regardless of whether one favours  ''lego'' or ''ligo'', is that the now-familiar prefix [[:wikt:re-|re-]] "again" is not attested prior to its occurrence in ''religio'' and is itself in need of an etymological explanation.

==Significance in Roman religion==
Within the system of what we would now call "[[ancient Roman religion|Roman religion]] (in the modern sense of the word), the term ''religio''   originally meant an obligation to the gods, something expected by them from human beings or a matter of particular care or concern as related to the gods,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Linderski]], "The Augural Law", ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16 (1986), p. 2180, and in the same volume, G.J. Szemler, "Priesthoods and Priestly Careers in Ancient Rome," p. 2322.&lt;/ref&gt; 
"reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p.33, 1889. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']; [[Max Müller]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA28&amp;id=aM0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;as_brr=4 Introduction to the science of religion]''. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense, ''religio'' might be translated better as "religious scruple" than with the English word "religion".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], ''The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire'' (University of California Press, 2008), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; One definition of ''religio'' offered by [[Cicero]] is ''cultus deorum'', "the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De natura deorum'' 2.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Religio'' among the Romans was not based on "[[faith]]", but on knowledge, including and especially [[orthopraxy|correct practice]].&lt;ref&gt;Ando, ''The Matter of the Gods'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Religio'' (plural ''religiones'') was the [[pietas|pious practice]] of Rome's traditional cults, and was a cornerstone of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Belayche, in Rüpke, Jörg (Editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p. 279: "Care for the gods, the very meaning of religio, had [therefore] to go through life, and one might thus understand why Cicero wrote that religion was "necessary". Religious behavior – ''pietas'' in Latin, ''eusebeia'' in Greek – belonged to action and not to contemplation. Consequently religious acts took place wherever the faithful were: in houses, boroughs, associations, cities, military camps, cemeteries, in the country, on boats."&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional social norms that regulated public, private, and military life. To the Romans, their success was self-evidently due to their practice of proper, respectful ''religio'', which gave the gods what was owed them and which was rewarded with social harmony, peace and prosperity.

Religious law maintained the proprieties of divine honours, sacrifice, and ritual. Impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitia]]'' (faults, hence "vice," the English derivative); excessive devotion, fearful grovelling to deities, and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were ''[[superstitio]]''; neglecting the ''religiones'' owed to the traditional gods was [[atheism]], a charge leveled during the Empire at Jews,&lt;ref&gt;Jack N. Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Judaism," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 360, 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Christians, and Epicureans.&lt;ref&gt;Adelaide D. Simpson, "Epicureans, Christians, Atheists in the Second Century," ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 72 (1941) 372–381.&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger (''ira deorum'') and, therefore, harm the State.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard ''et al''., ''Literacy in the Roman world'', Ann Arbor, Mich.: Journal of Roman Archaeology, 1991, Vol. 1, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Religion in ancient Rome]].

''Religiosus'' was something pertaining to the gods or marked out by them as theirs, as distinct from ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacer|sacer]]'', which was something or someone given to them by humans. Hence, a graveyard was not primarily defined as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacer|sacer]]'' but a ''locus religiosus'', because those who lay within its boundaries were considered belonging to the [[di Manes]].&lt;ref&gt;F. De Visscher "Locus religiosus" ''Atti del Congresso internazionale di Diritto Romano'', 3, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Places struck by lightning were [[taboo]]&lt;ref&gt;Warde Fowler considers a possible origin for ''sacer'' in taboos applied to holy or accursed things or places, without direct reference to deities and their property. W. Warde Fowler "The Original Meaning of the Word Sacer" ''Journal of Roman Studies'', I, 1911, p.57-63&lt;/ref&gt; because they had been marked as ''religiosus'' by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- the Varro's presumably a fragment - no idea which one, so this needs checking --&gt;Varro. LL V, 150. See also Festus, 253 L: "A place was once considered to become ''religiosus'' which looked to have been dedicated to himself by a god": "''locus statim fieri putabatur religiosus, quod eum deus dicasse videbatur"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and etymology==
{{See also|Religio}}
''Religion'' (from O.Fr. ''religion'' religious community, from L. ''religionem'' (nom. ''religio'') "respect for what is sacred, reverence for the gods, sense of right, moral obligation, sanctity",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; "obligation, the bond between man and the gods"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;) is derived from the Latin ''[[Religio|religiō]]'', the ultimate origins of which are obscure. One possible interpretation traced to [[Cicero]], connects ''{{lang|la|lego}}'' read, i.e. ''re'' (again) with ''lego'' in the sense of choose, go over again or consider carefully. The definition of ''religio'' by [[Cicero]] is ''cultum deorum'', "the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De natura deorum'' II, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Caesar used ''religio'' to mean "obligation of an oath" when discussing captured soldiers making an oath to their captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Caesar |first1=Julius |last2=Translated by |first2=W.A.

In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin root ''religio'' was understood as an individual virtue of worship in mundane contexts; never as doctrine, practice, or actual source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Jon|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=MIchael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature: From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=254|chapter=10. Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, ''religio'' referred to broad social obligations towards anything including family, neighbors, rulers, and even towards God.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; ''Religio'' was most often used by the ancient Romans not in the context of a relation towards gods, but as a range of general emotions such as hesitation, caution, anxiety, fear; feelings of being bound, restricted, inhibited; which arose from heightened attention in any mundane context.&lt;ref name="religio roman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Carlin |last2=Boyarin |first2=Daniel |title=Imagine No Religion : How Modern Abstractions Hide Ancient Realities |date=2016 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823271207 |chapter=1. 'Religio' without “Religion” |pages=15–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also closely related to other terms like ''scrupulus'' which meant "very precisely" and some Roman authors related the term ''supertitio'', which meant too much fear or anxiety or shame, to ''religio'' at times.&lt;ref name="religio roman" /&gt; When ''religio'' came into English around the 1200s as religion, it took the meaning of "life bound by monastic vows" or monastic orders.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huizinga Middle" /&gt; The compartmentalized concept of religion, where religious things were separated from worldly things, was not used before the 1500s.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; The concept of religion was first used in the 1500s to distinguish the domain of the church and the domain of civil authorities.&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths about Religions|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17|chapter=Myth 1: All Societies Have Religions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient Greece, the Greek term ''threskeia'' was loosely translated into Latin as ''religio'' in late antiquity. The term was sparsely used in classical Greece but became more frequently used in the writings of Josephus in the first century CE. It was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others; to cultic practices. It was often contrasted with the Greek word ''deisidaimonia'' which meant too much fear.&lt;ref name="threskeia greece"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Carlin |last2=Boyarin |first2=Daniel |title=Imagine No Religion : How Modern Abstractions Hide Ancient Realities |date=2016 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823271207 |chapter=8.

The modern concept of religion, as an abstraction that entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines, is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226184487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion enlightenment"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title='Religion' and the Religions in the English Enlightenment|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521892933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt;
Some argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply the term religion to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1=Daniel|last1=Dubuisson|title=The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=978-0801887567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt; Others argue that using religion on non-western cultures distorts what people do and believe.&lt;ref name="Smith Meaning and End"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Wilfred Cantwell |title=The Meaning and End of Religion|date=1991|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0800624750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though traditions, sacred texts, and practices have existed throughout time, most cultures did not align with western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, and [[world religions]] first entered the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015|page=101 |quote=The first recorded use of "Boudhism" was 1801, followed by "Hindooism" (1829), "Taouism" (1838), and "Confucianism" (1862) (see figure 6).

This construction of "religions" was not merely the production of European translation terms, but the reification of systems of thought in a way strikingly divorced from their original cultural milieu. The original discovery of religions in different cultures was rooted in the assumption that each people had its own divine "revelation," or at least its own parallel to Christianity. In the same period, however, European and American explorers often suggested that specific African or Native American tribes lacked religion altogether.

But these diverse identities were united, each an integral part of life; no part existed in a separate sphere identified as "religious." Nor were the diverse traditions lumped together under the term "Hinduism" unified by sharing such common features of religion as a single founder, creed, theology, or institutional organization.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hindu" has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=brian111&gt;{{citation|last=Pennington|first=Brian K.|title=Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7drluePK-acC&amp;pg=PA111|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803729-3|pages=111–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lloyd Ridgeon|title=Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFKBAgAAQBAJ |year= 2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-42935-6|pages=10–11}}, Quote: "It is often said that Hinduism is very ancient, and in a sense this is true (...). It was formed by adding the English suffix -ism, of Greek origin, to the word ''Hindu'', of Persian origin; it was about the same time that the word ''Hindu'', without the suffix -ism, came to be used mainly as a religious term. (...) The name ''Hindu'' was first a geographical name, not a religious one, and it originated in the languages of Iran, not of India. (...) They referred to the non-Muslim majority, together with their culture, as 'Hindu'. (...) Since the people called Hindu differed from Muslims most notably in religion, the word came to have religious implications, and to denote a group of people who were identifiable by their Hindu religion.

According to the [[philologist]] [[Max Müller]] in the 19th century, the root of the English word religion, the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:religio|religio]]'', was originally used to mean only reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]] (which [[Cicero]] further derived to mean diligence).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p. 33, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Müller]] characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]].

===Modern western===
Religion is  a [[modern era|modern]] [[Western culture|Western]] concept.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures; there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt; Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM.  2002).

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A.M. |date=2002 |title=Sociological definitions, language games, and the 'essence' of religion | journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion | volume=14 | issue=1 | issn=0943-3058 | doi=10.1163/157006802760198776 | pages=61–83 |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf |access-date=20 July 2017| citeseerx=10.1.1.613.6995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wilfred Cantwell |date=1978 |title=The Meaning and End of Religion |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference US]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010" /&gt;

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0034412504007462|title='Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited|journal=Religious Studies|volume=41|pages=81–94|year=2005|last1=Finlay|first1=Hueston E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"/&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion.

==Aspects==

===Beliefs===
{{Main|Religious beliefs}}
Traditionally, [[faith]], in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

====Mythology====
{{Main|Mythology}}
The word ''myth'' has several meanings.
# A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;
# A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or
# A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''The Power of Myth'', p. 22 {{ISBN|0-385-24774-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and [[Scandinavia]], are usually categorized under the heading of [[mythology]]. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or [[culture]]s in development, are similarly called myths in the [[anthropology of religion]]. The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs. [[Joseph Campbell]] remarked, "Mythology is often thought of as ''other people's'' religions, and religion can be defined as mis-interpreted mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor''. Ed. Eugene Kennedy. New World Library {{ISBN|1-57731-202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/myth|title=myth|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[resurrection]] of their real-life founder [[Jesus]], which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the [[symbol]]ism of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is what is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.

====Worldview====
Religions have [[sacred history|sacred histories]], [[narrative]]s, and  [[mythology|mythologies]] which may be preserved in sacred [[Religious text|scriptures]], and [[Religious symbol|symbols]] and [[holy places]], that aim to explain the [[meaning of life]], the [[creation myth|origin of life]], or the [[religious cosmology|Universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Practices===
{{Main|Religious behaviour|Cult (religious practice)}}
The practices of a religion may include [[ritual]]s, [[sermon]]s, commemoration or veneration (of a [[deity]], [[God (male deity)|gods]], or [[goddess]]es), [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]]s, [[initiation]]s, [[funeral|funerary services]], [[matrimony|matrimonial services]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], [[religious music]], [[religious art]], [[sacred dance]], [[Community service|public service]], or other aspects of human culture.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mythology Oxford Dictionaries] mythology, retrieved 9 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social organisation===
Religions have a societal basis, either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants, or with an organized [[clergy]], and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership.

==Academic study==
{{Main|Religious studies|Classifications of religious movements}}
A number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion: [[theology]], [[comparative religion]], [[history of religion]], [[evolutionary origin of religions]], [[anthropology of religion]], [[psychology of religion]] (including [[neurotheology|neuroscience of religion]] and [[evolutionary psychology of religion]]), [[law and religion]], and [[sociology of religion]].

Daniel L. Pals mentions eight classical theories of religion, focusing on various aspects of religion: [[animism]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], by [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]] and [[J.G. Frazer]]; the [[Psychoanalysis|psycho-analytic]] approach of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and further [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]], and [[Clifford Geertz]].{{sfn|Pals|2006}}

[[Michael Stausberg]] gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion, including [[Cognitive science of religion|cognitive]] and biological approaches.{{sfn|Stausberg|2009}}

===Theories===
{{Main|Theories of religion}}
[[Sociology of religion|Sociological]] and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropological]] theories of religion generally attempt to explain the [[origin of religion|origin]] and [[social function|function of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of [[religious belief]] and [[Religious behaviour|practice]].

====Origins and development====
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Yazılıkaya]] sanctuary in [[Turkey]], with the twelve gods of the underworld]]
The origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.

According to [[anthropologists]] John Monaghan and Peter Just, "Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success – and many movements come and go with little long-term effect – has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[development of religion]] has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their [[law]]s and [[cosmology]] to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places religion has been associated with public institutions such as [[education]], [[hospital]]s, the [[family]], [[government]], and [[politics|political]] hierarchies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, "it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Cultural system====
While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category".&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Niebuhr's (1894–1962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though not without some interplay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Niebuhr, ''Christ and Culture'' (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1951) as cited by Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social constructionism====
{{Main|Theories about religions#Social constructionism|l1=Social constructionism}}
One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings.&lt;ref name="vergote 89"&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald,  Talal Asad, and Jason Ānanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

====Cognitive science====
{{Main|Cognitive science of religion}}

Cognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[neurobiology]], [[zoology]], and [[ethology]].  Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.

Hallucinations and delusions related to religious content occurs in about 60% of people with [[schizophrenia]]. While this number varies across cultures, this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomenon and possible relation to psychotic disorders. A number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms, although retrospective diagnoses are practically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=PT|title=Psychosis and paroxysmal visions in the lives of the founders of world religions.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=26|issue=1|date=2014|pages=E13–14|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12120412|pmid=24515692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=ED|last2=Cunningham|first2=MG|last3=Price|first3=BH|title=The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=24|issue=4|date=2012|pages=410–426|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214|pmid=23224447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=SR|last2=Pargament|first2=KI|title=The role of religion and spirituality in mental health.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=September 2014|volume=27|issue=5|pages=358–363|doi=10.1097/YCO.0000000000000080|pmid=25046080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reina|first1=Aaron|title=Faith Within Atheism|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|date=July 2014|volume=40|issue=4|pages=719–720|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbt076|pmid=23760918|pmc=4059423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparativism===
{{Main|Comparative religion}}
Comparative religion is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and form of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main||History of religions}}
[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|upright=2.05|A map of [[List of religious populations|major denominations and religions of the world]]]]
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of [[comparative religion]] divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called world religions. Some academics [[Study of religion|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories:
# [[world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], [[international]] religions
# [[indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and
# [[new religious movements]], which refers to recently developed religions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited.&lt;ref name="pennington"&gt;Brian Kemble Pennington ''Was Hinduism Invented?'' New York: Oxford University Press US, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-516655-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. McCutcheon. ''Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public Study of Religion''. Albany: SUNY Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lash. ''The beginning and the end of 'religion'.'' Cambridge University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-521-56635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. religions).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bulbulia. "Are There Any Religions? An Evolutionary Explanation." ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion'' 17.2 (2005), pp. 71–100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological classification===
Some scholars classify religions as either ''[[Universalizing religion|universal religions]]'' that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, or ''[[ethnic religion]]s'' that are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts.&lt;ref name="Hinnells"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33311-5 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald. ''The Ideology of Religious Studies''. New York: Oxford University Press US, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Prentiss. ''Religion and the Creation of Race and Ethnicity''. New York: NYU Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8147-6701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomoko Masuzawa.

===Demographical classification===
{{Main|Major religious groups|List of religious populations}}
The five largest religious groups by world population, estimated to account for 5.8 billion people and 84% of the population, are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism (with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of [[syncretism]]) and traditional folk religion.

==Specific religions==
{{Mainarticle|List of religions and spiritual traditions}}

===Abrahamic===
[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|upright|thumb|The patriarch [[Abraham]] (by [[József Molnár (painter)|József Molnár]])]]
[[Abrahamic religions]] are [[monotheistic]] religions which believe they descend from [[Abraham]].

====Judaism====
[[File:Open Torah and pointer.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Torah]] is the primary sacred text of Judaism.]]
[[Judaism]] is the oldest Abrahamic religion, originating in the people of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel and Judea]]. The [[Torah]] is its foundational text, and is part of the larger text known as the [[Tanakh]] or [[Hebrew Bible]]. It is supplemented by oral tradition, set down in written form in later texts such as the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]]. Judaism includes a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which holds that God revealed his laws and [[613 Mitzvot|commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the form of both the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]]; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups. The [[Jewish people]] were scattered after the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton61/st02_27.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cbs.gov.il |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest [[Jewish religious movements]] are [[Orthodox Judaism]] ([[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]), [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]].

====Christianity====
[[File:StJohnsAshfield StainedGlass GoodShepherd Portrait cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jesus]] is the central figure of Christianity.]]
[[Christianity]] is based on the life and teachings of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] (1st century) as presented in the [[New Testament]]. The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the [[Christ]], the [[Son of God]], and as [[Messiah|Savior]] and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the [[Trinity]], which teaches the unity of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] (Jesus Christ), and [[Holy Spirit]] as three persons in [[monotheism|one Godhead]]. Most Christians can describe their faith with the [[Nicene Creed]]. As the religion of [[Byzantine Empire]] in the first millennium and of [[Western Europe]] during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world. The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:
* The [[Catholic Church]], led by the [[Bishop of Rome]] and the bishops worldwide in communion with him, is a [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] of 24 Churches ''[[sui iuris]]'', including the [[Latin Church]] and 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic churches]], such as the [[Maronite]] Catholic Church.
* [[Eastern Christianity]], which include [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Church of the East]].
* [[Protestantism]], separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation]] and is split into thousands of [[Religious denomination|denominations]].  Major branches of Protestantism include [[Anglicanism]], [[Baptists]], [[Calvinism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Methodism]], though each of these contain many different denominations or groups.

There are also smaller groups, including:
* [[Restorationism]], the belief that Christianity should be restored (as opposed to reformed) along the lines of what is known about the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic early church]].
* [[Latter Day Saint movement]], founded by [[Joseph Smith]] in the late 1820s.
* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]].

====Islam====
[[File:Kaaba mirror edit jj.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Muslim]]s [[Tawaf|circumambulating]] the [[Kaaba]], the most sacred site in [[Islam]]]]
[[Islam]] is based on the [[Quran]], one of the [[Islamic holy books|holy books]] considered by Muslims to be [[Wahy|revealed]] by [[God in Islam|God]], and on the [[Hadith|teachings (hadith)]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is based on the unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] prophets of Judaism, Christianity and other Abrahamic religions before [[Muhammad]]. It is the most widely practiced religion of [[Southeast Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Western Asia]], and [[Central Asia]], while Muslim-majority countries also exist in parts of [[South Asia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Southeast Europe]]. There are also several [[Islamic republic]]s, including [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Afghanistan]].
* [[Sunni Islam]] is the largest denomination within Islam and follows the Quran, the hadiths which record the [[sunnah]], whilst placing emphasis on the [[sahabah]].
* [[Shia Islam]] is the second largest denomination of Islam and its adherents believe that [[Ali]] succeeded Muhammad and further places emphasis on Muhammad's family.
* [[Ahmadiyya]] adherents believe that the awaited Imam [[Mahdi]] and the Promised Messiah has arrived, believed to be [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] by Ahmadis.
* There are also Muslim revivalist movements such as [[Muwahhidism]] and [[Salafism]].

Other denominations of Islam include [[Nation of Islam]], [[Ibadi]], [[Sufism]], [[Quranism]], [[Mahdavia]], and [[non-denominational Muslims]]. [[Wahhabism]] is the dominant Muslim [[Maddhab|schools of thought]] in the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].

====Other====
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is an Abrahamic religion founded in 19th-century Iran and since then has spread worldwide. It teaches unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets including its founder [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. One of its divisions is the [[Orthodox Bahá'í Faith]].

Smaller regional Abrahamic groups also exist, including [[Samaritanism]] (primarily in Israel and the West Bank), the [[Rastafari movement]] (primarily in Jamaica), and [[Druze]] (primarily in Syria and Lebanon).

===East Asian===
{{Main|East Asian religions}}
East Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions or Taoic religions) consist of several religions of East Asia which make use of the concept of Tao (in Chinese) or Dō (in Japanese or Korean). They include:

====Taoism and Confucianism====
* [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]], as well as Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese religion influenced by Chinese thought.

====Chinese folk religion====
* [[Chinese folk religion]]: the indigenous religions of the [[Han Chinese]], or, by [[metonymy]], of all the populations of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]]. It includes the syncretism of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]], [[Wuism]], as well as many new religious movements such as [[Chen Tao (True Way Cult)|Chen Tao]], [[Falun Gong]] and [[Yiguandao]].
* Other folk and new religions of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] such as [[Korean shamanism]], [[Chondogyo]], and [[Jeung San Do]] in Korea; [[Shinto]], [[Shugendo]], [[Ryukyuan religion]], and [[Japanese new religions]] in Japan; [[Satsana Phi]] in Laos; [[Cao Đài]], [[Hòa Hảo]], and [[Vietnamese folk religion]] in Vietnam.

===Dharmic (Indian)===
[[File:Rama, Lakshman and Sita at the Kalaram Temple, Nashik..jpg|upright|thumb|[[Hindu]] statue of [[Lord Rama]] in Kalaram Temple ([[India]])]]
[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Dharmacakra Discourse.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Buddha]], in a [[Sanskrit]] manuscript, [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], Bihar, India]]
[[Indian religions]] are practiced or were founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. They are sometimes classified as the ''dharmic religions'', as they all feature [[dharma]], the specific law of reality and duties expected according to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mittal |first=Sushil |title=Surprising Bedfellows: Hindus and Muslims in Medieval and Early Modern India |year=2003 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739106730 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
* [[Hinduism]] is preferentially self-designated by the term ''Vaidika Dharma''.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=Survey of Hinduism, A: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CVviRghVtIC|date=2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8011-3| page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[synecdoche]] describing the similar philosophies of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], and [[Hindu denominations|related groups]] practiced or founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Concepts most of them share in common include [[karma]], [[caste]], [[reincarnation]], [[mantra]]s, [[yantra]]s, and [[darśana]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Hinduism is variously defined as a religion, set of religious beliefs and practices, religious tradition etc. For a discussion on the topic, see: "Establishing the boundaries" in Gavin Flood (2003), pp. 1–17. [[René Guénon]] in his'' [[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'' (1921 ed.), Sophia Perennis, {{ISBN|0-900588-74-8}}, proposes a definition of the term religion and a discussion of its relevance (or lack of) to Hindu doctrines (part II, chapter 4, p. 58).&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is one of the most ancient of still-active religions,&lt;ref&gt;p. 434 ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' By Wendy Doniger, M. Webster, Merriam-Webster, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 219 ''Faith, Religion &amp; Theology'' By Brennan Hill, Paul F. Knitter, William Madges&lt;/ref&gt; with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;p. 6 ''The World's Great Religions'' By Yoshiaki Gurney Omura, Selwyn Gurney Champion, Dorothy Short&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a religious category containing dozens of separate philosophies amalgamated as [[Sanātana Dharma]], which is the name by which Hinduism has been known throughout history by its followers.

====Jainism====
* [[Jainism]], taught primarily by [[Rishabhanatha]] (the founder of [[ahimsa]]) is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of [[non-violence]], [[truth]] and [[anekantavada]] for all forms of living beings in this universe; which helps them to eliminate all the [[Karma in Jainism|Karmas]], and hence to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death ([[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving ([[Moksha (Jainism)|nirvana]]). Jains are found mostly in India. According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the [[Mahavira]] as about contemporaneous with the [[Buddha]] in the 5th-century BCE, and accordingly the historical [[Parshvanatha]], based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BCE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–31}}
** [[Digambara]] Jainism (or sky-clad) is mainly practiced in South India. Their holy books are [[Pravachanasara]] and [[Samayasara]] written by their Prophets  [[Kundakunda]] and [[Amritchandra]] as their [[Jain Agamas (Digambara)|original cannon]] is lost.
** [[Shwetambara]] Jainism (or white-clad) is mainly practiced in Western India. Their holy books are [[Jain Agamas]], written by their Prophet [[Sthulibhadra]].

====Buddhism====
* [[Buddhism]] was founded by [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]] in the 6th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] end their [[dukkha|suffering (dukkha)]] by understanding the [[dharma|true nature of phenomena]], thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth ([[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].
** [[Theravada]] Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in [[Sri Lanka]] and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion, shares some characteristics of Indian religions. It is based in a large collection of texts called the [[Pali Canon]].
** [[Mahayana]] Buddhism (or the Great Vehicle) under which are a multitude of doctrines that became prominent [[Buddhism in China|in China]] and are still relevant [[Buddhism in Vietnam|in Vietnam]], [[Buddhism in Korea|Korea]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Japan]] and to a lesser extent [[Buddhism in the West|in Europe and the United States]]. Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as [[Zen]], [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], and [[Soka Gakkai]].
** [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism first appeared in India in the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony (2000), Buddhist Thought: A complete introduction to the Indian tradition, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-203-18593-5}} p=194&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently most prominent in the Himalaya regions&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E.

[[Mikkyō]]).
** Two notable new Buddhist sects are [[Hòa Hảo]] and the [[Navayana]] ([[Dalit Buddhist movement]]), which were developed separately in the 20th century.

[[File:GuruNanakFresco-Goindwal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Fresco of [[Guru Nanak]] at [[Goindwal Sahib]] [[Gurdwara]]]]

====Sikhism====
* [[Sikhism]] is a [[panentheistic]] religion founded on the teachings of [[Guru Nanak]] and ten successive [[Sikh gurus]] in 15th-century [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. It is the [[Major religious groups|fifth-largest]] [[organized religion]] in the world, with approximately 30 million Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sikhism: What do you know about it?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/sikhism-what-do-you-know-about-it/2012/08/06/19131ef6-dff1-11e1-8fc5-a7dcf1fc161d_gallery.html|accessdate=13 December 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zepps |first=Josh |title=Sikhs in America: What You Need To Know About The World's Fifth-Largest Religion |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/06/sikhs-in-america_n_1748125.html |accessdate=13 December 2012 |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sikh]]s are expected to embody the qualities of a ''Sant-Sipāhī'' – a saint-soldier, have control over one's internal [[Five Thieves|vices]] and be able to be constantly immersed in virtues clarified in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in ''[[Waheguru]]''—represented by the phrase ''[[ik Onkar|ik ōaṅkār]]'', meaning one God, who prevails in everything, along with a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings.

[[Indigenous religions]] or [[ethnic religion|folk religions]] refers to a broad category of traditional religions that can be characterised by [[shamanism]], [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]], where traditional means "indigenous, that which is aboriginal or foundational, handed down from generation to generation…".&lt;ref&gt;J.O. Awolalu (1976) [http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/uploads/ArticlePDFs/268.pdf What is African Traditional Religion?] Studies in Comparative Religion Vol. 10, No. 2. (Spring, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; These are religions that are closely associated with a particular group of people, ethnicity or tribe; they often have no formal creeds or sacred texts.&lt;ref name="pew global"&gt;Pew Research Center (2012) [http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape.aspx The Global Religious Landscape.

There are also notable [[African diasporic religions]] practiced in the Americas, such as [[Santeria]], [[Candomble]], [[Haitian Vodun|Vodun]], [[Lucumi religion|Lucumi]], [[Umbanda]], and [[Macumba]].

===Iranian===
[[File:Maneckji Sett Agiary entrance.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Zoroastrian]] [[Fire temple|Fire Temple]] in Mumbai, India]]
[[Iranian religions]] are ancient religions whose roots predate the [[Islamization]] of [[Greater Iran]]. Nowadays these religions are practiced only by minorities.

[[Zoroastrianism]] is based on the teachings of prophet [[Zoroaster]] in the 6th century BCE. Zoroastrians worship the [[Creator deity|creator]] [[Ahura Mazda]]. In Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources, with evil trying to destroy the creation of Mazda, and good trying to sustain it.

[[Mandaeism]] is a [[monotheistic]] religion with a strongly [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] worldview. Mandaeans are sometime labeled as the Last [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]].

[[Religion in Kurdistan|Kurdish religions]] include the traditional beliefs of the [[Yazidi]], [[Alevi]], and [[Ahl-e Haqq]]. Sometimes these are labeled [[Yazdânism]].

===New religious movements===
{{Main|New religious movement}}
*  [[Japanese new religions|Shinshūkyō]] is a general category for a wide variety of religious movements founded in Japan since the 19th century. These movements share almost nothing in common except the place of their founding. The largest religious movements centered in Japan include [[Soka Gakkai]], [[Tenrikyo]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]] among hundreds of smaller groups.
* [[Cao Đài]] is a syncretistic, monotheistic religion, established in [[Vietnam]] in 1926.
* [[Raëlism]] is a new religious movement founded in 1974 teaching that humans were created by aliens. It is numerically the world's largest [[UFO religion]].
* [[Hindu reform movements]], such as [[Ayyavazhi]], [[Swaminarayan Faith]] and [[Ananda Marga]], are examples of new religious movements within Indian religions.
* [[Unitarian Universalism]] is a religion characterized by support for a free and responsible search for truth and meaning, and has no accepted [[creed]] or [[theology]].
* [[Noahidism]] is a monotheistic ideology based on the Seven Laws of Noah, and on their traditional interpretations within Rabbinic Judaism.
* [[Scientology]] teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature. Its method of spiritual rehabilitation is a type of counseling known as [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]], in which practitioners aim to consciously re-experience and understand painful or traumatic events and decisions in their past in order to free themselves of their limiting effects.
* [[Eckankar]] is a pantheistic religion with the purpose of making God an everyday reality in one's life.
* [[Wicca]] is a neo-pagan religion first popularised in 1954 by British civil servant [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], involving the worship of a God and Goddess.
* [[Neo-Druidism|Druidry]] is a religion promoting harmony with nature, and drawing on the practices of the druids.
* There are various [[Neopagan]] movements that attempt to reconstruct or revive ancient [[pagan]] practices. These include [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]], and [[Kemeticism]].
* [[Satanism]] is a broad category of religions that, for example, worship Satan as a deity ([[Theistic Satanism]]) or use Satan as a symbol of carnality and earthly values ([[LaVeyan Satanism]]).

[[Sociological classifications of religious movements]] suggest that within any given religious group, a community can resemble various types of structures, including [[Church (building)|churches]], [[Religious denomination|denominations]], [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s, and [[institution]]s.

===Law===
{{main|Law and religion}}
The study of law and religion is a relatively new field, with several thousand scholars involved in law schools, and academic departments including political science, religion, and history since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witte |first1=John |year=2012 |title=The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report |url= |journal=Ecclesiastical Law Journal |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=327–354 |doi=10.1017/s0956618x12000348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non-establishment, but also study religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding of religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in a comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, ''Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham and Brett G. Scharffs, eds., ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, and discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S.

Studies have focused on [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ferrari |first1=Silvio |year=2012 |title=Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective |url= |journal=Ecclesiastical Law Journal |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=355–370 |doi=10.1017/s0956618x1200035x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palomino |first1=Rafael |year=2012 |title=Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems |url= http://eprints.ucm.es/12247/|journal=Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice |volume=2 |issue= |pages=208–225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the issue of wearing religious symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bennoune |first1=Karima |year=2006 |title=Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law |url= |journal=Columbia Journal of Transnational Law |volume=45 |issue= |page=367 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
{{Main|Faith and rationality|Relationship between religion and science|Epistemology}}
[[Science]] acknowledges [[reason]], [[empiricism]], and [[evidence]]; and religions include [[revelation]], [[faith]] and [[sacredness]] whilst also acknowledging [[Philosophy of religion|philosophical]] and [[metaphysical]] explanations with regard to the study of the universe. Both science and religion are not monolithic, timeless, or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stenmark |first1=Mikael |title=How to Relate Science and Religion: A Multidimensional Model |date=2004 |publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co. |location=Grand Rapids, Mich. |isbn=978-0802828231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of science and religion are a recent invention: the term religion emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri/&gt; The term science emerged in the 19th century out of [[natural philosophy]] in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature ([[natural science]]),&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226089287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSACM"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Numbers|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=David|title=When Science and Christianity Meet|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226482149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase religion and science emerged in the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"/&gt; It was in the 19th century that the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt; In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (''scientia'') and religion (''religio'') were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;

In general the [[scientific method]] gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop [[theories]] through elucidation of facts or evaluation by [[experiment]]s and thus only answers [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] questions about the [[universe]] that can be observed and measured. It develops [[theory|theories]] of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as ''[[de facto]]'' verities in general parlance, such as the theories of [[general relativity]] and [[natural selection]] to explain respectively the mechanisms of [[gravity]] and [[evolution]].

Religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world, and to explain humanity's place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities. In terms of Christian theology and ultimate truths, people rely on reason, experience, scripture, and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe. Furthermore, religious models, understanding, and metaphors are also revisable, as are scientific models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tolman |first1=Cynthia |title=Methods in Religion |url=http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |website=Malboro College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013431/http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding religion and science, [[Albert Einstein]] states (1940): "For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action; it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts…Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determine the goals, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal God Concept Causes Science-Religion Conflict |journal=The Science News-Letter |date=21 September 1940 |first=Albert |last=Einstein |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=181–182 |jstor=3916567 |doi=10.2307/3916567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morality ===
{{Main|Morality and religion}}
Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Jems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Theological Aspects of the Avesta|Zoroastrianism's]] good thoughts, good words, and good deeds concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|last=Esptein|first=Greg M.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=978-0-06-167011-4|edition=|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and morality are not synonymous. While it is "an almost automatic assumption."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elements of Moral Philosophy|last2=Rachels|first2=(ed) Stuart|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2011|isbn=978-0-078-03824-2|edition=7|location=New York|page=|last1=Rachels|first1=(ed) James}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Christianity, morality can have a [[Secular morality|secular basis]].

The study of religion and morality can be contentious due to ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definitions of religiosity.

=== Politics ===
====Impact====
Religion has had a significant impact on the political system in many countries. Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of [[sharia]], the Islamic law. Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as [[Iran|The Islamic Republic of Iran]]. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57&amp;nbsp;billion people who are [[Muslim world|Muslims]]. However, religion also affects political decisions in many western countries. For instance, in the [[United States]], 51% of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in God, and only 6% more likely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/02/economist-explains-18?cid1=cust/noenew/n/n/n/20160229n/owned/n/n/nwl/n/n/NA/email The Economist explains: The role of religion in America’s presidential race], ''The Economist'', 25 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Christians make up 92% of members of the US Congress, compared with 71% of the general public (as of 2014). At the same time, while 23% of U.S. adults are religiously unaffiliated, only one member of Congress ([[Kyrsten Sinema]], D-Arizona), or 0.2% of that body, claims no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/27/10-facts-about-religion-in-america/|title=10 facts about religion in America|last=Lipka|first=Michael|date=27 Aug 2015|website=|publisher=Pew Research Center|access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most European countries, however, religion has a much smaller influence on politics&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2014/04/europe-religion-and-politics Europe, religion and politics:Old world wars], The Economist, 22 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; although it used to be much more important. For instance, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] were illegal in many European countries until recently, following Christian (usually [[Catholicism|Catholic]]) doctrine. Several [[List of atheists in politics and law|European leaders are atheists]] (e.g. [[France]]’s former president [[François Hollande|Francois Hollande]] or Greece's prime minister [[Alexis Tsipras]]). In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries. For instance, [[India]] is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics, given that Hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the Muslims and the Christians, who historically belonged to the lower castes.&lt;ref&gt;Lobo, L. 2000 [http://americamagazine.org/issue/276/article/religion-and-politics-india Religion and Politics in India], ''America Magazine'', 19 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, countries such as [[Religion in China|China]] or [[Religion in Japan|Japan]] are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics.

====Secularism====
[[File:Ranjitsingh.gif|thumb|upright|[[Ranjit Singh]] established [[Ranjit Singh#Secular Sikh rule|secular rule]] over [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the early 19th century.]]

{{Main|Secularism| Secularization}}
Secularization is the transformation of the politics of a society from close identification with a particular religion's values and institutions toward nonreligious values and [[secular]] institutions. The purpose of this is frequently modernization or protection of the populations religious diversity.

===Economics===
[[File:Religion economy.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Average income correlates negatively with (self-defined) religiosity.&lt;ref name="gia" /&gt;]]
{{Main|Economics of religion}}
{{Further|Religion and business|Wealth and religion}}
One study has found there is a negative correlation between self-defined religiosity and the wealth of nations.&lt;ref name=WIN-Gallup&gt;{{cite web |last=WIN-Gallup |title=Global Index of religion and atheism. |url=http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065544/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the richer a nation is, the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves religious, whatever this word means to them (Many people identify themselves as part of a religion (not irreligion) but do not self-identify as religious).&lt;ref name="WIN-Gallup" /&gt;

Sociologist and political economist [[Max Weber]] has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their [[Protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, [1904] 1920. ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study from 2015, [[Christians]] hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by [[Muslims]] (5.8%), [[Hindus]] (3.3%) and [[Jewish]] (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification [[Irreligion]] or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/453467/christians-hold-largest-percentage-global.html6 |title=Christians hold largest percentage of global wealth: Report|publisher=deccanherald.com|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Main|Impacts of religion on health}}
[[Mayo Clinic]] researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. The authors reported that: "Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide."&lt;ref name="Religion and Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Paul S. |last1=Mueller, MD |first2=David J. |last2=Plevak, MD |first3=Teresa A. |last3=Rummans, MD |title=Religious Involvement, Spirituality, and Medicine: Implications for Clinical Practice |url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0025-6196/PIIS0025619611627997.pdf |quote=We reviewed published studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and subject reviews that examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes.

The authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is largely beneficial, based on a review of related literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Hill |first2=Peter C. |title=The Role of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=February 2001 |first=Kevin S. |last=Seybold |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=21–24 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to academic James W. Jones, several studies have discovered "positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Religion, Health, and the Psychology of Religion: How the Research on Religion and Health Helps Us Understand Religion |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |year=2004 |first=James W. |last=Jones |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=317–328 |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4299-3|url=http://dergipark.gov.tr/bilimname/issue/3501/47580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested "that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.11.008|pmid=16359765|title=Gender differences in religious practices, spiritual experiences and health: Results from the US General Social Survey|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=62|issue=11|pages=2848–2860|year=2006|last1=Maselko|first1=Joanna|last2=Kubzansky|first2=Laura D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing "religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical." He asserts that "violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion" and that "virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary."&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=As we have insisted previously, religion is not inherently and irredeemably violent; it certainly is not the essence and source of all violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=Religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical. Violence is one phenomenon in human (and natural existence), religion is another, and it is inevitable that the two would become intertwined. Religion is complex and modular, and violence is one of the modules—not universal, but recurring. As a conceptual and behavioral module, violence is by no means exclusive to religion. There are plenty of other groups, institutions, interests, and ideologies to promote violence. Violence is, therefore, neither essential to nor exclusive to religion. Nor is religious violence all alike... And virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal sacrifice ====
Done by some (but not all) religions, [[animal sacrifice]] is the [[ritual]] killing and offering of an animal to appease or maintain favour with a [[deity]]. It has been banned in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/india-court-bans-animal-sacrifice-hindu-temples |title=Indian court bans animal sacrifice |last=France-Presse |first=Agence|newspaper=The Guardian |date=2014-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superstition ===
{{Further|Superstition|Magical thinking|Magic and religion}}
Greek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (''deisidaimonia''), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods ''superstitio''.&lt;ref&gt;Veyne 1987, p. 211 {{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ancient Greek]] historian [[Polybius]] described superstition in [[Ancient Rome]] as an ''[[instrumentum regni]]'', an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]], VI 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superstition has been described as the non rational establishment of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf Kevin R.

B'' (2009) 276, 31–37] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728042608/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf |date=28 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is more complex and is often composed of social institutions and has a moral aspect. Some religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Religion Explained |last=Boyer | first = Pascal |year=2001 |chapter=Why Belief |authorlink=Pascal Boyer |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wreF80OHTicC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=%22fang+too+were+quite+amazed%22|title-link=Religion Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nailed : ten Christian myths that show Jesus never existed at all|last=David|first=Fitzgerald|isbn=9780557709915|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=701249439|date = October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[atheists]], [[deists]], and [[skeptics]] regard religious belief as superstition.

The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states that superstition "in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion" (para. #2110).  "Superstition," it says, "is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16–22" (para. #2111)

===Agnosticism and atheism===
{{Main|Atheism|Agnosticism|Irreligion|Antireligion|Humanism}}
{{See also|Criticism of atheism}}
The terms [[atheist]] (lack of belief in any gods) and agnostic (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of religious. There are religions (including Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or [[nontheism|nontheistic]]. The true opposite of religious is the word irreligious. [[Irreligion]] describes an absence of any religion; [[antireligion]] describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general.

===Interfaith cooperation===
{{Main|Interfaith dialogue}}
Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}, many religious practitioners{{who|date=July 2016}} have aimed to band together in [[interfaith]] dialogue, cooperation, and [[Religion and peacebuilding|religious peacebuilding]]. The first major dialogue was the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], which affirmed universal values and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures. The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]] representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Recent interfaith initiatives include A Common Word, launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acommonword.com/|title=A Common Word Between Us and You|work=acommonword.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "C1 World Dialogue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|title=konsoleH :: Login|work=c1worlddialogue.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128195027/http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|archivedate=28 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Common Ground initiative between Islam and Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islambuddhism.com/|title=Islam and Buddhism|work=islambuddhism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[United Nations]] sponsored "World Interfaith Harmony Week".&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/ World Interfaith Harmony Week]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/world-interfaith-harmony-week-resolution/|title=» World Interfaith Harmony Week UNGA Resolution A/65/PV.34|work=worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
Culture and religion have usually been seen as closely related. [[Paul Tillich]] looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Queen, ''
Encyclopedia of American Religious History, Volume 1'' Facts on File, 1996. p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture, and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture, culture is the form of religion. Such a consideration definitely prevents the establishment of a dualism of religion and culture. Every religious act, not only in organized religion, but also in the most intimate movement of the soul, is culturally formed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', Robert C. Kimball (ed), (Oxford University Press, 1959). p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Ernst Troeltsch]], similarly, looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that, therefore, transplanting a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would actually kill it in the same manner that transplanting a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it. &lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Sharpe, "Religion and Cultures", An inaugural lecture delivered on 6 July, 1977 by Eric J. Sharpe, Professor of Religious Studies in the University of Sydney. Accessed at [https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/ART/article/download/5496/6167 Openjournals] on June 22, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many attempts in the modern pluralistic situation to distinguish culture from religion.&lt;ref&gt;See Taslima Nasreen, [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/i-say-three-cheers-for-ayaan/232289 "I Say, Three Cheers For Ayaan",] ''Outlook, The Magazine'' 28 August 2006. Also, Nemani Delaibatiki, [http://fijisun.com.fj/2017/07/08/religion-and-the-vanua/ "Religion and the Vanua"] ''Fiji Sun'' July 08, 2017 in which the distinctive elements of culture against religion are taken from Domenic Marbaniang, [https://philpapers.org/bbs/thread.pl?tId=959 "Difference Between Culture and Religion: A Proposal Requesting Response"], 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Domenic Marbaniang has argued that elements grounded on beliefs of a metaphysical nature (religious) are distinct from elements grounded on nature and the natural (cultural). For instance, language (with its grammar) is a cultural element while sacralization of language in which a particular religious scripture is written is more often a religious practice. The same applies to music and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of religion}}
Criticism of religion is [[criticism]] of the ideas, the truth, or the practice of religion, including its political and social implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Beckford|first=James A.|title=Social Theory and Religion| page=2| year=2003| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-77431-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
