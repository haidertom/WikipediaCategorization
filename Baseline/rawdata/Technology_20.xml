      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">'''Alternative technology''' is a term used to refer to technologies that are more [[environmentally friendly]] than the functionally equivalent technologies dominant in current practice.

The term was coined by [[Peter Harper (alternative technologist)|Peter Harper]], one of the founders of the [[Centre for Alternative Technology]], [[North Wales]] (a.k.a. ''The Quarry''), in [[Undercurrents (magazine)]] in the 1970s.

Some "alternative technologies" have in the past or may in the future become widely adopted, after which they might no longer be considered "alternative."  For example, the use of wind turbines to produce electricity.

==Alternative technologies==
Alternative technologies include the following:
* [[Anaerobic digestion]]
* [[Composting]]
* [[Fuel cell]]s 
* Fuels for automobiles (besides [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]])
** [[Alcohol fuel|Alcohol]] (either [[ethanol]] or [[methanol]])
** [[Biodiesel]]
** [[Vegetable oil]]
** [[Biomass to liquid]]
* [[Greywater]]
* [[Photovoltaic module|Solar panel]]s
** Silicon-based
** [[Photosynthetic]] "[[Gratzel cell]]s" ([[Titanium dioxide]])
* [[Landfill gas]] extraction from landfills
* [[Mechanical biological treatment]]
* [[Recycling]]
* [[Wind generator]]s

'''Architectural technology''', or '''building technology''', is the application of technology to the design of buildings. It is a component of [[architecture]] and [[building engineering]] and is sometimes viewed as a distinct discipline or sub-category. New materials and technologies generated new design challenges and construction methods throughout the evolution of building, especially since the advent of industrialisation in the 19th century. Architectural technology is related to the different elements of a building and their interactions, and is closely aligned with advances in [[building science]].

Architectural technology can be summarised as the "technical design and expertise used in the application and integration of construction technologies in the building design process."&lt;ref&gt; BSc (Architectural Technology) Level 8 - Dublin Institute of Technology&lt;/ref&gt; or as "The ability to analyse, synthesise and evaluate building design factors in order to produce efficient and effective technical design solutions which satisfy performance, production and procurement criteria."&lt;ref&gt;Architectural Technology BSc (Hons), School of the Built and Natural Environment, Ellison Building, Newcastle City Campus&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Many specialists and professionals, consider [[Vitruvius]]'s theories as the foundations of architectural technology. Vitruvius's attempt to classify building types, styles, materials and construction methods&lt;ref&gt;"[[s:Ten Books on Architecture|The Ten Books on Architecture]]", Translated by Morris Hicky Morgan, Ph.D., LL.D., Cambridge, Harvard University Press, London: Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; influenced the creation of many disciplines such as [[civil engineering]], [[structural engineering]], architectural technology and other practices which, now and since the 19th century, form a conceptual framework for architectural design.

In his published research, Stephen Emmitt explains that in our modern society, "The relationship between building technology and design can be traced back to the Enlightenment and the industrial revolution, a period when advances in technology and science were seen as the way forward, and times of solid faith in progress... As technologies multiply in number and complexity the building profession started to fragment".&lt;ref&gt;Extract from: "Architectural Technology: Research and Practice", by Stephen Emmitt, published in May 2013 in the UK by Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1-118-29206-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice of architectural technology==
Architectural technology is a discipline that spans architecture, building science and engineering. It is practiced by [[architect]]s, [[architectural technologist]]s, [[structural engineer]]s, [[Architectural engineering|architectural / building engineers]] and others who develop the design / concept into a buildable reality. Specialist manufacturers who develop products used to construct buildings, are also involved in the discipline.

[[Paul Nuttall]] director at [[Arup Group|ARUP]] compares the role of the building engineer to the role of the technical architect and architect. The practice of architectural technology cannot be limited to technology itself; it also relates to the space, the building, the light, the environment served and created by the design. The professional in charge of the technical design leads specialist engineers to provide the best technical and engineered solutions for the project.&lt;ref&gt;Breakfast with Arup: Tuesday 11 December 2012, Paul Nuttall, Director, Building Engineering London, Arup In this talk, Paul Nuttall shares his insights on designing buildings in the 21st Century. The video is widely available on youtube and other websites.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, architectural technology is developed, understood and integrated into a building by producing [[architectural drawing]]s and [[Scheduling (production processes)|schedules]]. Computer technology is now used on all but the simplest building types: in the twentieth century the use of [[computer aided design]] (CAD) became mainstream, allowing for highly accurate drawings that can be shared electronically, so that for example the architectural plans can be used as the basis for designing electrical and air handling services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ciat.org.uk/about-us/what-is-a-chartered-architectural-technologist.html What is a Chartered Architectural Technologist ?]&lt;/ref&gt; As the design develops, that information can be shared with the whole [[design team]]. That process is currently taken to a logical conclusion with the widespread use of [[Building Information Modeling]] (BIM), which uses a [[3D modeling|three dimensional model]] of the building, created with input from all the disciplines to build up an integrated design.

Architectural technology is informed by both practical constraints, and [[Building code|building regulations]], as well as standards relating to safety, environmental performance, fire resistance, etc.

==Building materials==
Until the twentieth century, the materials used for building were limited to brick, stone, timber and steel to form structures, slate and tiles for roof coverings, lead and sometimes copper for waterproofing details and decorative roofing effects. The Romans used concrete, but it was virtually unknown as a building material until the invention of reinforced concrete in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blconcrete.htm The History of Concrete and Cement]. Inventors.about.com (2012-04-09). Retrieved on 2013-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern construction is much more complex, with walls, floors and roofs all built up from many elements to include structure, insulation and waterproofing often as separate layers or elements.

'''Creative technology''' is a broadly [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] field combining [[computing]], [[design]], [[art]] and the [[humanities]]. The field of creative technology encompasses art, [[digital product design]], digital media or an advertising and media made with a software-based, electronic and/or data-driven engine. Examples of creative technology include multi-sensory experiences made using [[computer graphics]], [[video production]], [[digital cinematography]], [[virtual reality]], [[augmented reality]], [[video editing]], [[software engineering]], [[3D printing]], the [[Internet of Things]], [[CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] and [[wearable technology]].&lt;ref name=BII&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.in/Creative-technology-is-key-for-connecting-the-next-billion/articleshow/46946247.cms "Creative technology is key for connecting the next billion"].

==Description==
Creative technology facilities may be organized as arts, research or job development entities, such as the UK's Foundation for Art and Creative Technology which has presented hundreds of new media and digital artworks from around the world, or a recently established $20.5m project in Hawaii specializing in film industry job training and workforce development programs which plans to offer robotics, computer labs, recording studios and editing bays,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thegardenisland.com/news/local/the-future-is-now/article_8d4353b4-e0e2-11e4-abe4-57da23fc4360.html "The future is now"], ''The Garden Island''. Retrieved 1 May 2015. {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; pitched as a "game-changing" opportunity to bring new skills and jobs to Kauai. Degrees in this field were designed to address needs for cross-disciplinary interaction and aim to develop lateral thinking skills across more rigidly defined academic areas. Some educators have complained that creative technology tools, though "widely available", are difficult to use for young populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winbeta.org/news/how-microsoft%E2%80%99s-sway-presentation-tool-being-used-foster-creativity-students "How Microsoft’s Sway presentation tool is being used to foster creativity in students"], ''Winbeta.org''.

The first major corporation to have a corporate officer bearing the title creative technology was [[The Walt Disney Company]], which gave it first to the [[Walt Disney Imagineering|imagineer]], [[Bran Ferren]] in 1993, who eventually became Disney's president of creative technology in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/16/local/me-17957|title=Valley People|date=16 March 1999|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=18 February 2017|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the first educational research center in the United States was created to bridge these disciplines across industry, academia and the defense communities, designated the University of Southern California's, [[Institute for Creative Technologies]]. The ICT was established with funding by the US Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/09/19/shall_we_play_a_game_the_rise_of_the_military_entertainment_complex/|title=Shall we play a game?: The rise of the military-entertainment complex|last=Mead|first=Corey|website=Salon|date=19 September 2013|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketers and advertisers are also looking toward the power of creative technology to re-engage customers. The UK's Marketing Agencies Association is promoting creative technology as a way to build a more connected and personalized engagement with prospective customers, which launched a Creative Technology Initiative in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt; Omaid Hiwaizi, [http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1333118/creative-technology-will-drive-next-era-marketing "Creative technology will drive the next era of marketing"], ''Campaign'', 9 February 2015. Retrieved 1 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Industry associations and developers, arts organizations and agency creatives alike call for more investment in technology, which has lagged behind the sea change in the industry that is introducing more technology into creative fields. Many advertising agencies and other businesses have begun to create internal labs for research in creative technology. For example, [[Unilever]] created its Foundry Project as a way for the company to "embrace the mentality of hacking, deploying and scaling"; they share their discoveries and view the lab as a way to incorporate technology into the company, drive experimentation and engage with strategic partners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/marketing-agencies-association-partner-zone/2015/feb/06/creative-technology-stimulate-innovation-marketing "Harnessing creative technology to stimulate innovation"], ''The Guardian''.

Creative technology is best seen as the intersection of new technology with creative initiatives such as fashion, art, advertising, media and entertainment. As such, it is a way to make connections between countries seeking to update their culture; a winter 2015 ''Forbes'' article tells of 30 creative technology startups from the UK making the rounds in Singapore, Kuala Lampur and New York City in an effort to raise funds and make connections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccafannin/2015/02/24/tech-e-trade-route-between-the-uk-and-china-opens-up/ "Tech E-Trade Route Between The UK And China Opens Up"], ''Forbes''.

== Careers ==
Professionals who work in the field of creative technology tend to have a background as developers and may work in digital or entertainment media, with an advertising agency or in a new electronic product development role. In an advertising agency setting, a professional with a job description including creative technology may be a designer who became interested in technology, or a developer who focuses on the bigger picture of experience design. Department heads in creative technology may be charged with integrating new technologies into the agency's departments, leveraging partnerships with cutting edge providers and platforms. For example, the head of creative technology at [[Grey Global Group]] in New York "created an in-house lab... which highlights new tech each month with exhibits, events and workshops."&lt;ref&gt;Noreen O'Leary, [http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/grey-names-head-creative-technology-new-york-160580 "Grey Names a Head of Creative Technology for New York"], ''Adweek'', 6 October 2014.

The creative technologist job title is likely to refer to a developer who understands the creative process and the world of advertising. The person is actually making and coding and may be building web projects, mobile apps and other digital experiences. They are trying out new concepts and ideas, and modifying; this is recognized as similar to the artistic process but applied to media, advertising and other creative industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.creativegroup.com/bid/291889/Hot-Job-of-the-Future-Creative-Technologist "Hot Job of the Future: Creative Technologist"], ''The Creative Group Blog''.

== Academic degree ==
A [[Master's degree|Master]] or [[Bachelor degree]] in creative technologies or creative technology is a broadly [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] course of study combining fields of [[computer technology]], [[design]], [[art]] and the [[humanities]]. Established as a modern degree addressing needs for cross-disciplinary interaction, one of its fundamental objectives is to develop lateral thinking skills across more rigidly defined academic areas recognized as a valuable component in expanding technological horizons. The Creative Technology &amp; Design (CT&amp;D) subject area at [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] offers specialized courses and both credit and non-credit programs. According to FIT's web site, the mission of this [[transdisciplinary]] subject area is to elevate students’ understanding of advanced design concepts, as well as their command of cutting-edge technologies. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitnyc.edu/communication-design/ctd/index.php Creative Technology and Design] Retrieved 2018-10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The Creative Technology 2-year portfolio program at [[Miami Ad School]] description reads, "You are a techie with creative passion and talent – or – a creative with a knack for tech...It's about how we integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence into a creative environment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.miamiadschool.com/advertising-programs/creative-technology What Does a Creative Technologist Do?] Retrieved 2018-03-05&lt;/ref&gt;  Creative Technology is also seen as an industry and skill set for the emerging economy, as in this quote by a [[University of Texas at Austin]] dean at the opening of a new school at the University presumed to become the largest academic unit in the college: "The School of Design and Creative Technologies moves UT Austin more assertively into emerging creative, commercial disciplines that are driving culture and economies in the 21st century".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.utexas.edu/2017/09/07/new-school-of-design-and-creative-technologies-launched New School of Design and Creative Technologies Launched at UT Austin’s College of Fine Arts], ''UT News'', September 27 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2832">{{For|the curriculum program|Design and Technology}}'''Design technology''', or D.T., is the study, design, development, application, implementation, support and management of computer and non-computer based technologies for the express purpose of communicating product design intent and constructability. Design technology can be applied to the problems encountered in construction, operation and maintenance of a product.

At times there is cross-over between D.T. and [[Information Technology]], whereas I.T. is primarily focused on overall network infrastructure, hardware &amp; software requirements, and implementation, D.T. is specifically focused on supporting, maintaining and training design and engineering applications and tools and working closely with I.T. to provide necessary infrastructure, for the most effective use of these applications and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of Information Technology {{!}} North Dakota ITD|url = https://www.nd.gov/itd/about-us/definition-information-technology|website = www.nd.gov|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the building design, construction and maintenance industry (also known as AEC/O/FM), the product is the building and the role of D.T., is the effective application of technologies within all phases and aspects of building process. D.T. processes have adopted Building Information Modeling (BIM) to quicken construction, design and facilities management using technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Our Solutions {{!}} BIM|url = http://www.thomasenterprisesolutions.com/solutions/bim-modeling|website = www.thomasenterprisesolutions.com|access-date = 2016-02-17|first = Thomas Enterprise|last = Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; So though D.T. encompasses [[Building information modeling|BIM]] and Integrated Project Delivery, I.P.D., it is more overarching in its directive and scope and likewise looks for ways to leverage and more effectively utilize C.A.D., Virtual Design &amp; Construction, V.D.C., as well as historical and legacy data and systems.

D.T. is also applicable to industrial and product design and the [[manufacturing]] and [[Metal fabrication|fabrication processes]] therein.

There are formal courses of study in some countries known as [[design and technology]] that focus on particular areas. In this case the above definition still remains valid, if for instance one takes the subject textiles technology and replace product in the above definition with textile.

The DAA platform enables secure authentication of a mobile user whilst simultaneously preserving privacy of the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=451 Research Analyst Report|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-30|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3955296/ovum-report-averon.pdf?hsCtaTracking=21516a12-2112-4331-b738-9cc9ebbd4b19%7C77dd6935-548f-45ff-9b6a-8652e13c284c/|title=Ovum Report: On The Radar |last=Kellet|first=Andrew|date=2018-03-21|website=ovum.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology was developed in stealth from late 2015, first publicly introduced by Averon in 2018, and featured at the 2018 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] as a new technology that combats the increasing threats of cybercrime and consumer account hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crn.com.au/news/10-coolest-smb-products-at-ces-2018-480892?utm_source=desktop&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=share/|title=10 Coolest Products at CES 2018|last=Alspach|first=Kyle|date=2018-01-11|website=CRN|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Overview ==
In contrast to legacy methods of cybersecurity, the DAA platform bypasses end user actions, and rather than focusing on the authentication of a user's device, DAA instead provides autonomous authentication of a user's mobile phone number, since the mobile phone number continues to be associated with the user even when they lose, destroy or upgrade their mobile phone. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.redherring.com/mobile/averon-ceo-wendell-brown-ux-now-crucial-element-cybersecurity/|title=UX Now Crucial Element in Cybersecurity|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2017-11-02|website=redherring.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAA method uses a proprietary mix of technology developed by Averon that works inside the secure mobile network data pipelines together with encrypted technology already within every smartphone. The combination of these autonomous authentication methods has been described by research analysts as a faster, more secure, and stronger method of cybersecurity than traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blockchain and privacy properties ==
Blockchain technology incorporated into the DAA platform ensures the privacy of end users. No identifiable personal data is maintained on the platform, therefore public disclosure of one's authentic identity (such as for the purpose of verified social media interactions) is voluntary. DAA technology affords the end user full control over identity disclosure in any given online interaction, which can be controlled by the end user in varying degrees from fully anonymous to fully identified publicly. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://martechseries.com/mobile/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-invests-in-mobile-identity-start-up-averon/|title=Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Invests in Mobile Identity Startup Averon |last=|first=|date=2018-03-22|website=martechseries.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases involving the need for anonymity with regard to an end user's safety, such as in cases of whistleblowers or political activists, the DAA platform's blockchain technology provides a method for both complete anonymity with the option of voluntary verification of limited but often needed data (such as verifying an anonymous user's general location). Thus DAA technology alleviates the heretofore insurmountable challenge of protecting user privacy with the need for authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use cases ==
The DAA technology platform was designed to be seamlessly adopted for utilization in a wide variety of industries and use cases in which mobile authentication of users is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/ideo-colab/digital-identity-is-broken-but-we-can-fix-it-b15398180bdf/|title=Digital Identity Is Broken, But We Can Fix It|last=Elitzer|first=Dan|date=2017-04-11|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
Since its introduction to the market in 2018, the DAA platform has been recognized by a number of industry groups for its innovation, including winning the Gold prize at the 2018 [[Edison Awards]], a Cybersecurity Excellence Award, and a BIG Innovation 2018 Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edisonawards.com/winners2018.php  |title=Edison Awards 2018 Winners|last=|first=|date=2018-04-17|website=tmcnet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2018/04/17/8737272.htm/|title=Gold Edison Award 2018|last=|first=|date=2018-04-17|website=tmcnet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bintelligence.com/blog/2018/2/7/55-chosen-as-winners-in-annual-big-innovation-awards|title=BIG Innovation Winners 2018|last=|first=|date=2018-02-07|website=bintelligence.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cybersecurity-excellence-awards.com/candidates/averon|title=Cybersecurity Excellence Awards|last=|first=|date=2018-05-03|website=oneworldidentity.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

! style="background:#fff;" | Types of Innovation&lt;ref name=Christensen2003p_xviii&gt;{{Harvnb|Christensen|1997|p=xviii}}. Christensen describes as "revolutionary" innovations as "discontinuous" "sustaining innovations".&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|
;Sustaining: An innovation that does not significantly affect existing markets. It may be either:

:;Evolutionary: An innovation that improves a product in an existing market in ways that customers are expecting (e.g., [[fuel injection]] for gasoline engines, which displaced [[carburetor]]s.)

:;Revolutionary (discontinuous, radical): An innovation that is unexpected, but nevertheless does not affect existing markets (e.g., the first [[automobile]]s in the late 19th century, which were expensive luxury items, and as such very few were sold)

;Disruptive: An innovation that creates a ''new'' market by providing a different set of values, which ultimately (and unexpectedly) overtakes an existing market (e.g., the lower-priced, affordable [[Ford Model T]], which displaced horse-drawn carriages)
|}

In [[business administration|business]], a '''disruptive innovation''' is an [[innovation]] that creates a new [[Market (economics)|market]] and [[value network]] and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network, displacing established market-leading firms, products, and alliances. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ab Rahman |first=Airini |title=Emerging Technologies with Disruptive Effects: A Review |journal=PERINTIS eJournal |date=2017 |volume=7 |issue=2 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Umar_Zakir_Abdul_Hamid/publication/321906585_Emerging_Technologies_with_Disruptive_Effects_A_Review/links/5a38fb87a6fdccdd41ff013d/Emerging-Technologies-with-Disruptive-Effects-A-Review.pdf |display-authors=etal|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was defined and first analyzed by the American scholar [[Clayton M. Christensen]] and his collaborators beginning in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Bower, Joseph L. &amp; Christensen, Clayton M. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called the most influential business idea of the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Bagehot|date=15 June 2017|work=The Economist|page=53|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21723426-labours-leader-has-disrupted-business-politics-jeremy-corbyn-entrepreneur|title=Jeremy Corbyn, Entrepreneur|quote=The most influential business idea of recent years is Clayton Christensen’s theory of disruptive innovation.|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all innovations are disruptive, even if they are revolutionary. For example, the first [[automobile]]s in the late 19th century were not a disruptive innovation, because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s. The market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lower-priced [[Ford Model T]] in 1908.{{sfn|Christensen|2003|p=49}} The ''mass-produced'' automobile was a disruptive innovation, because it changed the transportation market, whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not.

Disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and [[entrepreneur]]s in [[startups]], rather than existing market-leading companies. The business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruptive innovations when they first arise, because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations (which are needed to compete against current competition).&lt;ref name="Christensen1997p47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Christensen|1997|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental or evolutionary forms of innovations, but once it is deployed in the market, it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets.&lt;ref name=Assink&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Assink | first1 = Marnix | year = 2006 | title = Inhibitors of disruptive innovation capability: a conceptual model | url = | journal = European Journal of Innovation Management | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 215–233 | doi=10.1108/14601060610663587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond business and economics disruptive innovations can also be considered to disrupt [[complex system]]s, including economic and business-related aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durantin|first1=Arnaud|last2=Fanmuy|first2=Gauthier|last3=Miet|first3=Ségolène|last4=Pegon|first4=Valérie|title=Disruptive Innovation in Complex Systems|journal=Complex Systems Design &amp; Management|date=1 January 2017|pages=41–56|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-49103-5_4|publisher=Springer, Cham|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and usage of the term==
The term '''disruptive technologies''' was coined by [[Clayton M. Christensen]] and introduced in his 1995 article ''Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave'',&lt;ref&gt;Bower, Joseph L. &amp; Christensen, Clayton M. (1995). However the concept of new technologies leading to wholesale economic change is not a new idea since [[Joseph Schumpeter]] adapted the idea of creative destruction from [[Karl Marx]]. Schumpeter (1949) in one of his examples used "the railroadization of the Middle West as it was initiated by the Illinois Central". He wrote, "The Illinois Central not only meant very good business whilst it was built and whilst new cities were built around it and land was cultivated, but it spelled the death sentence for the [old] agriculture of the West."Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave" ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', January–February 1995&lt;/ref&gt; which he cowrote with Joseph Bower. The article is aimed at management executives who make the funding or purchasing decisions in companies, rather than the research community. He describes the term further in his book ''[[The Innovator's Dilemma]]''.&lt;ref name="Christensen1997"&gt;{{Harvnb|Christensen|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Innovator's Dilemma'' explored the cases of the disk drive industry (which, with its rapid generational change, is to the study of business what fruit flies are to the study of genetics, as Christensen was advised in the 1990s&lt;ref name="Christensen1997p3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Christensen|1997|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the excavating equipment industry (where [[hydraulic machinery|hydraulic actuation]] slowly displaced cable-actuated movement). In his sequel with Michael E. Raynor, ''The Innovator's Solution'',&lt;ref name="Christensen2003"&gt;{{Harvnb|Christensen|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen replaced the term ''disruptive technology'' with ''disruptive innovation'' because he recognized that few technologies are intrinsically disruptive or sustaining in character; rather, it is the ''business model'' that the technology enables that creates the disruptive impact. However, Christensen's evolution from a technological focus to a business-modelling focus is central to understanding the evolution of business at the market or industry level. Christensen and Mark W. Johnson, who cofounded the management consulting firm [[Innosight]], described the dynamics of "business model innovation" in the 2008 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article "Reinventing Your Business Model".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Mark, Christensen, Clayton, et al., 2008, "Reinventing Your Business Model, ''Harvard Business Review'', December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of disruptive technology continues a long tradition of identifying radical technical change in the study of [[innovation]] by economists, and the development of tools for its management at a firm or policy level.

The term “disruptive innovation” is misleading when it is used to refer to a product or service at one fixed point, rather than to the evolution of that product or service over time.

In the late 1990s, the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of "constructive disruptive technology" by working with the consultant David E. O'Ryan, whereby the use of current off-the-shelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called "an unfair advantage". The process or technology change as a whole had to be "constructive" in improving the current method of manufacturing, yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model, resulting in a significant reduction of waste, energy, materials, labor, or legacy costs to the user.

In keeping with the insight that what matters economically is the business model, not the technological sophistication itself, Christensen's theory explains why many disruptive innovations are ''not'' "advanced technologies", which a default hypothesis would lead one to expect. Rather, they are often novel combinations of existing off-the-shelf components, applied cleverly to a small, fledgling value network.

Online news site TechRepublic suggests to end using the term, and similar related terms, being that it is overused jargon as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Conner Forrest, May 1, 2014, 5:52 AM PST, https://www.techrepublic.com/article/startup-jargon-10-terms-to-stop-using/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default, an idea that [[Clayton M. Christensen]] called the "technology mudslide hypothesis". This is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesn't "keep up technologically" with other firms. In this hypothesis, firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing, where it takes constant upward-climbing effort just to stay still, and any break from the effort (such as complacency born of profitability) causes a rapid downhill slide. Christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong; it doesn't model reality. What they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations, but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise, because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations (which are needed to compete against current competition). In Christensen's terms, a firm's existing ''value networks'' place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm. Meanwhile, start-up firms inhabit different value networks, at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network. At that time, the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the [[market share]] attack with a me-too entry, for which survival (not thriving) is the only reward.&lt;ref name="Christensen1997p47"/&gt;

Christensen defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers.
{{quote|Generally, disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward, consisting of off-the-shelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches. They offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there. They offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from, and unimportant to, the mainstream.{{sfn|Christensen|1997|p=15}}}}

Christensen argues that disruptive innovations can hurt successful, well-managed companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development. These companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations, because the markets have very tight [[profit margin]]s and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established (sizable) firm.{{sfn|Christensen|1997|p=i-iii}} Thus, disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common business-world advice to "[[marketing#Customer orientation|focus on the customer]]" (or "stay close to the customer", or "listen to the customer") can be strategically counterproductive.

While Christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful, well-managed companies, O'Ryan countered that "constructive" integration of existing, new, and forward-thinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same well-managed companies, once decision-making management understood the systemic benefits as a whole.

{{Anchor|Technological_disruption_low-end_vs_new-market}}Christensen distinguishes between "low-end disruption", which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market, and "new-market disruption", which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents.{{sfn|Christensen|2003|p=23-45}}

"Low-end disruption" occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance. Therefore, at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments. At this point, a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments, thereby gaining a foothold in the market.

In low-end disruption, the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer, who is happy with a good enough product. This type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality. Once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment, it seeks to improve its profit margin. To get higher profit margins, the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality. To ensure this quality in its product, the disruptor needs to innovate. The incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a not-so-profitable segment, and will move up-market and focus on its more attractive customers. After a number of such encounters, the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving. And then, finally, the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market.

"New market disruption" occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry.

==Disruptive technology==
In 2009, [[Milan Zeleny]] described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted. The answer, according to Zeleny, is the ''support network'' of high technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeleny|first=Milan|title=High Technology and Barriers to Innovation: From Globalization to Localization|journal=[[International Journal of Information Technology &amp; Decision Making]]|volume=11|page=P 441|publisher=World Scientific}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars (network of gas and service stations). Such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners. In the long run, high (disruptive) technology bypasses, upgrades, or replaces the outdated support network.
Questioning the concept of a disruptive technology, Haxell (2012) questions how such technologies get named and framed, pointing out that this is a positioned and retrospective act.&lt;ref&gt;Haxell, A.

Technology, being a form of social relationship,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} always evolves. No technology remains fixed. Technology starts, develops, persists, mutates, stagnates, and declines, just like living [[organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Opening up the innovation process: towards an agenda | last=Oliver | first=Gassmann | journal=R&amp;D Management |date=May 2006  | volume=36 | issue=03 | pages=P 223–366 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9310.2006.00437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology. A new high-technology core emerges and challenges existing [[technology support net]]s (TSNs), which are thus forced to coevolve with it. New versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate TSN, with smaller and smaller high-technology effects. High technology becomes regular technology, with more efficient versions fitting the same support net. Finally, even the efficiency gains diminish, emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes (appearance, style), and technology becomes TSN-preserving appropriate technology. This technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated, resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation; then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated.

Regarding this evolving process of technology, [[Clayton M. Christensen|Christensen]] said:
{{quote|The technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view. They do, however, have two important characteristics: First, they typically present a different package of performance attributes—ones that, at least at the outset, are not valued by existing customers. Second, the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Disruptive Technologies Catching the Wave | journal=Harvard Business Review |date=January 1995  | page=P 3 | first1=Clayton | last1=Christensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6426 Joseph Bower]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HBS Faculty &amp; Research|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6426}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained the process of how disruptive technology, through its requisite support net, dramatically transforms a certain industry.
{{quote|When the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges, established companies typically see it as unattractive: it’s not something their mainstream customers want, and its projected profit margins aren’t sufficient to cover big-company cost structure. As a result, the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of what’s currently popular with the best customers. But then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market. Once the disruptive technology becomes established there, smaller-scale innovation rapidly raise the technology’s performance on attributes that mainstream customers’ value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=9f3ed8e7-4200-4c5d-9d35-c43991bd16ec%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4213&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=bth&amp;AN=6623927 | title=Disruptive Change | journal=Harvard Business Review |date=May 2002  | volume=80 | issue=05 | pages=P 95–101 | first1=Joseph | last1=Bower}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, the automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage; however, it evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable, unchanging TSN. The main high-technology advance in the offing is some form of [[electric car]]—whether the energy source is the sun, hydrogen, water, air pressure, or traditional charging outlet. Electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile. The printing press was a development that changed the way that information was stored, transmitted, and replicated. This allowed empowered authors but it also promoted censorship and information overload in writing technology.

[[Milan Zeleny]] described the above phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Technology and High Technology: Support Net and Barriers to Innovation | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | journal=Advanced Management Systems |date=January 2009  | volume=01 | issue=01 | pages=P 8–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that:
{{quote|Implementing high technology is often resisted. This resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite TSN. The electric car will be resisted by gas-station operators in the same way automated teller machines (ATMs) were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers. Technology does not qualitatively restructure the TSN and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted. Middle management resists [[business process reengineering]] because BPR represents a direct assault on the support net (coordinative hierarchy) they thrive on. Teamwork and multi-functionality is resisted by those whose TSN provides the comfort of narrow specialization and command-driven work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Technology and High Technology: Support Net and Barriers to Innovation | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | journal=Acta Mechanica Slovaca |date=September 2009  | volume=36 | issue=01 | pages=P 6–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social media could be considered a disruptive innovation within sports. More specifically, the way that news in sports circulates nowadays versus the pre-internet era where sports news was mainly on T.V., radio, and newspapers. Social media has created a new market for sports that was not around before in the sense that players and fans have instant access to information related to sports.

==High-technology effects==
[[High technology]] is a technology core that changes the very architecture (structure and organization) of the components of the [[technology support net]]. High technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the TSN's tasks and their relations, as well as their requisite physical, energy, and information flows. It also affects the skills required, the roles played, and the styles of management and coordination—the organizational culture itself.

This kind of technology core is different from regular technology core, which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way, but faster, more reliably, in larger quantities, or more efficiently. It is also different from appropriate technology core, which preserves the TSN itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency, instead of improving the efficiency of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The role of strategic alliances in high-technology new product development | last=Masaaki | first=Kotabe |author2=Scott Swan  | journal=Strategic Management Journal |date=January 2007  | volume=16 | issue=08 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250160804 | pages=621–636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the difference between high technology and low technology, Milan Zeleny once said:
{{quote|The effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself, therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity. High technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost, net present value or return on investment. Only within an unchanging and relatively stable TSN would such direct financial comparability be meaningful. For example, you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter, but not a typewriter with a word processor. Therein lies the management challenge of high technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Milan | last1=Zeleny | title=Knowledge-information autopoietic cycle: towards the wisdom systems | date=2006 | journal=International Journal of Management and Decision Making  | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=P 3–18 | doi=10.1504/IJMDM.2006.008168}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, not all modern technologies are high technologies. They have to be used as such, function as such, and be embedded in their requisite TSNs. They have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge. Not all information technologies have integrative effects. Some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing TSN. The administrative model of management, for instance, further aggravates the division of task and labor, further specializes knowledge, separates management from workers, and concentrates information and knowledge in centers.

As knowledge surpasses capital, labor, and raw materials as the dominant economic resource, technologies are also starting to reflect this shift. Technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks. Nowadays knowledge does not reside in a super-mind, super-book, or super-database, but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action.

==Practical example of disruption==
In the practical world, the popularization of [[personal computers]] illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation. The original centralized concept (one computer, many persons) is a knowledge-defying idea of the prehistory of computing, and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent. The era of personal computing brought powerful computers "on every desk" (one person, one computer). This short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment, but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge. Adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing (one person, many computers). Each person's computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the Internet of other computers, databases, and mainframes, as well as production, distribution, and retailing facilities, and the like. For the first time, technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies. It transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs: at the [[Locus of control|loci]] of the useful knowledge. Even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate, free and empowered individuals do; knowledge, innovation, spontaneity, and self-reliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/views_from_the_front_lines_of_the_data_analytics_revolution | title=Views from the front lines of the data-analytics revolution | publisher=McKinsey Quarterly | last=Brown | first=Brad | date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

&lt;!-- 
PLEASE PROVIDE SOURCES THAT ARGUE THAT THE INNOVATION YOU ARE ADDING IS A DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION. 
To be a disruptive innovation it must have: 
DISRUPTED SOME MARKET BECAUSE NO ONE SAW IT COMING. 
i.e., firms went out of business, there were enormous changes in market share. Otherwise it's just not that disruptive.
People tend to add innovations that are "revolutionary", but not disruptive. See definitions in the introduction of the article.

CRT sets were very heavy, and the size and weight of the tube limited the maximum screen size to about 38 inches; in contrast, LCD and other flat-panel TVs are available in 40", 50", 60" and even bigger sizes, all of which weigh much less than a CRT set.

Continuing advances have overtaken 35&amp;nbsp;mm film and are challenging 70&amp;nbsp;mm film applications.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

| rowspan="3" | Publishing || | [[Computer printer]]s || [[Offset printing]] || Offset printing has a high [[overhead cost]], but very low [[unit cost]] compared to computer printers, and superior quality. But as printers, especially [[laser printer]]s, have improved in speed and quality, they have become increasingly useful for creating documents in limited issues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[Desktop publishing]] || Traditional [[publishing]] || Early desktop-publishing systems could not match high-end professional systems in either features or quality, but their impact was felt immediately as they lowered the cost of entry to the publishing business. By the mid-1990s, DTP had largely replaced traditional tools in most prepress operations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[Word Processing]] || [[Typewriter]] || The typewriter has been replaced with word processing software that has a wealth of functionality to stylize, copy and facilitate document production.
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| rowspan="6" | Transportation || [[Steamboat]]s || [[Sailing ship]]s || The first steamships were deployed on inland waters where sailing ships were less effective, instead of on the higher profit margin seagoing routes. Hence steamships originally only competed in traditional shipping lines' "worst" markets.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[Automobile]]s || [[Rail transport]] || At the beginning of the 20th century, rail (including [[streetcars]]) was the fastest and most cost-efficient means of land transportation for goods and passengers in industrialized countries. The first cars, buses and trucks were used for local transportation in [[suburb]]an areas, where they often replaced streetcars and industrial tracks. As highways expanded, medium- and later long-distance transports were relocated to road traffic, and some railways closed down. As rail traffic has a lower [[ton-kilometer]] cost, but a higher investment and operating cost than road traffic, rail is still preferred for large-scale bulk cargo (such as minerals). However, [[traffic congestion]] provides a bound on the efficiency of car use, and so rail is still used for urban passenger transport.
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[High speed rail]] || Short distance flights || In almost every market where high speed rail with journey times of two hours or less was introduced in competition with an air service, the air service was either greatly reduced within a few years or ceased entirely. Even in markets with longer rail travel times, airlines have reduced the amount of flights on offer and passenger numbers have gone down. Examples include the [[Barcelona-Madrid high speed railway]], the [[Cologne Frankfurt high speed railway]] (where no direct flights are available as of 2016) or the Paris-London connection after the opening of [[High Speed 1]]. For medium-distance trips, like between Beijing &amp; Shanghai, the high speed rail and airlines often end up in extremely stiff competition.
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[Private jet]] || [[Supersonic transport]] || The [[Concorde]] aircraft has so far been the only supersonic airliner in extensive commercial traffic. However, it catered to a small customer segment, which could later afford small private sub-sonic jets. The loss of speed was compensated by flexibility and a more direct routing (i.e. no need to go through a [[airline hub|hub]]). Supersonic flight is also banned above inhabited land, due to [[sonic boom]]s. Concorde service ended in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title= Concorde grounded for good |publisher=''BBC News,'' 10 April 2003 |accessdate=4 May 2012 |date=10 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arduino Duemilanove 2009b.jpg|thumb|A microcontroller development board ([[Arduino]] Duemilanove), which could be used for [[Embedded system|embedded systems development]].]]

'''Electrical/Electronics engineering technology''' ('''EET''') is an [[engineering technology]] field that implements and applies the principles of [[electrical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical Engineering Technology|url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/engtech/disciplines/elecet.htm|work=Engineering Technology Overview|publisher=Sloan Career Cornerstone Center|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like electrical engineering, EET deals with the "design, application, installation, manufacturing, operation or maintenance of electrical/electronic(s) systems."&lt;ref name=Program_Criteria&gt;{{cite web | title=Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Technology Programs, 2012 - 2013  | url =http://www.abet.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation/Accreditation_Process/Accreditation_Documents/Current/tac-criteria-2012-2013.pdf | work=Program Criteria | pages=13–14 | publisher=[[ABET]] | accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, EET is a specialized discipline that has more focus on application, theory, and applied design, and implementation, while electrical engineering may focus more of a generalized emphasis on theory and conceptual design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Engineering vs. Engineering Technology  | url =http://www.abet.org/engineering-vs-engineering-technology/ | work=Curricular Focus | publisher=[[ABET]] | accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical/Electronic engineering technology is the largest branch of engineering technology and includes a diverse range of sub-disciplines, such as applied design, [[electronics]], [[embedded system]]s, [[control system]]s, [[instrumentation]], [[telecommunication]]s, and [[Power engineering|power systems]].

==Education==

===Accreditation===
The [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) is the recognized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programmatic Accrediting Organizations|url=http://www.chea.org/pdf/2010_2011_Directory_of_CHEA_Recognized_Organizations.pdf|work=Directory of CHEA-Recognized Organizations|publisher=[[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; organization for accrediting both undergraduate engineering and engineering technology programs in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is ABET? |work=General Information (ABET) |url=http://www.vanth.org/curriculum/curr_abet.asp#generalinfo |publisher=VaNTH ERC |accessdate=22 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005031742/http://www.vanth.org/curriculum/curr_abet.asp |archivedate=October 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coursework===
EET curricula can vary widely by institution type, degree type, program objective, and expected student outcome. Each year, however, ABET publishes a set of minimum criteria that a given EET program (either associate degree or bachelor's degree) must meet in order to maintain its ABET accreditation. These criteria may be classified as either general criteria, which apply to all ABET accredited programs, or as program criteria, which apply to discipline-specific criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Technology Programs, 2012 - 2013  | url =http://www.abet.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation/Accreditation_Process/Accreditation_Documents/Current/tac-criteria-2012-2013.pdf | work=Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Technology Programs | page=1 | publisher=[[ABET]] | accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Associate degree====

Associate degree programs emphasize the practical field knowledge that is needed to maintain or troubleshoot existing electrical/electronic systems or to build and test new design prototypes.

Discipline-specific program outcomes include the application of circuit analysis and design, analog and digital electronics, computer programming, associated software, and relevant engineering standards

Coursework must be at a minimum [[algebra]] and [[trigonometry]] based.&lt;ref name="Program_Criteria" /&gt;

====Bachelor's degree====

Bachelor’s degree programs emphasize the analysis, design, and implementation of electrical/electronic systems. Some programs may focus on a specific sub-discipline, such as [[control system]]s or [[communications system]]s, while others may take a broader approach, introducing the student to several different sub-disciplines.&lt;ref name="Program_Criteria" /&gt;

Math to [[differential equation]]s is a minimum requirement for ABET accredited bachelor’s level EET degrees. In addition, graduates must demonstrate an understanding of basic project management skills.&lt;ref name="Program_Criteria" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of Commerce]] classifies the bachelor of science in electrical engineering technology (BSEET) as a [[STEM fields|STEM]] undergraduate engineering degree field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Technology Programs, 2012 - 2013  | url =http://www.esa.doc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/documents/stemfinalyjuly14_1.pdf | work=STEM: Good Jobs Now and for the Future | page=2,9 | author=Langdon | publisher=[[U.S. Department of Commerce]] | accessdate=20 May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many states, recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate BSEET degree are qualified to sit-in for the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FE Requirements | url=http://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam/| work= | page= | publisher=NCEES | accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those BSEETs who have already gained at least four years’ post-college experience are qualified to sit-in for the [[Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam|Professional Engineer exam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PE Requirements | url=http://ncees.org/exams/pe-exam/| work= | page= | publisher=NCEES | accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their [[licensure]] in the United States. The importance of the licensing board requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exam Requirements |url=http://www.ncees.org/Licensing_boards.php?boardID=1004&amp;show=examRequirements |work= |page= |publisher=NCEES |accessdate=20 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523093147/http://www.ncees.org/Licensing_boards.php?boardID=1004&amp;show=examRequirements |archivedate=May 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; depend upon location, level of education, required years of experience, and the BSEETs sub-discipline are the passageways for becoming a licensed engineer. The knowledge obtained by a TAC/ABET accredited program is one pathway that may help students prepare for and pass the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam|FE]]/[[Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam|PE]] exam. For example, in the United States and Canada, "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate = 11 July 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp| archivedate = June 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High technology''', often abbreviated to '''high tech''' (adjective forms '''high-technology''', '''high-tech''' or '''hi-tech''') is [[technology]] that is at the [[state of the art|cutting edge]]: the most advanced technology available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cortright|first1=Joseph|last2=Mayer|first2=Heike|title=High Tech Specialization: A Comparison of High Technology Centers|date=January 2001|publisher=Brookings Institution, Center on Urban &amp; Metropolitan Policy|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/specialization.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of high tech is ''[[low technology]]'', referring to simple, often traditional or mechanical technology; for example, a [[slide rule]] is a low-tech calculating device.

The phrase was used in a 1958 ''[[The New York Times]]'' story advocating "[[Nuclear power|atomic energy]]" for Europe: "... Western Europe, with its dense population and its high technology ...."&lt;ref&gt;"Atomic Power for Europe", ''The New York Times'', February 4, 1958, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Metz used the term in a financial column in 1969: "Arthur H. Collins of Collins Radio] controls a score of high technology patents in variety of fields."&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Robert (1969). "Market Place: Collins Versus The Middle Man", ''The New York Times'', April 24, 1969, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 1971 article used the abbreviated form, "high tech."&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Robert (1971). "Market Place: So What Made E.D.S. Plunge?", ''The New York Times'', November 11, 1971, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely-used classification of high-technological manufacturing industries is provided by the [[OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;Hatzichronoglou, Thomas: "Revision of the High-Technology Sector and Product Classification", OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers, No. 1997/02, OECD Publishing, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the intensity of research and development activities used in these industries within OECD coutries, resulting in four distinct categories.

Industrial Technology programs typically include instruction in optimization theory, human factors, organizational behavior, industrial processes, industrial planning procedures, computer applications, and report and presentation preparation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences: Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP). Retrieved on October 26, 2009 from http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/occupationallookup6d.ASP?CIP=15.0612&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ATMAE Membership Venn Diagram. {{cite web |url=http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113190247/http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning and designing manufacturing processes and equipment is a main aspect of being an industrial technologist. An Industrial Technologist is often responsible for implementing certain designs and processes.
== Accreditation and certification ==

The USA based [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE), accredits selected collegiate programs in Industrial Technology in the USA. An instructor or graduate of an Industrial Technology program may choose to become a Certified Technology Manager (CTM) by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering [[Production Planning]] &amp; Control, Safety, Quality, and Management/Supervision.

ATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) for accrediting Industrial Technology programs. CHEA recognizes ATMAE in the U.S. for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in
the United States.(2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf ATMAE Scope of Recognition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231001220/http://chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge base ==

"A career in industrial technology typically entails formal education from an accredited college or university. Opportunities are available to professionals with all levels of education. Those who hold associate degrees typically qualify for entry-level technician and technologist positions, such as in the maintenance and operation of machinery. Bachelor's degree-holders could fill management and engineering positions, such as plant manager, production supervisor and quality systems engineering technologist. A graduate degree in industrial technology could qualify individuals for jobs in research, teaching and upper-level management".&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;

Industrial Technology includes wide-ranging subject matter and could be viewed as an amalgamation of [[industrial engineering]] and business topics with a focus on practicality and management of technical systems with less focus on actual engineering of those systems.

Typical curriculum at a four-year university might include courses on [[manufacturing|manufacturing process]], technology and impact on society, mechanical and electronic systems, [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control|control]], [[materials science]], [[packaging]], [[Operations management|production and operations management]], and manufacturing facility planning and design. In addition, the Industrial Technologist may have exposure to more [[Vocational education|vocational-style education]] in the form of courses on [[CNC]] manufacturing, [[welding]], and other tools-of-the-trade in manufacturing.

== Industrial technologist ==

Industrial technology program graduates obtain a majority of positions which are applied engineering and/or management oriented.  Since "industrial technologist" is not a common job title in the United States, the actual bachelor's degree or associate degree earned by the individual is obscured by the job title he/she receives. Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a bachelor's degree include quality systems engineering technologist, manufacturing engineering technologist, industrial engineering technologist, plant manager, production supervisor, etc.&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Common Industrial Technology Jobs "&gt;{{cite web|title= What Are Some Common Jobs in the Field of Industrial Technology? |url=http://learn.org/articles/What_are_Some_Common_Jobs_in_the_Field_of_Industrial_Technology.html|publisher=utr zfeqaLearn.org|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a two-year associate degree include project technologist, manufacturing technologist, process technologist, etc.&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;

A technologist curriculum may focus or specialize in a certain technical area of study. Examples of this includes [[electronics]], [[manufacturing]], [[construction]], [[graphics]], [[automation]]/[[robotics]], [[CADD]], [[nanotechnology]], [[aviation]], etc.

== Technological development in industry ==

A major subject of study is technological development in industry. This has been defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* the introduction of new tools and techniques for performing given tasks in production, distribution, data processing (etc.);
* the mechanization of the production process, or the achievement of a state of greater autonomy of technical production systems from human control, responsibility, or intervention;
* changes in the nature and level of integration of technical production systems, or enhanced interdependence;
* the development, utilization, and application of new scientific ideas, concepts, and information in production and other processes; and
* enhancement of technical performance capabilities, or increase in the efficiency of tools, equipment, and techniques in performing given tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Lewis F. ''Technological Development in Industry: A Business-Economic Survey and Analysis'', ISR Publications, Manchester UK, revised second edition 2003, page 1. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-29-4}}.  
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Studies in this area often employ a multi-disciplinary research methodology and shade off into the wider analysis of [[business]] and [[economic growth]] (development, performance). The studies are often based on a mixture of industrial field research and desk-based data analysis and aim to be of interest and use to practitioners in business management and investment (etc.) as well as academics. In [[engineering]], [[construction]], [[textiles]], [[food]] and [[drugs]], [[chemicals]] and [[petroleum]], and other industries, the focus has been on not only the nature and factors facilitating and hampering the introduction and utilization of new technologies but also the impact of new technologies on the production organization (etc.) of firms and various social and other wider aspects of the technological development process.&lt;ref&gt;''Technological Development In Industry: A Business-Economic Survey and Analysis'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

How and When Technological development in industry Performed :
#Technological Processes based always on (Material, Equipment, Human skills and operating circumstances.
#So, If any of these parameters changed, we have to re-calibrate this technology to match the designed product.
#This re-calibration can't be considered as a technology change because industrial technology is not more than an Engineering guide to achieve the required specification of the designed product.
#To calibrate any industrial technology, we should make a documented copy of manufacturing experiments until matching the final product specifications based on original technology, new changed parameters and scientific basics.
#Finally, documentation of the new change should be done to the original industrial technology for that new case as a new addition.
#Any application of industrial technology for 1st time or after a long time stop,Technology processes should be tested by a primary samples triers as a Re-calibration process.

'''Low technology''', often abbreviated '''low tech''' (adjective forms '''low-technology''', '''low-tech''', '''lo-tech''') is simple technology, often of a traditional or non-mechanical kind, such as [[crafts]] and [[tool]]s that pre-date the [[Industrial Revolution]]. It is the opposite of [[high technology]].

Low technology can typically be practised or fabricated with a minimum of [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment by an individual or small group of individuals. Also, the knowledge of the practice can be completely comprehended by a single individual, free from increasing [[Departmentalization|specialization]] and [[wikt:compartmentalization|compartmentalization]]. Low-tech techniques and designs may fall into disuse due to changing socio-economic conditions or priorities.

==Examples of low technology==

'''Note:''' almost all of the entries in this section should be prefixed by the word ''traditional''.

* [[weaving]] produced on non-automated looms, and [[basketry]].
* hand [[wood-working]], [[joiner]]y, [[coopering]], and [[carpentry]].
* the trade of the [[shipwright|ship-wright]].
* the trade of the [[Wheelwright|wheel-wright]].
* the trade of the [[wainwright]]: making wagons. (the Latin word for a two-wheeled ''wagon'' is ''carpentum'', the maker of which was a ''carpenter''.)

(''Wright'' is the [[agent form]] of the word ''wrought'', which itself is the original [[past passive participle]] of the word ''work'', now superseded by the [[Light verb|weak verb]] forms ''worker'' and ''worked'' respectively.)

* [[blacksmithing]] and the various related [[smithing]] and metal-crafts.
* [[folk music]] played on [[acoustic instruments]].
* [[mathematics]] (particularly, ''[[pure mathematics]]'')
* [[organic farming]] and [[animal husbandry]] (i.e.; agriculture as practiced by all American farmers prior to World War II).
* [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] in the sense of operating hand-constructed equipment with the intent to either grind grain, or the reduction of timber to lumber as practiced in a [[saw-mill]].
* [[fulling]], [[felt]]ing, [[spindle (textiles)|drop spindle]] spinning, [[hand knitting]], [[crochet]], &amp; similar textile preparation.
* the production of [[charcoal]] by the [[Charcoal maker|collier]], for use in [[home heating]], [[foundry]] operations, [[smelting]], the various [[smithing]] trades, and for brushing ones teeth as in [[Colonial America]].
* [[glass-blowing]].
* various subskills of [[food preservation]]:
** [[Smoking (food)|smoking]]
** [[salting (food)|salting]]
** [[pickling]]
** [[drying (food)|drying]]

'''Note''': [[home canning]] is a counter example of a '''low technology''' since some of the supplies needed to pursue this skill rely on a [[global trade network]] and an existing manufacturing [[infrastructure]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

* the production of various [[alcoholic beverage]]s:
** [[wine]]: poorly preserved fruit juice.
** [[beer]]: a way to preserve the calories of grain products from decay.
** [[whiskey]]: an improved ([[distilled]]) form of beer.
* [[flint-knapping]]
* [[masonry]] as used in [[castles]], [[cathedrals]], and [[root cellar]]s.

==Legal status of low-technology==
{{See also|Handicraft|Organic food|Natural foods}}
By federal law in the United States, only those articles produced with little or no use of machinery or tools with complex mechanisms may be stamped with the designation "hand-wrought" or "hand-made". Lengthy court-battles are currently underway over the precise definition of the terms "organic" and "natural" as applied to [[foodstuff]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Groups associated with low-technology==
* [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], popularized by [[Gustav Stickley]] in America around 1900.
* [[Bauhaus]] movement of Germany around the same time.
* [[Do-It-Yourself]] phenomenon arising in America following [[World War II]].
* [[Back-to-the-land movement]] beginning in America during the 1960s.
* [[Luddites]], whose activities date to the very beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]].
* Living history and [[open-air museum]]s around the world, which strive to recreate bygone societies.
* [[Simple living]] adherents, such as the [[Amish]] and to a lesser extent some sects of the [[Mennonites]], who specifically refuse some newer technologies to avoid undesirable effects on themselves or their societies.
* [[Survivalists]] are often proponents,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} since low-technology is inherently more [[:wikt:robust|robust]] than its [[high-technology]] counterpart.

'''Marine technology''' is defined by [[WEGEMT]] (a [[Europe]]an association of 40 universities in 17 countries) as "[[technologies]] for the safe use, exploitation, protection of, and intervention in, the [[marine environment]]."  In this regard, according to WEGEMT, the technologies involved in marine technology are the following:&lt;ref name="Wegemnt"&gt;[http://www.wegemt.org.uk/home/technology.htm Marine Technology A Definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324141245/http://www.wegemt.org.uk/home/technology.htm |date=2012-03-24 }}, wegemt.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; [[naval architecture]], [[Marine propulsion|marine engineering]], [[ship design]], [[ship building]] and ship operations; oil and gas exploration, exploitation, and production; [[hydrodynamics]], [[navigation]], [[sea surface]] and sub-surface support, [[underwater]] technology and engineering; marine resources (including both renewable and non-renewable marine resources); [[transport]] [[logistics]] and [[economics]]; inland, coastal, short sea and deep sea [[shipping]]; [[Environmental protection|protection]] of the marine environment; [[leisure]] and [[safety]].&lt;ref name=Wegemnt/&gt;

==Education and training==
According to the [[Cape Fear Community College]] of [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], the [[curriculum]] for a marine technology program provides practical skills and academic background that are essential in succeeding in the area of marine scientific support. Through a marine technology program, students aspiring to become  '''marine technologists''' will become proficient in the knowledge and skills required of scientific support technicians.  

The educational preparation includes classroom instructions and practical training aboard ships, such as how to use and maintain electronic navigation devices, physical and chemical measuring instruments, sampling devices, and data acquisition and reduction systems aboard ocean-going and smaller vessels, among other advanced equipment.&lt;ref name="CFCC"&gt;[http://cfcc.edu/martech/ MARINE TECHNOLOGY], cfcc.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as marine technician programs are concerned, students learn hands-on to trouble shoot, service and repair four- and two-stroke outboards, stern drive, rigging, fuel &amp; lube systems, electrical including diesel engines.&lt;ref name="marinetech"&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.com/florida/universal-technical-institute-orlando Marine Technician Training]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to commerce==
Marine technology is related to the '''marine science and technology industry''', also known as '''maritime commerce'''.  The Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development (EOHED) of the government of [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States]] defined [[marine science]] and technology industry as any business that deals primarily with or relates to the [[sea]].  A '''marine science industry''' includes businesses and technologies, research facilities, and higher education learning institutions.  Companies and businesses involved in marine science and [[marine industry|industry]] produce products such as [[rope]]s used for [[commercial fishing]], undersea [[robotics]], and stabilized [[sensor]] systems.  The marine science industry has five sub-sectors, namely marine instrumentation and equipment, marine services, marine research and education, marine materials and supply, and shipbuilding and design.&lt;ref name=Massgov&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=ehedterminal&amp;L=3&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Economic+Analysis&amp;L2=Key+Industries&amp;sid=Ehed&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=mobd_key_industries_maritime_comm_ind&amp;csid=Ehed Maritime Commerce], mass.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microtechnology''' is [[technology]] with features near one [[micrometre]] (one millionth of a metre, or 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; metre, or 1μm).

Around 1970, scientists learned that by arraying large numbers of [[microscopic]] [[transistor]]s on a single chip, microelectronic circuits could be built that dramatically improved performance, functionality, and reliability, all while reducing cost and increasing volume. This development led to the [[Information Revolution]].

More recently, scientists have learned that not only [[electrical]] devices, but also mechanical devices, may be [[miniaturized]] and batch-fabricated, promising the same benefits to the mechanical world as [[integrated circuit]] technology has given to the electrical world. While electronics now provide the ‘brains’ for today’s advanced systems and products, micro-mechanical devices can provide the [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s — the eyes and ears, hands and feet — which interface to the outside world.

Today, micromechanical devices are the key components in a wide range of products such as automobile [[airbag]]s, ink-jet printers, [[Blood pressure|blood pressure monitor]]s, and projection display systems. It seems clear that in the not-too-distant future these devices will be as pervasive as electronics.

==Micro electromechanical systems==
[[Image:etchedwafer.jpg|thumb|An etched silicon wafer]]
The term [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]], for Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, was coined in the 1980s to describe new, sophisticated mechanical systems on a chip, such as micro electric motors, resonators, gears, and so on. Today, the term MEMS in practice is used to refer to any microscopic device with a mechanical function, which can be fabricated in a batch process (for example, an array of microscopic gears fabricated on a microchip would be considered a MEMS device but a tiny laser-machined stent or watch component would not). In Europe, the term MST for Micro System Technology is preferred, and in Japan MEMS are simply referred to as "micromachines". The distinctions in these terms are relatively minor and are often used interchangeably. 

Though MEMS processes are generally classified into a number of categories – such as surface [[machining]], bulk machining, [[LIGA]], and [[Electrochemical fabrication|EFAB]] – there are indeed thousands of different MEMS processes. Some produce fairly simple geometries, while others offer more complex 3-D geometries and more versatility.   A company making [[accelerometer]]s for [[airbag]]s would need a completely different design and process to produce an accelerometer for inertial navigation. Changing from an accelerometer to another inertial device such as a [[gyroscope]] requires an even greater change in design and process, and most likely a completely different [[fabrication (metal)|fabrication]] facility and engineering team.

MEMS technology has generated a tremendous amount of excitement, due to the vast range of important applications where MEMS can offer previously unattainable performance and reliability standards. In an age where everything must be smaller, faster, and cheaper, MEMS offers a compelling solution. MEMS have already had a profound impact on certain applications such as automotive sensors and inkjet printers. The emerging MEMS industry is already a multibillion-dollar market. It is expected to grow rapidly and become one of the major industries of the 21st century. [[Cahners In-Stat Group]] has projected sales of MEMS to reach $12B by 2005. The European NEXUS group projects even larger revenues, using a more inclusive definition of MEMS.

Microtechnology is often constructed using [[photolithography]].  Lightwaves are focused through a mask onto a surface.  They solidify a chemical film.  The soft, unexposed parts of the film are washed away.  Then [[acid]] etches away the material not protected.

Microtechnology's most famous success is the [[integrated circuit]].  It has also been used to construct [[micromachinery]].

'''Multimodal anthropology''' is an emerging subfield of social [[cultural anthropology]] that encompasses anthropological research and knowledge production across multiple traditional and new media platforms and practices including [[film]], [[video]], [[photography]], theatre, design, [[podcast]], mobile apps, interactive games, web-based social networking, immersive [[360-degree video|360 video]] and [[augmented reality]]. As characterized in [[American Anthropologist]]'','' multimodal anthropology is an "anthropology that works across multiple media, but one that also engages in public anthropology and collaborative anthropology through a field of differentially linked media platforms" (Collins, Durington &amp; Gill).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Samuel Gerald|last2=Durington|first2=Matthew|last3=Gill|first3=Harjant|date=2017-01-12|title=Multimodality: An Invitation|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=119|issue=1|pages=142–146|doi=10.1111/aman.12826|issn=0002-7294}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multimodal approach also encourages [[anthropologist]] to reconsider the ways in which they conduct their research, to pay close attention to the role various media technologies and digital devices plays in the lives of their interlocutors, and how they these technologies redefine what fieldwork looks like.

== History and background ==
Multimodal anthropology is not a new concept. It has been a fundamental part of anthropological research and [[Field research|fieldwork]] from the early days of the disciple. Anthropologists have been experimenting with different forms media technologies throughout the [[20th century|twentieth century]] whenever confronted with the limitation of text-based ethnography. Multimodal is a term that has readily been used since the 1970s in varied disciplines as [[psychotherapy]], [[phonetics]], [[genetics]], [[literature]] and [[medicine]] to characterize different approaches to carrying out scientific research that involves to a certain degree, thinking outside of the box. In the early 1990s, semioticians used the terms to discuss different forms of communication across different media, eventually including digital media.

Technological advances in the later part of the twentieth century, the accessibility to [[photography]], [[film]] cameras and audio recorders led to the emergence of [[visual anthropology]] as a sub discipline dedicated to the study and production of ethnographic photography, film and media. Building in this legacy, multimodal anthropology seeks to expand the boundaries of visual anthropology to incorporate emerging technologies of [[21st century|twenty-first century]] including mobile networking, [[social media]], [[Geotagging|geo-mapping]], [[virtual reality]], [[Podcast|podcasting]], [[interactive design]], along with other traditional forms of learning and knowledge production like art and drawing that were often sidelined within [[visual anthropology]], such as interactive gaming, theatre, performance, graphic novels, ethnofiction and experimental ethnography. As Samuel Collins, Matthew Durington and [[Harjant Gill]] note in their introductory essay on title "Multimodality: An Invitation," published in [[American Anthropologist]], "multimodal anthropologies does not attempt – or desire – to supplant visual anthropology. Rather it seeks to include traditional forms of [[visual anthropology]] while simultaneously broadening the purview of the discipline to engage in variety of media forms that exist today."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Open-source appropriate technology''' ('''OSAT''') is [[appropriate technology]] developed through the principles of the [[open-design movement]]. OSAT refers to, on the one hand, technology designed with special consideration to the environmental, ethical, cultural, social, political, and economic aspects of the community it is intended for. On the other hand, OSAT is developed in the open and licensed in such a way as to allow their designs to be used, modified and distributed freely.&lt;ref name="Pearce" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J. M. (2014). Free and open source appropriate technology. in ''The Routledge Companion to Alternative Organization'', 308. {{ISBN|9780415782265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Open source is a development method for [[appropriate technology]] that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process. [[appropedia:|Appropedia]] is an example of open-source appropriate technology. There anyone can both learn how to make and use AT free of concerns about patents. At the same time anyone can also add to the collective open-source knowledge base by contributing ideas, observations, experimental data, deployment logs, etc. It has been claimed that the potential for open-source-appropriate technology to drive [[applied sustainability]] is enormous.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt; The built in continuous [[peer-review]] can result in better quality, higher reliability, and more flexibility than conventional design/patenting of technologies. The free nature of the knowledge also obviously provides lower costs, particularly for those technologies that do not benefit to a large degree from scale of manufacture. Finally, OSAT also enables the end to predatory intellectual property lock-in. This is particularly important in the context of technology focused on relieving suffering and saving lives in the [[developing world]].

The "open-source" model can act as a driver of [[sustainable development]]. Reasons include:

* It enables localization for communities that do not have the resources to tempt commercial developers to provide local versions of their products. It thus minimizes the need to ship materials over long distances and organizes material activities accordingly;&lt;ref name="hbr.org"&gt;Kostakis, Vasilis. Roos, Andreas. [https://hbr.org/2018/06/new-technologies-wont-reduce-scarcity-but-heres-something-that-might New Technologies Won’t Reduce Scarcity, but Here’s Something That Might]. ''Harvard Business Review'', 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Local manufacturing also makes maintenance easier and also encourages manufacturers to design products to last as long as possible;&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;
* It can be free as in "gratis" as well as free as in "libre", an important consideration for developing communities.&lt;ref&gt;

Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/9013667/Innovation_Through_Collaboration_Scaling_up_Technological_Solutions_for_Sustainable_Development Innovation Through Collaboration: Scaling up Technological Solutions for Sustainable Development], ''Environment, Development and Sustainability'' 16(6): 1299-1316 (2014). {{doi|10.1007/s10668-014-9528-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the lateral scaling concepts of [[Jeremy Rifkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy. The zero marginal cost society: The internet of things, the collaborative commons, and the eclipse of capitalism. Macmillan, 2014. {{ISBN|978-1137278463}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus optimizes the sharing of knowledge and design as there are no patent costs to pay for.&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;

== Ethical considerations ==

For solutions, many researchers, companies, and academics do work on products meant to assist [[sustainable development]]. [[Vinay Gupta]] has suggested that those developers agree to three principles:&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;

# I will not permit any human being to be deprived of life-giving technology by the profit motive.
# Any works that I patent I will make available to others who are engaged in humanitarian activity for free, except where this would breach other contractual responsibilities.
# I will not use patent law to slow the pace of innovation or service delivery to the needy under any circumstances.

The ethics of information sharing in this context has been explored in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, P. (2014). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/73133/1/Phillipa_Shea_Thesis.pdf Community arts and appropriate internet technology: participation, materiality, and the ethics of sustainability in the digitally networked era].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, C. M. (2014). [http://www.ejisdc.org/Ojs2/index.php/ejisdc/article/viewFile/1233/510 Exploring information ethics for inclusive open development]. The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support in the literature ==

* It has been investigated how open sharing of designs, specifications, and technical information can enhance effectiveness, widespread use, and innovation of appropriate technology.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt;
* OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="Zelenika" /&gt;
* OSAT has been claimed to assist in development of medical technology particularly for the developing world.&lt;ref name="Kapczynski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sali" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, S.R. and Barry, M., 2011. Health technologies and innovation in the global health arena. New England Journal of Medicine, 365(9), pp.779-782.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been claimed that the sharing of design processes, appropriate tools, and technical information enables more effective and rapid development of appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized regions.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt; In addition, it is claimed that this sharing will require the appropriate-technology community to adopt open standards/licenses, document knowledge, and build on previous work.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt;
* OSAT can be used to generate [[renewable energy]]&lt;ref&gt;Louie H. Experiences in the construction of open source low technology off-grid wind turbines. In2011 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting 2011 Jul 24 (pp. 1-7). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;
* OSAT in [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]&lt;ref&gt;Pscheidt, M. and van der Weide, T.P., 2010. Bridging the Digital Divide by Open Source: A Theoretical Model of Best Practice.&lt;/ref&gt;
* OSAT and [[peer production]]&lt;ref&gt;Rocco, G.R., 2015. Developing Maker Economies in Post-Industrial Cities: Applying Commons Based Peer Production to Mycelium Biomaterials.http://scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/257/&lt;/ref&gt;

== In education ==

* At the university level, the use of open-source-appropriate technology classroom projects has been shown to be successful in forging  the connection between physics and social benefit:&lt;ref name="Pearce-2" /&gt;  This approach has the potential to use university students' access to resources and testing equipment in furthering the development of appropriate technology. Similarly OSAT has been used as a tool for improving [[service learning]].&lt;ref name="Pearce-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saleh" /&gt; [[MIT]] has completed a study looking at the usefulness of using [[appropriate technology]] education and its relation to OSAT.&lt;ref name="Grue" /&gt;
* It has been proposed that the evolution of the open-source [[3D printer]]s can enable a new method of development for OSAT&lt;ref name="Villumsen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Zovko" /&gt;

==Open source scientific equipment==
* [[Open source hardware]] for science can also be considered OSAT. Hundreds of scientific tools have already been developed and shared. Recently (2014) [[Open Source Lab (book)|open source labs]] have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Pearce, [[Open Source Lab (book)|Open-Source Lab: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs]], Elsevier, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Appropriate technology is designed to promote [[Decentralization|decentralized]], [[labor-intensive]], [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] and [[environmentally sound]] businesses.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll Pursell says that the movement declined from 1965 to 1985, due to an inability to counter advocates of agribusiness, large private utilities, and multinational construction companies.&lt;ref name="Pursell" /&gt; Recently (2011), several barriers to OSAT deployment have been identified:&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Pearce" /&gt;
* AT seen as inferior or "poor person's" technology
* Technical transferability and robustness of AT
* Insufficient funding
* Weak institutional support
* The challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3081">[[File:Kodak DCS315 DSLR Camera Teardown.jpg|thumb|A teardown of a [[Kodak DCS 300 series|Kodak DCS315]] DSLR camera]]
A '''product teardown''', or simply '''teardown''', is the act of disassembling a product, such that it helps to identify its component parts, chip &amp; system functionality, and component costing information. For products having 'secret' technology, such as the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25]], the process may be secret. For others, including [[consumer electronics]], the results are typically disseminated through photographs and component lists so that others can make use of the information without having to disassemble the product themselves. This information is important to designers of semiconductors, displays, batteries, packaging companies, integrated design firms, and semiconductor fabs, and the systems they operate within.

This information can be of interest to hobbyists, but can also be used commercially by the technical community to find out, for example, what semiconductor components are being utilized in consumer electronic products, such as the [[Wii]] video game console or [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]]. Such knowledge can aid understanding of how the product works, including innovative design features, and can facilitate estimating the [[bill of materials]] (BOM). The financial community therefore has an interest in teardowns, as knowing how a company's products are built can help guide a stock valuation. Manufacturers are often not allowed to announce what components are present in a product due to [[non-disclosure agreement]]s (NDA). Teardowns can also play a part in evidence of use in court and litigation proceedings where a companies parts may have been used without their permission, counterfeited, or to show where intellectual property or patents might be infringed by another firms part or system.

Identifying semiconductor components in systems has become more difficult over the past years. The most notable change started with Apple's 8GB iPod nano,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/design/audio-design/4016200/Tear-Down-Inside-the-Apple-8GB-iPod-nano|title=Tear Down: Inside the Apple 8GB iPod nano|last=Quirk|first=Gregory A.|date=2006-10-08|website=EE Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061110191819/http://www.wolfsonmicro.com/products/WM8750/ CODECs &amp;#x7C; WM8750 &amp;#x7C; Wolfson Microelectronics]&lt;/ref&gt; which were repackaged with Apple branding. This makes it more difficult to identify the actual device manufacturer and function of the component without performing a 'decap' – removing the outer packaging to analyze the [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] within it. Typically there are markings on the die inside the package that can lead experienced engineers to see who actually created the device and what functionality it performs in the system.

'''Technology''' ("science of craft", from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|τέχνη}}, ''techne'', "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]''&lt;ref name="Liddell 1980"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Greek-English Lexicon (Abridged Edition)|first=Henry George|last2=Scott|first2=Robert|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1980|isbn=978-0199102075|location=United Kingdom|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Liddell|title-link=A Greek-English Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the collection of [[Art techniques and materials|techniques]], [[skill]]s, [[wikt:method|methods]], and [[Business process|processes]] used in the production of [[Good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as [[scientific investigation]]. Technology can be the [[knowledge]] of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in [[machines]] to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.

The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic [[tool]]s. The [[prehistory|prehistoric]] discovery of [[Control of fire by early humans|how to control fire]] and the later [[Neolithic Revolution]] increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the [[wheel]] helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the [[printing press]], the [[telephone]], and the [[Internet]], have lessened physical barriers to [[communication]] and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.

Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced [[economy|economies]] (including today's [[economic globalization|global economy]]) and has allowed the rise of a [[Conspicuous leisure|leisure class]]. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as [[pollution]] and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's [[natural environment|environment]]. Innovations have always influenced the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of a society and raised new questions of the [[ethics of technology]].  Examples include the rise of the notion of [[efficiency]] in terms of human [[productivity]], and the challenges of [[bioethics]].

Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the [[human condition]] or worsens it. [[Neo-Luddism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], and similar [[reactionary]] movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the [[human condition]].

== Definition and usage ==
[[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The spread of paper and printing to the West, as in this [[printing press]], helped [[scientist]]s and [[politician]]s communicate their ideas easily, leading to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]; an example of technology as cultural force.]]
The use of the term "technology" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the [[useful arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Universal Technological Dictionary, or Familiar Explanation of the Terms Used in All Arts and Sciences|last=Crabb|first=George|publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|year=1823|isbn=|location=London|page=524|quote=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to allude to technical education, as in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (chartered in 1861).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind and Hand: The Birth of MIT|last=Mannix|first=Loretta H.|last2=Stratton|first2=Julius Adams|publisher=MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0262195249|location=Cambridge|pages=190–92|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "technology" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with [[Thorstein Veblen]], translated ideas from the German concept of ''[[:de:Technik|Technik]]'' into "technology." In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between ''technik'' and ''technologie'' that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as "technology." By the 1930s, "technology" referred not only to the study of the [[industrial arts]] but to the industrial arts themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Technik Comes to America: Changing Meanings of Technology Before 1930|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that "technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Technology and State Government|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=2|issue=6|page=860|doi=10.2307/2084365|jstor=2084365|year=1937|last1=Bain|first1=Read}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists.  Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as [[applied science]], rather than as the things that people make and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Shaping of Technology|last=MacKenzie|first=Donald A.|last2=Wajcman|first2=Judy|publisher=Open University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0335199136|edition=2nd|location=Buckingham|pages=|chapter=Introductory Essay|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of "technique" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s work on [[technologies of the self]] (''techniques de soi'').

Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The ''[[Merriam-Webster's Advanced Learner's English Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary]]'' offers a definition of the term: "the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems" and "a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technology|title=Technology {{!}} Definition of Technology by Merriam-Webster|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Merriam-Webster|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ursula Franklin]], in her 1989 "Real World of Technology" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is "practice, the way we do things around here."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Real World of Technology|last=Franklin|first=Ursula|publisher=House of Anansi|year=1999|isbn=978-0887848919|edition=revised|location=Scarborough|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to [[high technology]] or just [[consumer electronics]], rather than technology as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology|title=Technology|last=|first=|date=|work=BBC News|access-date=7 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Stiegler]], in ''[[Technics and Time, 1]]'', defines technology in two ways: as "the pursuit of life by means other than life," and as "organized inorganic matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus | year=1998 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] | isbn=978-0804730419 | pages=17, 82|title-link=Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus }} Stiegler has more recently stated that [[biotechnology]] can no longer be defined as "organized inorganic matter," given that it is, rather, "the reorganization of the organic." {{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=L'avenir du passé: Modernité de l'archéologie | year=2008 |publisher=La Découverte | isbn=978-2707154958 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] or wooden [[spoon]], or more complex machines, such as a [[space station]] or [[particle accelerator]]. Tools and machines need not be material; {{anchor|Virtual technology}}virtual technology, such as [[computer software]] and [[business method]]s, fall under this definition of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c6/c6s5.htm|title=Industry, Technology and the Global Marketplace: International Patenting Trends in Two New Technology Areas|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/5902/20150818090057/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c6/c6s5.htm|archive-date=18 August 2005|dead-url=yes|website=Science and Engineering Indicators 2002|accessdate=7 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Brian Arthur]] defines technology in a similarly broad way as "a means to fulfill a human purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arthur |first=W. Brian |date=2009 |title=The Nature of Technology |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |page=28 |isbn=978-1416544050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "technology" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as "medical technology" or "space technology," it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. "[[State-of-the-art]] technology" refers to the [[high technology]] available to humanity in any field.

[[File:C4004 (Intel).jpg|thumb|right|The invention of integrated circuits and the [[microprocessor]] (here, an [[Intel 4004]] chip from 1971) led to the modern [[computer revolution]].]]
Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Borgmann | first=Albert | authorlink=Albert Borgmann | year=2006 | title=Technology as a Cultural Force: For Alena and Griffin | journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=351–60 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/canadian_journal_of_sociology/v031/31.3borgmann.html | format=fee required | accessdate=16 February 2007 | doi=10.1353/cjs.2006.0050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of [[communication]] technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of [[cyberculture]] has at its basis the development of the [[Internet]] and the [[computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://macek.czechian.net/defining_cyberculture.htm | title=Defining Cyberculture | accessdate=25 May 2007 | author=Macek, Jakub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate [[political oppression]] and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both [[science]] and [[engineering]], each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.

==Science, engineering and technology==
[[File:Zoom lunette ardente.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light]]
The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. [[Science]] is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/science|title=Science|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Dictionary.com|publisher=|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as [[utility]], [[usability]], and [[safety]].{{Citation needed|reason=This implies that some technologies are not product of science if they have utility, that seems wrong|date=August 2017}}

Engineering is the [[goal-oriented]] process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, [[mathematics|mathematical]], [[language|linguistic]], and [[history|historical]] knowledge, to achieve some practical result.

Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of [[electron]]s in [[electrical conductor]]s by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as [[semiconductor]]s, [[computer]]s, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ |title=Intute: Science, Engineering and Technology |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Intute]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217141847/http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ |archive-date=17 February 2007 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=17 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of [[World War II]], for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply "applied science" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s treatise on postwar science policy, ''Science – The Endless Frontier'': "New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature&amp;nbsp;... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm#summary|title=Science the Endless Frontier|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|date=July 1945|website=|publisher=National Science Foundation|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wise|first=George|year=1985|title=Science and Technology|journal=Osiris (2nd Series)|volume=1|pages=229–46|doi=10.1086/368647|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Between Politics and Science: Assuring the Integrity and Productivity of Research|last=Guston|first=David H.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0521653183|location=New York|pages=|quote=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Outline of prehistoric technology}}

The use of tools by [[Homo (genus)|early humans]] was partly a process of discovery and of evolution. Early humans evolved from a [[Australopithecus afarensis|species]] of [[foraging]] [[hominids]] which were already [[bipedal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=17 May 2008|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/prehistoric_life/human/human_evolution/mother_of_man1.shtml|title=Mother of man&amp;nbsp;– 3.2 million years ago |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=212317|title=Human Evolution|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|accessdate=17 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423204038/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=212317|archivedate=23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history. Approximately 50,000 years ago, the use of tools and [[behavioral modernity|complex set of behaviors]] emerged, believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/15/science/early-voices-the-leap-to-language.html|title=Early Voices: The Leap to Language|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|date=15 July 2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=7 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clovis Point.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[Clovis point]], made via [[pressure flaking]]]]

Hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago. The earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock, but approximately 75,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/10/stone-tool-sharpening/|title=Stone Agers Sharpened Skills 55,000 Years Earlier Than Thought|last=Bower|first=Bruce|date=29 October 2010|work=WIRED|access-date=7 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pressure flaking]] provided a way to make much finer work.

====Clothing and shelter====
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were [[clothing]] and shelter; the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly, but they were a key to humanity's progress. As the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate; as early as 380 ka, humans were constructing temporary wood huts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/homo2/mod_homo_3.htm | title=Evolution of Modern Humans: Archaic Homo sapiens Culture | accessdate=31 March 2007 | author=O'Neil, Dennis | publisher=[[Palomar College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Villa | first=Paola | year=1983 | title=Terra Amata and the Middle Pleistocene archaeological record of southern France| publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] | isbn= 978-0520096622 |page= 303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals, helped humanity expand into colder regions; humans began to [[Historical migration|migrate]]

=== Neolithic through classical antiquity (10 ka&amp;nbsp;– 300 CE) ===
[[File:Néolithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools]]

Human's technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the [[Neolithic]] Period ("New Stone Age"). The invention of polished [[stone axe]]s was a major advance that allowed [[deforestation|forest clearance]] on a large scale to create farms. This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic, but were originally used in the preceding [[Mesolithic]] in some areas such as [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driscoll|first1=Killian|title=The early prehistory in the west of Ireland: Investigations into the social archaeology of the Mesolithic, west of the Shannon, Ireland|date=2006|url=http://lithicsireland.ie/mlitt_mesolithic_west_ireland_chap_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agriculture]] fed larger populations, and the transition to [[sedentism]] allowed simultaneously raising more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried, as [[nomad]]ic ones must. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the [[hunter-gatherer]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060103114116.htm|title=The First Baby Boom: Skeletal Evidence Shows Abrupt Worldwide Increase In Birth Rate During Neolithic Period|last=University of Chicago Press Journals|first=|date=4 January 2006|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=7 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child Transport, Family Size, and Increase in Human Population During the Neolithic|journal=[[Current Anthropology]]|author=Sussman, Robert W. |author2=Hall, Roberta L. |volume=13|issue=2| pages=258–67|date=April 1972|doi=10.1086/201274 |jstor=2740977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in [[labor specialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=17 May 2008|url=https://books.google.com/?id=isGyuX9motEC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=labor+neolithic+population|title=Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]]|author=Ferraro, Gary P.|year=2006|isbn=978-0495030393}}&lt;/ref&gt; What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities, such as [[Uruk]], and the first civilizations, such as [[Sumer]], is not specifically known; however, the emergence of increasingly [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] social structures and specialized labor, of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures, and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as [[irrigation]], are all thought to have played a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8pKKwlEcpwYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=labor+surplus+neolithic+population|accessdate=17 May 2008|title=The ESSENTIALS of Ancient History|publisher=Research &amp; Education Association|author=Patterson, Gordon M.|year=1992|isbn=978-0878917044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metal tools====

====Energy and transport====
[[File:Wheel Iran.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[wheel]] was invented circa 4000 BCE.]]
{{Main article|History of transport}}
Meanwhile, humans were learning to harness other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the [[sailing ship]]; the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to the 8th millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The oldest representation of a Nile boat|journal=Antiquity|volume=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; From prehistoric times, Egyptians probably used the power of the annual [[flooding of the Nile]] to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and "catch" basins. The ancient [[Sumer]]ians in [[Mesopotamia]] used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Harriet|date=2013|title=The Sumerian World|location=New York City, New York and London, England|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0203096604|pages=34–43|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qSOYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=Sumerian+irrigation#v=onepage&amp;q=Sumerian%20irrigation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to archaeologists, the [[wheel]] was invented around 4000 BCE probably independently and nearly simultaneously in Mesopotamia (in present-day [[Iraq]]), the Northern Caucasus ([[Maykop culture]]) and Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East|last=Potts|first=D.T.|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|page=285|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 BCE with most experts putting it closer to 4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Light on the Most Ancient East|last=Childe|first=V.

The invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war. It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads.

=== Medieval and modern history (300 CE&amp;nbsp;– present) ===
{{Main article|Medieval technology|Renaissance technology|Industrial Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution|Information Technology|Productivity improving technologies (economic history)}}

Innovations continued through the [[Middle Ages]] with innovations such as [[silk]], the [[horse collar]] and [[horseshoe]]s in the first few hundred years after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Medieval technology]] saw the use of [[simple machine]]s (such as the [[lever]], the [[screw]], and the [[pulley]]) being combined to form more complicated tools, such as the [[wheelbarrow]], [[windmill]]s and [[clock]]s. The [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance]] brought forth many of these innovations, including the [[printing press]] (which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge), and technology became increasingly associated with [[science]], beginning a cycle of mutual advancement. The advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food, followed by the wider availability of consumer goods.

[[File:Late model Ford Model T.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|The [[automobile]] revolutionized personal transportation.]]
Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the [[Industrial Revolution]] was a period of great technological discovery, particularly in the areas of [[British Agricultural Revolution|agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], [[metallurgy]], and [[transport]], driven by the discovery of [[steam power]]. Technology took another step in a [[second industrial revolution]] with the harnessing of [[electricity]] to create such innovations as the [[electric motor]], [[light bulb]], and countless others. Scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for [[flight|powered flight]] and advancements in [[medicine]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]]. The rise in technology has led to [[skyscraper]]s and broad [[urban area]]s whose inhabitants rely on [[motor]]s to transport them and their food supply. Communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the [[telegraph]], [[telephone]], [[radio]] and [[television]]. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the [[airplane]] and [[automobile]].

[[File:USAF F-16A F-15C F-15E Desert Storm edit2.jpg|thumb|[[F-15]] and [[F-16]] flying over [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] during the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.]]
The 20th century brought a host of innovations. In [[physics]], the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] has led to both [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear power]]. [[Computers]] were also invented and later [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] utilizing [[transistor]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Information technology]] subsequently led to the creation of the [[Internet]], which ushered in the current [[Information Age]]. Humans have also been able to [[space exploration|explore space]] with [[satellite]]s (later used for [[telecommunication]]) and in manned missions going all the way to the moon. In medicine, this era brought innovations such as [[Cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]] and later [[stem cell treatments|stem cell therapy]] along with new [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]] and treatments.

Complex [[manufacturing]] and [[construction]] techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies, and entire [[industry|industries]] have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education&amp;nbsp;– their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them, including [[engineering]], [[medicine]], and [[computer science]], and other fields have been made more complex, such as [[construction]], [[transportation]], and [[architecture]].

==Philosophy==
===Technicism===
Generally, technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collins English Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2011|isbn=978-0007437863|editor-last=Breslin|editor-first=Gerry|location=|pages=|chapter=technicism|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken to an extreme, technicism "reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality, to resolve all problems with the use of scientific–technological methods and tools."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Philosophical and Ethical Problems of Technicism and Genetic Engineering|journal=Society for Philosophy and Technology|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as Stephen V. Monsma,&lt;ref name="Monsma 1986"&gt;{{cite book| last = Monsma | first = Stephen V.| publisher = W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|location= [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]| title = Responsible Technology | year= 1986| isbn = 978-0802801753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher [[moral authority]].

===Optimism===
{{See also|Extropianism}}
Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[singularitarianism]], which view [[technological evolution|technological development]] as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good.

Transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers, and that what we commonly refer to as the [[human condition]] is just another barrier to be surpassed.

Singularitarians believe in some sort of "[[accelerating change]]"; that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology, and that this will culminate in a "[[Technological singularity|Singularity]]" after [[artificial general intelligence]] is invented in which progress is nearly infinite; hence the term. Estimates for the date of this Singularity vary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://intelligence.org/ie-faq/#WhenWillTheSingularity|title=Intelligence Explosion FAQ|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|date=10 November 2015|website=|publisher=[[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]]|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but prominent futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]] estimates the Singularity will occur in 2045.

Kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs: (1) the physical/chemical epoch, (2) the life epoch, (3) the human/brain epoch, (4) the technology epoch, (5) the artificial intelligence epoch, and (6) the universal colonization epoch. Going from one epoch to the next is a Singularity in its own right, and a period of speeding up precedes it. Each epoch takes a shorter time, which means the whole history of the universe is one giant Singularity event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|isbn=978-1101218884|location=|pages=|chapter=The Six Epochs|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics see these ideologies as examples of [[scientism]] and [[techno-utopianism]] and fear the notion of [[human enhancement]] and [[technological singularity]] which they support. Some have described [[Karl Marx]] as a techno-optimist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/DemocraticTranshumanism.htm|title=Democratic Transhumanism 2.0|last=Hughes|first=James|date=|website=Changesurfer|publisher=|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skepticism and critics===
{{See also|Luddite|Neo-Luddism|Anarcho-primitivism|Bioconservatism}}
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|[[Luddites]] smashing a power loom in 1812]]
On the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[John Zerzan]], who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed. They suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health.

Many, such as the [[Luddites]] and prominent philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], hold serious, although not entirely, deterministic reservations about technology (see "[[The Question Concerning Technology]]"&lt;ref name="Heidegger 1977"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lovitt | first = William | chapter = The Question Concerning Technology | year= 1977 | chapter-url = http://www.culturaleconomics.atfreeweb.com/Anno/Heidegger%20The%20Question%201954.htm | accessdate=21 November 2007 | title = The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays | publisher = Harper Torchbooks | pages = 3–35 | isbn = 978-0613913140}}&lt;/ref&gt;). According to Heidegger scholars [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and Charles Spinosa, "Heidegger does not oppose technology. He hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that 'in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same thing, to rebel helplessly against it.' Indeed, he promises that 'when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1977|isbn=|location=New York|pages=25–26|translator-last=Lovitt|translator-first=W.|chapter=The Question Concerning Technology|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophical Romanticism|last=Dreyfus|first=Hubert|last2=Spinosa|first2=Charles|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Kompridis|editor-first=Nikolas|location=New York|pages=265–81|chapter=Further Reflections on Heidegger, Technology, and the Everyday|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', [[Anthony Burgess]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', and [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. In [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']], Faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology. More recently, modern works of science fiction such as those by [[Philip K. Dick]] and [[William Gibson]] and films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity.

The late cultural critic [[Neil Postman]] distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and from what he called "technopolies," societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices, values, and world-views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology|last=Postman|first=Neil|publisher=Vintage|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darin Barney]] has written about technology's impact on practices of [[citizenship]] and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make [[ethics|ethical]] questions, including the question of what a good life consists in, nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Nation Under Google|last=Barney|first=Darin|publisher=House of Anansi Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolas Kompridis]] has also [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf written] about the dangers of new technology, such as [[genetic engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], [[synthetic biology]], and [[robotics]]. He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings, including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature. These concerns are shared by other philosophers, scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues (e.g. [[Francis Fukuyama]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Bill Joy|William Joy]], and [[Michael Sandel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Technology's Challenge to Democracy|journal=Parrhesia|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent critic of technology is [[Hubert Dreyfus]], who has published books such as ''On the Internet'' and ''What Computers Still Can't Do''.

A more infamous anti-technological treatise is ''[[s:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'', written by the Unabomber [[Ted Kaczynski]] and printed in several major newspapers (and later books) as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure. There are also subcultures that disapprove of some or most technology, such as self-identified [[off-gridder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vannini, Phillip, and Jonathan Taggart. "Voluntary simplicity, involuntary complexities, and the pull of remove: The radical ruralities of off-grid lifestyles." Environment and Planning A 45.2 (2013): 295-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appropriate technology===
{{See also|Technocriticism|Technorealism}}
The notion of [[appropriate technology]] was developed in the 20th century by thinkers such as [[E.F. Schumacher]] and [[Jacques Ellul]] to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized [[infrastructure]] or parts or skills imported from elsewhere. The [[ecovillage]] movement emerged in part due to this concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunner-Kolstrup|first=Christina|last2=Hörndahl|first2=Torsten|last3=Karttunen|first3=Janne P.|date=2018-07-03|title=Farm operators' experiences of advanced technology and automation in Swedish agriculture: a pilot study|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=215–26|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1458670|pmid=30047856|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optimism and skepticism in the 21st century===
''This section mainly focuses on American concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other Western countries. ''

{{Quotation|The inadequate quantity and quality of American jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face. [...] What's the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem?|Bernstein, Jared|"It’s Not a Skills Gap That’s Holding Wages Down: It’s the Weak
Economy, Among Other Things," in ''[[The American Prospect]]''|October 2014}}

In his article, [[Jared Bernstein]], a Senior Fellow at the [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/jared-bernstein|title=Jared Bernstein|last=|first=|date=2013-09-13|website=|publisher=[[Center for Budget and Policy Priorities]]|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions the widespread idea that [[automation]], and more broadly, technological advances, have mainly contributed to this growing [[labor market]] problem.
His thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism. Essentially, he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and American issues concerning [[unemployment]] and declining wages.

He uses two main arguments to defend his point.
First, because of recent technological advances, an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs. Yet, scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved. Indeed, [[automation]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;threatens repetitive jobs but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that "requires flexibility judgment and common sense"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=It's Not a Skills Gap That's Holding Wages Down: It's the Weak Economy, Among Other Things|journal=The American Prospect|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain hard to replace with [[machine]]s. Second, studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades.

Therefore, according to Bernstein, instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current American increasing unemployment and declining wages, one needs to worry more about "bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand, trade, income, and opportunity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For people who use both the Internet and mobile devices in excessive quantities it is likely for them to experience [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and over exhaustion as a result of disruptions in their sleeping patterns. Continuous studies have shown that increased [[Body mass index|BMI]] and weight gain are associated with people who spend long hours online and not exercising frequently.&lt;ref&gt;7.Kim JH 2010 ~Kim JH, Lau C, Cheuk K-K, Kan P, Hui HL, Griffiths SM.

J Adolesc. 2010;33(1):215–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, mass media and technology have a negative impact on people, on both their mental and physical health.

===Complex technological systems===
[[Thomas P. Hughes]] stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems, we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human-Built World: How to Think About Technology and Culture|last=Hughes|first=Thomas P.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0226359335|location=Chicago|pages=1–11|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is the difference between a [[wheel]] or a [[compass]] and cooking machines such as an [[oven]] or a [[gas stove]]? Can we consider all of them, only a part of them, or none of them as technologies?

Technology is often considered too narrowly; according to Hughes, "Technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity".&lt;ref name="Hughes, Thomas P. 2004"&gt;Hughes, Thomas P. (2004) "Introduction: Complex Technology" (1–11) in "Human-Built World: How to Think About Technology and Culture"&lt;/ref&gt; This definitio's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking "technologies," but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems.

Yet, because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that [[engineer]]s, [[scientist]]s, and [[Management|managers]] have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want. They have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, [[Evgeny Morozov]] particularly challenges two concepts: "Internet-centrism" and "solutionism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2013|isbn=978-1610391399|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the Internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to [[Alexis Madrigal]]'s review of Morozov's theory, to ignore it will lead to “unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/toward-a-complex-realistic-and-moral-tech-criticism/273996/|title=Toward a Complex, Realistic, and Moral Tech Criticism|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=13 March 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=11 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin R. Cohen and Gwen Ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Benjamin |last1=Cohen |first2=Gwen |last2=Ottinger |editor-first1=Gwen |editor-last1=Ottinger |editor-first2=Benjamin |editor-last2=Cohen| chapter=Introduction: Environmental Justice and the Transformation of Science and Engineering |date=2011 |pages=1–18 |title=Technoscience and Environmental Justice: Expert Cultures in a Grassroots Movement |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0262015790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, recognition of the limitations of technology, and more broadly, scientific knowledge, is needed&amp;nbsp;– especially in cases dealing with [[environmental justice]] and health issues. Ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers’ new comprehension of their role. Such an approach of technology and science "[require] technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently. [They have to consider themselves as] collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gwen |last1= Ottinger |editor-first1=Gwen |editor-last1=Ottinger |editor-first2=Benjamin |editor-last2=Cohen |title=Technoscience and Environmental Justice: Expert Cultures in a Grassroots Movement |date=2011 |pages=229–48 |chapter=Rupturing Engineering Education: Opportunities for Transforming Expert Identities Through Community-Based Projects |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0262015790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitiveness==
Technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function. The science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane, but it is all technology, and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage.

Technology-based planning is what was used to build the US industrial giants before WWII (e.g., [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]], [[DuPont]], [[General Motors|GM]]) and it is what was used to transform the US into a [[superpower]]. It was not economic-based planning.

==Future technology==
{{main article|Emerging technologies}}

[[Theories of technology]] often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the [[high technology]] and science of the time. As with all predictions of the future, however, technology's is uncertain.

In 2005, futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]] predicted that the future of technology would mainly consist of an overlapping "GNR Revolution" of [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[robotics]], with robotics being the most important of the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Singularity is Near|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|isbn=978-1101218884|location=|pages=|chapter=GNR: Three Overlapping Revolutions|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology assessment''' ('''TA''', German: {{lang|de|Technikfolgenabschätzung}}, French: {{lang|fr|évaluation des choix scientifiques et technologiques}}) is a scientific, interactive, and communicative process that aims to contribute to the formation of public and political opinion on societal aspects of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the commonly used definition given in the report of the EU-funded project TAMI (Technology Assessment – Methods and Impacts) in 2004: [http://www.ta-swiss.ch/?uid=45 ta-swiss.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;

== General description ==

TA is the study and evaluation of new technologies. It is based on the conviction that new developments within, and discoveries by, the scientific community are relevant for the world at large rather than just for the scientific experts themselves, and that technological progress can never be free of ethical implications. Also, technology assessment recognizes the fact that scientists normally are not trained [[ethicist]]s themselves and accordingly ought to be very careful when passing ethical judgement on their own, or their colleagues, new findings, projects, or work in progress.

Technology assessment assumes a global perspective and is future-oriented, not anti-technological. TA considers its task as an interdisciplinary approach to solving already existing problems and preventing potential damage caused by the uncritical application and the commercialization of new technologies.

Therefore, any results of technology assessment studies must be published, and particular consideration must be given to communication with political decision-makers.

An important problem concerning technology assessment is the so-called [[Collingridge dilemma]]: on the one hand, impacts of new technologies cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used; on the other hand, control or change of a technology is difficult as soon as it is widely used.

Technology assessments, which are a form of [[cost–benefit analysis]], are difficult if not impossible to carry out in an objective manner since subjective decisions and value judgments have to be made regarding a number of complex issues such as (a) the boundaries of the analysis (i.e., what costs are internalized and externalized), (b) the selection of appropriate indicators of potential positive and negative consequences of the new technology, (c) the monetization of non-market values, and (d) a wide range of ethical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 8, "The Positive Biases of Technology Assessments and Cost Benefit Analyses", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, most technology assessments are neither objective nor value-neutral exercises but instead are greatly influenced and biased by the values of the most powerful stakeholders, which are in many cases the developers and proponents (i.e., corporations and governments) of new technologies under consideration. In the most extreme view, as expressed by Ian Barbour in  '’Technology, Environment, and Human Values'’, technology assessment is "a one-sided apology for contemporary technology by people with a stake in its continuation."&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, I.A. (1980). ''Technology, environment, and human values'', Praeger, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the major fields of TA are: information technology, [[hydrogen technologies]], [[nuclear technology]], [[molecular nanotechnology]], [[pharmacology]], [[organ donation|organ transplant]]s, [[biotechnology|gene technology]], [[artificial intelligence]], the Internet and many more. [[Health technology assessment]] is related, but profoundly different, despite the similarity in the name.

===Forms and concepts of technology assessment===
The following types of concepts of TA are those that are most visible and practiced. There are, however, a number of further TA forms that are only proposed as concepts in the literature or are the label used by a particular TA institution.&lt;ref&gt;Among those concepts one finds, for instance, '''Interactive TA''' [http://www.itas.fzk.de/deu/tadn/tadn298/rath298a.htm ITAS.fzk.de], '''Rational TA''' [http://www.ea-aw.com/the-europaeische-akademie/aimstasks.html EA-AW.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918235522/http://www.ea-aw.com/the-europaeische-akademie/aimstasks.html |date=September 18, 2010 }}, '''Real-time TA''' (cp. Guston/Sarewitz (2002) Real-time technology assessment, in: Technology in Society 24, 93–109), Innovation-oriented TA [http://www.innovationsanalysen.de Innovationsanalysen].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Parliamentary TA (PTA)''': TA activities of various kinds whose addressee is a parliament. PTA may be performed directly by members of those parliaments (e.g. in France and Finland) or on their behalf of related TA institutions (such as in the UK, in Germany and Denmark) or by organisations not directly linked to a Parliament (such as in the Netherlands and Switzerland).&lt;ref&gt;Those TA institutions that perform PTA are organised in the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network; see [http://eptanetwork.org EPTAnetwork.org].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Expert TA''' (often also referred to as the '''classical TA''' or '''traditional TA''' concept): TA activities carried out by (a team of) TA and technical experts. Input from stakeholders and other actors is included only via written statements, documents and interviews, but not as in participatory TA.
* '''Participatory TA (pTA)''': TA activities which actively, systematically and methodologically involve various kinds of social actors as assessors and discussants, such as different kinds of civil society organisations, representatives of the state systems, but characteristically also individual stakeholders and citizens (lay persons), technical scientists and technical experts. Standard pTA methods include consensus conferences, focus groups, scenario workshops etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cp. the 2000 EUROpTA (European Participatory Technology Assessment – Participatory Methods in Technology Assessment and Technology Decision-Making) project report [http://www.tekno.dk/pdf/projekter/europta_Report.pdf TEKNO.dk].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes pTA is further divided into '''expert-stakeholder pTA''' and '''public pTA''' (including lay persons).&lt;ref&gt;Van Eijndhoven (1997) Technology assessment: Product or process? in: Technological Forecasting and Social Change 54 (1997) 269–286.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Constructive TA (CTA)''': This concept of TA, developed in the Netherlands, but also applied&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://run.unl.pt/handle/10362/31566|title=Battery storage systems as balancing option in intermittent renewable energy systems - A transdisciplinary approach under the frame of Constructive Technology Assessment. PhD Thesis|last=Baumann|first=Manuel Johann|last2=|publisher=Universidade Nova de Lisboa|year=2017|isbn=|location=Lisbon|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;Schot/Rip (1997), The Past and Future of Constructive Technology Assessment in: Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change 54, 251–268.&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to broaden the design of new technology through feedback of TA activities into the actual construction of technology. Contrary to other forms of TA, CTA is not directed toward influencing regulatory practices by assessing the impacts of technology. Instead, CTA wants to address social issues around technology by influencing design practices.
* '''Discursive TA''' or '''Argumentative TA''': This type of TA wants to deepen the political and normative debate about science, technology and society. It is inspired by ethics, policy discourse analysis and the sociology of expectations in science and technology. This mode of TA aims to clarify and bring under public and political scrutiny the normative assumptions and visions that drive the actors who are socially shaping science and technology. Accordingly, argumentative TA not only addresses the side effects of technological change, but deals with both broader impacts of science and technology and the fundamental normative question of why developing a certain technology is legitimate and desirable.&lt;ref&gt;van Est/Brom (2010) Technology assessment as an analytic and democratic practice, in: Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Health TA (HTA)''': A specialised type of expert TA informing policy makers about efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness issues of pharmaceuticals and medical treatments, see [[health technology assessment]].

'''Technology fusion''' involves a transformation of core technologies through a combination process facilitated by technological advances such as the phone and the Internet, which ensure that labs are no longer isolated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Market-Oriented Technology Management: Innovating for Profit in Entrepreneurial Times|last=Phillips|first=Fred|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9783642074561|location=Berlin|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in profitable advances that can be made cheaply by combining knowledge from different fields, companies, industries, and geographies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The technological fusion is distinguished from the so-called breakthrough approach, which is the linear technological development that replaces an older generation of technology through its focus on combining existing technologies into hybrid products that can revolutionize markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1992/07/technology-fusion-and-the-new-rd|title=Technology Fusion and the New R&amp;D|last=Kodama|first=Fumio|date=1992-07-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Fusion==
The fusion of technologies goes beyond mere combination. Fusion is more than complementarism, because it creates a new market and new growth opportunities for each participant in the innovation. It blends [[Incrementalism|incremental]] improvements from several (often previously separate) fields to create a product.&lt;ref name="Kodama1991"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kodama|first=Fumio|title=Analyzing Japanese High Technologies: The Techno-Paradigm Shift|publisher=Thomson Learning|date=September 1991|isbn=978-0-86187-835-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is the fusion of mechanical and electronic engineering to create [[mechatronics]]. There is also the case of fusing chemical and electronics technology to produce the [[Liquid-crystal display|Liquid Crystal display]] (LCD) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=R&amp;D and Economy in Korea: With Selected Multinational Cases &amp; Theories|last=Kim|first=Junmo|publisher=iUniverse|year=2005|isbn=9780595375257|location=Lincoln, NE|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology readiness levels''' ('''TRL''') are a method of estimating [[technology maturity]] of Critical Technology Elements (CTE) of a program during the acquisition process. They are determined during a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) that examines program concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities.  TRL are based on a scale from 1 to 9 with 9 being the most mature technology. The use of TRLs enables consistent, uniform discussions of technical maturity across different types of technology. TRL has been in widespread use at [[NASA]] since the 1980s where it was originally invented&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In 1999 the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] was advised by [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] to use the scale for procurement which it did from the early 2000s.  By 2008 the scale was also in use at the [[European Space Agency|European Space Agency (ESA)]] as it is evidenced by their [https://artes.esa.int/sites/default/files/TRL_Handbook.pdf handbook]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The [[European Commission]] advised EU-funded research and innovation projects to adopt the scale in 2010&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which they did from 2014 in its [https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/ Horizon 2020] [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|program]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In 2013 TRL was further canonized by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16290:2013 standard&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. A comprehensive approach and discussion about TRLs has been published by the European Association of Research and Technology Organisations ([http://www.earto.eu/ EARTO]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earto.eu/fileadmin/content/03_Publications/The_TRL_Scale_as_a_R_I_Policy_Tool_-_EARTO_Recommendations_-_Final.pdf The TRL scale as a Research &amp; Innovation Policy Tool]&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive criticism of the adoption of TRL scale by the European Union was published in The Innovation Journal, in that "concreteness and sophistication of the TRL scale gradually diminished as its usage spread outside its original context (space programs)".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==

Technology Readiness Levels were originally conceived at NASA in 1974 and formally defined in 1989. The original definition included seven levels, but in the 1990s NASA adopted the current nine-level scale that subsequently gained widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name="TRL Demystified"&gt;{{cite web|title = Technology Readiness Levels Demystified|author=Banke, Jim |date = 20 August 2010 |url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/trl_demystified.html|publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRL methodology was originated by Stan Sadin at NASA Headquarters in 1974.&lt;ref name="TRL Demystified"/&gt; At that time, Ray Chase was the JPL Propulsion Division representative on the Jupiter Orbiter design team. At the suggestion of Stan Sadin, Mr Chase used this methodology to assess the technology readiness of the proposed JPL Jupiter Orbiter spacecraft design.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Later Mr Chase spent a year at NASA Headquarters helping Mr Sadin institutionalize the TRL methodology. Mr Chase joined ANSER in 1978, where he used the TRL methodology to evaluate the technology readiness of proposed Air Force development programs. He published several articles during the 1980s and 90s on reusable launch vehicles utilizing the TRL methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Chase, R.L.|title = ''Methodology for Assessing Technological and Manufacturing Readiness of NASP-Technology Enabled Vehicles (AIAA 91-2389)'', presented at the 27th Joint Propulsion Conference, June 24-26, 1991, Sacramento CA |date = 26 June 1991|url = http://papers.sae.org/965565/}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documented an expanded version of the methodology that included design tools, test facilities, and manufacturing readiness on the Air Force Have Not program.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The Have Not program manager, Greg Jenkins, and Ray Chase published the expanded version of the TRL methodology, which included design and manufacturing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Leon McKinney and Mr Chase used the expanded version to assess the technology readiness of the ANSER team's Highly Reusable Space Transportation ("HRST") concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|display-authors = 4|author = R.

The [[United States Air Force]] adopted the use of Technology Readiness Levels in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In 1995, [[John C. Mankins]], NASA, wrote a paper&lt;ref name="Mankins"&gt;[http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/2000-testimony-JohnMankins.htm Statement of John C. Mankins] U.S. House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics Committee on Science, Sep 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; that discussed NASA's use of TRLs and proposed expanded descriptions for each TRL. In 1999, the United States [[General Accounting Office]] produced an influential report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Best Practices: Better Management of Technology Can Improve Weapon System Outcomes (GAO/NSIAD-99-162)|date = July 1999 |url = http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/ns991620.pdf|publisher = [[General Accounting Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that examined the differences in [[technology transfer|technology transition]] between the DOD and private industry. It concluded that the DOD takes greater risks and attempts to transition emerging technologies at lesser degrees of maturity than does private industry. The GAO concluded that use of immature technology increased overall program risk. The GAO recommended that the DOD make wider use of Technology Readiness Levels as a means of assessing technology maturity prior to transition. In 2001, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology issued a memorandum that endorsed use of TRLs in new major programs. Guidance for assessing technology maturity was incorporated into the ''Defense Acquisition Guidebook''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://at.dod.mil/docs/DefenseAcquisitionGuidebook.pdf ''Defense Acquisition Guidebook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425232741/http://at.dod.mil/docs/DefenseAcquisitionGuidebook.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the DOD developed detailed guidance for using TRLs in the 2003 DOD Technology Readiness Assessment Deskbook.

=== TRL in the European Union&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mihaly|first=Heder|date=September 2017|title=From NASA to EU: the evolution of the TRL scale in Public Sector Innovation|url=https://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/22_2_3_heder_nasa-to-eu-trl-scale.pdf|journal=The Innovation Journal|volume=22|pages=1–23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011071816/https://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/22_2_3_heder_nasa-to-eu-trl-scale.pdf|archive-date=October 11, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
The European Space Agency adopted the TRL scale in the mid-2000s. Its handbook&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Readiness Levels Handbook For Space Applications|last=|first=|publisher=European Space Agency|year=2008|isbn=|location=https://artes.esa.int/sites/default/files/TRL_Handbook.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely follows the NASA definition of TRLs. The universal usage of TRL in EU policy was proposed in the final report of the first High Level Expert Group on Key Enabling Technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/11283/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native|title=High-Level Expert Group on Key Enabling Technologies - Final Report|last=|first=|date=2011|website=|access-date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and it was indeed implemented in the subsequent EU framework program, called H2020, running from 2013 to 2020&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This means not only space and weapons programs, but everything from nanotechnology to informatics and communication technology.

A ''Technology Readiness Level Calculator'' was developed by the [[United States Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Nolte, William L.|title = ''Technology Readiness Level Calculator, Air Force Research Laboratory'', presented at the NDIA Systems Engineering Conference |date = 20 October 2003|url = http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2003systems/nolte.ppt|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tool is a standard set of questions implemented in [[Microsoft Excel]] that produces a graphical display of the TRLs achieved. This tool is intended to provide a snapshot of technology maturity at a given point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Technology Assessment Calculator|url = https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=320594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Technology Program Management Model'' was developed by the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Craver, Jeffrey T.|title = ''Technology Program Management Model, Army Space and Missile Defense Command Technical Center'', presented at the NDIA Systems Engineering Conference |date = 26 October 2006|url = http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2006systems/Thursday/crave.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TPMM is a TRL-gated high-fidelity activity model that provides a flexible management tool to assist Technology Managers in planning, managing, and assessing their technologies for successful technology transition.  The model provides a core set of activities including [[systems engineering]] and [[program management]] tasks that are tailored to the technology development and management goals.  This approach is comprehensive, yet it consolidates the complex activities that are relevant to the development and transition of a specific technology program into one integrated model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''TPMM - Technology Program Management Model'' (only available to DOD components)|url = https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=148163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The primary purpose of using technology readiness levels is to help management in making decisions concerning the development and transitioning of technology. It should be viewed as one of several tools that are needed to manage the progress of research and development activity within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Christophe Deutsch|author2 = Chiara Meneghini|author3 = Ozzy Mermut|author4 = Martin Lefort|title = Measuring Technology Readiness to improve Innovation Management|accessdate = 2011-11-27|url = http://www.ino.ca/Docs/Documents/publications/scientifiques/Deutch_Measuring%20technology%20readiness%20to%20improve%20innovation%20management.pdf|publisher = INO|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120602044401/http://www.ino.ca/Docs/Documents/publications/scientifiques/Deutch_Measuring%20technology%20readiness%20to%20improve%20innovation%20management.pdf|archivedate = 2012-06-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the advantages of TRLs:&lt;ref name="hfidtc"&gt;{{cite web|author = Ben Dawson|title = The Impact of Technology Insertion on Organisations|date = 31 October 2007|url = http://www.hfidtc.com/research/process/reports/phase-2/HFIDTC-2-12-2-1-1-tech-organisation.pdf|publisher = Human Factors Integration Design Technology Centre|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001612/http://www.hfidtc.com/research/process/reports/phase-2/HFIDTC-2-12-2-1-1-tech-organisation.pdf|archivedate = 26 April 2012|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Provides a common understanding of technology status
* Risk management
* Used to make decisions concerning technology funding
* Used to make decisions concerning transition of technology

Some of the characteristics of TRLs that limit their utility:&lt;ref name ="hfidtc" /&gt;

* Readiness does not necessarily fit with appropriateness or technology maturity
* A mature product may possess a greater or lesser degree of readiness for use in a particular system context than one of lower maturity
* Numerous factors must be considered, including the relevance of the products' operational environment to the system at hand, as well as the product-system architectural mismatch

Current TRL models tend to disregard negative and obsolescence factors. There have been suggestions made for incorporating such factors into assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Ricardo Valerdi|author2 = Ron J. Kohl|title = ''An Approach to Technology Risk Management'', Engineering Systems Division Symposium MIT, Cambridge, MA, March 29-31, 2004 |date = March 2004|url = http://web.mit.edu/rvalerdi/www/TRL%20paper%20ESD%20Valerdi%20Kohl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For complex technologies that incorporate various development stages, a more detailed scheme called the Technology Readiness Pathway Matrix has been developed going from basic units to applications in society. This tool aims to show that a readiness level of a technology is based on a less linear process but on a more complex pathway through its application in society.. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Vincent Jamier|author2 = Christophe Aucher|title = ''Demystifying Technology Readiness Levels for Complex Technologies'', Leitat, Barcelona, April 24, 2018 |date = April 2018|url = https://projects.leitat.org/demystifying-trls-for-complex-technologies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
