'''Artificiality''' (also called '''factitiousness''', or the state of being '''artificial''' or '''man-made''') is the state of being the product of intentional human manufacture, rather than occurring [[nature|naturally]] through processes not involving or requiring human activity.

==Connotations==
Artificiality often carries with it the implication of being false, counterfeit, or deceptive. The philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote in his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'':

{{quote|Naturalness is persuasive, artificiality is the contrary; for our hearers are prejudiced and think we have some design against them, as if we were mixing their wines for them. It is like the difference between the quality of Theodorus' voice and the voices of all other actors: his really seems to be that of the character who is speaking, theirs do not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', (2004, Dover Publications, W.D. Ross, translator), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, artificiality does not necessarily have a negative connotation, as it may also reflect the ability of humans to replicate forms or functions arising in nature, as with an [[artificial heart]] or [[artificial intelligence]]. Political scientist and artificial intelligence expert [[Herbert A. Simon]] observes that "some artificial things are imitations of things in nature, and the imitation may use either the same basic materials as those in the natural object or quite different materials.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;[[Herbert A. Simon]], ''The Sciences of the Artificial'' (1996), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon distinguishes between the artificial and the synthetic, the former being an imitation of something found in nature (for example, an [[artificial sweetener]] which generates [[sweetness]] using a formula not found in nature), and the latter being a replication of something found in nature (for example, a [[sugar]] created in a laboratory that is chemically indistinguishable from a naturally occurring sugar).&lt;ref name="Simon"/&gt; Some philosophers have gone further and asserted that, in a [[Determinism|deterministic]] world, "everything is natural and nothing is artificial", because everything in the world (including everything made by humans) is a product of the physical laws of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Qinglai Sheng, ''Philosophical Papers'' (1993), p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing natural objects from artificial objects==
[[File:Homebrew reaction diffusion example 512iter.jpg|thumb|right|Pattern resembling a [[Reaction-diffusion]] model, produced using sharpen and blur.]]
It is generally possible for humans, and in some instances, for computers,&lt;ref&gt;''See generally, E.P. Baltsavias, A. Gruen, L. VanGool, ''Automatic Extraction of Man-made Objects from Aerial and Space Images'', Volume 3 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish natural from artificial environments. The artificial environment tends to have more physical regularity both spatially and over time, with natural environments tending to have both irregular structures and structures that change over time.&lt;ref name="Kaken"&gt;Herman Kaken, "Recognition of Natural and Artificial Environments by Computers: Commonalities and Differences", in Juval Portugali, ''Complex Artificial Environments'' (2006), p. 31-48.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on close observation it is possible to discern some mathematical structures and [[Patterns in nature|patterns in natural environments]], which can then be replicated to create an artificial environment with a more natural appearance.&lt;ref name="Kaken"/&gt;

For example, by identifying and imitating natural means of [[pattern formation]], some types of [[Finite state machine|automata]] have been used to generate organic-looking [[Texture (computer graphics)|textures]] for more realistic [[Shader|shading]] of [[3D modeling|3D objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Greg Turk, [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/reaction_diffusion/reaction_diffusion.html Reaction-Diffusion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reaction-Diffusion Textures|author=Andrew Witkin, Michael Kassy|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aw/pdf/texture.pdf|doi=10.1145/122718.122750|journal=Proceedings of the 18th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques|year=1991|pages=299–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of several reasons why cherophobia may develop is the belief that when one becomes [[Happiness|happy]], a negative event will soon occur that will taint that happiness, as if punishing that individual for satisfaction. This belief is thought to be more prevalent in [[eastern_world|Eastern]] cultures. In [[Western cultures]], such as [[American culture]], "it is almost taken for granted that happiness is one of the most important values guiding people's [[personal life | lives]]".  Western cultures are more driven by an urge to maximize happiness and to minimize sadness. Failing to appear happy often gives cause for concern. The value placed on happiness echoes through Western [[positive psychology]] and through research on subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1457741-0 |title= What's so bad about feeling happy? |date= 17 March 2014 |author= Joan Robinson |publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fear of happiness is associated with fragility of happiness beliefs, suggesting that one of the causes of aversion to happiness may be the belief that happiness is unstable and fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-014-9553-0|title= Fragility of Happiness Beliefs Across 15 National Groups|first1= Mohsen|last1= Joshanloo|first2= Dan|last2= Weijers|first3= Ding-Yu|last3= Jiang|first4= Gyuseog|last4= Han|first5= Jaechang|last5= Bae|first6= Joyce S.|last6= Pang|first7= Lok Sang|last7= Ho|first8= Maria Cristina|last8= Ferreira|first9= Melikşah|last9= Demir|first10= Muhammad|last10= Rizwan|first11= Imran Ahmed|last11= Khilji|first12= Mustapha|last12= Achoui|first13= Ryosuke|last13= Asano|first14= Tasuku|last14= Igarashi|first15= Saori|last15= Tsukamoto|first16= Sanne M.

==Cultural factors==
There are four major reasons why cherophobes avoid happiness: "believing that being happy will provoke bad things to happen; that happiness will make you a worse person; that expressing happiness is bad for you and others; and that pursuing happiness is bad for you and others".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=It's time for Western psychology to recognise that many individuals, and even entire cultures, fear happiness |url=http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/its-time-for-western-psychology-to.html |publisher=[[The British Psychological Society]] |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "some people—in Western and Eastern cultures—are wary of happiness because they believe that bad things, such as unhappiness, suffering, and death, tend to happen to happy people."&lt;ref name="livescience44233"&gt;{{citation |title=Why Happiness Scares Us |author=Stephanie Pappas |url=http://www.livescience.com/44233-fear-of-happiness.html |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings "call into question the notion that happiness is the ultimate goal, a belief echoed in any number of articles and [[self-help]] publications about whether certain choices are likely to make you happy".&lt;ref name="livescience44233"/&gt; Also, "in cultures that believe worldly happiness to be associated with sin, shallowness, and moral decline will actually feel less satisfied when their lives are (by other standards) going well",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=13 of Psychology’s Newest and Coolest Ideas |author=Susan Krauss Whitbourne |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201304/13-psychology-s-newest-and-coolest-ideas |publisher=[[Psychology Today]] |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so measures of personal happiness cannot simply be considered a yardstick for satisfaction with one's life, and attitudes such as aversion to happiness have important implications for measuring happiness across cultures and ranking nations on [[Happiness economics|happiness scores]].

{{Main|Asherah pole}}
An Asherah pole is a sacred [[tree]] or pole that stood near [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] religious locations to honor the [[Asherah|Ugaritic mother-goddess Asherah]], [[Spouse|consort]] of [[El (deity)|El]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ed. ''Religions of the Ancient World'', (Belnap Press, Harvard) 2004, p. 418; the book-length scholarly treatment is W.L. Reed, ''The Asherah in the Old Testament'' (Fort Worth: Texas Christian University Press) 1949; the connection of the pillar figurines with Asherah was made by [[Raphael Patai]] in ''[[The Hebrew Goddess]]'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The relation of the literary references to an ''asherah'' and archaeological finds of Judaean pillar-figurines has engendered a literature of debate.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized and sharply criticized in Raz Kletter's ''The Judean Pillar-Figurines and the Archaeology of Asherah'' (Oxford: Tempus Reparatum), 1996; Kletter gives a catalogue of material remains but his conclusions were not well received in the scholarly press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''asherim'' were also [[cult object]]s related to the worship of the [[fertility god]]dess Asherah, the consort of either Ba'al or, as inscriptions from [[Kuntillet Ajrud|Kuntillet ‘Ajrud]] and Khirbet el-Qom attest, [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]],&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Dever, "Asherah, Consort of Yahweh? New Evidence from Kuntillet ʿAjrûd" ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'',1984; D.N. Freedman, "Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', 1987; [[Morton Smith]], "God Male and Female in the Old Testament: Yahweh and his Asherah" ''Theological Studies'', 1987; J.M. Hadley "The Khirbet el-Qom Inscription", ''Vetus Testamentum'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and thus objects of contention among competing cults. The insertion of "''pole''" [[begs the question]] by setting up unwarranted expectations for such a wooden object: "we are never told exactly what it was", observes John Day.&lt;ref&gt;John Day, "Asherah in the Hebrew Bible and Northwest Semitic Literature" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''105'''.3 (September 1986:385-408) p 401; ''asherim'' are discussed pp 401-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was certainly a movement against goddess-worship at the Jerusalem Temple in the time of King Josiah, it did not long survive his reign, as the following four kings "did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh" (2 Kings 23:32, 37; 24:9, 19). Further exhortations came from [[Jeremiah]]. The traditional interpretation of the Biblical text is that the Israelites imported pagan elements such as the Asherah poles from the surrounding Canaanites. In light of archeological finds, however, modern scholars now theorize that the Israelite [[folk religion]] was Canaanite in its inception and always polytheistic, and it was the prophets and priests who denounced the Asherah poles who were the innovators;&lt;ref&gt;William G. Dever, ''Did God have a wife?: Archaeology and folk religion in ancient Israel'', 2005, esp. pp&lt;/ref&gt; such theories inspire ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Ahituv (2006), ''Did God have a wife?'', ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', Book Review&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maypole Sweden.jpg|thumb|300px|Dancing around the maypole, in [[Åmmeberg]], Sweden]]
A [[maypole]] is a tall wooden pole erected as a part of various European folk festivals, around which a maypole dance often takes place.

The festivals may occur on [[May Day]] or [[Pentecost]] ([[Whitsun]]), although in some countries it is instead erected at [[Midsummer]]. In some cases the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilised during the festival, although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again.

Primarily found within the nations of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] Europe and the neighbouring areas which they have influenced, its origins remain unknown, although it has been speculated that it originally had some importance in the [[Germanic paganism]]&lt;ref name="Russel Jefferry Burton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russel|first1=Jefferry Burton|title=Medieval Civilisation|orig-year=1968 |date=22 February 2005 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |location=Eugene|isbn=1-59752-103-5|page=243|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=C05LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Iron Age]] and early Medieval cultures, and that the tradition survived Christianisation, albeit losing any original meaning that it had. It has been a recorded practice in many parts of Europe throughout the [[Medieval]] and [[Early Modern]] periods, although became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, the tradition is still observed in some parts of Europe and among European communities in North America.&lt;ref name="Kelly Cannon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cannon|first1=Kelly|title=Good Neighbor: Former teacher continues tradition of Maypole dance|url=http://news.hjnews.com/news/good-neighbor-former-teacher-continues-tradition-of-maypole-dance/article_43e9b2fb-2f30-54b6-aeb3-34398c645005.html|accessdate=28 September 2015|work=From the Good Neighbors series|agency=The Herald Journal's Staff writer|issue=May 21, 2015|publisher=The Herald Journal, 75 West 300 North Logan, UT|date=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that they were found primarily in areas of Germanic Europe, where, prior to Christianisation, [[Germanic paganism]] was followed in various forms, has led to speculation that the maypoles were in some way a continuation of a Germanic pagan tradition.&lt;ref name="Russel Jefferry Burton" /&gt; One theory holds that they were a remnant of the Germanic reverence for sacred trees, as there is evidence for various sacred trees and wooden pillars that were venerated by the pagans across much of Germanic Europe, including [[Thor's Oak]] and the [[Irminsul]].&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Pagan Europe'' by Prudence Jones and Nigel Pennick, Routledge, 1997, {{ISBN|0-415-15804-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-15804-6}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James Frazer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazer|first1=James George|title=The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|date=1922|page=Chapter 10:: Relics of Tree Worship in Modern Europe|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Golden_Bough|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that, in [[Norse paganism]], [[cosmology|cosmological]] views held that the universe was a [[world tree]], known as [[Yggdrasil]].&lt;ref&gt;'The London quarterly review, Volumes 113-114', Theodore Foster, 1863, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The History of Religions' By Hopkins Edward Washburn, The McMillan Company 1929, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''European paganism: the realities of cult from antiquity to the Middle Ages'' by [[Ken Dowden]], Routledge, 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-12034-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-12034-0}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Nart sagas from the Caucasus: myths and legends from the Circassians, Abazas, Abkhaz, and Ubykhs' by [[John Colarusso]], Princeton University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-691-02647-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-691-02647-3}}, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The early history and antiquities of Freemasonry: as connected with ancient Norse guilds, and the oriental and mediæval building fraternities' by George Franklin Fort, Bradley, 1881, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

The floor of the [[Mære Church]], [[Norway]], was excavated in 1969&lt;ref&gt;Lidén, Hans-Emil. 1969. From Pagan Sanctuary to Christian Church, the Excavation of Mære Church in Trøndelag. Norwegian Archaeological Review. (1969) 2, pp. 3–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and found to contain the remains of a pagan cult structure. The nature of that structure was not clear. Lidén felt this represented the remains of a building, but a critique by Olsen (1969:26) in the same work suggested this may have been a site for pole-related rituals. A recent review of the evidence by Walaker (Norddide 2011: 107-113)&lt;ref&gt;Walaker Nordeide, Sæbjorg. 2011.

A '''civilization''' or '''civilisation''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|English spelling differences]]) is any [[complex society]] characterized by [[urban area|urban development]], [[social stratification]] imposed by a cultural [[elite]], [[symbol]]ic systems of communication (for example, [[writing system]]s), and a perceived separation from and domination over the [[natural environment]].&lt;ref name="Adams 1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adams, Robert McCormick|title=The Evolution of Urban Society|year=1966|page=13|publisher=Transaction Publishers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrZOwKU0TlsC&amp;q=%22civilizations+are+associated%22|isbn=9780202365947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haviland 2013"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Haviland, William|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2013|page=250|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DfEWAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22civilization+refers+to+societies%22|display-authors=etal|isbn=978-1285675305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright 2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald|last=Wright|title=A Short History of Progress|publisher=House of Anansi|year=2004|pages=115, 117, and 212|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nzWPFQIEvfEC&amp;q=%22technical,%20anthropological%22|isbn=9780887847066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Llobera 2003"&gt;{{cite book|first=Josep|last=Llobera|title=An Invitation to Anthropology|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2003|pages=136–137|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_-LDyWxODjAC&amp;q=%22best-known+definition%22|isbn=9781571815972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernández-Armesto 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernández-Armesto|first=Felipe|title=Civilizations: Culture, Ambition, and the Transformation of Nature |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2001|url= https://books.google.com/?id=3MNzi698aXwC|isbn=9780743216500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyden 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyden|first=Stephen Vickers|title=The Biology of Civilisation|year=2004|pages=7–8|publisher=UNSW Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TX78DfVbM7kC&amp;q=%22the+essential+precondition%22|isbn=9780868407661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solms-Laubach 2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Franz|last=Solms-Laubach|title=Nietzsche and Early German and Austrian Sociology|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2007|pages=115, 117, and 212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxTITNduFc4C&amp;dq|isbn=9783110181098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's literature, domestication, and social foundation : narratives of civilization and wilderness|last=1964-|first=AbdelRahim, Layla|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780415661102|location=New York|page=8|oclc=897810261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including [[centralization]], the [[domestication]] of both humans and other organisms, [[division of labor|specialization of labour]], culturally ingrained [[Idea of Progress|ideologies of progress]] and [[supremacism]], [[monument]]al [[architecture]], [[taxation]], societal dependence upon [[farming]] and [[expansionism]].&lt;ref name="Haviland 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Llobera 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyden 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solms-Laubach 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Historically, civilization has often been understood as a larger and "more advanced" culture, in contrast to smaller, supposedly [[primitive culture]]s.&lt;ref name="Adams 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Llobera 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolesti|first=Maria|title=Barbarism and Its Discontents|year=2013|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cpZZKabXvWAC|isbn=9780804785372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some scholars have described civilization as being necessarily multicultural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wei|journal=Globality Studies Journal|year=2011|issue=24|title=Civilization and Culture|first=Ruan |url=https://gsj.stonybrook.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/0024Wei.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of [[nomadic pastoralist]]s, [[Neolithic]] societies or [[hunter-gather]]ers, but it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves. As an uncountable noun, "civilization" also refers to the process of a society developing into a centralized, urbanized, stratified structure. Civilizations are organized in densely populated settlements divided into [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[social class]]es with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Sources of Social Power |last=Mann |first=Michael |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1986 |volume=1 |pages=34–41 |author-link=Michael Mann (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilization, as its etymology (below) suggests, is a concept originally linked to towns and cities. The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally associated with the final stages of the [[Neolithic Revolution]], culminating in the relatively rapid process of [[urban revolution]] and [[state formation]], a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite.

== History of the concept ==
The English word ''civilization'' comes from the [[Early modern France|16th-century French]] ''civilisé'' ("civilized"), from Latin ''civilis'' ("civil"), related to ''civis'' ("citizen") and ''civitas'' ("city").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3041K2Zv76AC&amp;pg=PT73 |title=The SAGE Glossary of the Social and Behavioral Sciences |last=Sullivan |first=Larry E. |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=9781412951432 |page=73 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental treatise is [[Norbert Elias]]'s ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939), which traces social [[mores]] from [[Court (royal)|medieval courtly society]] to the [[Early Modern period]].&lt;ref&gt;It remains the most influential sociological study of the topic, spawning its own body of secondary literature. Notably, [[Hans Peter Duerr]] attacked it in a major work (3,500 pages in five volumes, published 1988–2002). Elias, at the time a nonagenarian, was still able to respond to the criticism the year before his death. In 2002, Duerr was himself criticized by Michael Hinz's ''Der Zivilisationsprozeß: Mythos oder Realität'' (2002), saying that his criticism amounted to a hateful defamation of Elias, through excessive standards of [[political correctness]].  ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-25327104.html 40/2002]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Philosophy of Civilization'' (1923), [[Albert Schweitzer]] outlines two opinions: one purely [[materialism|material]] and the other material and [[ethic]]al. He said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of civilization, "the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress".{{page needed|date=October 2014}}

Adjectives like "civility" developed in the mid-16th century. The abstract noun "civilization", meaning "civilized condition", came in the 1760s, again from French. The first known use in French is in 1757, by [[Victor Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau]], and the first use in English is attributed to [[Adam Ferguson]], who in his 1767 ''[[Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'' wrote, &lt;!-- Keep original spelling please. --&gt;"Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood, but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation".&lt;ref name=Benveniste&gt;Cited after [[Émile Benveniste]], ''Civilisation. Contribution à l'histoire du mot'' (''Civilisation. Contribution to the history of the word''), 1954, published in ''Problèmes de linguistique générale'', [[Éditions Gallimard]], 1966, pp. 336–345 (translated by Mary Elizabeth Meek as ''Problems in general linguistics'', 2 vols., 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; The word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness, in the active pursuit of [[Progress (history)|progress]] characteristic of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

In the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the [[French Revolution]], "civilization" was used in the [[Grammatical number|singular]], never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole. This is still the case in French.&lt;ref name=velkley/&gt; The use of "civilizations" as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in the title ''A narrative of the loss of the Winterton East Indiaman wrecked on the coast of Madagascar in 1792; and of the sufferings connected with that event. To which is subjoined a short account of the natives of Madagascar, with suggestions as to their civilizations'' by J. Hatchard, L.B. Seeley and T. Hamilton, London, 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; but has become much more common in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning [[culture]] (itself in origin an uncountable noun, made countable in the context of [[ethnography]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Civilization" (1974), ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 15th ed. Vol. II, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 956. Retrieved 25 August 2007. Using the terms "civilization" and "culture" as equivalents is controversial{{clarify|date=October 2014}} and generally rejected, so that for example some types of culture are not normally described as civilizations.&lt;/ref&gt; Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a "medieval civilization", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron.

Already in the 18th century, civilization was not always seen as an improvement. One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of [[Rousseau]], particularly his work about education, ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Emile]]''. Here, civilization, being more [[Reason|rational]] and socially driven, is not fully in accord with [[human nature]], and "human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original prediscursive or prerational natural unity" (see [[noble savage]]). From this, a new approach was developed, especially in Germany, first by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], and later by philosophers such as [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Nietzsche]]. This sees cultures as natural organisms, not defined by "conscious, rational, deliberative acts", but a kind of pre-rational "folk spirit". Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural and leads to "vices of social life" such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and avarice.&lt;ref name=velkley&gt;{{Citation|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question| last=Velkley|first=Richard|year=2002|chapter=The Tension in the Beautiful: On Culture and Civilization in Rousseau and German Philosophy|pages=11–30|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[World War II]], [[Leo Strauss]], having fled Germany, argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind [[Nazism]] and German [[militarism]] and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/LeoStraussOnGermanNihilism1941 On German Nihilism]" (1999, originally a 1941 lecture), ''Interpretation'' 26, no. 3 edited by David Janssens and Daniel Tanguay.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Grün - The End of Dinner.jpg|thumb|The emergence of [[table manners]] and other forms of [[etiquette]] and [[self-restraint]] are presented as one of the characteristics of ''civilized'' society by [[Norbert Elias]] in ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939). ''The End of Dinner'' by [[Jules-Alexandre Grün]] (1913).]]
Social scientists such as [[V. Gordon Childe]] have named a number of traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of society.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Childe, V., ''What Happened in History'' (Penguin, 1942) and ''Man Makes Himself'' (Harmondsworth, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of [[livelihood]], [[Human settlement|settlement]] patterns, [[forms of government]], [[social stratification]], economic systems, [[literacy]] and other cultural traits. [[Andrew Nikiforuk]] argues that "civilizations relied on shackled human muscle. It took the energy of slaves to plant crops, clothe emperors, and build cities" and considers slavery to be a common feature of pre-modern civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Energy of Slaves: Oil and the new servitude |last=Nikiforuk |first=Andrew |publisher=Greystone Books |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All civilizations have depended on [[agriculture]] for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru which may have depended upon maritime resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=85 | title= The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization: An Evolving Hypothesis | last=Moseley | first=Michael | publisher= The Hall of Ma'at |format= |website= | accessdate= 2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moseley |first=Michael | title = The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization |year=1975 |publisher=Cummings |location=Menlo Park |isbn=978-0-8465-4800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grain farms can result in accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial [[fertilisation|fertilization]], [[irrigation]] and [[crop rotation]]. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Hadjikoumis; Angelos, Robinson; and Sarah Viner-Daniels (Eds) (2011), "Dynamics of Neolithisation in Europe: Studies in honour of Andrew Sherratt" (Oxbow Books)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grain]] surpluses have been especially important because grain can be [[food storage|stored]] for a long time. A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides produce food for a living: early civilizations included [[soldiers]], [[artisan]]s, [[priest]]s and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and perhaps during the [[Mesolithic]] [[Natufian culture]]. It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/mann-text/1 |title= Göbekli Tepe |publisher= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|accessdate=|date = June 2011|last= Mann|first = Charles C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies. The word "civilization" is sometimes simply defined as "'''living in cities''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Standage]] (2005), ''A History of the World in 6 Glasses'', Walker &amp; Company, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade.

Compared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex political structure, namely the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;Grinin, Leonid E (Ed) et al. (2004), "The Early State and its Alternatives and Analogues" (Ichitel)&lt;/ref&gt; State societies are more stratified&lt;ref&gt;Bondarenko, Dmitri et al. (2004), "Alternatives to Social Evolution" in Grinin op cit.&lt;/ref&gt; than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes. The [[ruling class]], normally concentrated in the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a [[Forms of government|government]] or [[bureaucracy]]. [[Morton Fried]], a [[conflict theory|conflict theorist]] and [[Elman Service]], an integration theorist, have classified human cultures based on political systems and [[social inequality]]. This system of classification contains four categories&lt;ref&gt;Bogucki, Peter (1999), "The Origins of Human Society" (Wiley Blackwell)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Hunter-gatherer]] bands'', which are generally [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].&lt;ref&gt;DeVore, Irven, and Lee, Richard (1999) "Man the Hunter" (Aldine)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[horticulture|Horticultural]]/[[Pastoralism|pastoral]] societies'' in which there are generally two inherited social classes; chief and commoner.
* ''Highly stratified structures'', or [[chiefdom]]s, with several inherited social classes: king, noble, freemen, serf and slave.
* ''Civilizations,'' with complex [[social hierarchy|social hierarchies]] and organized, institutional [[Forms of government|governments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. |author2=Linda Black |author3=Larry S.

Economically, civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership and exchange than less organized societies. Living in one place allows people to accumulate more [[Ownership|personal possessions]] than nomadic people. Some people also acquire [[landed property]], or private ownership of the land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must [[trade]] their goods and services for food in a [[Market (economics)|market]] system, or receive food through the levy of [[tribute]], redistributive [[taxation]], [[tariffs]] or [[tithe]]s from the food producing segment of the population. Early human cultures functioned through a [[gift economy]] supplemented by limited [[barter]] systems. By the early [[Iron Age]], contemporary civilizations developed [[money]] as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions. In a village, the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot. These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled. From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites.

[[Writing]], developed first by people in [[Sumer]], is considered a hallmark of civilization and "appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Cahokia and the Mississippians|last=Pauketat|first=Timothy R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780521520669|location=|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other. However, writing is not always necessary for civilization, as shown the [[Inca]] civilization of the Andes, which did not use writing at all except from a complex recording system consisting of cords and nodes instead: the "Quipus", whose still functioned as a civilized society.

Aided by their division of labour and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These include organized [[religion]], development in the [[arts]], and countless new advances in [[science]] and [[technology]].

Through history, successful civilizations have spread, taking over more and more territory, and assimilating more and more previously-uncivilized people. Nevertheless, some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day. These cultures are called by some "[[primitive culture|primitive]]", a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. "Primitive" implies in some way that a culture is "first" (Latin = ''primus''), that it has not changed since the dawn of humanity, though this has been demonstrated not to be true. Specifically, as all of today's cultures are contemporaries, today's so-called primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized. Anthropologists today use the term "[[Protohistoric archaeology|non-literate]]" to describe these peoples.

Civilization has been spread by [[colonization]], [[imperialism|invasion]], [[religious conversion]], the extension of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic control]] and [[trade]], and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate peoples. Some non-civilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour. But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.

Assessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trade or manufacturing capacities, the territorial extensions of its power, the complexity of its [[division of labor|division of labour]], and the carrying capacity of its [[urbanism|urban centres]]. Secondary elements include a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency, contractual and [[tort]]-based legal systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific understanding, [[metallurgy]], political structures and organized religion.

Traditionally, polities that managed to achieve notable military, ideological and economic power defined themselves as "civilized" as opposed to other societies or human groupings outside their sphere of influence&amp;nbsp;– calling the latter [[barbarians]], [[wikt:savages|savages]], and [[primitive culture|primitives]]. In a modern-day context, "civilized people" have been contrasted with [[indigenous people]] or [[tribal societies]].

== Cultural identity ==
{{further|Cultural area}}
&lt;!-- [[File:Persepolis iran.jpg;The king of Holy Kingdon Rum kneel of the king of Arabia]] comment to remove redlinked img--&gt;
"Civilization" can also refer to the [[culture]] of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a [[state (polity)|state]]-based [[decision making]] apparatus, a [[literature]], professional [[art]], [[architecture]], organized [[religion]] and complex customs of [[education]], [[coercion]] and control associated with maintaining the elite.

[[File:Clash_of_Civilizations_mapn2.png|thumb|upright=2.0|A world map of major civilizations according to the political hypothesis ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' by [[Samuel P. Huntington]]]]

The intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization (a classic example being [[China|Chinese]] civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam). Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.

Many historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units. Early twentieth-century philosopher [[Oswald Spengler]],&lt;ref name="Spengler, Oswald 1919"&gt;Spengler, Oswald, ''Decline of the West: Perspectives of World History'' (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; uses the German word ''Kultur'', "culture", for what many call a "civilization". Spengler believed a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol. Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline and death, often supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol. Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as "the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable".&lt;ref name="Spengler, Oswald 1919" /&gt;

This "unified culture" concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in the mid-twentieth century. Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume ''[[A Study of History]],'' which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five "arrested civilizations". Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a "creative minority", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] defines civilization as "the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species". Huntington's theories about civilizations are discussed [[Civilization#Future|below]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LO4xG-bH1CQC&amp;pg=PA43 |title=The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order |last=Huntington |first=Samuel P. |date=1997 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416561248 |page=43 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complex systems ==
Another group of theorists, making use of [[systems theory]], looks at a civilization as a [[complex system]], i.e., a framework by which a group of objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result. Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them. Any organization is a complex [[social system]] and a civilization is a large organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial but misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.

Systems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges and political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the [[Silk Road]] through [[Central Asia]] and [[Indian Ocean]] sea routes linking the [[Roman Empire]], [[History of Iran|Persian Empire]], India and China, were well established 2000 years ago, when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such long distance trade is in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. During the [[Uruk period]], Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Algaze, Guillermo, ''The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization'' (Second Edition, 2004) ({{ISBN|978-0-226-01382-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Resin found later in the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.

Many theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single "[[world-system theory|world system]]", a process known as [[globalization]]. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration – cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic – is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. [[David Wilkinson (political scientist)|David Wilkinson]] has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the "Central Civilization" around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ojs.lib.byu.edu/spc/index.php/CCR/article/view/12262/12162|title=Central Civilization|last1=Wilkinson|first1=David|author-link1=David Wilkinson (political scientist)|journal=[[Comparative Civilizations Review]]|volume=17|issue=|date=Fall 1987|pages=31–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization. What Huntington calls the "clash of civilizations" might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization. Others point to the [[Crusades]] as the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since [[Ancient history|ancient times]], and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== History ==
{{See also|History of the world}}

The notion of [[world history]] as a succession of "civilizations" is an entirely modern one.
In the European [[Age of Discovery]], emerging [[Modernity]] was put into stark contrast with the
[[Neolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]]  stage of the cultures of the [[New World]], suggesting
that the complex states had emerged at some time in prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;
"Explicit theories of the origin of the state are relatively modern [...] the age of exploration, by making Europeans aware that many peoples throughout the world lived, not in states, but in independent villages or tribes, made the state seem less natural, and thus more in need of explanation."
{{cite web |url=http://72.52.202.216/~fenderse/Carneiro.htm |title=A Theory of the Origin of the State |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530140606/http://72.52.202.216/~fenderse/Carneiro.htm |archivedate=30 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;
The term "civilization" as it is now most commonly understood, a complex state with centralisation,  social stratification and specialization of labour, corresponds to early empires that arise in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in the [[Early Bronze Age]], around roughly 3000 BC.
[[Gordon Childe]] defined the emergence of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the [[Neolithic Revolution]], triggering the development of settled communities, and the [[Urban Revolution]].

===Urban Revolution===
{{Main article|Neolithic|Bronze Age|Cradle of Civilization}}
At first, the [[Neolithic]] was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation, where continuous farming led to the depletion of soil fertility resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from the settlement, eventually compelling the settlement itself to move. In major semi-arid river valleys, annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year, with the result that population densities could rise significantly.
This encouraged a [[secondary products revolution]] in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, wool, manure and pulling ploughs and carts&amp;nbsp;– a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene.

The earlier neolithic technology and lifestyle was established first in Western Asia (for example at [[Göbekli Tepe]], from about 9,130 BCE), and later in the [[Yellow River]] and [[Yangtze]] basins in China (for example the [[Pengtoushan]] culture from 7,500 BCE), and later spread.
[[Mesopotamia]] is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, with civilizations developing from 6,500 years ago. This area has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in [[History of the world|human history]] including the invention of the [[wheel]], the development of [[cuneiform]] script, [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[agriculture]]."&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-13.html|title=Iraq, past, present and future: a thoroughly-modern mandate?|last=Milton-Edwards|first=Beverley|date=May 2003|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar pre-civilized "neolithic revolutions" also began independently from 7,000 BCE in northwestern [[South America]] (the [[Norte Chico civilization]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Haas |first=Jonathan |last2=Creamer |first2=Winifred |last3=Ruiz |first3=Alvaro |date=December 2004 |title=Dating the Late Archaic occupation of the Norte Chico region in Peru |url= |journal=Nature |language=En |volume=432 |issue=7020 |pages=1020–1023 |doi=10.1038/nature03146 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=15616561}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennett, Douglas J.; Winterhalder, Bruce (2006).

The [[8.2 kiloyear event|8.2 Kiloyear Arid Event]] and the [[5.9 kiloyear event|5.9 Kiloyear]] [[Pluvial|Interpluvial]] saw the drying out of semiarid regions and a major spread of deserts.&lt;ref&gt;De Meo, James (2nd Edition), "Saharasia"&lt;/ref&gt;  This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of [[endemic warfare|endemic violence]] between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, associated with the first civilizations.

This "[[urban revolution]]" marked the beginning of the accumulation of transferrable surpluses, which helped economies and cities develop. It was associated with the state monopoly of violence, the appearance of a soldier class and endemic warfare, the rapid development of hierarchies, and the appearance of human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;"Ritual human sacrifice promoted and sustained the evolution of stratified societies" op cit{{huh|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of [[sedentism]], the domestication of grains and animals and development of lifestyles that facilitated [[economies of scale]] and accumulation of surplus production by certain social sectors.  The transition from ''complex cultures'' to ''civilizations'', while still disputed, seems to be associated with the development of state structures, in which power was further monopolized by an elite ruling class&lt;ref&gt;Carniero, R.L. (Ed) (1967), "The Evolution of Society: Selections from Herbert Spencer’s Principles of Sociology", (Univ. of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1967), pp. 32–47, 63–96, 153–165.&lt;/ref&gt; who practised human sacrifice.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Joseph |last1 = Watts|first2 =Oliver|last2 = Sheehan|first3 = Quentin D.|last3 = Atkinson|first4 = Joseph|last4 = Bulbulia|first5 = Russell D.|last5= Gray|title = Ritual human sacrifice promoted and sustained the evolution of stratified societies|journal =Nature |volume = 532|issue = 532|pages = 228–231|date = 4 April 2016|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v532/n7598/full/nature17159.html |doi = 10.1038/nature17159|pmid = 27042932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the Neolithic period, various elitist [[Chalcolithic]] civilizations began to rise in various [[Cradle of civilisation|"cradles"]] from around 3300 BCE, expanding into large-scale [[empire]]s in the course of the Bronze Age ([[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Akkadian Empire]], [[Assyrian Empire]], [[Old Assyrian Empire]], [[Hittite Empire]]).

A parallel development took place independently in the [[Pre-Columbian Americas]], where the [[Mayan civilization|Mayans]] began to be [[Maya city|urbanised]] around 500 BCE, and the fully fledged [[Aztec Empire|Aztec]] and [[Inca Empire|Inca]] emerged by the 15th century, briefly before European contact.

=== Axial Age ===
{{Main article|Axial Age}}
{{further|Iron Age|Hinduism|Christianization|Spread of Buddhism|Spread of Islam}}
The [[Bronze Age collapse]] was followed by the Iron Age around 1200 BCE, during which a number of new civilizations emerged, culminating in a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE which  [[Karl Jaspers]] termed the [[Axial Age]], presented as a critical transitional phase leading to [[Classical antiquity|classical civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarnas, Richard (1993). ''The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View'' (Ballantine Books)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[William Hardy McNeill]] proposed that this period of history was one in which culture contact between previously separate civilizations saw the "closure of the [[oecumene]]" and led to accelerated social change from China to the Mediterranean, associated with the spread of coinage, larger empires and new religions. This view has recently been championed by Christopher Chase-Dunn and other [[world systems theory|world systems theorists]].

== Fall of civilizations ==
{{prose|section|date=July 2013}}
{{Main article|Societal collapse}}
Civilizations have generally ended in one of two ways; either through being incorporated into another expanding civilization (e.g. As Ancient Egypt was incorporated into Hellenistic Greek, and subsequently Roman civilizations), or by collapse and reversion to a simpler form, as happens in what are called Dark Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Arnold (1965) "A Study of History" (OUP)&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of civilization. Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory.
* [[Ibn Khaldūn]]'s ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' influenced theories of the analysis, growth and decline of the Islamic civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Campanini (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5DoasQxzvNQC&amp;pg=PA75 ''Studies on Ibn Khaldûn''], Polimetrica s.a.s., p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested repeated invasions from nomadic peoples limited development and led to social collapse.
* [[Edward Gibbon]]'s work ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' was a well-known and detailed analysis of the fall of Roman civilization. Gibbon suggested the final act of the collapse of Rome was the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453 CE. For Gibbon, "The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the cause of the destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. The story of the ruin is simple and obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman Empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it has subsisted for so long".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 2nd ed., vol. 4, ed. by J. B. Bury (London, 1909), pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174. Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis. Part VI. General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theodor Mommsen]] in his ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'' suggested Rome collapsed with the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 CE and he also tended towards a biological analogy of "genesis", "growth", "senescence", "collapse" and "decay".
* [[Oswald Spengler]], in his ''[[Decline of the West]]'' rejected [[Petrarch]]'s chronological division, and suggested that there had been only eight "mature civilizations". Growing cultures, he argued, tend to develop into imperialistic civilizations, which expand and ultimately collapse, with democratic forms of government ushering in [[plutocracy]] and ultimately [[imperialism]].
* [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in his ''[[A Study of History]]'' suggested that there had been a much larger number of civilizations, including a small number of arrested civilizations, and that all civilizations tended to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen. The cause of the fall of a civilization occurred when a cultural [[elite]] became a [[parasitic]] elite, leading to the rise of internal and external [[proletariat]]s.
* [[Joseph Tainter]] in ''[[Societal collapse|The Collapse of Complex Societies]]'' suggested that there were [[diminishing returns]] to [[complexity]], due to which, as states achieved a maximum permissible complexity, they would decline when further increases actually produced a negative return. Tainter suggested that Rome achieved this figure in the 2nd century CE.
* [[Jared Diamond]] in his 2005 book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'' suggests five major reasons for the collapse of 41 studied cultures: environmental damage, such as [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]]; [[climate change]]; dependence upon [[international trade|long-distance trade]] for needed resources; increasing levels of internal and external violence, such as war or invasion; and societal responses to internal and environmental problems.
* [[Peter Turchin]] in his [https://web.archive.org/web/20060830212141/http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/faculty/turchin/HistDyn.htm ''Historical Dynamics''] and [[Andrey Korotayev]] ''et al.'' in their [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=172&amp;Itemid=70 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Secular Cycles, and Millennial Trends''] suggest a number of mathematical models describing collapse of agrarian civilizations. For example, the basic logic of Turchin's "fiscal-demographic" model can be outlined as follows: during the initial phase of a sociodemographic [[Social cycle theory|cycle]] we observe relatively high levels of per capita production and consumption, which leads not only to relatively high [[population growth]] rates, but also to relatively high rates of surplus production. As a result, during this phase the population can afford to pay taxes without great problems, the taxes are quite easily collectible, and the population growth is accompanied by the growth of state revenues. During the intermediate phase, the increasing [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing, whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state. As a result, during this phase the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems. During the final pre-collapse phases the overpopulation leads to further decrease of per capita production, the surplus production further decreases, state revenues shrink, but the state needs more and more resources to control the growing (though with lower and lower rates) population. Eventually this leads to famines, epidemics, state breakdown, and demographic and civilization collapse (Peter Turchin. ''Historical Dynamics.'' [[Princeton University Press]], 2003:121–127; [[Andrey Korotayev]] et al. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=302&amp;Itemid=70 Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends. Moscow: Russian Academy of Sciences, 2006]).
* [[Peter Heather]] argues in his book ''[[Decline of the Roman Empire#Peter Heather|The Fall of the Roman Empire: a New History of Rome and the Barbarians]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Heather|title=The Fall Of The Roman Empire: A New History Of Rome And The Barbarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCOJfTB7HtgC|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=1 December 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515954-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that this civilization did not end for moral or economic reasons, but because centuries of contact with barbarians across the frontier generated its own nemesis by making them a much more sophisticated and dangerous adversary. The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the Empire. Although this argument is specific to Rome, it can also be applied to the Asiatic Empire of the Egyptians, to the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties of China, to the Muslim [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and others.
* [[Bryan Ward-Perkins]], in his book ''The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan Ward-Perkins|title=The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vSUh9KbfKAC|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=7 September 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the real horrors associated with the collapse of a civilization for the people who suffer its effects, unlike many revisionist historians who downplay this. The collapse of complex society meant that even basic plumbing disappeared from the continent for 1,000 years. Similar [[Greek dark ages|Dark Age]] collapses are seen with the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]] in the Eastern Mediterranean, the collapse of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], on [[Easter Island]] and elsewhere.
* [[Arthur Demarest]] argues in ''[[Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-521-53390-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a holistic perspective to the most recent evidence from archaeology, [[paleoecology]], and epigraphy, that no one explanation is sufficient but that a series of erratic, complex events, including loss of soil fertility, drought and rising levels of internal and external violence led to the disintegration of the courts of Mayan kingdoms, which began a spiral of decline and decay. He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today.
* Jeffrey A. McNeely has recently suggested that "a review of historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to [[over-exploit]] their forests, and that such abuse of important resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the over-exploiting society".&lt;ref&gt;McNeely, Jeffrey A. (1994) "Lessons of the past: Forests and Biodiversity" (Vol 3, No 1 1994. Biodiversity and Conservation)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]] in [http://www.theupsideofdown.com/ ''The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization''], where he considers that the fall in the [[EROEI|energy return on investments]]. The energy expended to energy yield ratio is central to limiting the survival of civilizations. The degree of social complexity is associated strongly, he suggests, with the amount of disposable energy environmental, economic and technological systems allow. When this amount decreases civilizations either have to access new energy sources or they will collapse.
* [[Feliks Koneczny]] in his work "On the Plurality of Civilizations"  calls his study the science on civilizations. Civilizations fall not because they must or there exist some cyclical or a "biological" life span. There still exist two ancient civilizations&amp;nbsp;– Brahmin-Hindu and Chinese&amp;nbsp;– which are not ready to fall any time soon. Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot be mixed into hybrids, an inferior civilization when given equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome it. One of Koneczny's claims in his study on civilizations is that "a person cannot be civilized in two or more ways" without falling into what he calls an "abcivilized state" (as in abnormal). He also stated that when two or more civilizations exist next to one another and as long as they are vital, they will be in an existential combat imposing its own "method of organizing social life" upon the other.&lt;ref&gt;Koneczny, Feliks (1962) On the Plurality of Civilizations, Posthumous English translation by Polonica Publications, London {{ASIN|B0000CLABJ}}. Originally published in Polish, O Wielości Cywilizacyj, Gebethner &amp; Wolff, Kraków 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Absorbing alien "method of organizing social life" that is civilization and giving it equal rights yields a process of decay and decomposition.

Political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel P., ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'', (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;, has argued that the defining characteristic of the 21st century will be a [[clash of civilizations]]. According to Huntington, conflicts between civilizations will supplant the conflicts between [[nation-state]]s and ideologies that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries. These views have been strongly challenged by others like [[Edward Said]], Muhammed Asadi and [[Amartya Sen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selvesandothers.org/article15618.html |title=A Critique of Huntington's "Clash of Civilizations" |last=Asadi |first=Muhammed |date=22 January 2007 |publisher=Selves and Others |accessdate=23 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426042806/http://www.selvesandothers.org/article15618.html |archivedate=26 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Pippa Norris]] have argued that the "true clash of civilizations" between the Muslim world and the West is caused by the Muslim rejection of the West's more liberal sexual values, rather than a difference in political ideology, although they note that this lack of tolerance is likely to lead to an eventual rejection of (true) democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/2003/0304clash.htm|title=The True Clash of Civilizations|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|author2=Pippa Norris|date=March–April 2003|publisher=Global Policy Forum|accessdate=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Identity and Violence'' Sen questions if people should be divided along the lines of a supposed "civilization", defined by religion and culture only. He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make up people and leads to a focus on differences.

Cultural Historian [[Morris Berman]] suggests in ''Dark Ages America: the End of Empire'' that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness―extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth―have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable. Politically associated with over-reach, and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially, economically and politically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Morris (2007), ''Dark Ages America: the End of Empire'' (W.W. Norton)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although developed in much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner, [[Jane Jacobs]] who argues that the five pillars of United States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jane (2005), ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Vintage)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some environmental scientists also see the world entering a [[Planetary Phase of Civilization]], characterized by a shift away from independent, disconnected nation-states to a world of increased global connectivity with worldwide institutions, environmental challenges, economic systems, and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionsociety.org/pages/oo/sidebars/America/Rockefeller.html Orion Thoughts on America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515112558/http://www.orionsociety.org/pages/oo/sidebars/America/Rockefeller.html |date=15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo/backissue/s2006/laszlo-1.shtml Kosmos Journal Paths to Planetary Civilization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712162009/http://www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo/backissue/s2006/laszlo-1.shtml |date=12 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to better understand what a Planetary Phase of Civilization might look like in the current context of declining natural resources and increasing consumption, the [[Global scenario group]] used [[scenario analysis]] to arrive at three archetypal futures: Barbarization, in which increasing conflicts result in either a fortress world or complete societal breakdown; Conventional Worlds, in which market forces or policy reform slowly precipitate more sustainable practices; and a Great Transition, in which either the sum of fragmented [[Eco-Communalism]] movements add up to a sustainable world or globally coordinated efforts and initiatives result in a new [[sustainability]] paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/Great_Transitions.pdf GTinitiative.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814021505/http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/Great_Transitions.pdf |date=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural critic]] and author [[Derrick Jensen]] argues that modern civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful, unsustainable, and self-destructive fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2006), "Endgame: The Problem of Civilization", Vol 1 &amp; Vol 2 (Seven Stories Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Defending his definition both linguistically and historically, he defines civilization as "a culture... that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities", with "cities" defined as "people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2006), "Endgame: The Problem of Civilization", Vol 1 (Seven Stories Press), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources. Therefore, civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and, to maintain these, highly militarized, hierarchically structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles.

The [[Kardashev scale]] classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness. The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist (see also: [[Civilizations and the Future]] and [[Space civilization]]).

{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}
A '''classic''' is an outstanding example of a particular style; something of [[Masterpiece|lasting worth]] or with a timeless quality; of the first or [[Literary merit|highest quality]], class, or rank&lt;ref name="dref" /&gt; &amp;ndash; something that [[Exemplification|exemplifies]] its [[Class (philosophy)|class]]. The word can be an [[adjective]] (a ''classic'' car) or a [[noun]] (a ''classic'' of English literature). It denotes a particular quality in art, architecture, literature, design, technology, or other cultural artifacts. In commerce, products are named 'classic' to denote a long-standing popular version or model, to distinguish it from a newer variety. ''Classic'' is used to describe many major, long-standing sporting events. Colloquially, an everyday occurrence (e.g. a joke or mishap) may be described in some dialects of English as 'an absolute classic'.

"Classic" should not be confused with ''classical'', which refers specifically to certain cultural styles, especially in [[Classical music|music]] and [[Classical architecture|architecture]]: styles generally taking inspiration from the [[Classical tradition]], hence [[classicism]].

==The Classics==
{{main article|Classics}}
The [[classics]] are the literature of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], known as [[classical antiquity]], and once the principal subject studied in the [[humanities]].  Classics (without the definite article) can refer to the study of philosophy, literature, history and the arts of the ancient world, as in "reading classics at Cambridge". From that usage came the more general concept of 'classic'.&lt;ref name="dref"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/classic] Definition of classic at dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese classics]] occupy a similar position in [[Chinese culture]], and various other cultures have their own classics.

==Cultural classics==
Books, films and music particularly may become ''a classic'' but a painting would more likely be called a [[masterpiece]]. A classic is often something old that is still popular. Some examples would be the book ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' by [[Mark Twain]], the 1941 film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and the song [[Heartbreak Hotel]] by [[Elvis Presley]]. Lists of classics are long and wide-ranging, and would vary depending on personal opinion. [[Classic rock]] is a popular radio format, playing a repertoire of old but familiar recordings.

A contemporary work may be hailed as an ''instant classic'', but the criteria for classic status tends to include the test of time. The term "classic" is in fact often generalized to refer to any work of a certain age, regardless of whether they are any good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cult classic]] may be well known but is only favored by a minority.

==Science and technology==
A well known and reliable procedure, such as a demonstration of well-established scientific principle, may be described as classic: e.g. the [[cartesian diver]] experiment.

==Consumer artifacts==
Manufacturers frequently describe their products as classic, to distinguish the original from a new variety, or to imply qualities in the product – although the [[Ford Consul Classic]], a car manufactured 1961–1963, has the "classic" tag for no apparent reason. The [[iPod classic]] was simply called the iPod until the sixth generation, when ''classic'' was added to the name because other designs were also available – an example of a [[retronym]]. ''Coca-Cola Classic'' is the name used for the relaunch of [[Coca-Cola]] after the failure of the [[New Coke]] recipe change. Similarly, the [[Classic (transit bus)]], a transit bus manufactured from 1982–97, succeeded an unpopular futuristic design.

A classic can be something old that remains prized or valuable (but not an [[antique]]). [[Classic car]]s, for example, are recognised by various collectors' organisations such as the [[Classic Car Club of America]], who regulate the qualifying attributes that constitute classic status.

==Sport==
Many sporting events take the name ''classic'':

*Horse races, e.g. [[British Classic Races]]
*Snooker tournaments e.g. the [[Wuxi Classic]]
*College Basketball e.g. the [[Charleston Classic]]
*Major League Baseball All-Star Game e.g. the [[Midsummer Classic]]
*[[World Baseball Classic]]
*National Hockey League, the [[Winter Classic]].
*Cycling, the [[Classic cycle races]]

In Spanish-speaking countries, the term "Clásico" refers to a match between two [[Association football|football]] teams known as traditional rivals, e.g. [[El Clásico]] in Spain.&lt;sup&gt;rr&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1051">'''Cognitive adequacy''' is a term proposed by [[Rein Raud]] as a standard of judging [[Bandwagon effect|cultural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Raud|first=Rein|publisher=Polity Books|year=2016|isbn=9781509511242|location=Cambridge|pages=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this method, a cultural phenomenon is cognitively adequate if it provides the means of solving certain problems in a certain [[Social environment|socio-cultural context]]. This is true even when that solution is, according to other criteria, wrong. For example, before the [[Great Depression]] in the US many people thought that it is cognitively adequate to think of getting rich quickly through [[land speculation]]. All cultural phenomena are replaced by others when they are no longer cognitively adequate. For example, when a community has embraced a new religion, or when science has displaced religion as the primary explanatory discourse for their world.

'''Collectivism''' is a cultural value that is characterized by emphasis on cohesiveness among individuals and prioritization of the group over self. Individuals or groups that subscribe to a collectivistic worldview tend to find common values and goals as particularly salient&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=S.

C.|publisher=Westview Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Boulder, CO|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meta-analytic findings support that collectivism shows a consistent association with discrete values, interpersonal patterns of interaction, cognition, perception and self-construal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oyserman, D., Coon, H., Kemmelmeier, M.|first=|date=2002|title=Rethinking individualism and collectivism: evaluation of theoretical assumptions and meta-analyses|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivism is often discussed alongside the cultural value of [[individualism]], but these are two distinct concepts and are not considered to be opposites.

== Origins and historical perspectives ==
The German sociologist Tönnies described an early model of collectivism and individualism using the terms ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) and ''Gesellschaft'' (society).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community and association|last=Tönnies|first=F.|publisher=Harper Torchbooks|year=1957 |orig-year=1887|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gemeinschaft'' relationships, in which communalism is prioritized, were thought to be characteristic of small, rural village communities. An anthropologist, Redfield (1941) echoed this notion in work contrasting folk society with urban society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The folk culture of Yucatán|last=Redfield|first=R.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1941|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] (1930) contrasted collectivism and individualism through the lens of religion, believing that Protestants were more individualistic and self-reliant compared to Catholics, who endorsed hierarchical, interdependent relationships among people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism|last=Weber|first=M.|publisher=Routledge|year=1930|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geert Hofstede|Hofstede]] (1980) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism. Hofstede conceptualized collectivism and individualism as part of a single continuum, with each cultural construct representing an opposite pole. The author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture's consequences|last=Hofstede|first=G.|publisher=Sage|year=1980|isbn=|location=Beverly Hills|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion that collectivism-individualism is unidimensional has been challenged by contemporary theorists.

=== Marxism–Leninism ===
{{Main|New Soviet man}}
Collectivism was an important part of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology in the [[Soviet Union]], where it played a key part in forming the New Soviet man, willingly sacrificing his or her life for the good of the collective. Terms such as "collective" and "the masses" were frequently used in the official language and praised in [[agitprop]] literature, for example by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] (''Who needs a "1"'') and [[Bertolt Brecht]] ([[The Decision (play)|The Decision]], [[Man Equals Man]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|last=Overy|first=Richard|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-393-02030-4|location=|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horn|first=Eva|date=2006|title=Actors/Agents: Bertolt Brecht and the Politics of Secrecy|url=|journal=Grey Room|volume=24|pages=38–55|doi=10.1162/grey.2006.1.24.38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology and measurement ==
The construct of collectivism is represented in empirical literature under several different names. Most commonly, the term interdependent self-construal is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markus, H. R., &amp; Kitayama, S.|first=|date=1991|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=98|pages=224–253|via=|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other phrases used to describe the concept of collectivism-individualism include allocentrism-idiocentrism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Allocentric vs. idiocentric social behavior: A major cultural difference between Hispanics and mainstream (Technical reports)|last=Triandis|first=H. C.|publisher=Department of Psychology, University of Illinois|year=1983|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; collective-private self,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trafimow, D., [[Triandis, H. C.]], &amp; Goto, S. G.|first=|date=1991|title=Some tests of the distinction between the private self and the collective self|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=60|pages=649–665|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.5.649}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as subtypes of collectivism-individualism (meaning, vertical and horizontal subtypes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Triandis, H. C., Bhawuk, D. P. S., &amp; Gelfand, M. J.|first=|date=1995|title=Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism: A theoretical and measurement refinement|url=|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|volume=29|pages=240–275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inconsistent terminology is thought to account for some of the difficulty in effectively synthesizing the empirical literature on collectivism.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taras et al.|first=|date=2014|title=Opposite Ends of the Same Stick? Multi-Method Test of the Dimensionality of Individualism and Collectivism|url=|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=45 | issue = 2 |pages=213–245|via=|doi=10.1177/0022022113509132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, collectivism is measured via self-report questionnaire. Meta-analytic findings suggest that there are six instruments that have been used to measure collectivism (and the related construct of individualism) in a manner that best reflects current theoretical thinking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Gudykunst and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gudykunst, W. G., Matsumoto, Y., Ting-Toomey, S., &amp; Nishida, T.|first=|date=1996|title=The influence of cultural individualism-collectivism, self-construals, and individual values on communication styles across cultures|url=|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=22|pages=510–543|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1996.tb00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a 28-item measurement tool that rates items on a scale from 1-7. Interdependent and independent self-construal subscales are produced. Sample items from the interdependent subscale include, "I maintain harmony in the groups of which I am a member" and "I will sacrifice my self-interest for the benefit of the group."
* Kim and Leung developed the Revised Self-Construal Scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A revised Self-Construal Scale|last=Kim, M. S., &amp; Leung, K.|first=|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|year=1997|isbn=|location=Honolulu|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a 28-item measure that produces Interdependent and independent self-construal subscales. Sample items from the interdependent subscale include, "I feel uncomfortable disagreeing with my group" and "My relationships with others in my group are more important than my personal accomplishments."
* Oyserman&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; developed a measure containing 18 items rated on a five-point Likert scale which produces collectivism and individualism subscales. An example item from the collectivism subscale include "In order to really understand who I am, you must see me with members of my group."
* Singelis developed the 24-item Self-Construal Scale,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; which rates items on a scale from 1-7. Items from the interdependent subscale include, "My happiness depends on the happiness of those around me" and "If my brother or sister fails, I feel responsible."
* Takata&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takata, T.|first=|date=1993|title=Social comparison and formation of self-concept in adolescent: Some findings about Japanese college students|url=|journal=Japanese Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=41|pages=339–348|via=|doi=10.5926/jjep1953.41.3_339}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a 20-item measure that was originally published in Japanese. It contains a collectivism and an individualism subscale. 
* Triandis&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; developed a 12-item measure that produces collectivism and individualism subscales. The person completing the question is asked "Are you a person who is likely to..." and then asked to rate a number of scenarios. Examples of scenarios that if endorsed would indicate greater adherence to collectivism include "Stay with friends, rather than at a hotel, when you go to another town (even if you have plenty of money)."

== Theoretical models ==
In one critical model of collectivism, Markus and Kitayama&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markus, H. R., &amp; Kitayma, S.|first=|date=2010|title=Cultures and selves: A cycle of mutual constitution|url=|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=5 | issue = 4 |pages=420–430|via=|doi=10.1177/1745691610375557}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe the interdependent (i.e., collectivistic) self as fundamentally connected to the social context. As such, one's sense of self depends on and is defined in part by those around them and is primarily manifested in public, overt behavior. As such, the organization of the self is guided by using others as a reference. That is, an interdependent individual uses the unexpressed thoughts, feelings, and beliefs of another person with whom they have a relationship with, as well as the other person's behaviors, to make decisions about their own internal attributes and actions.

Markus and Kitayama also contributed to the literature by challenging Hofstede's unidimensional model of collectivism-individualism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The authors conceptualized these two constructs bidimensionally, such that both collectivism and individualism can be endorsed independently and potentially to the same degree. This notion has been echoed by other prominent theorists in the field.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singelis|first=T.|date=1994|title=The measurement of independent and interdependent self-construal|url=|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=20|pages=580–591|via=|doi=10.1177/0146167294205014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=INDCOL (Unpublished research scale on individualism and collectivism)|last=Triandis|first=H. C.|publisher=University of Illinois|year=1994|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have expanded the collectivism-individualism framework to include a more comprehensive view. Specifically, Triandis and colleagues introduced a theoretical model in which incorporates the notion of relational contexts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singelis, T. M., Triandis, H. C., Bhawuk, D. P. S., &amp; Gelfand, M. J.|first=|date=1995|title=Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism: A theoretical and measurement refinement|url=|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|volume=29|pages=240–275|via=|doi=10.1177/106939719502900302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argues that the domains of collectivism and individualism can be further described by horizontal and vertical relationships. Horizontal relationships are believed to be status-equal whereas vertical relationships are characterized as hierarchical and status-unequal. As such, horizontal collectivism is manifested as an orientation in which group harmony is highly valued and in-group members are perceived to experience equal standing. Vertical collectivism involves the prioritization of group goals over individual goals, implying a hierarchical positioning of the self in relation to the overarching in-group. The horizontal-vertical individualism-collectivism model has received empirical support and has been used to explore patterns within cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Komarraju, M., &amp; Cokley, K. O.|first=|date=2008|title=Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism–collectivism: A comparison of African Americans and European Americans|url=|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=14|pages=336–343|via=|doi=10.1037/1099-9809.14.4.336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalwani, A.

Originated by W. E. B. DuBois,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The souls of Black folk|last=DuBois|first=W. E. B.|publisher=Signet|year=1969 |orig-year=1903 |isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; some researchers have adopted a historical perspective on the emergence of collectivism among some cultural groups. DuBois and others argued that oppressed minority groups contend with internal division, meaning that the development of self-identity for individuals from these groups involves the integration of one's own perceptions of their group as well as typically negative, societal views of their group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaines, Jr., S. O., &amp; Reed, E. S.|first=|date=1995|title=Prejudice: From Allport to DuBois|url=|journal=American Psychologist|volume=50 | issue = 2 |pages=96–103|via=|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.50.2.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This division is thought to impact goal formation such that people from marginalized groups tend to emphasize collectivistic over individualistic values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black men|last=Asante|first=M.

Some organizational research has found different variations of collectivism. These include institutional collectivism and in-group collectivism. Institutional collectivism is the idea that a work environment creates a sense of collectivist nature due to similar statuses and similar rewards, such as earning the same salary. In-group collectivism is the idea that an individual's chosen group of people, such as family or friend groups, create a sense of collectivist nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/culture-leadership-and-organizations/book226013|title=Culture, Leadership, and Organizations|last1=House|first1=Robert J.|last2=Hanges|first2=Paul J.|last3=Javidan|first3=Mansour|last4=Dorfman|first4=Peter W.|last5=Gupta|first5=Vipin|date=2004|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-group collectivism can be referred to as family collectivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brewer|first1=Paul|last2=Venaik|first2=Sunil|date=April 2011|title=Individualism-Collectivism in Hofstede and GLOBE|url=https://www.jstor.org.db19.linccweb.org/stable/29789431|journal=Palgrave Macmillan Journals|volume=42|pages=436–445|doi=10.1057/jibs.2010.62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognition ==
A number of classic studies have demonstrated that there is a relationship between collectivism and cognition. These studies support the notion that people from collectivistic cultures tend to demonstrate a [[holistic]] cognitive style, which is reflected in processes such as memory, visual perception, attributional style, and categorization schemas. This effect has been replicated extensively by independent research groups, supporting its robustness.

*Memory: Masuda and Nisbett&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masuda, T., &amp; Nisbett, R. E.|first=|date=2001|title=Attending holistically versus analytically: comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=81 | issue = 5 |pages=922–934|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Japanese students, who were presumed to hold greater collectivistic views, demonstrated greater attention to the context in which a visual stimulus was embedded and resultantly, exhibited more holistic memory compared to North American students.
*Visual perception: During a “rod and frame” test, in which a person is asked to determine the angle of a rod in relation to a frame, [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asian]] participants were more likely be “field dependent” than Americans, meaning that they were more biased by the orientation of the frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji, L. J., Peng, K., &amp; Nisbett, R. E.|first=|date=2000|title=Culture, control, and perception of relationships in the environment|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=78|pages=943–955|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.5.943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitayama, S., Duffy, S., Kawamura, T., &amp; Larsen, J.

*Attributional style: Participants were shown a picture of a group of fish and asked to rate the reasons they believed one fish was swimming in front of the group. Chinese participants were more likely to endorse external forces (for example, “the fish is being chased”) compared to Americans, who endorsed more internal forces (for example, “the fish is a leader”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris, M., &amp; Peng, K.|first=|date=1994|title=Culture and cause: American and Chinese attributions for social and physical events|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=67 | issue = 6 |pages=949–971|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.949}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Categorization schemas: Collectivism has been shown to influence how people sort and group. Individuals who are more collectivistic tend to think about the relationship of objects and sort on that basis rather than by shared properties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiu|first=L. H.|date=1972|title=A cross-cultural comparison of cognitive styles in Chinese and American children|url=|journal=International Journal of Psychology|volume=7 | issue = 4 |pages=235–242|via=|doi=10.1080/00207597208246604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji, L.

When probed about the reasons for this grouping, it was explained that cows eat grass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Development of self-concept ==
An individual's self-concept can be fundamentally shaped by cultural values. Such processes typically begin in childhood and adolescence and parents are often one of the first critical inputs that shape a child's sense of self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Perspectives on Human Development|last=Chiao|first=J. Y.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=|editor1=N. Budwig|editor2=E. Turiel|editor3=P. D. Zelazo|location=|pages=|chapter=Cultural neuroscience of the developing brain in adolescence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents with more collectivistic world views have been shown to speak and interact with their children in a manner that conveys the core tenets of collectivism, such as emphasis on the relationships between objects and interpersonal connections. As such, youth who are parented in this manner tend to develop a sense of self that is defined in relation to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang, Q., Shao, Y., &amp; Li, Y. J.|first=|date=2010|title="My way or mom's way?" The bilingual and bicultural self in Hong Kong Chinese children and adolescents|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=81 | issue = 2 |pages=555–567|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01415.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of self also has been found to be reflected in patterns of structural and functional connectivity in the brain. For example, generally the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is more active when adults think about themselves compared to when they think about someone else. However, for adults who endorse collectivism, the MPFC actually shows greater response when they think about themselves in the context of their close relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner, D. D., Haxby, J. V., &amp; Heatherton, T. F.|first=|date=2012|title=The representation of self and person knowledge in the medial prefrontal cortex|url=|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|volume=3 | issue = 4 |pages=451–470|via=|doi=10.1002/wcs.1183|pmc=3375705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Macro-level effects ==
Cultural views are believed to have a reciprocal relationship with macro-level processes such as economics, social change, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture Shift in Advanced Industrial Society|last=Inglehart|first=R.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modernization and Postmodernization: Cultural, Economic, and Political Change in 43 Societies|last=Inglehart|first=R.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[collectivism-individualism dimension]] of culture influences [[economic development]]: collectivistic culture theoretically promotes growth. For instance, the influence of the collectivist dimension of culture can be observed among the [[European Union]] economies: countries which societies are less individualistic record faster economic development, at the expense of individual liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maziarz|first=Mariusz|date=2015|title=Collectivism and economic development - a causal analysis|url=http://www.socioeconomica.info/jspui/bitstream/11171/180/1/2.%20Maziarz.pdf|journal=Socioeconomica|volume=4 | issue = 8 |pages=277–290|via=|doi=10.12803/sjseco.48133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Societal changes in China exemplifies this well. Beginning in the early 1980s, China experienced dramatic expansion of economic and social structures, resulting in greater income inequality between families, less involvement of the government in social welfare programs, and increased competition for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming China: Economic reform and its political implications|last=Zhang|first=W. W.|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding with these changes was a shift in ideology among Chinese citizens, especially among those who were younger, away from collectivism (the prevailing cultural ideology) toward individualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cai, X., &amp; Wu, P.|first=|date=1999|title=A study of the modernity of social concept of younger students in China|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-XLKX199902013.htm|journal=Psychological Science |location=China|volume=22|pages=148–152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=M.|date=1999|title=A comparative study of the value outlook of Chinese adolescent students|url=|journal=Journal of Southwest China Normal University (Philosophy and Social Sciences)|volume=25|pages=83–88|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; China also saw this shift reflected in educational policies, such that teachers were encouraged to promote the development of their students’ individual opinions and self-efficacy, which prior to the aforementioned economic changes, was not emphasized in Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu, X., &amp; Peng, L.|first=|date=2001|title=Reflection on parents' educational beliefs in the new century|url=|journal=Theory and Practice of Education|volume=21|pages=62–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu, R.|first=|date=2002|title=On the reform of elementary school education in China|url=|journal=Educational Exploration|volume=129|pages=56–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to study the association of collectivism and political views and behaviors has largely occurred at the aggregate national level. However, more isolated political movements have also adopted a collectivistic framework. For example, [[Collectivist anarchism]] (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. ''Marx in Context''. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarchist]] doctrine that advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54" /&gt;

{{sociology}}
A '''counterculture''' (also written '''counter-culture''') is a [[subculture]] whose values and norms of behavior differ substantially from those of mainstream society, often in opposition to mainstream cultural [[mores]].&lt;ref name=MWebster/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eric Donald Hirsch 1993 p 419"&gt;Eric Donald Hirsch. ''The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy''. Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|0-395-65597-8}}. (1993) p. 419. "Members of a cultural protest that began in the U.S. In the 1960s and Europe before fading in the 1970s... fundamentally a cultural rather than a [[political protest]]."&lt;/ref&gt;  A countercultural movement expresses the ethos and aspirations of a specific population during a well-defined era. When oppositional forces reach [[critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]], countercultures can trigger dramatic cultural changes.  Prominent examples of countercultures in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] include [[Romanticism]] (1790–1840), [[Bohemianism]] (1850–1910), the more fragmentary counterculture of the [[Beat Generation]] (1944–1964), followed by the globalized [[counterculture of the 1960s]] (1964–1974), usually associated with the [[hippie]] subculture&lt;ref name=HarvardTR/&gt; and the diversified [[punk subculture]] of the 1970s and 1980s.

==Definition and characteristics==
[[John Milton Yinger]] originated the term "contraculture" in his 1960 article in ''[[American Sociological Review]]''. Yinger suggested the use of the term contraculture "wherever the normative system of a group contains, as a primary element, a theme of conflict with the values of the total society, where personality variables are directly involved in the development and maintenance of the group's values, and wherever its norms can be understood only by reference to the relationships of the group to a surrounding dominant culture." &lt;ref&gt;"Contraculture and Subculture" by J. Milton Yinger, ''American Sociological Review'',
Vol. 25, No. 5 (Oct., 1960) https://www.jstor.org/stable/2090136&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have attributed the ''counterculture'' to [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]],&lt;ref name=HarvardTR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Social critic Theodore Roszak *58 explores intolerance in new novel about gay Jewish writer | first = Andrea| last = Gollin | url = http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/archive_new/PAW02-03/14-0423/books.html | publisher = PAW Online | date = April 23, 2003 | accessdate = June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRbook/&gt; author of ''[[The Making of a Counter Culture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;His conception of the counterculture is discussed in Whiteley, 2012 &amp; 2014 and Bennett, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It became prominent in the news media amid the [[social revolution]] that swept the [[Americas]], [[Western Europe]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="MWebster"&gt;"counterculture", ''Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary'', 2008, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/counterculture MWCCul].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HarvardTR"&gt;F. X. Shea, S. J., "Reason and the Religion of the Counter-Culture", ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'', Vol. 66/1 (1973), pp. 95–111, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1509351 JSTOR-3B2-X].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TRbook"&gt;[[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Roszak, Theodore]], ''The Making of a Counter Culture: Reflections on the Technocratic Society and Its Youthful Opposition'', 1968/1969, Doubleday, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-385-07329-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars differ in the characteristics and specificity they attribute to "counterculture". "Mainstream" culture is of course also difficult to define, and in some ways becomes identified and understood through contrast with counterculture. Counterculture might oppose mass culture (or "media culture"),&lt;ref&gt;Gelder, ''Subcultures'' (2007) p. 4. "...to the banalities of mass cultural forms".&lt;/ref&gt; or middle-class culture and values.&lt;ref&gt;Hodkinson and Deicke, ''Youth Cultures'' (2007), p. 205. "...opposition to, the middle-class establishment of adults."&lt;/ref&gt; Counterculture is sometimes conceptualized in terms of generational conflict and rejection of older or adult values.&lt;ref&gt;Hebdige, ''Subculture'' (1979), p. 127. "defining themselves against the parent culture."&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterculture may or may not be explicitly political. It typically involves criticism or rejection of currently powerful institutions, with accompanying hope for a better life or a new society.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Jefferson, ''Resistance Through Rituals'' (1991), p. 61. "They make articulate their opposition to dominant values and institutions—even when, as frequently occurred, this does not take the form of an overtly political response."&lt;/ref&gt; It does not look favorably on party politics or [[authoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazlehurst &amp; Hazlehurst, ''Gangs and Youth Subcultures'' (1998), p. 59. "There does seem to be some general commitment towards antiauthoritarianism, a rejection of the traditional party political system which is considered irrelevant."&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural development can also be affected by way of counterculture. Scholars such as Joanne Martin and Caren Siehl, deem counterculture and cultural development as "a balancing act, [that] some core values of a counterculture should present a direct challenge to the core values of a dominant culture". Therefore, a prevalent culture and a counterculture should coexist in an uneasy symbiosis, holding opposite positions on valuable issues that are essentially important to each of them. According to this theory, a counterculture can contribute a plethora of useful functions for the prevalent culture, such as "articulating the foundations between appropriate and inappropriate behavior and providing a safe haven for the development of innovative ideas".&lt;ref&gt;''Organizational Culture and Counterculture: An Uneasy Symbiosis'' (1983), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a  "fringe culture" expands and grows into a counterculture by defining its own values in opposition to mainstream norms.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Countercultures tend to peak, then go into decline, leaving a lasting impact on mainstream cultural values. Their life cycles include phases of rejection, growth, partial acceptance and absorption into the mainstream.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  During the late 1960s, hippies became the largest and most visible countercultural group in the United States.&lt;ref name="Yablonsky, Lewis 1968 pp 21-37"&gt;Yablonsky, Lewis (1968), The Hippie Trip, New York: Western Publishing, Inc., {{ISBN|978-0595001163}}, pp. 21–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The "cultural shadows" left by the Romantics, Bohemians, Beats and Hippies remain visible in contemporary Western culture.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

According to Sheila Whiteley, "recent developments in sociological theory complicate and problematize theories developed in the 1960s, with digital technology, for example, providing an impetus for new understandings of counterculture".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Whiteley, 2012 &amp; 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Bennett writes that "despite the theoretical arguments that can be raised against the sociological value of counterculture as a meaningful term for categorising social action, like [[subculture]], the term lives on as a concept in social and [[cultural theory]]… [to] become part of a received, mediated memory". However, "this involved not simply the utopian but also the dystopian and that while festivals such as those held at [[Monterey]] and [[Woodstock]] might appear to embrace the former, the deaths of such iconic figures as [[Brian Jones]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jim Morrison]] and [[Janis Joplin]], the nihilistic mayhem at [[Altamont Free Concert|Altamont]], and the shadowy figure of [[Charles Manson]] cast a darker light on its underlying agenda, one that reminds us that ‘pathological issues [are] still very much at large in today's world".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Andy Bennett, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
The counterculture of the 1960s and early 1970s generated its own unique brand of notable literature, including comics and cartoons, and sometimes referred to as the [[underground press]]. In the United States, this includes the work of [[Robert Crumb]] and [[Gilbert Shelton]], and includes [[Mr. Natural (comics)|Mr. Natural]]; [[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']]; ''[[Fritz the Cat]]''; [[Fat Freddy's Cat]]; [[Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]; the album cover art for ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]''; and in several countries contributions to ''[[International Times]]'', ''[[The Village Voice]]'', and [[Oz (magazine)|''Oz'' magazine]]. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, these comics and magazines were available for purchase in [[head shop]]s along with items like beads, incense, cigarette papers, tie-dye clothing, [[Blacklight paint|Day-Glo]] posters, books, etc.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, some of these shops selling hippie items also became cafés where hippies could hang out, chat, smoke [[marijuana]], read books, etc., e.g. [[Gandalf's Garden]] in the [[King's Road]], London, which also published a magazine of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunrise-press.co.uk/Sunrise_Press/A_psychedelic_trip_around_London_page_1.html ''London a Map of the Underground''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825021903/http://www.sunrise-press.co.uk/Sunrise_Press/A_psychedelic_trip_around_London_page_1.html |date=August 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another such hippie/anarchist bookshop was [[psychedelic mushroom|Mushroom]] Books, tucked away in the [[Lace Market]] area of [[Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesparrowsnest.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19:keith-leonard-1948-2009&amp;catid=2:blog&amp;Itemid=11 ''Mushroom Books, Nottingham'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120527014115/http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/Founder-radical-bookshop-dies/article-1254803-detail/article.html ''Founder of radical bookshop dies'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
Some genres tend to challenge societies with their content that is meant to outright question the norms within cultures and even create change usually towards a more modern way of thought. More often than not, sources of these controversies can be found in art such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] whose piece ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was meant to be "a calculated attack on the most basic conventions of art"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Making Sense of Marcel Duchamp|url = http://www.understandingduchamp.com/|website = www.understandingduchamp.com|accessdate = November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1917. Contentious artists like [[Banksy]] base most of their works off of mainstream media and culture to bring pieces that usually shock viewers into thinking about their piece in more detail and the themes behind them. A great example can be found in [[Dismaland]], the biggest project of "[[anarchism]]" to be organised and exhibited which showcases multiple works such as an "iconic [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] princess's horse-drawn pumpkin carriage, [appearing] to re-enact the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Many are finding this shocking piece hidden inside Banksy's 'Dismaland' gut-wrenching|url = http://www.techinsider.io/banky-dismaland-cinderella-princess-diana-2015-8|website = Tech Insider|accessdate = November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] as a symbol of the counterculture movement in the city]]Counterculture is very much evident in music particularly on the basis of the separation of genres into those considered acceptable and within the status quo and those not. Since many minorities groups are already considered counterculture, the music they create and produce may reflect their sociopolitical realities and their musical culture may be adopted as a social expression of their counterculture. This is reflected in dancehall with the concept of base frequencies and base culture in Henriques's "Sonic diaspora", where he expounds that "base denotes crude, debased, unrefined, vulgar, and even animal" for the Jamaican middle class and is associated with the "bottom-end, low frequencies…basic lower frequencies and embodied resonances distinctly inferior to the higher notes" that appear in dancehall.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Henriques (2008) ''Sonic diaspora, vibrations, and rhythm: thinking through the sounding of the Jamaican dancehall session, ''African and Black Diaspora: An International Journal'', 1:2, 215–236, DOI: 10.1080/17528630802224163. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17528630802224163&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Henriques, "base culture is bottom-up popular, street culture, generated by an urban underclass surviving almost entirely outside the formal economy".&lt;ref&gt;Julian Henriques (2008) Sonic diaspora, vibrations, and rhythm: thinking through the sounding of the Jamaican dancehall session, African and Black Diaspora: An International Journal, 1:2, 215–236, DOI: 10.1080/17528630802224163. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17528630802224163&lt;/ref&gt; That the music is low frequency sonically and regarded as reflective of a lower culture shows the influential connection between counterculture and the music produced. It should also be noted that while music may be considered base and counter culture, it may actually enjoy a lot of popularity which can be seen by the labelling of hip hop as a counter culture genre, despite it being one of the most commercially successful and high charting genres.

=== Assimilation ===
Many of these artists though once being taboo, have been assimilated into culture and are no longer a source of moral panic since they don't cross overtly controversial topics or challenge staples of current culture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stop Fooling Yourself: Coachella Style Is Trash—"Counterculture" and "subculture" have been assimilated into a commercialized "pop culture" product|url = http://ca.complex.com/style/2015/04/coachella-style-is-trash/counterculture-and-commercialization|website = Complex CA|accessdate = November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sociology in a Changing World|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U41tCgAAQBAJ|publisher = Cengage Learning|date = January 31, 2011|isbn = 9781133172857|first = William|last = Kornblum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of being a topic to fear, they have initiated subtle trends that other artists and sources of media may follow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== LGBT ==
[[Gay liberation]] (considered a [[wikt:precursor|precursor]] of various modern [[LGBT social movements]]) was known for its links to the counterculture of the time (e.g. groups like the [[Radical Faeries]]), and for the gay liberationists' intent to transform or abolish fundamental institutions of society such as [[gender]] and the [[nuclear family]];&lt;ref name="HoffmanIntro"&gt;Hoffman, Amy (2007) ''An Army of Ex-Lovers: My life at the Gay Community News''. University of Massachusetts Press. pp.xi-xiii. {{ISBN|978-1558496217}}&lt;/ref&gt; in general, the politics were radical, [[anti-racism|anti-racist]], and [[anti-capitalist]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/glf-london.html|title=Gay Liberation Front: Manifesto. London|origyear=1971|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve such liberation, [[consciousness raising]] and [[direct action]] were employed.&lt;ref name="HoffmanIntro" /&gt;

At the outset of the 20th century, [[homosexual]] acts were punishable offenses in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;See [[sodomy law]] for more information&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing public attitude was that homosexuality was a moral failing that should be punished, as exemplified by [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1895 trial and imprisonment for "gross indecency". But even then, there were dissenting views. [[Sigmund Freud]] publicly expressed his opinion that homosexuality was "assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development".&lt;ref name="ErnstLFreud"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1992|pp=423–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles Kaiser's ''The Gay Metropolis'', there were already semi-public gay-themed gatherings by the mid-1930s in the United States (such as the annual [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] balls held during the [[Harlem Renaissance]]). There were also [[gay bar|bars]] and [[gay bathhouse|bathhouses]] that catered to gay clientele and adopted warning procedures (similar to those used by [[Prohibition]]-era [[speakeasy|speakeasies]]) to warn customers of police raids. But homosexuality was typically subsumed into [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] culture, and was not a significant movement in itself.&lt;ref name="Gay Metro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=C|year=1997|title=The Gay Metropolis|publisher=New York: Harcourt Brace|isbn=0-15-600617-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, a genuine [[gay culture]] began to take root, albeit very discreetly, with its own styles, attitudes and behaviors and industries began catering to this growing demographic group. For example, publishing houses cranked out [[pulp novel]]s like ''[[The Velvet Underground (book)|The Velvet Underground]]'' that were targeted directly at gay people. By the early 1960s, openly gay political organizations such as the [[Mattachine Society]] were formally protesting abusive treatment toward gay people, challenging the entrenched idea that homosexuality was an aberrant condition, and calling for the decriminalization of homosexuality. Despite very limited sympathy, American society began at least to acknowledge the existence of a sizable population of gays. The film ''[[The Boys in the Band]]'', for example, featured negative portrayals of gay men, but at least recognized that they did in fact fraternize with each other (as opposed to being isolated, solitary predators who "victimized" straight men).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Disco|Disco music]] in large part rose out of the New York gay club scene of the early 1970s as a reaction to the stigmatization of gays and other outside groups such as blacks by the counterculture of that era.&lt;ref name="alternative to rock'n'roll"&gt;(2007) ''The 1970s'', {{ISBN|978-0-313-33919-6}}, p.203–204: "During the late 1960s various male counterculture groups, most notably gay, but also heterosexual black and Latino, created an alternative to rock'n'roll, which was dominated by white—and presumably heterosexual—men.

Another element of [[LGBT]] counter-culture that began in the 1970s—and continues today—is the [[Womyn's land|lesbian land]], landdyke movement, or [[womyn's land]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land." ''Journal of Homosexuality'', 56 (2009):719.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical feminists inspired by the [[back-to-the-land]] initiative and migrated to rural areas to create communities that were often female-only and/or lesbian communes.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, A., and Zajicek, A. M. "The history of the contemporary grassroots women's movement in northwest Arkansas, 1970–2000." Fayetteville, AR&lt;/ref&gt; "Free Spaces" are defined by Sociologist Francesca Polletta as "small-scale settings within a community or movement that are removed from the direct control of dominant groups, are voluntarily participated in, and generate the cultural challenge that precedes or accompanies political mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;Polletta, Francesca. "Free Spaces in Collective Action" Theory and Society, 28/1. (Feb 1999):1.&lt;/ref&gt; Women came together in Free Spaces like music festivals, activist groups and collectives to share ideas with like-minded people and to explore the idea of the lesbian land movement. The movement is closely tied to [[eco-feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land." Journal of Homosexuality, 56 (2009):720-722.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four tenets of the Landdyke Movement are relationship with the land, liberation and transformation, living the politics, and bodily Freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land." Journal of Homosexuality, 56 (2009):720-719.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most importantly, members of these communities seek to live outside of a [[patriarchal society]] that puts emphasis on "beauty ideals that discipline the female body, compulsive heterosexuality, competitiveness with other women, and dependence".&lt;ref name="AnahitaSine"&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land". Journal of Homosexuality, 56 (2009):729.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of adhering typical female [[gender roles]], the women of Landdyke communities value "self-sufficiency, bodily strength, autonomy from men and patriarchal systems, and the development of lesbian-centered community".&lt;ref name="AnahitaSine" /&gt; Members of the Landdyke movement enjoy bodily freedoms that have been deemed unacceptable in the modern Western world—such as the freedom to expose their breasts, or to go without any clothing at all.&lt;ref&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land." Journal of Homosexuality, 56 (2009):734.&lt;/ref&gt;  An awareness of their impact on the Earth, and connection to nature is essential members of the Landdyke Movement's way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land". Journal of Homosexuality, 56 (2009):732.&lt;/ref&gt;

The watershed event in the American gay rights movement was the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]] in New York City. Following this event, gays and lesbians began to adopt the militant protest tactics used by [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-war]] and [[black power]] radicals to confront anti-gay ideology. Another major turning point was the 1973 decision by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] to remove homosexuality from the official list of [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Conger, J. J. (1975) "Proceedings of the American Psychological Association, Incorporated, for the year 1974: Minutes of the Annual meeting of the Council of Representatives." ''American Psychologist'', 30, 620-651.&lt;/ref&gt; Although gay radicals used pressure to force the decision, Kaiser notes that this had been an issue of some debate for many years in the psychiatric community, and that one of the chief obstacles to normalizing homosexuality was that therapists were profiting from offering dubious, unproven "cures".&lt;ref name="Gay Metro" /&gt;

The [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|AIDS epidemic]] was initially an unexpected blow to the movement, especially in North America. There was speculation that the disease would permanently drive gay life underground. Ironically, the tables were turned. Many of the early victims of the disease had been openly gay only within the confines of insular "gay ghettos" such as New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] and San Francisco's [[The Castro|Castro]]; they remained closeted in their professional lives and to their families. Many heterosexuals who thought they didn't know any gay people were confronted by friends and loved ones dying of "the gay plague" (which soon began to infect [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] people also). LGBT communities were increasingly seen not only as victims of a disease, but as victims of ostracism and hatred. Most importantly, the disease became a rallying point for a previously complacent gay community. AIDS invigorated the community politically to fight not only for a medical response to the disease, but also for wider acceptance of homosexuality in mainstream America. Ultimately, [[coming out]] became an important step for many LGBT people.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== History ==
Bill Osgerby argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the counterculture's various strands developed from earlier artistic and political movements. On both sides of the Atlantic the 1950s "Beat Generation" had fused existentialist philosophy with jazz, poetry, literature, Eastern mysticism and drugs – themes that were all sustained in the 1960s counterculture.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Osgerby, "Youth Culture" in Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds. ''A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939–2000'' (2005) pp. 127–44, quote at p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Counterculture of the 1960s|Timeline of 1960s counterculture}}
In the United States, the counterculture of the 1960s became identified with the rejection of conventional [[social norms]] of the 1950s. Counterculture youth rejected the cultural standards of their parents, especially with respect to racial [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and initial widespread support for the [[Vietnam War]],&lt;ref name="Eric Donald Hirsch 1993 p 419"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Works Covington, ''Rockin' At the Red Dog: The Dawn of Psychedelic Rock'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and, less directly, the [[Cold War]]—with many young people fearing that America's [[nuclear arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]], coupled with its involvement in Vietnam, would lead to a [[nuclear holocaust]].

In the United States, widespread tensions developed in the 1960s in American society that tended to flow along generational lines regarding the [[war]] in Vietnam, [[race relations]], [[sexual revolution|sexual mores]], women's rights, traditional modes of authority, and a [[economic materialism|materialist]] interpretation of the [[American Dream]]. White, [[middle class]] youth—who made up the bulk of the counterculture in western countries—had sufficient leisure time, thanks to widespread economic [[prosperity]], to turn their attention to [[social issues]].&lt;ref name="Conscience"/&gt; These social issues included support for [[civil rights]], [[Women's rights#Modern movements|women's rights]], and [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]] movements, and a rejection of the [[Vietnam War]]. The counterculture also had access to a media which was eager to present their concerns to a wider public. Demonstrations for [[social justice]] created far-reaching changes affecting many aspects of society.  [[Hippies]] became the largest countercultural group in the United States.&lt;ref name="Yablonsky, Lewis 1968 pp 21-37"/&gt;

Rejection of mainstream culture was best embodied in the new genres of [[psychedelic rock]] music, [[pop-art]] and new explorations in [[spirituality]]. Musicians who exemplified this era in the United Kingdom and United States included [[The Beatles]], [[Neil Young]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[The Doors]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Velvet Underground]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Who]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[The Kinks]], [[Sly and the Family Stone]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/topic/Sly-and-the-Family-Stone&lt;/ref&gt; and, in their early years, [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]. New forms of musical presentation also played a key role in spreading the counterculture, with large outdoor rock festivals being the most noteworthy.  The climactic live statement on this occurred from August 15–18, 1969, with the ''[[Woodstock]] Music Festival'' held in [[Bethel, New York]]—with 32 of [[rock music|rock]]'s and [[psychedelic rock]]'s most popular acts performing live outdoors during the sometimes rainy weekend to an audience of half a million people. ([[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]] stated 400,000 attended, half of which did not have a ticket.)&lt;ref name = "NY Times Aug 27, 1969"&gt;{{cite news | title = State Investigating Handling of Tickets At Woodstock Fair | work = New York Times | page = 45 | date = August 27, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history—with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calling it one of the ''50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6085488/woodstock_in_1969| title=Woodstock in 1969| date=June 24, 2004| accessdate=April 17, 2008| publisher=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bill Mankin, "It seems fitting… that one of the most enduring labels for the entire generation of that era was derived from a rock festival: the ‘Woodstock Generation’."&lt;ref&gt;Mankin, Bill.  [http://likethedew.com/2012/03/04/we-can-all-join-in-how-rock-festivals-helped-change-america/ ''We Can All Join In: How Rock Festivals Helped Change America'']. Like the Dew. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentiments were expressed in song lyrics and popular sayings of the period, such as "do your own thing", "[[turn on, tune in, drop out]]", "whatever turns you on", "[[Eight miles high]]", "[[Wine, women and song|sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll]]", and "[[Light My Fire|light my fire]]". Spiritually, the counterculture included interest in [[astrology]], the term "[[Age of Aquarius]]" and knowing people's [[astrological signs]] of the [[Zodiac]]. This led Theodore Roszak to state "A {{sic}} eclectic taste for [[mysticism|mystic]], [[occult]], and magical phenomena has been a marked characteristic of our [[postwar]] youth culture since the days of the [[beatnik]]s."&lt;ref name=TRbook/&gt; In the United States, even actor [[Charlton Heston]] contributed to the movement, with the statement "Don't trust anyone over thirty" (a saying coined in 1965 by activist [[Jack Weinberg]]) in the 1968 film ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''; the same year, actress and social activist [[Jane Fonda]] starred in the sexually-themed ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]''. Both actors opposed the [[Vietnam War]] during its duration, and Fonda would eventually become controversially active in the [[peace movement]].

The counterculture in the United States has been interpreted as lasting roughly from 1964 to 1972&lt;ref name="Reason"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riech|first=Robert|title=[[Reason: Why Liberals Will Win the Battle for America]]|year=2004|isbn=1-4000-4221-6|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf}} Chapter 1, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;—coincident with America's involvement in Vietnam—and reached its peak in August 1969 at the Woodstock Festival, New York, characterized in part by the film ''Easy Rider'' (1969). Unconventional or psychedelic dress; political activism; public protests; campus uprisings; pacifist then loud, defiant music; drugs; [[communitarianism|communitarian experiments]], and [[sexual liberation]] were hallmarks of the sixties counterculture—most of whose members were young, white and middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "Counterculture of the 1960s," ''Criminology Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms'', CFM Research, Jul. 2012. p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the movement divided the  population. To some Americans, these attributes reflected American ideals of [[free speech]], equality, [[world peace]], and the pursuit of happiness; to others, they reflected a self-indulgent, pointlessly rebellious, unpatriotic, and destructive assault on the country's traditional [[argument from morality|moral order]]. Authorities banned the psychedelic drug [[LSD]], restricted political gatherings, and tried to enforce bans on what they considered [[obscenity]] in books, music, theater, and other media.

The counterculture has been argued  to have diminished in the early 1970s, and some have attributed two reasons for this. First, it has been suggested that the most popular of its political goals—[[civil rights]], [[civil liberties]], [[gender equality]], [[environmentalism]], and the end of the [[Vietnam War]]—were  "accomplished" (to at least  some degree); and also that its most popular social attributes—particularly a "[[wikt:live and let live|live and let live]]" mentality in personal lifestyles (the "[[sexual revolution]]")—were co-opted by mainstream society.&lt;ref name="Conscience"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beatles"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yenne|first=Bill|title=The Beatles|year=1989|isbn=0-681-00576-9|publisher=Longmeadow Press}} pp. 46-55&lt;/ref&gt; Second, a decline of idealism and [[hedonism]] occurred as many notable counterculture figures died, the rest settled into mainstream society and started their own families, and the "magic economy" of the 1960s gave way to the [[1973–75 recession|stagflation of the 1970s]]&lt;ref name="Conscience"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Krugman|title=[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]|year=2007|isbn=0-393-06069-1|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.}} Chapter 5. Economist Paul Krugman comments on the effects of the economy on the counterculture: "In fact," he argues, "you have to wonder whether the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] [[recession]] of 1969-1971 [which nearly doubled the [[unemployment rate]]] didn't do more to end the [[hippie movement]] than the killings at [[Altamont, California|Altamont]]."&lt;/ref&gt;—the latter costing many in the  middle-classes the luxury of being able to live outside conventional [[social institution]]s. The counterculture, however, continues to influence [[social movement]]s, art, music, and society in general, and the post-1973 mainstream society has been in many ways a hybrid of the 1960s establishment and counterculture.&lt;ref name="Beatles"/&gt;

The counterculture movement has been said to be rejuvenated in a way that maintains some similarities from the Counterculture of the 1960s, but it is different as well. Photographer Steve Schapiro investigated and documented these contemporary hippie communities from 2012 to 2014. He traveled the country with his son, attending festival after festival. These findings were compiled in Schapiro’s book ''Bliss: Transformational Festivals &amp; the Neo Hippie.'' One of his most valued findings was that these “Neo Hippies” experience and encourage such a spiritual commitment to the community.

===Australia===
Australia's countercultural trend followed the one burgeoning in the US, and to a lesser extend the one in Great Britain. Political scandals in the country, such as the [[disappearance of Harold Holt]], and the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]], as well as Australia's involvement in [[Vietnam War]], led to a disillusionment or disengagement with political figures and the government. Large protests were held in the countries most populated cities such as [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]], one prominent march was held in Sydney in 1971 on [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]]. The photographer [[Roger Scott (photographer)|Roger Scott]], who captured the protest in front of the [[Queen Victoria Building]], remarked: "I knew I could make a point with my camera. It was exciting. The old conservative world was ending and a new Australia was beginning. The demonstration was almost silent. The atmosphere was electric. The protesters were committed to making their presence felt … It was clear they wanted to show the government that they were mighty unhappy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vietnam march George street|work=[[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]|date=2007|url=https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/114.1989/|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political upheaval made its way into art in the country: film, music and literature were shaped by the ongoing changes both within the country, the Southern Hemisphere and the rest of the world. Bands such as [[The Master’s Apprentices]], [[The Pink Finks]] and [[Normie Rowe &amp; The Playboys]], along with Sydney’s [[The Easybeats]], [[Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs]] and [[The Missing Links]] began to emerge in the 1960s.

One of Australia's most noted literary voices of the counter-culture movement was [[Frank Moorhouse]], whose collection of short stories, ''Futility and Other Animals'', was first published in [[Sydney]] 1969.&lt;ref name="Rickard"&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Rickard|title=Australia: A Cultural History|pp=224|year=2017|publisher=[[Monash University Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-921867-60-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its "discontinuous narrative" was said to reflect the "ambience of the counter-culture".&lt;ref name="Rickard" /&gt; [[Helen Garner]]'s ''[[Monkey Grip (novel)|Monkey Grip]]'' (1977), released eight years later, is considered a classic example of the contemporary Australian novel, and captured the thriving countercultural movement in Melbourne's inner-city in the mid 1970s, specifically [[open relationships]] and recreational drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monkey grip / Helen Garner|work=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=2 April 2018|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/7045527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PostColonial"&gt;{{cite book|title=Enyclopedia of Post-Colonial Literatures in English|pp=564|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-1-134468-48-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Garner revealed it was strongly autobiographical and based on her own diaries.&lt;ref name="PostColonial" /&gt; Additionally, from the 1960s, [[surf culture]] took rise in Australia given the abundance of beaches in the country, and this was reflected in art, from bands such as [[The Atlantics]] and novels like ''[[Puberty Blues (novel)|Puberty Blues]]'' as well as the [[Puberty Blues|film of the same name]].

===Great Britain===
Starting in the late 1960s the [[counterculture movement]] spread from the US like a wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Nelson, ''The British Counter-Culture, 1966-73: A Study of the Underground Press'' (1989) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dAuwCwAAQBAJ   excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  Britain did not experience the intense social turmoil produced in America by the  [[Vietnam War]] and racial tensions. Nevertheless, British youth readily identified with their American counterparts' desire to cast off the older generation's social mores. The new music was a powerful weapon. In this case, it took the form of a wholesale revolt against the class system, which was now being questioned for the first time in the nation's history. Rock music, which had first been introduced from the US in the 1950s, became a key instrument in the social uprisings of the young generation and Britain soon became a groundswell of musical talent thanks to groups like [[the Beatles]], [[Rolling Stones]], [[the Who]], [[Pink Floyd]], and more in coming years.&lt;ref&gt;Steven D. Stark, ''Meet the Beatles: a cultural history of the band that shook youth, gender, and the world'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry J. Faulk, ''British rock modernism, 1967-1977: the story of music hall in rock'' (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Osgerby, ''Youth in Britain since 1945'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The antiwar movement in Britain closely collaborated with their American counterparts, supporting peasant insurgents in the Asian jungles.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia A. Ellis, "Promoting solidarity at home and abroad: the goals and tactics of the anti-Vietnam War movement in Britain." ''European Review of History: Revue européenne d’histoire 21.4'' (2014): 557-576.&lt;/ref&gt;  The  "[[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|Ban the Bomb]]" protests centered around opposition to [[nuclear weaponry]]; the campaign gave birth to what  was to  become the [[peace symbol]] of the 1960s.

=== Russia/Soviet Union===
Although not exactly equivalent to the English definition, the term ''Контркультура'' (''Kontrkul'tura'') became common in [[Russia]]n to define a 1990s [[cultural movement]] that promoted acting outside of cultural conventions: the use of explicit language; graphical descriptions of sex, violence and illicit activities; and uncopyrighted use of "safe" characters involved in such activities.

During the early 1970s, the [[Soviet government]] rigidly promoted optimism in Russian culture. Divorce and alcohol abuse were viewed as taboo by the media. However, Russian society grew weary of the gap between real life and the creative world,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} and underground culture became "forbidden fruit". General satisfaction with the quality of existing works led to parody, such as how the [[Russian joke|Russian anecdotal joke]] tradition turned the setting of ''[[War and Peace]]'' by [[Leo Tolstoy]] into a grotesque world of sexual excess. Another well-known example is [[Russian humour#Black humour|black humor]] (mostly in the form of short poems) that dealt exclusively with funny deaths and/or other mishaps of small, innocent children.

In the mid-1980s, the [[Glasnost]] policy permitted the production of less optimistic works. As a consequence, Russian cinema during the late 1980s and the early 1990s was [[action movie]]s with explicit (but not necessarily graphic) scenes of ruthless violence and social dramas about [[drug abuse]], [[prostitution]] and failing relationships. Although Russian movies of the time would be [[MPAA rating system|rated "R"]] in the United States due to violence, the use of explicit language was much milder than in American cinema.

In the late 1990s, Russian counterculture became increasingly popular on the [[Internet]]. Several websites appeared that posted user-created short stories dealing with sex, drugs and violence. The following features are considered the most popular topics in such works:

* Wide use of explicit language;
* Deliberate misspelling;
* Descriptions of drug use and consequences of abuse;
* Negative portrayals of alcohol use;
* Sex and violence: nothing is a taboo – in general, violence is rarely advocated, while all types of sex are considered good;
* [[Parody]]: media advertising, classic movies, [[popular culture|pop culture]] and children's books are considered fair game;
* Non-conformance; and
* [[Politically incorrect]] topics, mostly [[racism]], [[xenophobia]] and [[homophobia]].

A notable aspect of counterculture at the time was the influence of contra-cultural developments on Russian pop culture. In addition to traditional Russian styles of music, such as songs with jail-related lyrics, new music styles with explicit language were developed.

=== Asia ===
In the recent past, Dr. [[Sebastian Kappen]], an Indian theologian, has tried to redefine counterculture in the Asian context. In March 1990, at a seminar in Bangalore, he presented his countercultural perspectives (Chapter 4 in S. Kappen, ''Tradition, modernity, counterculture: an Asian perspective'', Visthar, Bangalore, 1994). Dr. Kappen envisages counterculture as a new culture that has to negate the two opposing cultural phenomena in Asian countries:
#invasion by Western [[capitalism|capitalist]] culture, and
#the emergence of [[revivalism|revivalist]] movements.

Kappen writes, "Were we to succumb to the first, we should be losing our identity; if to the second, ours would be a false, obsolete identity in a mental universe of dead symbols and delayed myths".

The most important countercultural movement in [[India]] had taken place in the state of [[West Bengal]] during the 1960s by a group of poets and artists who called themselves [[Hungry Generation|Hungryalists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">'''Criminal tradition''' - of the cultural transmission of criminal values. Criminal traditions are transmitted from the older generation to the younger generation, such as social customs are in other forms of society.

Studies of the criminal tradition involved  Clifford R. Shaw and Henry D. McKay. They put forward a theory of “cultural transmission”, focuses on the development in some urban neighborhoods of a criminal tradition that persists from one generation to another despite constant changes in population. This theory stresses the value systems of different areas

Also worth noting theory of “differential association,” in which  Edwin H. Sutherland described the processes by which criminal values are taken over by the individual. Edwin H. Sutherland asserted that criminal behavior is learned and that it is learned in interaction with others who have already incorporated criminal values.&lt;ref&gt;Criminology Theory: Selected Classic Readings, by Frank P. Williams III, Marilyn D. McShane&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Shaw and McKay on the concept of cultural transmission indicates that a criminal tradition or subculture does exist in areas of  larger cities.  According to their studies Criminal tradition arises and is maintained in areas of instability, and the values, norms, and behaviors of the participants in the criminal tradition are viewed as normal by these people.&lt;ref&gt;Hepburn J. R. Subcultures, violence, and the subculture of violence: An old rut or a new road? //Criminology. – 1971. – Т. 9. – №. 1. – С. 87-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population categories subject to criminal traditions ==

Traditions are not personified, so adolescents and boys are easier to obey than direct instructions from specific individuals. This is the power of tradition. The norms of the life of groups in which the will of their members manifest themselves take the form of tradition most often. In the tradition that there is no personification, adolescents find it easier to obey them than to a particular person. Against this background, the criminal traditions that are prevalent in youth criminal groups, especially in closed educational and correctional institutions are especially dangerous. In a criminal environment, there are two kinds of traditions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.vuzlib.su/book_z686_page_12.html "Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)" by Pirozhkov V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* They came to us from the criminal environment of the distant past and transformed into modern ones, taking into account the conditions of life of society and the relations dominating in it;
* New traditions that have arisen and established in a criminal environment in modern conditions and have no analogues in the past.

At the same time, there is a transformation of existing criminal traditions and the emergence of new ones. The reason for this is the changes in the social, economic, legal and other spheres.

== World criminal tradition ==

On the criminal tradition in different countries of the world, there is a huge amount of work. There is an impressive number of works on the Russian criminal tradition, written in different languages. 
We can also highlight works by Jonny Steinberg on [[The Numbers Gang|the numbers gangs]] of South Africa

== Alternative opinions ==

There is also the view that it is impossible to consider all the traditions of the criminal environment as antisocial and harmful, including, for the reason that some of the traditions in the cells of the remand center, contribute to hygiene and the maintenance of sanitary norms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.vuzlib.su/book_z686_page_12.html "Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)" by Pirozhkov V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian criminal tradition == 

In Russian criminal tradition adherents of the criminal (criminal) tradition are characterized by active participation in the life of the "thieves' community"; Living on tangible assets obtained by criminal means; Propaganda of "thieves' customs and traditions, as well as criminal way of life; Compulsion to keep a word not only before the "brother", but also the criminal-criminal world; Organization of collection of "obschekovyh" funds and control over their use; Guardianship and assistance to detainees and convicts, the so-called "vagabonds" and "honest prisoners"; Compliance with the decisions of "gatherings"; Demanding of "brotherhood" and control over their compliance; Organization of counteraction to state bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rulit.me/books/cvetnaya-mast-elita-prestupnogo-mira-read-10956-1.html ВМЕСТО ПРЕДИСЛОВИЯ "ВОРЫ В ЗАКОНЕ" — ИСТОРИЯ ПРОБЛЕМЫ] RuLit&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19571">'''Critical consumption''' is the conscious choice of buying or not buying a specific product according to ethical and political beliefs. The critical [[consumerism|consumer]] recognizes the importance of considering some characteristics of the product and its realization, such as environmental [[sustainability]] and respect of workers’ rights. Indeed, critical consumers take full responsibility for the [[environmental impact|environmental]], social and political effects of their choices. The critical consumer can sympathize with certain [[social movement]] goals and contributes towards them through modifying their consumption behavior.

Work on critical consumption has differed in the terms used to refer to boycotting and buycotting actions. The more prominent include [[Ethical consumerism|ethical consumption]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=it&amp;lr=&amp;id=iFtkiRK8ZoMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=Harrison,+R.,+Newholm,+T.+and+Shaw,+D.+(2005)+The+Ethical+Consumer,+London:+Sage.&amp;ots=5pr9vRtHho&amp;sig=SVmSshVUkiRyKAVBhWGtd__r9cA#v=onepage&amp;q=Harrison%2C%20R.%2C%20Newholm%2C%20T.%20and%20Shaw%2C%20D.%20(2005)%20The%20Ethical%20Consumer%2C%20London%3A%20Sage.&amp;f=false Harrison, R., Newholm, T. and Shaw, D. (2005) The Ethical Consumer, London: Sage.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[political consumerism]],&lt;ref&gt;Micheletti, M. (2003) Political Virtue and Shopping, New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[sustainable consumption]], more linked with policy, has also increased in usage.&lt;ref&gt;Spaargaren, G. (2003) ‘Sustainable consumption: A theoretical and environmental policy perspective’, Society and Natural Resources 16: 687/701.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often consumer and citizen are considered as different because consumers only show self-interest, whereas citizens denote expanded self-interest. The general idea is that, consumers ‘buy what they want—or what they have been persuaded to want—within the limits of what they can get.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10460-005-6042-4 Berry, W. (1989). The pleasures of eating. The Journal of Gastronomy, 5, 125–131.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citizenship]], on the other hand, carries duties or responsibilities along with various rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.662.5395&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Wilkins, J. F. (2005). Eating right here: Moving from consumer to food citizen. Agriculture and Human Values, 22, 269–273]&lt;/ref&gt; Since consumers are seen also as citizens they have to behave in a community-oriented, moral and political way, rather than as a self-interested one.

== Political use of consumption ==

A specificity of critical consumption is the political use of consumption, which is the consumers’ choice of “''producers and products with the aim of changing ethically or politically objectionable institutional or market practices''”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bridgingdifferences.mcgill.ca/en/Youth.pdf Micheletti, M., Stolle, D. "Concept of Political Consumerism" in ''Youth Activism - An International Encyclopedia'' (2006), Lonnie R. Sherrod (ed.), Westport: Greenwood Publishing.]&lt;/ref&gt; Their choices depend on different factors as non economic issues that concern personal and family well-being, issue of fairness, justice, ethical or political assessment. Main forms and tools of political use of consumption are [[boycotting]], "buycotting" ([[anti-boycott]]ing) and also [[culture jamming]] or [[adbusting]].

Political consumerism can be considered as an alternative form of political engagement, especially for young generations. In addition, market-based political strategies of young citizens go beyond boycotting and “buycotting”; they also started to participate in [[internet campaign]]s becoming active consumers. Their individual choices become political movements able to challenge political and economic powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naomiklein.org/no-logo/publication-info Klein, N. (2000), No Logo, Knopf Canada: Picador.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VidaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=Merlucci,+A.+(1988),+‘‘Social+Movements+and+the+Democratization+of+Everyday+life’’+in+J.+Keane+(ed.)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A2pidAlVOu&amp;sig=DZHNKpWdu42Y08WYjNckh2NDNKk&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtoPj-3 Merlucci, A. (1988), ‘‘Social Movements and the Democratization of Everyday life’’ in J. Keane (ed.), Civil Society and the State: New European Perspective, London: Verso.]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, as a political actor, the consumer “is seen as directly responsible not only for him or herself but also for the world”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users2.unimi.it/rsassatelli/wp-content/uploads/Sassatelli-Critical-consumerism-BrewerTrentmann-2006.pdf Sassatelli, R. (2006) "Virtue, Responsibility and Consumer Choice.

New Brunswick, Transaction Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that consumes are becoming increasingly politicized according to the boycott and buycott principles. In particular, Scandinavian people seems to be more committed in political consumerism, for example [[Sweden]] increased his average of boycotting episodes from 15 percent in 1987 to 29 percent in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Petersson, Olof, Hermansson, J6rgen, Micheletti, Michele, Teorell, Jan and Westholm, Anders (1998). Demokrati och medborgarskap.Stockholm: SNS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it is important to consider that even if a growing number of citizens are turning to the market to express their political and moral concerns,  it is difficult to assess whether political consumerism can also be considered as a meaningful or effective form of political participation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://profs-polisci.mcgill.ca/stolle/Data_files/FinalIJPS2005.pdf Micheletti, M., Stolle, D., Hooghe, M, (2005) Politics in the Supermarket: Political consumerism as form of political participation. International Political Science review]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical Background ==

[[File:Boston Tea Party.jpg|thumb|The [[Boston Tea Party]] was an important example of boycotting against England |253x253px]]
The chase for a fair consumption has deep roots in consumption history, starting for example with the [[American Revolution]]. Sympathizers of the American cause, in those years, refused to buy English goods, to support colons rebellion. This act of conscious choice can be seen as the beginning of both critical and political consumption. Traces of these two concepts can be found at the turn of the nineteenth century, in the [[United States]], where the [[National Consumers League|National Consumer League]] promoted the so-called “[[Whitelist]]s”, in which all the companies that treated fairly their employees were listed.

At the end of the century, also the first forms of political activism in consumption took place in the United States and Europe, like the “Dont Buy Jewish” boycotts. Several organizations were born in those times and in the following centuries, asking the consumers to join the mobilizations as active subjects.

A variety of discourses about the “duty” and the “responsibilities” of social actors arose after the 1999 [[World Trade Organization]] protests in [[Seattle]]. People were explicitly asked to think that to shop is to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users2.unimi.it/rsassatelli/wp-content/uploads/Sassatelli-Critical-consumerism-BrewerTrentmann-2006.pdf Sassatelli, R. (2006) Virtue, Responsibility and Consumer Choice. Framing Critical Consumerism, 219]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boycotting and "Buycotting" ==
[[Boycott]]ing and "buycotting" ([[Anti-boycott]]), as a particularly self-conscious form of consumption, are expressions of an individual’s political, ethical or environmental stance. Both boycotting and "buycotting" are discrete acts of critical consumption and they are mutually contingent. In fact, if the use-value or utility of a product is important, then it is difficult to view them as separate actions.
[[File:La2-buynothing.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Buy Nothing Day|Buy Nothing Day (BND)]] demonstration in San Francisco, November 2000]]
'''Boycotting''' refers to abstaining from buying, avoiding specific products or brands to punish companies for undesirable policies or business practices. "'''Buycotting'''" is a term coined by Friedman (1996); it refers to “positive buying” that aims to foster corporations that represent values – fair trade, environmentalism, sustainable development – that consumers choose to support.

When one boycotts a product or service, it does not mean that he abstains from consuming at all, but that he may select an alternative product or service. Equally, a choice to "buycott" could be understood as including a rejection or boycott of the non-ethical alternative. This interdependence is useful to explain the traditional pairing of boycotting and "buycotting" in much analysis of consumer politics.

One of the rising types of boycotting is the ad hoc one, which underlines the importance of consumers as political subjects. These initiatives show that critical consumption is really impacting in special occasions, gaining much more visibility than everyday boycotts. An example of this type of events is the [[Buy Nothing Day|Buy Nothing Day (BND)]].

== Sustainability ==
The notion of [[sustainability]] has both a temporal dimension demonstrated by the trade-off between present and future generations, and a justice dimension which considers the different distribution of harm and benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Gamborg, C., &amp;Sandøe, P. (2005a). Applying the notion of sustainability—Dilemmas and the need for dialogue. In S. Holm &amp; J. Gunning (Eds.), Ethics, Law and Society (pp. 123–130). Hants: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the term sustainability, notions of sustainable [[resource consumption]] by [[recycling]], [[environmental protection]], [[animal welfare]], [[social justice]], and climate responsibilities are gathered.&lt;ref&gt;Gamborg, C., &amp;Sandøe, P. (2005b). Sustainability in farm animal breeding. A review. Animal Production Science, 92(3), 221–231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Although the "good" purposes of critical consumerism there are some critics and pitfalls connected to this practice of consumption: 
* [[Fair trade]] protocols invite to respect all the communities and their cultures, workers’ rights and so on. At the same time, however, it appears as a hegemonic tool to impose a western culture of which the right standards must be.
* It requires a huge production of green and ethical products, but it is difficult to realize in the small-scale local production.
* People live in an asymmetrical world in terms of information. They take decisions just with the use of few elements.
* “A ‘paradox of sustainability’ arises because more substantive approaches to sustainability may be too complex to effectively motivate appropriate social responses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/23760319/Agricultural_sustainability_what_it_is_and_what_it_is_not Thompson, P. B. (2007). Agricultural sustainability: What it is and what it is not. International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability, 51, 5–16.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, all human food consumption has some kind of impact—hence there will always be some kind of prioritization”.

=== Criticism related to political use of consumption ===

* The idea that every person could be a potential political consumer is not true: ethical products can cost much more than traditional ones and people may not afford so expensive products (e.g. [[organic products]]).
* It is important to consider that people often buy products to express themselves. People who don’t care about ethical consumption will keep on buying products they like, not depending on political consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/doc/assr_0335-5985_1992_num_80_1_1564_t1_0249_0000_3 De Certeau, M.

* According to Shaw and Newholm,&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.10008/abstract Shaw, D. and T. Newholm (2002). "Voluntary Simplicity and the Ethics of Consumption." Psychology and Marketing 19(2): 167-185.]&lt;/ref&gt; even though single individuals take decisions and choices, political consumption can also be seen as a mass phenomenon. Consumes depend on consumers’ social environment. Moreover, [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://monoskop.org/images/e/e0/Pierre_Bourdieu_Distinction_A_Social_Critique_of_the_Judgement_of_Taste_1984.pdf Bourdieu, P. (1984). Distinction: a social critique of the judgement of taste. Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that consumption is determined by the belonging to a specific [[social class]] which determines our [[habit]]s and what we like.

== Examples ==
There are many examples of critical consumerism:
[[File:Rosaparks.jpg|thumb|235x235px|[[Rosa Parks]] with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]], 1955]]
* Montgomery boycott was a political and social protest campaign against the policy of [[racial segregation]] on the public transit system of Montgomery, [[Alabama]]. The campaign started on December 5, 1955 - when [[Rosa Parks]], an African American woman, was arrested for refusing to leave her seat to a white person. After that episode, boycotters organized a system of carpools, with car owners volunteering their vehicles or themselves driving people to various destinations.
* A well-known effective boycott took place against [[Nestlé]] (1977–84) for its marketing campaign of breast milk substitute or infant formula, in the third world. This boycott mobilized consumers on a global-scale and it brought Nestlè to the [[World Health Organization]] and United Nations International Children Emergency Fund ([[UNICEF]]) negotiating table. In 1981, the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes was adopted. However, political consumerist groups were not satisfied with the Code implementation and reinstated the boycott in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Yam, Naomi Bromberg (1995). "The Nestle Boycott: The Story of the WHO/UNICEF Code for Marketing Breastmilk Substitutes," Mothering (winter): 56-63.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nike, Inc.|Nike inc.]] has been accused for many years of exploiting children labour to produce [[footwear]] and [[apparel]], even though the company has always denied such charge. However, the brand has been highly damaged by both political consumption activism and the publicity it has received on the media. [[Watchdog group|Watchdog groups]] have forced Nike to raise wage levels, changing its sourcing of soccer balls to avoid child labor, raising the minimum age of its factory workers abroad, and insist that all outsourced footwear suppliers adopt US occupational safety andhealth standards for indoor air quality.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, Richard M. (2003). "The Promise and Perils of Globalization: The Case of Nike", MIT IPC Working Paper 02-008. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are also several examples of culture consumption association. One of the best known is the “[[No Sweat (organisation)|No Sweat]]" movement that is a broad-based no-profit organization which fights for the protection of [[sweatshop]] labourers, fights against child labour, forced overtime, poverty wages, unsafe conditions, harassment of women workers and intimidation of trade unionist, not only in developing countries, but also in Britain and the United States.

The '''[[cuckoo clock]]''', more than any other kind of timepiece, has often featured in literature, music, cinema, television, etc., in the [[Western culture]], as a [[metaphor]] or [[allegory]] of innocence, childhood, old age, past, fun, [[mental disorder]], etc. It has apparently been viewed more as a symbol or a toy -a folksy musical apparatus with animated figures- fascinating and a bit mysterious rather than as a serious timekeeper.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mühe &amp; Beatrice Techen, ''Beha Clocks In the Black Forest Manner''. In: NAWCC Bulletin, December 2001: p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the cuckoo clock functions as a symbol of [[Switzerland]] and Swissness, in fact it only has a slim connection with that country in terms of production. Its real home is the [[Black Forest]] of Germany.

== Science and technology ==
Inside Sierra Diablo mountains ([[Texas]]), is being built the monumental [[10,000 Year Clock]] based upon an idea of [[Daniel Hillis]] who in 1995&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2011/06/the_clock_in_th.php The Clock in the Mountain. The Technium. ]&lt;/ref&gt; expressed as follows: ''"I want to build a clock that ticks once a year. The century hand advances once every 100 years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium. I want the cuckoo to come out every millennium for the next 10,000 years."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10000yearclock.net/learnmore.html The 10.000 Year Clock official website.]&lt;/ref&gt; Funded by [[Jeff Bezos]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/06/10000-year-clock/all/1 Dylan Tweney, How to Make a Clock Run for 10.000 Years. Wired.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; it is designed to run for ten millennia with minimal maintenance and interruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://longnow.org/clock/ The Long Now Foundation website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Discovey Channel TV series [[Big!]], consisted of a team of craftspeople, in welding and metal construction, manufacturing the world's biggest items scaled up to proportions for the sake of setting world records, the devices had to function to qualify. One of the enlarged objects was a cuckoo clock in the episode number 9, although the [[Guinness World Record]] was not finally achieved.

In 2016 [[Lego]], as part of his Lego Mindstorms Remix Challenge, gave 48 hours to four company desginers to come up with a new item by combining two different existing products, the Lego Mindstorms EV3 (31313) and the Lego Technic Heavy Lift Helicopter (42052) sets. The winner model was a cuckoo and alarm clock by Jørn Kristian Thomsen. The cuckoo bird pops out to ‘cuckoo’ every 15 minutes and the alarm function triggers a moving, shooting vehicle to get you out of bed. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/remix Lego Mindstorms Remix Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Switzerland, they had brotherly love. They had five hundred years of democracy and peace. And what did that produce? The cuckoo clock." This remark was not in the script by [[Graham Greene]] but was added by Welles. Greene wrote in a letter: "What happened was that during the shooting of ''The Third Man'' it was found necessary for the timing to insert another sentence." Welles said the lines came from "an old Hungarian play". The painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] had said, "The Swiss in their mountains... What more worthy people! Yet, the perverse and scornful will none of it, and the sons of patriots are left with the clock that turns the mill, and the sudden cuckoo, with difficulty restrained in its box!" In ''This is Orson Welles'' (1993), Welles is quoted as saying "When the picture came out, the Swiss very nicely pointed out to me that they've never made any cuckoo clocks."&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Rees, ''Brewer's Famous Quotations'', Sterling, 2006, pp. 485-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding to [[television]], it plays a meaningful role in the next episodes of different TV series such as:
* [[Kraft Television Theatre]], "The Cuckoo Clock" (1954).
* [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]], "Triggers in Leash" (1955) and "The Cuckoo Clock" (1960).
* [[The Prisoner]], "[[Hammer into Anvil]]" (1967).
* [[Hogan's Heroes]], "The Antique" (1969). 
* [[Are you being served?]], "The Clock" (1974).
* [[Twin Peaks]], "Realization Time" (1990).
* [[Married... with Children]], "The Wedding Show" (1993).
* [[Martin (TV series)|Martin]], "Auction" (1997).
* [[My Name is Earl]], "Randy's Touchdown" (2005).

It has appeared on several children's shows as well, such as [[The Banana Splits Show]] where it was a secondary character, two same name episodes entitled "The Cuckoo Clock", the first one on [[Jackanory]] (season 10, episodes from 36 to 40, 1971) based on Mrs. Molesworth's novel and the second one on [[Ivor the Engine]] (1975), as well as some episodes of [[Fraggle Rock]], like “The Thirty-Minute Work Week” (1983),  [[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]] "[[The Cuckoo Clock of Doom]]" (1995), a Canadian/American horror series for children based on the same name books by [[R. L. Stine]] or in [[JoJo's Circus]] episode "Time Flies" (2005).

The British comedy [[Dave Allen at Large]] has a sketch taking place in the [[American West]], in which an outlaw loads his revolver and heads for a [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] just before noon, against the pleas and begging of his woman not to go through with it.  He tells her, "It's high noon and a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.  There ain't no other time I can do it!"  He goes into the saloon where there is a cuckoo clock on the wall.  At the stroke of twelve, when the door on the cuckoo clock swings open he shoots the bird.  He then tells her, "Like I said, there ain't no other time I can do it!"

British comedian [[Eric Sykes]] frequently obtained humour from the cuckoo clock in his house in the 1970s sit-com [[Sykes]]. Sykes and on -screen Sister Hattie Jaques treated the clock as though it were a pet, and spoke it as though it was alive. The temperamental bird inside was called Peter, who could usually be called upon to 'cuckoo' at the most opportune moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/sykes.htm Sykes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104192343/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/sykes.htm |date=2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critics of the practice, cultural appropriation differs from  [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or cultural exchange in that this appropriation is a form of [[colonialism]]: cultural elements are copied from a minority culture by members of a dominant culture, and these elements are used outside of their original cultural context—sometimes even against the expressly stated wishes of members of the originating culture.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name="Houska"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houska|first1=Tara|title='I Didn't Know' Doesn't Cut It Anymore|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/16/houska-i-didnt-know-doesnt-cut-it-anymore-160051|website=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|accessdate=April 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132337/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/16/houska-i-didnt-know-doesnt-cut-it-anymore-160051|archive-date=2015-04-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}

==Overview==

Cultural appropriation can involve the use of ideas, symbols, artifacts, or other aspects of human-made visual or non-visual culture.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;Schneider, Arnd (2003) ''[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=187627 On ‘appropriation’. A critical reappraisal of the concept and its application in global art practices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231455/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=187627 |date=March 3, 2016 }}'', published in Social Anthropology (2003), 11:2:215–229 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a concept that is controversial in its applications, the propriety of cultural appropriation has been the subject of much debate. Opponents of cultural appropriation view many instances as wrongful appropriation when the subject culture is a minority culture or is subordinated in social, political, economic, or military status to the dominant culture&lt;ref name=Keene1/&gt;&lt;ref name=KJohnson/&gt; or when there are other issues involved, such as a history of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] conflict.&lt;ref name="Culture and cultural appropriation"/&gt; This is often seen in cultural outsiders' use of an oppressed culture's symbols or other cultural elements, such as music, dance, spiritual ceremonies, modes of dress, speech, and social behaviour,&lt;ref name=Alcoff/&gt; notably when these elements are trivialized and used for fashion, rather than respected within their original cultural context. Opponents view the issues of colonialism, context, and the difference between appropriation and mutual exchange as central to analyzing cultural appropriation. They argue that mutual exchange happens on an "even playing field", whereas appropriation involves pieces of an oppressed culture being taken out of context by a people who have historically oppressed those they are taking from, and who lack the cultural context to properly understand, respect, or utilize these elements.&lt;ref name="Culture and cultural appropriation"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sundaresh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who Owns Culture?: Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law (Rutgers Series: The Public Life of the Arts)|last=Scafidi|first=Susan|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Taking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else's culture without permission. This can include unauthorized use of another culture's dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc. It is most likely to be harmful when the source community is a minority group that has been oppressed or exploited in other ways or when the object of appropriation is particularly sensitive, e.g. sacred objects.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different view of cultural appropriation characterizes critics of the practice as "engaged in a deeply conservative project: one which first seeks to preserve in formaldehyde the content of an established culture and second tries to prevent others from interacting with that culture."&lt;ref name=Bogeyman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-22/berg-cultural-appropriation-is-bad/7047004|title=Is cultural appropriation the bogeyman it's made out to be?|last=Berg|first=Chris|work=The Drum|date=December 21, 2015|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of cultural appropriation view it as often benign or mutually beneficial, citing mutation, product diversity, technological diffusion, and cultural empathy as among its benefits.&lt;ref name=Noah&gt;{{cite web|work=Noahpinion|url=http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/cultural-appropriation-is-great.html?m=1|title=Cultural appropriation is great!|last=Smith|first=Noah|date=December 19, 2015|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' appropriated elements from [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', which itself appropriated elements from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]; culture in the aggregate is arguably better off for each instance of appropriation. Fusion between cultures has produced such foods as [[American Chinese cuisine]], modern Japanese [[sushi]], and [[bánh mì]], each of which is sometimes argued to reflect part of its respective culture's identity.&lt;ref name=Bogeyman /&gt;

==Academic study==
Cultural appropriation is a relatively recent subject of academic study. 
The term emerged in the 1980s, in discussions of post-colonial critiques of Western expansionism,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095652789|title=Cultural appropriation - Oxford Reference|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the concept had been explored earlier, such as in "Some General Observations on the Problems of Cultural Colonialism" by Kenneth Coutts‐Smith in 1976.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hutchinson&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hutchinson |first=John |last2=Hiller |first2=Susan |date=1992 |title=The Myth of Primitivism|journal=Circa|issue=61|pages=49|doi=10.2307/25557703|issn=0263-9475|jstor=25557703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural and racial theorist [[George Lipsitz]] has used the term "strategic anti-essentialism" to refer to the calculated use of a cultural form, outside of one's own, to define oneself or one's group. Strategic anti-essentialism can be seen in both minority cultures and majority cultures, and is not confined only to the use of the other. However, Lipsitz argues, when the majority culture attempts to strategically anti-essentialize itself by appropriating a minority culture, it must take great care to recognize the specific socio-historical circumstances and significance of these cultural forms so as not to perpetuate the already existing majority vs. minority unequal power relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Technoliteracy, Discourse, and Social Practice: Frameworks and Applications in the Digital Age| editor=Darren Lee Pullen| publisher=IGI Global| date=2009| isbn=978-1605668437| pages=312| url=https://books.google.com/?id=TqJ3mKb41UsC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=strategic+anti+essentialism+lipsitz#v=onepage&amp;q=strategic%20anti%20essentialism%20lipsitz&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Art, literature, iconography, and adornment===
A common example of cultural appropriation is the adoption of the [[iconography]] of another culture, and using it for purposes that are unintended by the original culture or even offensive to that culture's [[mores]]. Examples include sports teams using [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribal names or images as mascots; wearing jewelry or fashion with religious symbols such as the [[war bonnet]],&lt;ref name=Keene1/&gt; [[medicine wheel]], or cross without any belief in those religions; and copying iconography from another culture's history such as [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] tribal tattoos, [[Chinese characters]], or [[Celtic art]] worn without regard to their original cultural significance. Critics of the practice of cultural appropriation contend that divorcing this iconography from its cultural context or treating it as [[kitsch]] risks offending people who venerate and wish to preserve their cultural traditions.&lt;ref name=Keene1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sundaresh/&gt;&lt;ref name=MTV1&gt;Ehrlich, Brenna (June 4, 2014) "[http://www.mtv.com/news/1837578/why-you-should-not-wear-headdresses/ Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Wear A Native American Headdress] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117151650/http://www.mtv.com/news/1837578/why-you-should-not-wear-headdresses/ |date=November 17, 2016 }}" for [[MTV]] News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EOnline1"&gt;Freda, Elizabeth (Jul. 28, 2014) "[http://www.eonline.com/news/563845/music-festival-is-banning-cultural-appropriation-aka-hipsters-wearing-native-american-headdresses Music Festival Is Banning Cultural Appropriation, aka Hipsters Wearing Native American Headdresses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507210844/http://www.eonline.com/news/563845/music-festival-is-banning-cultural-appropriation-aka-hipsters-wearing-native-american-headdresses |date=May 7, 2016 }}" for ''EOnline''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;Zimmerman, Amy (June 4, 2014) "[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/04/pharrell-harry-styles-and-native-american-appropriation.html Pharrell, Harry Styles, and Native American Appropriation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409140437/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/04/pharrell-harry-styles-and-native-american-appropriation.html |date=April 9, 2016 }}" for [[The Daily Beast]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe and North America a common example of cultural appropriation is the misrepresentation of East Indian symbols, mythology and religious ideas as typified in Rudyard Kipling's stories and Talbot Mundy's [[Jimgrim]] book series including the highly discussed [[Nine Unknown]] and [[King of the Khyber Rifles]]. Movements to undo the biases, misrepresentations, and cultural inaccuracies made popular by authors like Kipling and Mundy have gained significant momentum since Kipling's poem "[[If—]]" was scrubbed off Manchester University walls by student leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2018/07/18/rudyard-kiplings-poem-scrubbed-wall-students-claim-hewas-racist/|title=Rudyard Kipling's 'If' poem scrubbed off wall by students who claim he was a 'racist'|last=Turner|first=Camilla|date=2018-07-18|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAJA, a watchdog organization for fair and respectful cultural representation, works to point out and prevent these cultural inaccuracies in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aaja.org/about|title=About AAJA|work=Asian American Journalists Association|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, some of the most hotly debated cases of cultural appropriation have occurred in places where cultural exchange is the highest, such as along the trade routes in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe. Some scholars of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[ancient Egypt]] argue that Ottoman and Egyptian architectural traditions have long been falsely claimed and praised as Persian or Arab.&lt;ref&gt;Ousterhout, Robert.

===Religion and spirituality===
Among critics, the misuse and misrepresentation of [[indigenous intellectual property]] is seen as an exploitative form of colonialism, and one step in the destruction of indigenous cultures.&lt;ref name="Wernitznig2"&gt;Wernitznig, Dagmar, ''Europe's Indians, Indians in Europe: European Perceptions and Appropriations of Native American Cultures from Pocahontas to the Present''. University Press of America, 2007: p.132. "What happens further in the [[Plastic Shaman]]'s [fictitious] story is highly irritating from a perspective of cultural hegemony. The Injun elder does not only willingly share their spirituality with the white intruder but, in fact, must come to the conclusion that this intruder is as good an Indian as they are themselves. Regarding Indian spirituality, the Plastic Shaman even out-Indians the actual ones. The messianic element, which Plastic Shamanism financially draws on, is installed in the Yoda-like elder themselves. They are the ones – while melodramatically parting from their spiritual offshoot – who urge the Plastic Shaman to share their gift with the rest of the world. Thus Plastic Shamans wipe their hands clean of any megalomaniac or missionizing undertones. Licensed by the authority of an Indian elder, they now have every right to spread their wisdom, and if they make (quite more than) a buck with it, then so be it.—The neocolonial ideology attached to this scenario leaves less room for cynicism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of this use of indigenous knowledge have led some tribes, and the [[United Nations General Assembly]], to issue several declarations on the subject. The ''Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality'' includes the passage:
{{quote|We assert a posture of zero-tolerance for any "white man's shaman" who rises from within our own communities to "authorize" the expropriation of our ceremonial ways by non-Indians; all such "[[Plastic shaman|plastic medicine men]]" are enemies of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt;|}}Article 31 1 of the United Nations ''[[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]'' states:{{quote|Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.&lt;ref name="UNDRIP"/&gt;|}}

Many Native Americans have criticized what they deem to be cultural appropriation of their [[sweat lodge]] and [[vision quest]] ceremonies by non-Natives, and even by tribes who have not traditionally had these ceremonies. They also contend that there are higher safety risks when the ceremonies are conducted by non-Natives, pointing to [[Sweat lodge#Risks|deaths or injuries]] in 1996, 2002, 2004, and several high-profile deaths in 2009.&lt;ref name="Dehydration and heat-related death"&gt;{{cite news|first=RW|last=Byard|work=Forensic Science SA|title=Dehydration and heat-related death: sweat lodge syndrome|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16121078&amp;dopt=Abstract|date=2005-09-26|accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2 die in new-age sweat lodge"&gt;{{cite news|first=Suzanne|last=Herel|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|title=2 seeking spiritual enlightenment die in new-age sweat lodge|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/06/27/BA212763.DTL|date=2002-06-27|accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taliman2"&gt;{{citation | first = Valerie |last = Taliman | title = Selling the sacred | publisher = Indian Country Today | url = http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ict_sbc/selling-the-sacred | date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Bob |last = Goulais | title = Editorial: Dying to experience native ceremonies | newspaper = North Bay Nugget | date = 2009-10-24 | url =http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2144903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hocker, Lindsay.

====17th century to Victorian era====
During the 17th century, the forerunner to the [[three piece suit]] was appropriated from the [[traditional dress]] of diverse Eastern European and Islamic countries. The [[Justacorps]] [[frock coat]] was copied from the long [[zupan (clothing)|zupan]]s worn in Poland and the Ukraine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world4.eu/french-fashion-reign-louis-xiv/|title=Reign Louis XIV.

During the [[Highland Clearances]], the British aristocracy appropriated traditional [[Scottish clothing]]. [[Tartan]] was given spurious association with specific [[Highland clan]]s after publications such as [[James Logan (writer)|James Logan]]'s romanticised work ''The Scottish Gael'' (1831) led the Scottish tartan industry to invent clan tartans &lt;ref name="BanksdelaChapelle--106-108"&gt;[[#B|Banks: de la Chapelle 2007]]: pp. 106–108.&lt;/ref&gt; and tartan became a desirable material for dresses, waistcoats and cravats. In America, plaid flannel had become [[workwear]] by the time of [[Westward expansion]], and was widely worn by [[Old West]] [[American pioneer|pioneers]] and [[cowboy]]s who were not of Scottish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_mRcTRYcvsC&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=plaid+shirts+old+west&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood|first=Jeremy|last=Agnew|date=25 October 2012|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2000s in fashion|21st century]], tartan remains ubiquitous in mainstream fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/1907/highland-fling|title=Highland fling - New Humanist|website=newhumanist.org.uk|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century the fascination had shifted to Asian culture. English [[Regency era]] [[dandies]] adapted the Indian [[churidar]]s into [[skinny jeans|slim fitting]] [[Trousers#Europe before the 1900s|pantaloons]], and frequently wore [[turban]]s within their own houses. Later, [[Victorian era|Victorian]] gentlemen wore [[smoking cap]]s based on the Islamic [[fez]], and fashionable [[turn of the century]] ladies wore [[Orientalism|Orientalist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2015/07/18/books/underneath-orientalist-kimono/#.WO11OoWcHIU|title=Underneath the 'Orientalist' kimono - The Japan Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese inspired [[kimono]] dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pUhUmviJQFAC&amp;pg=PT255&amp;dq=smoking+cap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Cigars, 2nd Edition|first=Tad|last=Gage|date=1 September 1997|publisher=Penguin|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7G6xDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA202|title=The Social Life of Kimono: Japanese Fashion Past and Present|first=Sheila|last=Cliffe|date=23 March 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[tiki culture]] fad of the 1950s, white women frequently donned the [[qipao]] to give the impression that they had visited [[Hong Kong]], although the dresses were frequently made by seamstresses in America using [[rayon]] rather than genuine silk. At the same time, teenage British Teddy Girls wore Chinese [[coolie hat]]s due to their exotic connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://subcultureslist.com/teddy-girls/|title=Teddy girls - Teddy girl a member of youth subculture in 1950s|website=subcultureslist.com|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, the [[sombrero]] associated with the [[mestizo]] peasant class was appropriated from an earlier hat introduced by the Spanish colonials during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUz1xhAZcKQC&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=cowboy+hat+sombrero&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Cowboy at Work: All about His Job and how He Does it|first=Fay E.|last=Ward|date=27 June 1987|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, was adapted into the [[cowboy hat]] worn by American cowboys after the [[US Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-22/berg-cultural-appropriation-is-bad/7047004|title=Is cultural appropriation the bogeyman it's made out to be?|last=|first=|date=|website=abc.net.au|accessdate=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[University of East Anglia]] prohibited the wearing of sombreros to parties on campus, in the belief that these could offend Mexican students.&lt;ref name=Shriver /&gt;

American [[Western wear]] was copied from the work attire of 19th century Mexican [[Vaquero]]s, especially the pointed [[cowboy boot]]s and the [[guayabera]] which was adapted into the embroidered [[Western shirt]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Cowboys," from Time Life The Old West series. (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[China poblana]] dress associated with Mexican women was appropriated from the [[choli]] and [[lehenga]] worn by [[India]]n maidservants like [[Catarina de San Juan]] who arrived from Asia from the 17th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analesiie.unam.mx/pdf/71_37-73.pdf A Mughal princess in New Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 during the annual [[Victoria's Secret]] fashion show, model [[Karlie Kloss]] was scrutinized for wearing a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] headdress during her walk on the runway.  There was a mixed public response.  People of mixed heritage were the most sensitive to headdress. ''[[USA Today]]'' ran a feature where they interviewed a woman of mixed heritage who said that the headdress is a symbol of leadership and honour, and also has a [[religious]] meaning behind it. This cultural meaning was not considered in Victoria’s Secret’s use of the headdress as an accessory. Victoria's Secret issued an apology stating that they had no intentions of offending anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2012/11/12/victorias-secret-apologizes-for-use-of-headdress/1701413/|title=Victoria's Secret apologizes for using headdress|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac1394dbdcca6a36cbf486633b129cd813095ac3/r=x404&amp;c=534x401/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2012/11/12/ap-victoria-secret-headdress-4_3.jpg|title=(This is a link to the photo of Karlie Kloss wearing a Native American headdress during the Victoria's Secret Fashion show.)|website=gannett-cdn.com|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hairstyles, makeup and body modifications===
*The leaders of [[ancient Israel]] strongly condemned the adoption of Egyptian and Canaanite practises, especially cutting the hair short or shaving the beard. At the same time, the Old Testament distinguishes the religious [[circumcision]] of the [[Hebrew]]s, from cultures such as the Egyptians where the practise had aesthetic or practical purposes.
*During the early 16th century, European men imitated the short [[regular haircut]]s and beards on rediscovered [[Ancient Greek]] and Roman statues. The curled hair favoured by the [[Regency era]] [[dandy]] [[Beau Brummel]] was also inspired by the classical era.
*During the 17th century, [[Louis XIV]] began wearing [[wig]]s to conceal his baldness.

[[File:FedExField - Redskins Jaguars pregame field.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington Redskins]] logo in Maryland]]

While the history of colonization and [[marginalization]] is not unique to the Americas, the practice of non-Native sports teams deriving team names, imagery, and mascots from indigenous peoples is still common in the United States and Canada, and has persisted to some extent despite protests from Indigenous groups. Cornel Pewewardy, Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at [[Portland State University]], cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="Pewewardy.1999"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0710-1481| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 176–189| last = Pewewardy| first = Cornel| title = From enemy to mascot: The deculturation of Indian mascots in sports culture| journal = Canadian Journal of Native Education| accessdate = 2014-11-22| date = 1999| url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/230304174}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that such practices maintain the power relationship between the dominant culture and the indigenous culture, and can be seen as a form of [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0027-6014| volume = 40| issue = 3| pages = 1–12| last = Longwell-Grice| first = Robert|author2=Hope Longwell-Grice| title = Chiefs, Braves, and Tomahawks: The Use of American Indians as University Mascots| journal = NASPA Journal (National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, Inc.)| accessdate = 2014-10-29| year = 2003 | url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ehh&amp;AN=32547562&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site| doi=10.2202/0027-6014.1255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Riley| first=Angela| title=Straight Stealing: Towards an Indigenous System of Cultural Property Protection| journal=Washington Law Review| volume=80| issue=69| date=2005| ssrn=703283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such practices may be seen as particularly harmful in schools and universities which have a stated purpose of promoting ethnic diversity and inclusion.&lt;ref name="usccr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aistm.org/fr.usccr.htm |title=Statement of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on the Use of Native American Images and Nicknames as Sports Symbols |publisher=The United States Commission on Civil Rights |date=April 13, 2001 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of the responsibility of higher education to eliminate behaviors that create a hostile environment for education, in 2005 the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] initiated [[NCAA Native American mascot decision|a policy]] against "hostile and abusive" names and mascots that led to the change of many derived from Native American culture, with the exception of those that established an agreement with particular tribes for the use of their specific names. Other schools retain their names because they were founded for the education of Native Americans, and continue to have a significant number of indigenous students. The trend towards the elimination of indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady, with two thirds having been eliminated over the past 50 years according to the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI).&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the leadership of nearly all Native American tribes object to their depictions as sports mascots&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncai.org/proudtobe&lt;/ref&gt;, only one tribe explicitly approves of such representations. The [[Florida State Seminoles]] use the iconography of the [[Seminole]] tribe. Their mascots are [[Osceola and Renegade]], depictions of the Seminole chief [[Osceola]] and his Appaloosa horse.&lt;ref name="NPR.Seminole"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/11/28/456786680/osceola-at-the-50-yard-line|title=Osceola At The 50-Yard Line|last=Lyden|first=Jacki|accessdate=December 6, 2015|date=November 28, 2015|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo.Seminole"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/florida-states-unusual-bond-with-seminole-tribe-puts-mascot-debate-in-a-different-light/2014/12/29/5386841a-8eea-11e4-ba53-a477d66580ed_story.html|title=Florida State's Unusual Bond with Seminole Tribe Puts Mascot Debate in a Different Light|last=Culpepper|first=Chuck|accessdate=December 6, 2015|date=December 29, 2014|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the NCAA attempted to ban the use of Native American names and iconography in college sports in 2005, the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]] passed a resolution offering explicit support for FSU's use of Seminole culture and Osceola as a mascot; the university was granted a waiver, citing the close relationship with and consultation between the team and the tribe.&lt;ref name="WaPo.Seminole" /&gt; In 2013, the tribe's chairman objected to outsiders meddling in tribal approval, stating that the FSU mascot and use of Seminole iconography "represents the courage of the people who were here and are still here, known as the Unconquered Seminoles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seminoletribune.org/like-the-old-florida-flag-let-us-alone/|work=The Seminole Tribune|last=Billie|first=James E.|title=Like the old Florida flag: 'Let us alone!'|accessdate=December 6, 2015|date=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in 2013, the [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]] expressed disapproval of "the use of all American Indian sports-team mascots in the public school system, by college and university level and by professional sports teams", and not all members of the tribe's Florida branch are supportive of its stance.&lt;ref name="NPR.Seminole" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo.Seminole" /&gt;

In other former colonies in Asia, Africa, and South America, the adoption of indigenous names for majority indigenous teams is also found. There are also ethnicity-related team names derived from prominent immigrant populations in the area, such as the [[Boston Celtics]], the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]], and the [[History of the Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota Vikings]].

The [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] to be held on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in Australia from 4 April 2018 has named its mascot [https://shop.gc2018.com/collections/mascot-1 Borobi], the local [[Yugambeh people|Yugambeh]] word for "koala," and has sought to trademark the word through [https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/view/1762487?q=borobi IP Australia]. The application is being opposed by a Yugambeh cultural heritage organisation, which argues that the Games organising committee used the word without proper consultation with the Yugambeh people.

===African-American culture===
[[File:Paul Wall.jpg|thumb|Example of hip hop fashion]]
The term [[wigger]] (common spelling "wigga") is a slang term for a white person who adopts the mannerisms, [[African American Vernacular English|language]], and [[Hip hop fashion|fashions]] associated with [[African-American culture]], particularly [[hip hop]], and, in Britain, the [[Grime (music)|grime]] scene, often implying the imitation is being done badly, although usually with sincerity rather than mocking intent.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Nell: ''Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers'', 5th ed. 607&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/wigger |title=Wigger &amp;#124; Define Wigger at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wigger |title=wigger - definition of wigger by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wigger is a [[portmanteau]] of ''white'' and ''[[nigger]]'' or ''[[nigga]],'' and the related term wangsta is a mashup of ''wannabe'' or ''white'', and ''[[gangsta rap|gangsta]]''. Among black hip-hop fans, the word "nigga" can sometimes be considered a friendly greeting, but when used by whites, it is usually viewed as offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.09.98/cover/nigger-9814.html|title=Metroactive News &amp; Issues - The Word 'Nigger'|website=www.metroactive.com|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Wigger" may be derogatory, reflecting stereotypes of African-American, [[black British]], and white culture (when used as synonym of [[white trash]]). The term is sometimes used in a racist manner, by other white people to belittle the person perceived as "acting black", but it is also widely used by African Americans like [[50 Cent]] offended by the wigga or [[chav|wanksta]]'s demeaning of black people and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xmmNfoefAAC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=LvbpzvmxIs&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wankstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America|first=Bakari|last=Kitwana|date=30 May 2006|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of white people adopting elements of black culture has been prevalent at least since [[slavery]] was [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in the [[Western world]]. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the ''white negro'' in the [[jazz]] and [[swing music]] scenes of the 1920s and 1930s, as examined in the 1957 [[Norman Mailer]] essay "[[The White Negro]]". It was later seen in the [[zoot suit]]er of the 1930s and 1940s, the [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] of the 1940s, the [[beatnik]] of the 1950s–1960s, the [[blue-eyed soul]] of the 1970s, and the hip hop of the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, an article in the UK newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' described the phenomenon of white, middle-class kids who were "wannabe Blacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/wiggers-just-wannabe-black-white-middleclass-kids-are-adopting-black-street-style-and-chilling-out-to-rap-music-david-usborne-reports-from-washington-1462591.html|title=Wiggers just wannabe black: White middle-class kids are adopting black street style and chilling out to rap music.|date=1993-08-22|publisher=Independent.co.uk|author=|accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2005 saw the publication of ''Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wangstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America'' by Bakari Kitwana, "a culture critic who's been tracking American hip hop for years"''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kitwana |first=Bakari |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4773208 |title='Why White Kids Love Hip Hop' |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert A. Clift's documentary ''Blacking Up: Hip-Hop's Remix of Race and Identity'' questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture. Clift's documentary examines "racial and cultural ownership and authenticity -- a path that begins with the stolen blackness seen in the success of [[Stephen Foster]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Elvis Presley]], the [[Rolling Stones]] -- all the way up to [[Vanilla Ice]] (popular music's ur-wigger...) and [[Eminem]]."&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;Hank Stuever, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150706043444/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/29/AR2010012904040.html "'Blacking Up' documentary questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 30 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the documentary refers to the wiggers as "white [[poseur]]s", and states that the term ''wigger'' "is used both proudly and derisively to describe white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture".&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

===Language===
Use of [[minority languages]] is also cited as cultural appropriated, such as when non-speakers of [[Scottish Gaelic]] or [[Irish language|Irish]] get tattoos in that language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McEwan|first1=Emily|title=The Scottish Gaelic Tattoo Handbook|publisher=Bradan Press|isbn=9780995099807|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHb0jwEACAAJ&amp;dq=the%20scottish%20tattoo%20handbook|accessdate=14 January 2017|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2017}} Likewise, the use of incorrect [[Scottish Gaelic]] in a tokenistic fashion aimed at non-Gaelic speakers on signage and announcements has been criticized{{weasel inline|date=January 2017}} as disrespectful to fluent speakers of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Richard A.

Since the early 2000s, it has become increasingly popular for people not of Asian descent, to get [[tattoo]]s of Indian [[devanagari]], [[Hangeul|Korean letters]] or [[Han character]]s ([[Traditional Chinese|traditional]], [[Simplified Chinese|simplified]] or [[Kanji|Japanese]]), often without knowing the actual meaning of the symbols being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.port.ac.uk/1135/|title=Cultural appropriation of Japanese tattoos, 2008|website=port.ac.uk|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/04/13/lost-in-translation-tattoos-and-cultural-appropriation/|title=Lost in Translation: Tattoos and Cultural Appropriation - Sociological Images|first=The Society|last=Pages|website=thesocietypages.org|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to last US Census (2010), Asian-Americans make up 4.8 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf|title=Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010|last=Humes|first=Karen R|last2=Jones|first2=Nicholas A.|last3=Ramirez|first3=Roberto R.|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a study by the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 2016, only one out of 20 (which corresponds to 5 percent) speaking roles go to Asian-Americans, and they are given only one percent of lead roles in film.

In chapter four of his book ''[[Playing Indian]]'', Native American historian [[Philip J.

Some people in the transgender community have protested against the casting of straight, cis-gender actors in trans acting roles, such as when [[Eddie Redmayne]] played the role of artist Lili Elbe in the film ''[[The Danish Girl]]'' and when [[Jared Leto]] played the role of a trans woman named Rayon in ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]]''.&lt;ref name="Caruso"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://acculturated.com/hollywood-guilty-cultural-appropriation-casting/ |title=Is Hollywood Guilty of Cultural Appropriation in its Casting? |last=Caruso |first=Jay |date=24 May 2018 |website=acculturated.com |publisher=Acculturated |access-date=21 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gay community has expressed concerns about the use of straight actors to play gay characters, a practice nicknamed "gay for pay"; this occurs in films such as ''[[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call Me by Your Name]]'' (straight actors Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet), ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' ([[Heath Ledger]] and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]]), ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' (starring [[Tom Hanks]]), ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'' (starring [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]) and ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (with [[Sean Penn]] playing the role of the real-life gay rights activist, [[Harvey Milk]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.them.us/story/call-me-by-your-name-gay-for-pay-oscar-bait |title=Latest Gay-for-Pay Oscar Bait: Dear Hollywood, Let queer people tell our own damn stories. |last=Kirst |first=Seamus |date=6 December 2017 |website=www.them.us |publisher=Them|access-date= |quote=One need not look far to see that Hollywood often fails to provide both representation of, and employment to, members of marginalized communities.

In some cases, a culture usually viewed as the target of cultural appropriation can be accused of appropriation, particularly after colonization and an extensive period re-organization of that culture under the [[nation-state]] system. For example, the government of [[Ghana]] has been accused of cultural appropriation in adopting the Caribbean [[Emancipation Day]] and marketing it to African American tourists as an "African festival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hasty| first=J | title=Rites of Passage, Routes of Redemption: Emancipation Tourism and the Wealth of Culture| journal=Africa Today| volume=49| issue=3, Fall 2002| pages=47–76| publisher=Indiana University Press| url=https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20043196408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Prince Harry]] used [[Indigenous Australian art]] motifs in a painting for a school project. One Aboriginal group labelled it "misappropriation of our culture", saying that to Aboriginal people, the motifs have symbolic meanings "indicative of our spiritualism", whereas when non-Aborigines use the motifs they are simply "painting a pretty picture".&lt;ref name=RoyalRipOff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/20/1061261182182.html |title=A right royal rip-off |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=2003-08-20 |accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818171622/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/20/1061261182182.html |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the concept==

[[John McWhorter]], a professor at [[Columbia University]], has criticized the concept, arguing that cultural borrowing and cross-fertilization is a generally positive thing, and is something which is usually done out of admiration, and with no intent to harm, the cultures being imitated; he also argued that the specific term "appropriation," which can mean theft, is misleading when applied to something like culture that is not seen by all as a limited resource: unlike appropriating a physical object, others imitating an idea taken from one group's culture don't inherently deprive that originating group of its use.&lt;ref name=McWhorter&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[John McWhorter|McWhorter]]|first1=John|title=You Can't 'Steal' A Culture: In Defense of Cultural Appropriation|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/15/you-can-t-steal-a-culture-in-defense-of-cultural-appropriation.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If we embrace narrow group-based identities too fiercely, we cling to the very cages in which others would seek to trap us." She also asserted the right of authors from a cultural majority to write in the voice of someone from a cultural minority, attacking the idea that this constitutes unethical "cultural appropriation". Referring to a case in which U.S. college students were facing disciplinary action for wearing [[sombrero]]s to a 'tequila party', she said "The moral of the sombrero scandals is clear: ''you're not supposed to try on other people's hats''. Yet that's what we’re paid to do, isn't it? Step into other people's shoes, and try on their hats." Sudanese-Australian social activist [[Yassmin Abdel-Magied]] walked out on Shriver's speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Convery |first1=Stephanie |title=We need to talk about cultural appropriation: why Lionel Shriver's speech touched a nerve |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/15/we-need-to-talk-about-cultural-appropriation-why-lionel-shrivers-speech-touched-a-nerve |work=The Guardian |date=2016-09-15 |accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123152039/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/15/we-need-to-talk-about-cultural-appropriation-why-lionel-shrivers-speech-touched-a-nerve |archivedate=2016-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdel-Magied later wrote a dissenting opinion piece, published in ''[[The Guardian]]''; which has run a series of articles covering the debate over ''cultural appropriation'' matters.

'''Cultural assimilation''' is the process in which a [[minority group]] or [[culture]] comes to resemble those of a dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Boyer |first1=P |title=Cultural Assimilation |journal=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences |date=2001 |pages=3032–3035 |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/00364-8|isbn=9780080430768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is used to refer to both individuals and groups; the latter case can refer to a range of social groups, including [[ethnic minorities]], [[immigrants]], [[indigenous peoples]], and other marginalized groups such as [[sexual minorities]] who adapt to being culturally dominated by another societal group.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Cultural assimilation may involve either a quick or a gradual change depending on circumstances of the group. Full assimilation occurs when members of a society become indistinguishable from those of the dominant group. 

Whether it is desirable for a given group to assimilate is often disputed by both members of the group and those of the dominant society. Cultural assimilation does not guarantee social alikeness.

though as this article states, geographical and other natural barriers between cultures even if started by the same dominant culture will be culturally different.&lt;ref&gt;Parisi, Domenico, Federico Cecconi, and Francesco Natale. "Cultural change in spatial environments: the role of cultural assimilation and internal changes in cultures." ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' 47.2 (2003): 163–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A place, state, or ethnicity can spontaneously adopt a different culture because of its political relevance or its perceived cultural superiority. An example is the [[Latin]] language and [[Roman culture]] being gradually adopted by most of the people subjugated by [[Ancient Rome]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Cultural assimilation can happen either spontaneously or forcibly (''see [[forced assimilation]]''). A culture can spontaneously adopt a different culture. Also, older, richer, or otherwise more dominant cultures can forcibly absorb subordinate cultures.

The term assimilation is often used with regard to not only indigenous groups but also immigrants settled in a new land. A new culture and new attitudes toward the origin culture are obtained through contact and communication. Assimilation assumes that a relatively-tenuous culture gets to be united to one unified culture. That process happens by contact and accommodation between each culture. The current definition of assimilation is usually used to refer to immigrants, but in [[multiculturalism]], cultural assimilation can happen all over the world and within varying social contexts and is not limited to specific areas. For example, a shared language gives people the chance to study and work internationally, without being limited to the same cultural group. People from different countries contribute to diversity and form the "global culture" which means the culture combined by the elements from different countries. That "global culture" can be seen as a part of assimilation, which causes cultures from different areas to affect one another.

== Immigrant assimilation ==
Immigrant assimilation is a complex process in which immigrants not only fully integrate themselves into a new country but also lose aspects, perhaps even all of their heritage. Social scientists rely on four primary benchmarks to assess immigrant assimilation: [[socioeconomic status]], geographic distribution, [[second language]] attainment, and [[exogamy|intermarriage]].&lt;ref name="Waters" /&gt;  William A.V. Clark defines immigrant assimilation as "a way of understanding the social dynamics of American society and that it is the process that occurs spontaneously and often unintended in the course of interaction between majority and [[minority groups]]."&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=W. |year=2003 |title=Immigrants and the American Dream: Remaking the Middle Class |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-880-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States===
{{Further|Americanization (immigration)}}

Between 1880 and 1920, the United States took in roughly 24 million immigrants.&lt;ref name="Waters"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Waters |first=Mary C. |last2=Jiménez |first2=Tomás R. |title=Assessing Immigrant Assimilation: New Empirical and Theoretical Challenges |journal=[[Annual Review of Sociology]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=105–125 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100026 |url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3203280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This increase in immigration can be attributed to many historical changes. The beginning of the 21st century has also marked a massive era of immigration, and sociologists are once again trying to make sense of the impacts that immigration has on society and on the on immigrants themselves.&lt;ref name="Waters"/&gt;

Assimilation had various meanings in American sociology. [[Henry Pratt Fairchild]] associates American assimilation with Americanization or the ''[[melting pot]]'' theory. Some scholars also believed that assimilation and acculturation were synonymous. According to a common point of view, assimilation is a "process of interpretation and fusion" from another group or person. That may include memories, behaviors and sentiments. By sharing their experiences and histories, they blend into the common cultural life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/ecology-and-environmentalism/environmental-studies/assimilation|title=Assimilation facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Assimilation|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long history of immigration in the established gateways means that the place of immigrants in terms of [[social class|class]], [[race (classification of human beings)|racial]], and [[ethnic]] hierarchies in the traditional gateways are more structured or established, but on the other hand, the new gateways do not have much immigration [[history]] and so the place of immigrants in terms of class, racial, and ethnic hierarchies is less defined, and immigrants may have more influence to define their position. Secondly, the size of new gateways may influence immigrant assimilation. Having a smaller gateway may influence the level of [[racial segregation]] among immigrants and native-born people. Thirdly, the difference in institutional arrangements may influence immigrant assimilation. Traditional gateways, unlike new gateways, have many institutions set up to help immigrants such as legal aid, bureaus, social organizations. Finally, Waters and Jimenez have only speculated that those differences may influence immigrant assimilation and the way researchers that should assess immigrant assimilation.&lt;ref name="Waters"/&gt;

'''Cultural Competency Training''' is an instruction to achieve cultural competence and the ability to appreciate and interpret accurately other [[culture]]s.

==Cultural competence==
[[Cultural competence]] refers to an ability to interact effectively with people of different cultures. Cultural competence comprises four components: (a) awareness of one's own cultural worldview, (b) attitude towards cultural differences, (c) knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews, and (d) cross-cultural skills. Developing cultural competence results in an ability to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures and leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Cultural Candor Inc. Cultural Competency Training| accessdate=12 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Competency has a fundamental importance in every aspect of a work field and that includes school and government setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasponline.org/research-and-policy/advocacy-tools-and-resources/communications-strategies-and-resources/school-climate%E2%80%94connectthedots/the-importance-of-cultural-competence|title=The Importance of Cultural Competence|website=www.nasponline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the amalgamation of different cultures in American society, it has become imperative for teachers and government employees to have some form of cultural competency training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/39783.htm|title=Why Cultural Competence?|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
To cater to an increasingly globalized society, many hospitals, organizations, and employers may choose to implement forms of cultural competency training methods to enhance transparency between language, values, beliefs, and cultural differences.  Training in cultural competence often includes careful consideration of how best to approach people's various forms of diversity.  This new found awareness oftentimes allows military members, educators, medical practitioners, workers, and common citizens to establish equity in their environments and enhances interrelationships between one another for increased productivity levels.  There have been numerous developed theories as to how best to conduct cultural competency training, which oftentimes is dependent on the specific environment and type of work.

== Cultural Competence Training &amp; Identity ==

When defining the ideas that surround cultural competence training, defining what culture is can help to understand the ideas that shape the concept. [[Culture]] is defined as the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution or organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of CULTURE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at culture in terms of cultural competence training, certain groups of individuals should be focused on because of their relevance to society. There are many groups that are marginalized and underrepresented; however, four specific areas to look at are:

=== LGBTQIAP ===
[[LGBT|LGBTQIAP]] community, race, and religion. These areas, along with others, represent concepts that make up one’s identity. The approach to identity helps to shape the ideas and themes that go into cultural competence training.
The acronym LGBTQIAP stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Ally, and Pansexual. This particular group of individuals has faced numerous obstacles and has historical events to highlight the inequalities they face such as the Stonewall riots. The [[Stonewall riots]] became a symbol for the gay liberation movement when police attempted a raid at the Stonewall Inn bar to arrest the gay and lesbian patrons and the gay community fought back. Numerous systemic oppressions historically and currently target LGBT individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leyva|first1=Valerie L.|last2=Breshears|first2=Elizabeth M.|last3=Ringstad|first3=Robin|title=Assessing the Efficacy of LGBT Cultural Competency Training for Aging Services Providers in California’s Central Valley|journal=Journal of Gerontological Social Work|volume=57|issue=2-4|pages=335–348|doi=10.1080/01634372.2013.872215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competence training helps professionals develop knowledge and skills on how to address issues and be more aware on the type of language that is politically correct.

=== Race ===
Race is a sensitive aspect of cultural competency training that requires professionals to be able to identify, acknowledge and value cultural differences. Training on this aspect of cultural competence teaches professionals that to ignore racial differences, is a form of microaggression that can help exacerbate racial inequalities.  In order to begin to understand intercultural communications one must understand the historical and social context under which different cultural groups operate.  For example, the history related to the cultural genocide of indigenous peoples in North America, understanding the said group’s value system, their ways of learning, and logic is essential in being able to understand how certain aspects of their culture may be similar or different from our own. Such distinction must be approached with respect and without ascribing superiority or inferiority to the difference.

=== Religion ===
Religious differences can play a role in how professionals interact and communicate with others. [[Religiosity]] refers to the nature and extent of public and private religious activity, including belief in God, prayer, and place of worship attendance. Religiosity is usually linked to formal religious traditions (such as [[Christianity]]), institutions (such as mosques), sacred texts (such as [[Book of Mormon|The Book of Mormon]]), and a definitive moral code (such as the Decalogue). Spirituality can be an important part of religion but can also exist independent of extant faith traditions, involving a variety of more individual subjective beliefs and activities related to the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this aspect of cultural competence training professionals should learn how to have religious competence. Religious competence refers to skills, practices, and orientations that recognize, explore, and harness patient religiosity to facilitate diagnosis, recovery, and healing. Religious competence involves the learning and deployment of generic competencies, including active listening and a nonjudgmental stance. It is also an overarching orientation, providing a safe place for discussion of religious issues and identities received in a humble, respectful, and empathetic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nationality ===
in terms of nationality, particularly for people who are immigrants, the recent increase in global migration make them an increasingly common demographic everywhere. Though they will have varying cultures as well. In this aspect, it is important for those who are trained to understand both similarities and differences between them, and the individual they are helping. With this knowledge, it makes the process of aiding the individual more efficient, and successful. &lt;ref&gt;Schouler-Ocak, Graef-Calliess, Tarricone, Qureshi, Kastrup, &amp; Bhugra. (2015). EPA guidance on cultural competence training. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''30''(3), 431-440.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the past Nation the individual has come from, and their journey of immigration as an experience, can shape their mentality. To have specialists with specific nationalities help explain some differences is a helpful strategy. &lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, D. (2017). Cultural competence training and mental health care in refugees and asylum seekers. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''41''(SS), S35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in School ==
School is considered to be the second learning home for kids. Every year a large number of people come to the United States. These groups of people are often families, including small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics|title=Immigration Data &amp; Statistics {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today’s world, cultural competency plays a very vital role in shaping the kids future. In the United States, there is an underlying difference among parents as to how a kid should be raised, but it is clear that cultural competency should be taught at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/cultural-competence-and-your-child/|title=Cultural Competence and Your Child {{!}} Wendy McElroy|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|date=2007-09-01|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is not the front runner in cultural competency training amongst children, as Canada and Australia are seemingly far more progressive in this sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wehearyou.acecqa.gov.au/2014/07/10/what-does-it-mean-to-be-culturally-competent/|title=What does it mean to be culturally competent?|last=ACECQA|first=Author|date=2014-07-10|website=We Hear You|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competency training can be a huge help for the families who are thinking of adopting a foster child, specifically, if that child was born outside of United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/pressroom/features/issue/diversity.asp|title=Diversity &amp; Cultural Competence|website=www.socialworkers.org|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A school is a mixture of different races and cultures and as an educator, one must be sensitive to everyone’s needs. Different cultures act uniquely to the different situations, and as an educator, one has to not only value diversity, but also have a strategy for everyone to feel welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/30402.htm|title=Diversity Toolkit: Cultural Competence for Educators|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in the Workforce ==
Over the years, there have been new developed ways of practicing cultural competency in the workforce. There are many different methods that would allow assistance in cultural competency such as: Global leadership programs, international team building exercises and specific cross-cultural skills training for special executive positions. Having a good grasp on the many different cultures that exist is increasingly becoming a major principle in the workforce. The techniques for cultural competency training must be practiced more than just in class room lecture. Trainers must be extremely educated in this matter to be able to sufficiently train people.  They must take notice of their own biases perspective and about the different types cultures that receive discrimination.

== Cultural Competence Training for Medical Students and Physicians ==
{{see also|Cultural competence in health care}}
In the medical setting, effective communication between clinicians, patients, families and other health care providers is fundamental.

[[Health disparities]] refer to gaps in the quality of health and health care across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Studies have demonstrated the multiple factors that contribute to health disparities.

Cultural Competence Online for Medical Practice (CCOMP) is an attempt in the United States to address one of the factors - the patient-doctor interaction.  The CCOMP project is funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  CCOMP offers a clinician's guide to reduce cardiovascular disparities, intended to create effective cross-cultural approaches to care for African-American patients with [[cardiovascular disease]], especially [[hypertension]]. Videos with real patient scenarios and case-based modules are aimed at developing this increased awareness.

'''Cultural consensus theory''' is an [http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/sbp09/Presentations/paper%20presentations/William%20BatchelderCCTSBP092009(1).pdf approach to information pooling] (aggregation, data fusion) which supports a framework for the measurement and evaluation of beliefs as [[cultural]]; shared to some extent by a group of individuals.  Cultural consensus models guide the aggregation of responses from individuals to estimate (1) the culturally appropriate answers to a series of related questions (when the answers are unknown) and (2) individual competence (cultural competence) in answering those questions.  The theory is applicable when there is sufficient agreement across people to assume that a single set of answers exists.  The agreement between pairs of individuals is used to estimate individual cultural competence.  Answers are estimated by weighting responses of individuals by their competence and then combining responses.

== Theory ==
Cultural consensus theory assumes that  [[cultural]] beliefs are learned and shared across people and that there is a common understanding of what the world and society are all about.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engaging Society: The Sociologist in a War Zone|last=Carroll|first=John|publisher=Ateneo University Press|year=2006|isbn=9789715505055|location=Manila|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the amount of information in a culture is too large for any one individual to master, individuals know different subsets of the cultural knowledge and vary in their cultural competence.  Cultural beliefs are beliefs held by a majority of culture members.  Given a set of questions, on the same topic, shared cultural beliefs or norms regarding the answers can be estimated by aggregating the responses across a sample of culture members.  When agreement is close to absolute, estimating answers is straightforward.  The problem addressed by cultural consensus theory is how to estimate beliefs when there is some degree of heterogeneity present in responses.  In general, cultural consensus theory provides a framework for determining whether responses are sufficiently homogeneous to estimate a single set of shared answers, and then estimating the answers and individual cultural competence in answering the questions.

Cultural consensus models do not create consensus or explain why consensus exists; they simply facilitate the discovery and description of possible consensus.  A high degree of agreement among raters must be present in responses in order to use consensus theory – only with high agreement does it make sense to aggregate responses to estimate beliefs of the group.  Although there are statistical methods to evaluate whether agreement among raters is greater than chance ([[Binomial test]], [[Friedman test]], or [[Kendall's W|Kendall’s coefficient of concordance]]), these methods do not provide a best estimate of the “true” answers nor do they estimate competence of the raters.  Cultural consensus theory is able to estimate competence from the agreement between subjects and then, answers are estimated by “weighting” individual responses by competence prior to aggregation.

A very important feature in the [[Aggregate data|aggregation of responses]] is that the combined responses of individuals will be more accurate than the responses of each individual included in the aggregation. [[Reliability theory]] in psychology (specifically, the reliability coefficient and the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]]) provides a mathematical estimate of the accuracy or validity of aggregated responses from the number of units being combined and the level of agreement among the units.  In this case, accuracy of aggregated responses can be calculated from the number of subjects and the average [[Pearson correlation coefficient]] between all pairs of subjects (across questions).

==Usage==
To use cultural consensus theory, at least three assumptions must be met:
# Informants must be asked a series of questions. The questions should all be on the same topic and at the same level of difficulty. This assumption concerns the homogeneity of items&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Culturally-Aware Intelligent Systems and in Cross-Cultural Psychological Studies|last=Faucher|first=Colette|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=9783319670225|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and means that items should represent only one topic or domain of knowledge and that competency should be consistent across items, so that if someone does well on one subset of questions, they should also do well on another subset of questions. Responses to questions are not corrected, recoded, transformed, or reflected as they are with knowledge tests and attitudinal scales because the purpose is to use the original responses to estimate culturally correct answers.
# Each informant should provide answers independently of all other informants. This means that answers should be provided by individuals and not groups, and without consultation with others. Consensus models are not appropriate for group interviews.
# The cultural consensus model is applicable only if there is a single set of answers to the questions. This means that there must be a high level of consistency (agreement) in responses among informants, which some refer to as common truth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Research methods and Applications in Environmental Studies|last=Matthias|first=Ruth|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781783474639|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aggregation of responses is not a valid estimate unless there is reasonable consistency in the underlying data. An initial step in applying consensus theory is to check whether there is a high degree of agreement among the informants (e.g., to verify that there is only one response pattern present). 

==Models of the theory==
Cultural consensus theory encompasses formal and informal models. Practically speaking, these models are often used to estimate cultural beliefs, including the degree to which individuals report such beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The formal cultural consensus model models the decision-making process for answering questions.&lt;ref name="RWB86"&gt;Romney AK, Weller SC., Batchelder WH.  Culture as consensus: A theory of culture and informant accuracy.  Am Anthro. 1986;88(2):313–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BR88"&gt;Batchelder WH, Romney AK.  Test theory without an answer key. Psychometrika. 1988;53(1):71–92.&lt;/ref&gt;  This version is limited to categorical-type responses:  multiple-choice type questions (including those with dichotomous true/false or yes/no responses) and responses to open-ended questions (with a single word or short phrase response for each question). This version of the model has a series of additional assumptions that must be met, i.e., no response bias.&lt;ref name="RWB86" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, SC and Mann NC. Assessing rater performance without a “gold standard” using consensus theory.  Medical Decision Making 1997; 17:71–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal model has direct parallels in signal detection theory and latent class analysis.  An informal version of the model is available as a set of analytic procedures and obtains similar information with fewer assumptions.&lt;ref name="RBW87"&gt;Romney AK, Batchelder WH, Weller SC.  Recent applications of cultural consensus theory.  Am Behavioral Scientist.  1987; 31:163–177.&lt;/ref&gt;  The informal model parallels a factor analysis on people (without rotation) and thus has similarities to [[Q methodology|Q factor analysis (as in Q Methodology)]].  The informal version of the model can accommodate interval estimates and ranked response data.  Both approaches provide estimates of the culturally correct answers and estimates of individual differences in the accuracy of reported information. 

One specific method of the formal version used in the analysis of data is the mathematical model, which is a set of logical axioms as well as derived propositions and assumptions that explain how empirical variables fit in the model's parameters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The informal model, on the other hand, uses reliability analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Social Sciences: Methods and Research Design|last=Vaccaro|first=Ismael|last2=Smith|first2=Eric Alden|last3=Aswani|first3=Shankar|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521110846|location=Cambridge|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competence==
Cultural competence is estimated from the similarity in responses between pairs of subjects since the agreement between a pair of respondents is a function of their individual competencies.  In the formal model, similarity is the probability that matched responses occur (match method.&lt;ref name="RWB86"/&gt; or the probability of particular response combinations occur (covariance method&lt;ref name="BR88" /&gt;).  Simple match or covariance measures are then corrected for guessing and the proportion of positive responses, respectively.  In the informal model, similarity is calculated with a [[Pearson correlation coefficient]].&lt;ref name="RBW87" /&gt;

A [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of agreement coefficients between all pairs of subjects is then factored with a minimum residual factoring method ([[Factor analysis#Types of factoring|principal axis factoring without rotation]]) to solve for the unknown competence values on the main diagonal.  (For the informal model, the maximum likelihood factor analysis algorithm is preferred, but principal axis factoring can be used as well.)  To determine whether the solution meets cultural consensus criteria, that only a single factor is present, a goodness of fit rule is used.  If the ratio of the first to second [[eigenvalues]] is large with subsequently small values and all first factor loadings are positive, then it is assumed that the data contain only a single factor or a single response pattern.

===Individual competence===
'''Individual competence values are used to weight the responses and estimate the culturally correct answers'''.  In the formal model, a confidence level ([[Bayesian probability|Bayesian adjusted probabilities]]) is obtained for each answer from the pattern of responses and the individual competence scores.  In the informal model, responses are also weighted, using a [[linear model]].  When factoring a [[correlation matrix]], the estimated answers appear as the first set of factor scores.  Also, note that factor scores are usually provided as standardized variables (mean of zero), but may be transformed back to your original data collection units.

==Analysis==
When used as a method for analysis, the cultural consensus theory allows the following: the determination whether the observed variability in knowledge is cultural; the measurement of cultural competence that each individual possesses; and, the determination of culturally correct knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cultural Consensus analyses may be performed with software applications.  The formal consensus model is currently only available in  the software packages [http://www.analytictech.com/anthropac/apacdesc.htm ANTHROPAC] or [http://www.analytictech.com/ucinet/ UCINET].  Analysis procedures for the informal model are available in most statistical packages. The informal model can be run within a factor analysis procedure, requesting the minimum-residual (principal axis factoring) algorithm method that solves for the missing diagonal without rotation. However, when factor analysis is used for consensus applications, ~~the data must be transposed, so that questions are the unit of analysis (the rows in a data matrix) and people are the variables~~ (the columns in the data matrix).

An advantage of cultural consensus is the availability of necessary sample size information and that necessary sample sizes do not need to be very large.  Sample size determination in a consensus analysis is similar to other types of analyses; namely, that when variability is low, power is high and small samples will suffice.  Here, variability is the agreement (competence) among subjects.  For the formal model, sample size can be estimated from the level of agreement (e.g., assuming a low average competence level of .50), the proportion of items to be correctly classified (assuming a high level, .95), and high confidence (.999) a minimum sample size of 29 (per subgroup) is necessary.[1,5]  For higher levels of competence and lower levels of accuracy and confidence, smaller samples sizes are necessary.  Similarly, sample size can be estimated with reliability theory and the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula|Spearman–Brown prophecy formula]] (applied to people instead of items).  For a relatively low level of agreement (an average correlation of .25 between people, comparable to an average competence of .50) and a high degree of desired validity (.95 correlation between the estimated answers and the true answers), a study would require a minimum sample size of 30 subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Weller SC: Cultural consensus theory: Applications and frequently asked questions.  Field Methods 2007; 19(4): 339–368.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, cultural consensus theory offers a framework for estimating cultural beliefs.  A formal model is based on the decision-making process model of how questions are answered (with parameters for competence, response bias and guessing).  The model proceeds from axioms and uses mathematical proofs to arrive at estimates of competence and answers to a series of questions.  The informal model is a set of statistical procedures that provides similar information.  Given a series of related questions, the agreement between people’s reported answers is used to estimate their cultural competence.  Cultural competence is how much an individual knows or shares group beliefs.  Since the extraction of individual competencies depends upon having a single factor solution, the ratio of the first and second eigenvalues (&gt; 3:1) serves as a goodness-of-fit indicator that a single factor is present in the pattern of responses.  Culturally correct answers are estimated by weighting and combining individuals’ responses.

Absinthe has played a notable role in the [[fine art]] movements of [[Impressionism]], [[Post-impressionism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Modernism]], [[Cubism]] and in the corresponding literary movements. The legendary drink has more recently appeared in movies, video, television, music, and contemporary literature. The modern absinthe revival has had a notable effect on its portrayal. It is often shown as an unnaturally glowing green liquid demonstrating the influence of contemporary marketing efforts.

Absinthe has a widely documented role in 19th-century visual art and was frequently the subject of many [[Genre works|genre paintings]] and [[still life]]s of the day.

*[[Edgar Degas]]' painting ''[[L'Absinthe]]'' (1876) portrayed grim absinthe drinkers in a cafe. Degas himself never called the painting "L'Absinthe"; it was either his art dealer or a later owner who gave it the name.  Years later, it set off a flurry in the London art world, and the grim realism of "L'Absinthe" (a theme popular with [[bohemian]] artists) was perceived by London art critics as a lesson against alcohol and the French in general. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
*[[Paul Gauguin]] is known for consuming large quantities of absinthe,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and his bold use of flat color has also been attributed to its influence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/352/12/1275 NEJM - Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=November 2009}}

*[[Picasso]] depicted absinthe in various media, including the paintings ''Woman Drinking Absinthe'' (1901), ''Bottle of Pernod and Glass'' (1912), and the sculpture ''Absinthe Glass'' (1914).
*[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] was notorious for his consumption of the green muse. He often painted impressionistic scenes of the brothels and night spots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coloradocollege.edu/publications/thebulletin/spring97/gayle.html |title=Gale Murray and Toulouse-Lautrec |work=Coloradocollege.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529160958/http://www.coloradocollege.edu/Publications/thebulletin/spring97/gayle.html |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of 19th-century [[Montmartre]].

*In the game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', Absinthe is a rare consumable item which boosts Perception instead of Strength.

==Literature==

===Classic literature===
As prominent as absinthe's influence on visual art was, it is perhaps even more noteworthy in the context of 19th-century literature. Below is a short list of important authors who credited a portion of their literary success to the drink.

*[[Baudelaire]] was an avid absinthe drinker. Though he never wrote specifically about absinthe he did reference it in his famous poem "Get Drunk".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.absintheliquor.com/famous_absinthe_citats.htm Absintheliquor.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Guy de Maupassant]] was a naturalistic French author. He is generally considered one of the greatest French short story writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online-literature.com/maupassant/ |title=Guy de Maupassant - Biography and Works |work=Online-literature.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one famous work of prose, "A Queer Night in Paris", he describes the smells and sensations of absinthe in the streets of Paris and makes an overt reference to "the hour to take absinthe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readprint.com/work-1178/Guy-de-Maupassant |title=A Queer Night in Paris by Guy de Maupassant |publisher=Read Print |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ernest Dowson]] was an important English poet who notably wrote a poem dedicated to absinthe called "Absinthia Taetra".
*[[Ernest Hemingway]] features absinthe in the [[short story]] "[[Hills Like White Elephants]]" (1927), and in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1940), disappointed with the quality of other liquor available, Robert Jordan turns to absinthe while fighting with the loyalist guerrillas. Hemingway himself was a frequent absinthe drinker and most likely procured his absinthe from Spain and [[Cuba]] after the ban.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barnaby Conrad III|Conrad III, Barnaby]]; (1988). ''Absinthe History in a Bottle. ''Chronicle books. {{ISBN|0-8118-1650-8}} p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alfred Jarry]] is notably the author of the French absurdist play, ''Ubu Roi.'' Jarry claimed to use absinthe to "fuse together the dream and reality, art and lifestyle".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The drink was purported by the author to be a key part of his creative process.
*[[Arthur Rimbaud]] was a young Parisian poet who was notably involved in a homosexual relationship with Paul Verlaine; they famously drank large quantities of absinthe together. Their relationship ended when Rimbaud was shot in the hand by Verlaine, who was then sentenced to prison. Later in life Rimbaud quit drinking absinthe and writing poetry and instead became involved in military exploits and [[gun running]]. He is still regarded as one of France's greatest poets.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
*[[Paul Marie Verlaine]] was a famous Parisian poet of the Bohemian style. Though he wrote extensively about the benefits of absinthe in his early years, he later claimed to have consorted with prostitutes and men while drinking it, and blamed the beverage for his downfalls. Even when he was on his deathbed, his friends were said to be hiding bottles for him under his pillow.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zoomgraphics.com/absinthe/drinkers.html |title=Zoomgraphics Absinthe Page |work=Zoomgraphics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606074910/http://www.zoomgraphics.com/absinthe/drinkers.html |archivedate=2010-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Oscar Wilde]] was an avid absinthe consumer {{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and often wrote about the drink in connection with the creative process.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  Wilde has been quoted as saying, "What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxygenee.com/absintheFAQ4.html |title=Oxygénée's Absinthe FAQ IV |work=Oxygenee.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926210034/http://www.oxygenee.com/absintheFAQ4.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Absinthe History in a bottle" [[Barnaby Conrad III]] (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; and "After the first glass [of absinthe] you see things as you wish they were. After the second, you see things as they are not. Finally, you see things as they really are, and that is the most horrible thing in the world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michelleblack.com/books/absinthe.html |title=The Second Glass of Absinthe |publisher=Michelle Black |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary literature ===

*[[Dennis Wheatley]] included an absinthe session in his novel about the outbreak of the [[World War I|Great War]] in 1914, ''The Second Seal'' (1950). Wheatley was a wine merchant for many years, with a wide stock of spirits and liqueurs as well, and always put much information on the subject in his books. His hero the [[Duke de Richleau]] has been sent by British Intelligence on a mission to Vienna. He has to foil a plot by the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] to disturb the peace of Europe, and so of course must concentrate his thoughts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;  Instinctively he walked back across the Ring to Sachers. There he went up to his room, sat on his bed for a while, then rang for the waiter and ordered a double Absinthe. When it arrived, he added sugar and water and slowly drank the opal fluid. It had no more perceptible kick in it than lime juice, or a diluted [[paregoric]] cough mixture which it resembled in flavour, but he knew it had hidden properties which would act like a drug in clearing and accelerating his brain.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

*An absinthe hallucination may or may not have inspired a murder in ''The Second Glass of Absinthe'' (2003), a mystery novel by [[Michelle Black]], set in 1880 Leadville, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Michelle, ''The Second Glass of Absinthe. ''Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0-7653-4756-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Asinthe lends the name to [[Kyell Gold]]'s novel ''Green Fairy''. The substance is the driving force in [[Forester Universe#Dangerous Spirits|Dangerous Spirits]], in which multiple protagonists make use of it to commune with spirits.
*Gemma Doyle, the main character of Libba Bray's 2007 sequel ''[[Rebel Angels (Bray novel)|Rebel Angels]]'' (set in 1895), drinks absinthe with her friends at a Christmas ball and experiences hallucinatory effects.
*The characters in [[Poppy Z. Brite]]'s short story, "His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood", discover a crate of absinthe, the consumption of which forms the backdrop against which their transgressive antics occur.  The short story can be found in ''[[Swamp Foetus]]''. Characters in her book ''[[Lost Souls (Poppy Z. Brite novel)|Lost Souls]]'' also drink absinthe.&lt;ref name="LadouceurPullin2011"/&gt;
*''The Absinthe Cloud'' (LePage/Dupuy #1, 2012) is a spy thriller by Timothy Everhart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Everhard|title=The Absinthe Cloud (LePage/Dupuy #1)|id=[[Barnes &amp; Noble|BNID]] [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=2940044758377 2940044758377]|publisher=[[Smashwords]]|date=2012-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Absinthe figures heavily into the plot of the novel ''[[The Basic Eight]]'' (1999), by [[Daniel Handler]], which features Bohemian characters who are drawn to absinthe by its dangerous history.&lt;ref&gt;Handler, Daniel; (1999). ''The Basic Eight''. Thomas Dunne Books. {{ISBN|0-312-19833-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell]]'' (2006) contains a story in which the author, [[Tucker Max]], experiences absinthe for the first time.
*The [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]] character [[Aloysius Pendergast]] displays an affinity for absinthe in multiple novels.

==Music==
* [[Barbara (singer)|Barbara]] (1930-1997) the popular French female singer wrote and composed, with Frédéric Botton, and sang "l Absinthe", a song published in her 12th album [[:fr:La Fleur d'amour|''La Fleur d'amour'']] (1972). This song is a love song, a bit sad and nostalgic -sadness is Barbara's trademark-, where the singer explains to a lover that drinking absinthe helps, at last to feel in love, to render love joyful, just like it helped Rimbaud and Verlaine to write their poetry (a recurrent comparison, all along the song).
*[[Marilyn Manson]] has been an avid fan of absinthe since the recording of the ''[[Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/1174198.html "Go green with Marilyn: Drowned In Sound - Thurs 28 Sep 2006 absinthe news article"]. Retrieved 1 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also developed his own brand of the drink, entitled Mansinthe.
*On [[Minus The Bear]]'s 2002 debut album, ''[[Highly Refined Pirates]]'', there is a track entitled "Absinthe Party At The Fly Honey Warehouse". It is one of their most popular tracks among fans.

'''Culture''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|l|tʃ|ər}}) is the [[social behavior]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[Society|societies]]. Culture is considered a central concept in [[anthropology]], encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social [[learning]] in human [[society|societies]]. [[Cultural universals]] are found in all human societies; these include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[Tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of [[social organization]] (including practices of [[political organization]] and social [[institutions]]), [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]] (both [[writing|written]] and [[oral literature|oral]]), and [[science]] comprise the [[intangible cultural heritage]] of a society.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber and 2010 53"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995|title=Sociology|last=Macionis|first=John J|last2=Gerber|first2=Linda Marie|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|oclc=652430995|isbn=978-0137001613|location=Toronto|language=English|page=53|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995|archive-date=August 18, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[humanities]], one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in [[the arts]], sciences, [[education]], or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been seen to distinguish [[civilization]]s from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in [[Social class|class-based]] distinctions between a [[high culture]] of the social [[elite]] and a [[low culture]], [[popular culture]], or [[folk culture]] of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to [[cultural capital]]. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by [[ethnicity|ethnic groups]] to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as [[body modification]], [[clothing]] or [[jewelry]]. [[Media culture|Mass culture]] refers to the [[Mass production|mass-produced]] and [[mass media]]ted forms of [[consumer culture]] that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as [[Marxism]] and [[critical theory]], have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the lower classes and create a [[false consciousness]], and such perspectives are common in the discipline of [[cultural studies]]. In the wider [[social sciences]], the theoretical perspective of [[cultural materialism (cultural studies)|cultural materialism]] holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in [[human evolution|evolved biological]] dispositions.

When used as a [[count noun]], a "culture" is the set of customs, [[tradition]]s, and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic group or nation. Culture is the set of knowledge acquired over time. In this sense, [[multiculturalism]] values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet. Sometimes "culture" is also used to describe specific practices within a subgroup of a society, a [[subculture]] (e.g. "[[bro culture]]"), or a [[counterculture]]. Within [[cultural anthropology]], the ideology and analytical stance of [[cultural relativism]] holds that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system of a given culture.

== Etymology ==
The modern term "culture" is based on a term used by the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] orator [[Cicero]] in his ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', where he wrote of a cultivation of the soul or ''"cultura animi,"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA273|title=Tusculanes|last=Cicéron|first=Marcus Tullius Cicero|last2=Bouhier|first2=Jean|date=1812|publisher=J. Gaude|location=Nismes|oclc=457735057|page=273|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; using an [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[metaphor]] for the development of a philosophical soul, understood [[teleology|teleologically]] as the highest possible ideal for human development. [[Samuel Pufendorf]] took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection. His use, and that of many writers after him, "''refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original [[Barbarian|barbarism]], and through artifice, become fully human."''&lt;ref name=velkley&gt;{{Cite book|title=Being after Rousseau: philosophy and culture in question|last=Velkley|first=Richard L|date=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|oclc=47930775|isbn=978-0226852560|chapter=The Tension in the Beautiful: On Culture and Civilization in Rousseau and German Philosophy|pages=11–30|location=Chicago|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, philosopher [[Edward S. Casey]] wrote, "The very word ''culture'' meant 'place tilled' in Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin ''colere'', 'to inhabit, care for, till, worship' and ''cultus'', 'A cult, especially a religious one.' To be cultural, to have a culture, is to inhabit a place sufficiently intensive to cultivate it—to be responsible for it, to respond to it, to attend to it caringly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorrells|first1=Kathryn|title=Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice|date=2015|publisher=Sage|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1412927444}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;!-- Ref provided is based purely on ASIN from earlier, incomplete, citation. NEEDS Verification --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture described by [[Richard Velkley]]:&lt;ref name=velkley/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires most of its later modern meaning in the writings of the 18th-century German thinkers, who were on various levels developing [[Rousseau]]'s criticism of "[[modernity|modern]] [[liberalism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]". Thus a contrast between "culture" and "[[civilization]]" is usually implied in these authors, even when not expressed as such.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the words of anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]], it is "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."{{sfn|Tylor|1974|loc=1}} Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, "Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/9294719|title=Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability|last=James|first=Paul|last2=Magee|first2=Liam|last3=Scerri|first3=Andy|last4=Steger|first4=Manfred|date=2015|isbn=978-1138025721|oclc=942553107|page=53|publisher=Routledge|location=London|language=en|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626015736/http://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_|archive-date=June 26, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|Cambridge English Dictionary]]'' states that culture is "the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time."&lt;ref name="dict_cult"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/culture|title=Meaning of "culture"|work=Cambridge English Dictionary|language=en|access-date=July 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815114957/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/culture|archive-date=August 15, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terror management theory]] posits that culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide humans with the basis for perceiving themselves as "person[s] of worth within the world of meaning"—raising themselves above the merely physical aspects of existence, in order to deny the animal insignificance and death that ''Homo sapiens'' became aware of when they acquired a larger brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0065260115000052|title=Thirty Years of Terror Management Theory|volume=52|last=Pyszczynski|first=Tom|last2=Solomon|first2=Sheldon|last3=Greenberg|first3=Jeff|pages=1–70|language=en|doi=10.1016/bs.aesp.2015.03.001|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915131346/http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0065260115000052|archive-date=September 15, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|year=2015|isbn=978-0128022474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_9dAgAAQBAJ|title=Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychology|last=Greenberg|first=Jeff|last2=Koole|first2=Sander L.|last3=Pyszczynski|first3=Tom|year=2013|publisher=Guilford Publications|isbn=978-1462514793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with [[symbol]]s and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of [[behavioral modernity]] in humans around 50,000 years ago, and is often thought to be unique to humans, although some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complex, abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that is transmitted through social [[interaction]] and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form.

[[Raimon Panikkar]] identified 29 ways in which [[cultural change]] can be brought about, including growth, development, evolution, [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]], renovation, [[reconception]], reform, innovation, [[revivalism]], revolution, [[mutation]], progress, [[diffusion]], osmosis, borrowing, [[eclecticism]], [[syncretism]], modernization, [[indigenization]], and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious Pluralism: An Indian Christian Perspective|last=Panikkar|first=Raimon|editor-last=Pathil|editor-first=Kuncheria|date=1991|publisher=[[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|ISPCK]]|isbn=978-8172140052|oclc=25410539|pages=252–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, modernization could be viewed as adoption of Enlightenment era beliefs and practices, such as science, rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and the notion of progress. [[Rein Raud]], building on the work of [[Umberto Eco]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]], has proposed a model of cultural change based on claims and bids, which are judged by their [[cognitive adequacy]] and endorsed or not endorsed by the symbolic authority of the cultural community in question.&lt;ref name="meaning-in-action" /&gt;

[[Cultural invention]] has come to mean any innovation that is new and found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their behavior but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in a global "accelerating culture change period," driven by the expansion of international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the [[World population|human population]] explosion, among other factors. [[Culture change|Culture repositioning]] means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chigbu|first=Uchendu Eugene|date=2015-07-03|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–50|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506|issn=1366-8803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. These forces are related to both [[social structure]]s and natural events, and are involved in the perpetuation of cultural ideas and practices within current structures, which themselves are subject to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/change/change_2.htm|title=Culture Change: Processes of Change|last=O'Neil|first=Dennis|date=2006|website=Culture Change|publisher=Palomar College|access-date=October 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027181934/http://anthro.palomar.edu/change/change_2.htm|archive-date=October 27, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[structuration]].)

Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new [[schema (psychology)|cultural models]], and spurring or enabling [[generative actor|generative action]]. These social shifts may accompany [[ideology|ideological]] shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S. [[feminist movement]] involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last [[ice age]], plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the invention of [[agriculture]], which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Heather|date=November 20, 1998|title=The Slow Birth of Agriculture|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/282/5393/1446|journal=Science|language=en|volume=282|issue=5393|page=1446|doi=10.1126/science.282.5393.1446|issn=0036-8075|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807163436/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/282/5393/1446|archive-date=August 7, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or acculturation. In [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]], the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, [[hamburger]]s, fast food in the United States, seemed exotic when introduced into China.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} "Stimulus diffusion" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. "Direct borrowing," on the other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another. [[Diffusion of innovations]] theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas, practices, and products.

[[Acculturation]] has different meanings, but in this context it refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened to certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes and to many indigenous peoples across the globe during the process of [[colonization]]. Related processes on an individual level include [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] (adoption of a different culture by an individual) and [[transculturation]]. The transnational flow of culture has played a major role in merging different culture and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.

==Early modern discourses==

===German Romanticism===
[[File:Johann gottfried herder.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johann Herder]] called attention to national cultures.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) formulated an individualist definition of "enlightenment" similar to the concept of ''[[bildung]]'': "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1784. "Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?" (German: "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?") ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'', December (Berlin Monthly)&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: ''Sapere aude'', "Dare to be wise!" In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of ''bildung'': "For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/USC/pbt1.html|title=The German Bildung Tradition|last=Eldridge|first=Michael|publisher=[[UNC Charlotte]]|access-date=2017-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123162257/http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/USC/pbt1.html|archive-date=January 23, 2009|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Bastian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Bastian]] developed a universal model of culture.]]
In 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], scholars in [[Germany]], especially those concerned with [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a "Germany" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]—developed a more inclusive notion of culture as "[[world view|worldview]]" (''Weltanschauung'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humboldt, Worldview, and Language|last=Underhill|first=James W.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Edinburgh|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between "civilized" and "primitive" or "tribal" cultures.

In 1860, [[Adolf Bastian]] (1826–1905) argued for "the psychic unity of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adolf Bastian and the psychic unity of mankind|last=Köpping|first=Klaus-Peter|date=2005|publisher=Lit Verlag|isbn=978-3825839895|oclc=977343058}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of "elementary ideas" (''Elementargedanken''); different cultures, or different "folk ideas" (''Völkergedanken''), are local modifications of the elementary ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://todayinsci.com/B/Bastian_Adolf/BastianAdolf.htm|title=Biography of Adolf Bastian, ethnologist|last=Ellis|first=Ian|website=Today in Science History|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806215336/https://todayinsci.com/B/Bastian_Adolf/BastianAdolf.htm|archive-date=August 6, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

===English Romanticism===
[[File:Matthew Arnold - Project Gutenberg eText 16745.jpg|thumb|left|upright|British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] viewed "culture" as the cultivation of the humanist ideal.]]

In the 19th century, [[Humanism|humanists]] such as [[English people|English]] poet and essayist [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822–1888) used the word "culture" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of "the best that has been thought and said in the world."&lt;ref name=anarchy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_all.html|title=Culture and Anarchy|last=Arnold|first=Matthew|date=1869|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106012655/http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_all.html|archive-date=January 6, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of culture is also comparable to the [[German people|German]] concept of ''bildung'': "...culture being a pursuit of our total [[perfection]] by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world."&lt;ref name=anarchy /&gt;

In practice, ''culture'' referred to an [[elite]] ideal and was associated with such activities as [[art]], [[European classical music|classical music]], and [[haute cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1983), p. 90. Cited in {{Cite book|title=Understanding popular music|last=Roy|first=Shuker|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415107235|oclc=245910934|page=5}} argues that contemporary definitions of culture fall into three possibilities or mixture of the following three:
* "a general process of intellectual, spiritual, and aesthetic development"
* "a particular way of life, whether of a people, period, or a group"
* "the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity".&lt;/ref&gt; As these forms were associated with urban life, "culture" was identified with "civilization" (from lat. ''civitas'', city). Another facet of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement was an interest in [[folklore]], which led to identifying a "culture" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between [[high culture]], namely that of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]], and [[low culture]]. In other words, the idea of "culture" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1981, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|upright|British anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] was one of the first English-speaking scholars to use the term culture in an inclusive and universal sense.]]

Matthew Arnold contrasted "culture" with [[anarchy]]; other Europeans, following [[philosophy|philosophers]] [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], contrasted "culture" with "the state of nature." According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between "civilized" and "uncivilized." According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to [[Herbert Spencer]]'s theory of [[Social Darwinism]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s theory of [[cultural evolution]]. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is really an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is really an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects.

Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and [[sophistication]] of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature.&lt;!-- i.e. American Transcendentalism?? --&gt; These critics considered [[folk music]] (as produced by "the folk," i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed [[indigenous peoples]] as "[[noble savage]]s" living [[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified [[capitalism|capitalist]] systems of [[Western culture|the West]].

In 1870 the anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] (1832–1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the [[evolution of religion]]. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.&lt;ref&gt;McClenon, pp. 528–29&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

==Sociology==
{{main|Sociology of culture}}
The [[sociology of culture]] concerns culture as manifested in [[society]]. For sociologist [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918), culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/oclc/951272809|title=Georg Simmel on individuality and social forms: selected writings|last=Simmel|first=Georg|editor-last=Levine|editor-first=Donald N|date=1971|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226757766|location=Chicago|page=xix|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912194431/https://www.worldcat.org/title/oclc/951272809|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, culture in the [[sociology|sociological]] field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be any of two types, [[non-material culture]] or [[material culture]].&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber and 2010 53" /&gt; Non-material culture refers to the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture, past or present.

Cultural sociology first emerged in [[Weimar Germany]] (1918–1933), where sociologists such as [[Alfred Weber]] used the term ''Kultursoziologie'' (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then "reinvented" in the English-speaking world as a product of the "[[cultural turn]]" of the 1960s, which ushered in [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] and [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may be loosely regarded as an approach incorporating [[cultural analysis]] and [[critical theory]]. Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods, instead [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] focusing on words, artifacts and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|date=June 5, 1996|website=Lingua Franca|access-date=October 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326152500/http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|archive-date=March 26, 2007|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}} Physicist [[Alan Sokal]] published a paper in a journal of cultural sociology stating that gravity was a social construct that should be examined hermeneutically. See [[Sokal affair]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt; "Culture" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like [[social stratification]] and [[social network|social network analysis]]. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of [[social psychology]] and [[cognitive science]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Is any research confirms this claim/trend? Otherwise, can this claim be backed up by any major work about this new vein with many substantive contributors (handbook, encyclopedia, periodic dedicated to this new vein, etc.)? In addition, it would be highly beneficial if anyone knowledgeable about this new vein should write at least an additional (even small) section on the psychological / cognitive perspective on culture.|date=July 2018}}

===Early researchers and development of cultural sociology===
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Karl Marx: His Life and Environment|last=Berlin|first=Isaiah|last2=Ryan|first2=Alan|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195103267|oclc=611127754|location=New York|language=English|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]) with the growing discipline of [[anthropology]], wherein researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field lingers in the methods (much of cultural sociological research is qualitative), in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities), and in the substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between [[popular culture]], political control, and [[social class]] were early and lasting concerns in the field.

==Cultural studies==
In the [[United Kingdom]], sociologists and other scholars influenced by [[Marxism]] such as [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] (1932–2014) and [[Raymond Williams]] (1921–1988) developed [[cultural studies]]. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified "culture" with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film, [[food]], sports, and clothing). They saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by [[relations of production]], which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Raymond|date=1983|title=Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/keywords-a-vocabulary-of-culture-and-society/oclc/906396817|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=87–93, 236–38|language=English|journal=|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912193349/https://www.worldcat.org/title/keywords-a-vocabulary-of-culture-and-society/oclc/906396817|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/ways-of-seeing/oclc/780459348|title=Ways of seeing|last=Berger|first=John|date=1972|publisher=Peter Smithn|isbn=978-0563122449|oclc=780459348|language=English|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912191748/https://www.worldcat.org/title/ways-of-seeing/oclc/780459348|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of [[popular culture]]; that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods. [[Richard Hoggart]] coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] or CCCS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Studying Culture – Reflections and Assessment: An Interview with Richard Hoggart|journal=Media, Culture, and Society|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/sep/23/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety|title=Cultural hallmark|last=Adams|first=Tim|date=September 23, 2007|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 30, 2016|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031030223/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/sep/23/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety|archive-date=October 31, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who succeeded Hoggart as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stuart Hall|last=James|first=Procter|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415262675|oclc=318376213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as "[[Western culture|Western civilization]]" or "[[globalism]]."

From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Dick Hebdige]], Tony Jefferson, and [[Angela McRobbie]], created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed, it began to combine [[political economy]], [[communication]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[Media influence|media theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], [[museum studies]], and [[art history]] to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Cultural Studies|last=Sardar|first=Ziauddin|last2=Van Loon|first2=Borin|last3=Appignanesi|first3=Richard|date=1994|publisher=Totem Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1840465877|oclc=937991291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies is concerned with the [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]] and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to "fit in" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice.

In the context of cultural studies, the idea of a ''text'' includes not only [[written language]], but also [[film]]s, [[photography|photographs]], [[fashion]] or [[hairstyle]]s: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Myths of Oz: reading Australian popular culture|last=Fiske|first=John|last2=Turner|first2=Graeme|last3=Hodge|first3=Robert Ian Vere|date=1987|publisher=Allen and Unwin|isbn=978-0043303917|oclc=883364628|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of "culture." "Culture" for a cultural-studies researcher not only includes traditional [[high culture]] (the culture of [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://proxy2.hec.ca/login?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/hecm/Doc?id=10439450|title=The dialogic imagination four essays|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail Mikhaĭlovich|last2=Holquist|first2=Michael|date=1981|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|language=English|oclc=872436352|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[popular culture]], but also everyday meanings and practices. The last two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A further and recent approach is [[comparative cultural studies]], based on the disciplines of [[comparative literature]] and cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|title=Comparative Cultural Studies|date=2015|website=Purdue University Press|language=en|access-date=October 30, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805230001/http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|archive-date=August 5, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] developed somewhat different versions of cultural studies after the late 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly under the influence of Richard Hoggart, [[E.P. Thompson]], and [[Raymond Williams]], and later that of Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the [[University of Birmingham]]. This included overtly political, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] views, and criticisms of [[popular culture]] as "capitalist" [[mass culture]]; it absorbed some of the ideas of the [[Frankfurt School]] critique of the "[[culture industry]]" (i.e. mass culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and [[Paul Gilroy]].

In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, "Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Qualitative Communication Research Methods|last=Lindlof|first=Thomas R|last2=Taylor|first2=Bryan C|date=2002|publisher=Sage|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0761924937|oclc=780825710|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, [[mass culture]]; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of [[fandom]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a [[Marxist]] model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the [[Frankfurt School]], but especially from the [[structuralism|structuralist]] Marxism of [[Louis Althusser]] and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the ''production'' of [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]]. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies [[power (social and political)|power]] as residing with those producing [[cultural artifact]]s. In a Marxist view, those who control the [[means of production]] (the economic ''base'') essentially control a culture.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Other approaches to cultural studies, such as [[feminist]] cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book ''Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman'' (by Paul du Gay ''et al.''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gX-kksNNdFIC|title=Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman|editor1-last=du Gay|editor1-first=Paul|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0761954026|oclc=949857570|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist, and art historian [[Griselda Pollock]] contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of [[art history]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. The writer [[Julia Kristeva]] is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical [[French feminism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Petrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into two main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrakis|first=Panagiotis|last2=Kostis|first2=Pantelis|date=2013-12-01|title=Economic growth and cultural change|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|volume=47|pages=147–57|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2013.02.011|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117193727/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218|archive-date=January 17, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The first group covers the variables that represent the "efficiency orientation" of the societies: performance orientation, [[future orientation]], assertiveness, power distance and uncertainty avoidance.
# The second covers the variables that represent the "social orientation" of societies, i.e., the attitudes and lifestyles of their members. These variables include gender egalitarianism, institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism and human orientation.
In 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by [[Rein Raud]],&lt;ref name="meaning-in-action"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Rein|first=Raud|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1509511242|oclc=944339574|date = 2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; who defines culture as the sum of resources available to human beings for making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach, combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and cultural practices (all repeatable actions that involve the production, dissemination or transmission of meanings), thus making it possible to re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the tradition of textual theory.
