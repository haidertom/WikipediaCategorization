The functions studied are often, but not always, Boolean-valued, making them [[Boolean function]]s. The area has found many applications in [[combinatorics]], [[social choice theory]], [[random graph]]s, and theoretical computer science, especially in [[hardness of approximation]], [[property testing]] and [[probably approximately correct learning|PAC learning]].

==Basic concepts==

We will mostly consider functions defined on the domain &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes it is more convenient to work with the domain &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; instead. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, then the corresponding function defined on &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;f_{01}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = f((-1)^{x_1},\ldots,(-1)^{x_n}).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for us a Boolean function is a &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt;-valued function, though often it is more convenient to consider &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;-valued functions instead.

===Fourier expansion===

Every real-valued function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; has a unique expansion as a multilinear polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S(x), \quad \chi_S(x) = \prod_{i \in S} x_i. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Hadamard transform]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[Fourier transform]] in the [[group (mathematics)|group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2^n&lt;/math&gt;. The coefficients &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S)&lt;/math&gt; are known as ''Fourier coefficients'', and the entire sum is known as the ''Fourier expansion'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The functions &lt;math&gt;\chi_S&lt;/math&gt; are known as ''Fourier characters'', and they form an orthonormal basis for the space of all functions over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to the inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle f,g \rangle = 2^{-n} \sum_{x \in \{-1,1\}^n} f(x) g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The Fourier coefficients can be calculated using an inner product:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{f}(S) = \langle f, \chi_S \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, this shows that &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(\emptyset) = \mathbb{E}[f].&lt;/math&gt; Parseval's identity states that

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|^2 = \mathbb{E}[f^2] = \sum_S \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

If we skip &lt;math&gt;S = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, then we get the variance of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{V}[f] = \sum_{S \neq \emptyset} \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Fourier degree and Fourier levels ===

The ''degree'' of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for some set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the degree of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is its degree as a multilinear polynomial.

It is convenient to decompose the Fourier expansion into ''levels'': the Fourier coefficient &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S)&lt;/math&gt; is on level &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;'' part of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; f^{=d} = \sum_{|S| = d} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S. &lt;/math&gt;

It is obtained from &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by zeroing out all Fourier coefficients not on level &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

We similarly define &lt;math&gt;f^{&gt;d},f^{&lt;d},f^{\geq d},f^{\leq d}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Influence===

The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th influence of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in two equivalent ways:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \mathbb{E}\left[ \left(\frac{f - f^{\oplus i}}{2} \right)^2 \right] = \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2, \\[5pt]
&amp; f^{\oplus i}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = f(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},-x_i,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f]&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that flipping the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate flips the value of the function:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \Pr[f(x) \neq f^{\oplus i}(x)]. &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; doesn't depend on the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate.

The ''total influence'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all of its influences:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \sum_S |S| \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

The total influence of a Boolean function is also the ''average sensitivity'' of the function. The ''sensitivity'' of a Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at a given point is the number of coordinates &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; such that if we flip the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate, the value of the function changes. The average value of this quantity is exactly the total influence.

The total influence can also be defined using the [[Discrete Laplace operator#Graph Laplacians|discrete Laplacian]] of the [[Hamming graph]], suitably normalized:  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \langle f,Lf \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

===Noise stability===

Given &lt;math&gt;-1 \leq \rho \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, we say that two random vectors &lt;math&gt;x,y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; are ''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated'' if the marginal distributions of &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; are uniform, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[x_iy_i] = \rho&lt;/math&gt;. Concretely, we can generate a pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated random variables by first choosing &lt;math&gt;x,z \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random, and then choosing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; according to one of the following two equivalent rules, applied independently to each coordinate:

:&lt;math&gt; y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \rho, \\ z_i &amp; \text{w.p. } 1-\rho. \end{cases} \quad \text{or} \quad y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \frac{1+\rho}{2}, \\ -x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \frac{1-\rho}{2}. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

We denote this distribution by &lt;math&gt; y \sim N_\rho(x) &lt;/math&gt;.

The ''noise stability'' of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in two equivalent ways:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{x; y \sim N_\rho(x)}[f(x) f(y)] = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \delta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, the ''noise sensitivity'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{NS}_\delta[f] = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{Stab}_{1-2\delta}[f]. &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean, then this is the probability that the value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; changes if we flip each coordinate with probability &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, independently.

===Noise operator===

The ''noise operator'' &lt;math&gt;T_\rho&lt;/math&gt; is an operator taking a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and returning another function &lt;math&gt;T_\rho f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt; (T_\rho f)(x) = \mathbb{E}_{y \sim N_\rho(x)}[f(y)] = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S. &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\rho &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the noise operator can also be defined using a [[continuous-time Markov chain]] in which each bit is flipped independently with rate 1. The operator &lt;math&gt;T_\rho&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to running this Markov chain for &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\log\frac{1}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; steps starting at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and taking the average value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at the final state. This Markov chain is generated by the Laplacian of the Hamming graph, and this relates total influence to the noise operator.

Noise stability can be defined in terms of the noise operator: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] = \langle f, T_\rho f \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

===Hypercontractivity===

For &lt;math&gt;1 \leq q &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Lp space#Lp spaces|&lt;math&gt;L_q&lt;/math&gt;-norm]] of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_q = \sqrt[q]{\mathbb{E}[|f|^q]}. &lt;/math&gt;

We also define &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_\infty = \max_{x \in \{-1,1\}^n} |f(x)|.&lt;/math&gt;

The hypercontractivity theorem states that for any &lt;math&gt;q &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q' = 1/(1-1/q)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \|T_\rho f\|_q \leq \|f\|_2 \quad \text{and} \quad \|T_\rho f\|_2 \leq \|f\|_{q'}. &lt;/math&gt;

Hypercontractivity is closely related to the [[logarithmic Sobolev inequalities]] of [[functional analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diaconis|first1=Persi|last2=Saloff-Coste|first2=Laurent|date=1996|title=Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for finite Markov chains|journal=Ann. Appl. Probab.|volume=6|number=3|pages=695–750|doi=10.1214/aoap/1034968224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar result for &lt;math&gt;q &lt; 2&lt;/math&gt; is known as ''reverse hypercontractivity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mossel|first1=Elchanan|last2=Oleszkiewicz|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Sen|first3=Arnab|date=2013|title=On reverse hypercontractivity|journal=GAFA|volume=23|number=3|pages=1062–1097|doi=10.1007/s00039-013-0229-4|arxiv=1108.1210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''p''-Biased analysis===

In many situations the input to the function is not uniformly distributed over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, but instead has a bias toward &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. In these situations it is customary to consider functions over the domain &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; p &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, the ''p''-biased measure &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_p(x) = p^{\sum_i x_i} (1-p)^{\sum_i (1-x_i)}. &lt;/math&gt;

This measure can be generated by choosing each coordinate independently to be 1 with probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and 0 with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt;.

The classical Fourier characters are no longer orthogonal with respect to this measure. Instead, we use the following characters:

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_S(x) = \left(\sqrt{\frac{p}{1-p}}\right)^{|\{i \in S : x_i = 0\}|} \left(-\sqrt{\frac{1-p}{p}}\right)^{|\{i \in S : x_i = 1\}|}. &lt;/math&gt;

The ''p''-biased Fourier expansion of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the expansion of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of ''p''-biased characters:

:&lt;math&gt; f = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \omega_S. &lt;/math&gt;

We can extend the definitions of influence and the noise operator to the ''p''-biased setting by using their spectral definitions.

====Influence====

The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'s influence is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2 = p(1-p) \mathbb{E}[(f-f^{\oplus i})^2]. &lt;/math&gt;

The total influence is the sum of the individual influences:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{Inf}_i[f].&lt;/math&gt;

====Noise operator====

A pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated random variables can be obtained by choosing &lt;math&gt;x,z \sim \mu_p&lt;/math&gt; independently and &lt;math&gt;y \sim N_\rho(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_\rho&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \rho, \\ z_i &amp; \text{w.p. } 1-\rho. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The noise operator is then given by

:&lt;math&gt; (T_\rho f)(x) = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S) \omega_S(x) = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{y \sim N_\rho(x)} [f(y)]. &lt;/math&gt;

Using this we can define the noise stability and the noise sensitivity, as before.

====Russo–Margulis formula====

The Russo–Margulis formula states that for monotone Boolean functions &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dp} \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{x \sim \mu_p} [f(x)] = \frac{\operatorname{Inf}[f]}{p(1-p)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \Pr[f \neq f^{\oplus i}]. &lt;/math&gt;

Both the influence and the probabilities are taken with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt;, and on the right-hand side we have the average sensitivity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If we think of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a property, then the formula states that as &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; varies, the derivative of the probability that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; occurs at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; equals the average sensitivity at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

The Russo–Margulis formula is key for proving sharp threshold theorems such as [[#Friedgut's sharp threshold theorem|Friedgut's]].

===Gaussian space===

One of the deepest results in the area, the [[#Invariance principle|invariance principle]], connects the distribution of functions on the Boolean cube &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; to their distribution on ''Gaussian space'', which is the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; endowed with the standard &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Gaussian measure]].

Many of the basic concepts of Fourier analysis on the Boolean cube have counterparts in Gaussian space:

* The counterpart of the Fourier expansion in Gaussian space is the Hermite expansion, which is an expansion to an infinite sum (converging in &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;) of multivariate [[Hermite polynomials]].
* The counterpart of total influence or average sensitivity for the indicator function of a set is Gaussian surface area, which is the Minkowski content of the boundary of the set.
* The counterpart of the noise operator is the [[Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process|Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator]] (related to the [[Mehler kernel|Mehler transform]]), given by &lt;math&gt;(U_\rho f)(x) = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{z \sim N(0,1)}[f(\rho x + \sqrt{1-\rho^2}z)]&lt;/math&gt;, or alternatively by &lt;math&gt;(U_\rho f)(x) = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}[f(y)]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; is a pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated standard Gaussians.
* Hypercontractivity holds (with appropriate parameters) in Gaussian space as well.

Gaussian space is more symmetric than the Boolean cube (for example, it is rotation invariant), and supports continuous arguments which may be harder to get through in the discrete setting of the Boolean cube. The invariance principle links the two settings, and allows deducing results on the Boolean cube from results on Gaussian space.

==Basic results==

===Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem===

If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; has degree at most 1, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is either constant, equal to a coordinate, or equal to the negation of a coordinate. In particular, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a ''dictatorship'': a function depending on at most one coordinate.

The Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedgut |first1=Ehud |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |last3=Naor |first3=Assaf |date=2002 |title=Boolean functions whose Fourier transform is concentrated on the first two levels |journal=Adv. Appl. Math. |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=427–437 |doi=10.1016/S0196-8858(02)00024-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the ''FKN theorem'', states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; ''almost'' has degree 1 then it is ''close'' to a dictatorship. Quantitatively, if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|f^{&gt;1}\|^2 &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a dictatorship, that is, &lt;math&gt;\|f - g\|^2 = O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; for some Boolean dictatorship &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\Pr[f \neq g] = O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; for some Boolean dictatorship &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, a Boolean function of degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; depends on at most &lt;math&gt;d2^{d-1}&lt;/math&gt; coordinates, making it a ''junta'' (a function depending on a constant number of coordinates). The Kindler–Safra theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kindler |first=Guy |date=2002 |title=Property testing, PCP, and juntas |chapter=16 |publisher=Tel Aviv University}}&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes the Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem to this setting. It states that if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\|f^{&gt;d}\|^2 &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Boolean function of degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

===Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem===

The Poincaré inequality for the Boolean cube (which follows from formulas appearing above) states that for a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V}[f] \leq \operatorname{Inf}[f] \leq \deg f \cdot \mathbb{V}[f]. &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] \geq \frac{\mathbb{V}[f]}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=The influence of variables on Boolean functions. |last1=Kahn |first1=Jeff |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |last3=Linial |first3=Nati |date=1988 |publisher=IEEE |book-title=Proc. 29th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |pages=68–80 |location=White Plains |conference=SFCS'88 |doi=10.1109/SFCS.1988.2192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the ''KKL theorem'', states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean then &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The bound given by the Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem is tight, and is achieved by the ''Tribes'' function of Ben-Or and Linial:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Collective coin flipping, robust voting schemes and minima of Banzhaf values |last1=Ben-Or |first1=Michael |last2=Linial |first2=Nathan |date=1985 |publisher=IEEE |book-title=Proc. 26th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |pages=408–416 |location=Portland, Oregon |conference=SFCS'85 |doi=10.1109/SFCS.1985.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (x_{1,1} \land \cdots \land x_{1,w}) \lor \cdots \lor (x_{2^w,1} \land \cdots \land x_{2^w,w}). &lt;/math&gt;

The Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem was one of the first results in the area, and was the one introducing hypercontractivity into the context of Boolean functions.

===Friedgut's junta theorem===

If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;-junta (a function depending on at most &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; coordinates) then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] \leq M&lt;/math&gt; according to the Poincaré inequality.

Friedgut's theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedgut |first=Ehud |date=1998 |title=Boolean functions with low average sensitivity depend on few coordinates |journal=Combinatorica |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=474–483 |doi=10.1007/PL00009809}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a converse to this result. It states that for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Boolean junta depending on &lt;math&gt;\exp (\operatorname{Inf}[f]/\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; coordinates.

Combined with the Russo–Margulis lemma, Friedgut's junta theorem implies that for every &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, every monotone function is close to a junta with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mu_q&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;q \approx p&lt;/math&gt;.

===Invariance principle===

The invariance principle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mossel |first1=Elchanan |last2=O'Donnell |first2=Ryan |last3=Oleszkiewicz |first3=Krzysztof |date=2010 |title=Noise stability of functions with low influences: Invariance and optimality |journal=Ann. Math. |volume=171 |issue=1 |pages=295–341 |doi=10.4007/annals.2010.171.295|arxiv=math/0503503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes the [[Berry–Esseen theorem]] to non-linear functions.

The Berry–Esseen theorem states (among else) that if &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_i&lt;/math&gt; and no &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is too large compared to the rest, then the distribution of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is close to a normal distribution with the same mean and variance.

The invariance principle (in a special case) informally states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a multilinear polynomial of bounded degree over &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; and all influences of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are small, then the distribution of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; under the uniform measure over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is close to its distribution in Gaussian space.

More formally, let &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; be a univariate [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz function]], let &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;k=\deg f&lt;/math&gt;, and let
&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \max_i \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{S \neq \emptyset} \hat{f}(S)^2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt; \left| \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \{-1,1\}^n} [\psi(f(x))] - \mathbb{E}_{g \sim N(0,I)} [\psi(f(g))] \right| = O(k9^k \varepsilon). &lt;/math&gt;

By choosing appropriate &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, this implies that the distributions of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; under both measures are close in [[Cumulative distribution function|CDF distance]], which is given by &lt;math&gt;\sup_t |\Pr[f(x)&lt;t] - \Pr[f(g)&lt;t]|&lt;/math&gt;.

The invariance principle was the key ingredient in the original proof of the [[#Majority is Stablest|''Majority is Stablest'' theorem]].

==Some applications==

===Linearity testing===

A Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is ''linear'' if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;f(xy) = f(x)f(y)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;xy = (x_1y_1,\ldots,x_ny_n)&lt;/math&gt;. It is not hard to show that the Boolean linear functions are exactly the characters &lt;math&gt;\chi_S&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[property testing]] we want to test whether a given function is linear. It is natural to try the following test: choose &lt;math&gt;x,y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random, and check that &lt;math&gt;f(xy) = f(x)f(y)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is linear then it always passes the test. Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blum |first1=Manuel |last2=Luby |first2=Michael |last3=Rubinfeld |first3=Ronitt |date=1993 |title=Self-testing/correcting with applications to numerical problems |journal=J. Comput. Syst. Sci. |volume=47 |number=3 |pages=549–595 |doi=10.1016/0022-0000(93)90044-W}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that if the test passes with probability &lt;math&gt;1-\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Fourier character. Their proof was combinatorial.

Bellare et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Bellare |first1=Mihir |last2=Coppersmith |first2=Don |last3=Håstad |first3=Johan |last4=Kiwi |first4=Marcos |last5=Sudan |first5=Madhu |date=1995 |title= Linearity testing in characteristic two |booktitle = Proc. 36th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |conference=FOCS'95}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an extremely simple Fourier-analytic proof, that also shows that if the test succeeds with probability &lt;math&gt;1/2 + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is correlated with a Fourier character. Their proof relies on the following formula for the success probability of the test:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S)^3. &lt;/math&gt;

===Arrow's theorem===

[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that for three and more candidates, the only unanimous voting rule for which there is always a [[Condorcet criterion|Condorcet winner]] is a dictatorship.

The usual proof of Arrow's theorem is combinatorial. Kalai&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalai |first=Gil |date=2002 |title=A Fourier-theoretic perspective on the Condorcet paradox and Arrow's theorem |journal=Adv. Appl. Math. |volume=29 |number=3 |pages=412–426 |doi=10.1016/S0196-8858(02)00023-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an alternative proof of this result in the case of three candidates using Fourier analysis. If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is the rule that assigns a winner among two candidates given their relative orders in the votes, then the probability that there is a Condorcet winner given a uniformly random vote is &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4} \operatorname{Stab}_{-1/3}[f]&lt;/math&gt;, from which the theorem easily follows.

The [[#Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem|FKN theorem]] implies that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a rule for which there is almost always a Condorcet winner, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is close to a dictatorship.

===Sharp thresholds===

A classical result in the theory of [[random graph]]s states that the probability that a &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt; random graph is connected tends to &lt;math&gt;e^{-e^{-c}}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;p \sim \frac{\log n + c}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. This is an example of a ''sharp threshold'': the width of the "threshold window", which is &lt;math&gt;O(1/n)&lt;/math&gt;, is asymptotically smaller than the threshold itself, which is roughly &lt;math&gt;\frac{\log n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, the probability that a &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt; graph contains a triangle tends to &lt;math&gt;e^{-c^3/6}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;p \sim \frac{c}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Here both the threshold window and the threshold itself are &lt;math&gt;\Theta(1/n)&lt;/math&gt;, and so this is a ''coarse threshold''.

Friedgut's sharp threshold theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedgut |first=Ehud |date=1999 |title=Sharp thresholds of graph properties and the k-SAT problem |journal=J. Am. Math. Soc. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=1017–1054 |doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-99-00305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; states, roughly speaking, that a monotone graph property (a graph property is a property which doesn't depend on the names of the vertices) has a sharp threshold unless it is correlated with the appearance of small subgraphs. This theorem has been widely applied to analyze random graphs and [[percolation]].

On a related note, the [[#Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem|KKL theorem]] implies that the width of threshold window is always at most &lt;math&gt;O(1/\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedgut |first1=Ehud |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |date=1996 |title=Every monotone graph property has a sharp threshold |journal= Proc. Am. Math. Soc. |volume=124 |issue=10 |pages=2993–3002 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-96-03732-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority is Stablest===

Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Maj}_n\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; denote the majority function on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; coordinates. Sheppard's formula gives the asymptotic noise stability of majority:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[\operatorname{Maj}_n] \longrightarrow 1 - \frac{2}{\pi} \arccos \rho. &lt;/math&gt;

This is related to the probability that if we choose &lt;math&gt;x \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random and form &lt;math&gt;y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; by flipping each bit of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1-\rho}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, then the majority stays the same:
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[\operatorname{Maj}_n] = 2\Pr[\operatorname{Maj}_n(x) = \operatorname{Maj}_n(y)]-1&lt;/math&gt;.

There are Boolean functions with larger noise stability. For example, a dictatorship &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; has noise stability &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

The Majority is Stablest theorem states, informally, then the only functions having noise stability larger than majority have influential coordinates. Formally, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;\tau &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; has expectation zero and &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] \leq \tau&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] \leq 1 - \frac{2}{\pi} \arccos \rho + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

The first proof of this theorem used the [[#Invariance principle|invariance principle]] in conjunction with an isoperimetric theorem of Borell in Gaussian space; since then more direct proofs were devised.

Majority is Stablest implies that the [[Semidefinite programming#Example 3 .28Goemans-Williamson MAX CUT approximation algorithm.29|Goemans–Williamson approximation algorithm]] for [[Maximum cut|MAX-CUT]] is optimal, assuming the [[unique games conjecture]]. This implication, due to Khot et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''Archives of American Mathematics,''' located at the [[University of Texas at Austin]],  aims to collect, preserve, and provide access to the papers principally of American mathematicians and the records of American mathematical organizations.

==  History  ==

The Archives  began in 1975 at the University of Texas at Austin with the preservation of the papers of Texas mathematicians [[Robert Lee Moore|R.L. Moore]] and [[Harry Vandiver|H.S. Vandiver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corry|first=Leo|date=2007|title=A Clash of Mathematical Titans in Austin: Robert Lee Moore and Harry Schultz Vandiver (1924-1974)|url=|journal=Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=29|pages=62–74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the [[Mathematical Association of America]] established the university as the official repository for its archival records and the name "Archives of American Mathematics" was adopted to encompass all of the mathematical archival collections at the university.&lt;ref&gt;The Minutes of the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, 8–9 June 1978. https://www.utsystem.edu/sites/default/files/offices/board-of-regents/board-meetings/board-minutes/6-78meeting754.pdf pp. 3307-3312, accessed 17 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally a part of the [[Harry Ransom Center]], in 1984, the Archives was added to the special collections of the [[Dolph Briscoe Center for American History|Briscoe Center for American History]] at the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mead|first1=Carol|last2=Lewis|first2=Albert C.|date=September 2017|title=The Archives of American Mathematics|url=http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2017-09-105.pdf|journal=Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society|volume=105|pages=34–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20262">[[Mathematics]] encompasses a growing variety and depth of subjects over [[History of mathematics|history]], and comprehension requires a system to categorize and organize the many subjects into more general '''areas of mathematics'''. A number of different classification schemes have arisen, and though they share some similarities, there are differences due in part to the different purposes they serve. In addition, as mathematics continues to be developed, these classification schemes must change as well to account for newly created areas or newly discovered links between different areas. Classification is made more difficult by some subjects, often the most active, which straddle the boundary between different areas.

A traditional division of mathematics is into [[pure mathematics]], mathematics studied for its intrinsic interest, and [[applied mathematics]], mathematics which can be directly applied to real world problems.&lt;ref&gt;For example the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] groups its mathematics articles as [[wikisource:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Classified List of Articles#Mathematics|Pure, Applied, and Biographies]].&lt;/ref&gt;
This division is not always clear and many subjects have been developed as pure mathematics to find unexpected applications later on. Broad divisions, such as [[discrete mathematics]] and [[computational mathematics]], have emerged more recently.

An ideal system of classification permits adding new areas into the organization of previous knowledge, and fitting surprising discoveries and unexpected interactions into the outline.
For example, the [[Langlands program]] has found unexpected connections between areas previously thought unconnected, at least [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].

==Classification systems==
*The [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC) is produced by the staff of the review databases [[Mathematical Reviews]] and [[Zentralblatt MATH]]. Many mathematics journals ask authors to label their papers with MSC subject codes. The MSC divides mathematics into over 60 areas, with further subdivisions within each area.
*In the [[Library of Congress Classification]], mathematics is assigned the subclass QA within the class Q (Science). The LCC defines [[Library of Congress Classification: Class Q -- Science#QA Mathematics|broad divisions]], and individual subjects are assigned specific numerical values.
*The [[List of Dewey Decimal classes#500 – Science|Dewey Decimal Classification]] assigns mathematics to division 510, with subdivisions for [[Algebra]] &amp; [[number theory]], [[Arithmetic]], [[Topology]], [[Analysis]], [[Geometry]], [[Numerical analysis]], and [[Probabilities]] &amp; [[applied mathematics]].
*The [https://arxiv.org/archive/math Categories within Mathematics] list is used by the [[Arxiv]] for categorizing [[preprints]]. It differs from MSC; for example, it includes things like [[quantum algebra]].
*The [[International Mathematical Union|IMU]] uses its [http://www.mathunion.org/activities/icm/icm-2010-program-structure/ programme structure] for organizing the lectures at its four-yearly [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]]. One of its top-level sections that MSC doesn't have is [[Lie theory]].
*The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] includes a couple of mathematical [http://portal.acm.org/ccs.cfm?part=author&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=GUIDE categories] F. Theory of Computation and G. Mathematics of Computing.
*[[MathOverflow]] has a [http://mathoverflow.net/tags tag system].
*Mathematics book publishers such as [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] ([https://www.springer.com/mathematics?SGWID=0-10042-0-0-0 subdisciplines]), [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge]] ([http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/other_subject/item1521/?site_locale=en_GB Browse Mathematics and statistics]) and the [[American Mathematical Society|AMS]] ([http://www.ams.org/bookstore/textbooks subject area]) use their own subject lists on their websites to enable customers to browse books or filter searches by subdiscipline, including topics such as [[mathematical biology]] and [[mathematical finance]] as top-level headings.
*Schools and other educational bodies have [[syllabus]]es.
*Research institutes and university mathematics departments often have sub-departments or study groups. e.g. [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]] has [http://siam.org/activity/ activity groups] for its members.
*Wikipedia uses a [[:Category: Mathematics]] system on its articles, and also has a [[list of mathematics lists]].

==Major divisions of mathematics==

===Pure mathematics===

====Foundations====
;[[Recreational mathematics]]
: From [[magic square]]s to the [[Mandelbrot set]], numbers have been a source of amusement and delight for millions of people throughout the ages. Many important branches of "serious" mathematics have their roots in what was once a mere puzzle and/or game.
;[[History of mathematics|History]] and [[List of mathematicians|biography]]
: The history of mathematics is inextricably intertwined with the subject itself. This is perfectly natural: mathematics has an internal organic structure, deriving new theorems from those that have come before. As each new generation of mathematicians builds upon the achievements of our ancestors, the subject itself expands and grows new layers, like an onion.
;[[Mathematical logic]] and [[Foundations of mathematics|foundations]], including [[set theory]]
: Mathematicians have always worked with logic and symbols, but for centuries the underlying laws of logic were taken for granted, and never expressed symbolically. '''Mathematical logic''', also known as '''symbolic logic''', was developed when people finally realized that the tools of mathematics can be used to study the structure of logic itself. Areas of research in this field have expanded rapidly, and are usually subdivided into several distinct departments.
:;[[Model theory]]
:: Model theory studies mathematical [[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] in a general framework. Its main tool is [[first-order logic]].
:;[[Set theory]]
:: A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] can be thought of as a collection of distinct things united by some common feature. Set theory is subdivided into three main areas. [[Naive set theory]] is the original set theory developed by mathematicians at the end of the 19th century. [[Axiomatic set theory]] is a rigorous [[axiom]]atic theory developed in response to the discovery of serious flaws (such as [[Russell's paradox]]) in naive set theory.  It treats sets as "whatever satisfies the axioms", and the notion of collections of things serves only as motivation for the axioms. [[Internal set theory]] is an axiomatic extension of set theory that supports a [[logically consistent]] identification of ''illimited'' (enormously large) and ''infinitesimal'' (unimaginably small) elements within the [[real number]]s. See also [[List of set theory topics]].
:;[[Proof theory]] and [[constructive mathematics]]
:: '''Proof theory''' grew out of [[David Hilbert]]'s ambitious program to formalize all the proofs in mathematics. The most famous result in the field is encapsulated in [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. A closely related and now quite popular concept is the idea of [[Turing machines]]. '''Constructivism''' is the outgrowth of [[L.E.J. Brouwer|Brouwer]]'s unorthodox view of the nature of logic itself; constructively speaking, mathematicians cannot assert "Either a circle is round, or it is not" until they have actually exhibited a circle and measured its roundness.

====Arithmetic====
[[Arithmetic]] is the study of numbers and the properties of operations between them.

====Algebra====
The study of structure begins with [[number]]s, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s and their [[arithmetic]]al operations, which are recorded in [[elementary algebra]]. The deeper properties of these numbers are studied in [[number theory]]. The investigation of methods to solve equations leads to the field of [[abstract algebra]], which, among other things, studies [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, structures that generalize the properties possessed by everyday numbers. Long standing questions about [[compass and straightedge]] construction were finally settled by [[Galois theory]]. The physically important concept of [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s, generalized to [[vector space]]s, is studied in [[linear algebra]].

; [[Order theory]]
: For any two distinct  real numbers, one must be greater than the other. Order Theory extends this idea to sets in general. It includes notions like [[lattice (order)|lattices]] and ordered [[algebraic structure]]s. See also the [[order theory glossary]] and the [[list of order topics]].
; General [[algebraic system]]s
: Given a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], different ways of combining or relating members of that set can be defined. If these obey certain rules, then a particular algebraic structure is formed. [[Universal algebra]] is the more formal study of these structures and systems.
; [[Number theory]]
: Number theory is traditionally concerned with the properties of integers. More recently, it has come to be concerned with wider classes of problems that have arisen naturally from the study of integers. It can be divided into elementary number theory (where the integers are studied without the aid of techniques from other mathematical fields); [[analytic number theory]] (where [[calculus]] and [[complex analysis]] are used as tools); [[algebraic number theory]] (which studies the algebraic numbers  - the roots of [[polynomial]]s with integer [[coefficient]]s); [[geometric number theory]]; [[combinatorial number theory]]; [[transcendental number theory]]; and [[computational number theory]]. See also the [[list of number theory topics]].
; [[Field theory (mathematics)|Field theory]] and polynomials
: Field theory studies the properties of [[Field (mathematics)|fields]]. A field is a mathematical entity for which addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are [[well-defined]].  A polynomial is an expression in which constants and variables are combined using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
; [[Commutative ring]]s and [[commutative algebra|algebras]]
: In [[ring theory]], a branch of abstract algebra, a commutative ring is a ring in which the multiplication operation obeys the [[commutative operation|commutative law]]. This means that if a and b are any elements of the ring, then a×b=b×a.  Commutative algebra is the field of study of commutative rings and their ideals, modules and algebras.  It is foundational both for [[algebraic geometry]] and for algebraic number theory. The most prominent examples of commutative rings are [[polynomial ring|rings of polynomials]].

====Analysis==== 
Within the world of mathematics, '''[[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]''' is the branch that focuses on change: [[Derivative|rates of change]], [[Integral|accumulated change]], and multiple things changing relative to (or independently of) one another.

Modern analysis is a vast and rapidly expanding branch of mathematics that touches almost every other subdivision of the discipline, finding direct and indirect applications in topics as diverse as [[number theory]], [[cryptography]], and [[abstract algebra]]. It is also the language of science itself and is used across [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[physics]], from [[astrophysics]] to [[X-ray crystallography]].

====Combinatorics====
[[Combinatorics]] is the study of finite or discrete collections of objects that satisfy specified criteria. In particular, it is concerned with "counting" the objects in those collections ([[enumerative combinatorics]]) and with deciding whether certain "optimal" objects exist ([[extremal combinatorics]]). It includes [[graph theory]], used to describe inter-connected objects (a graph in this sense is a network, or collection of connected points). See also the [[list of combinatorics topics]], [[list of graph theory topics]] and [[glossary of graph theory]].  A ''combinatorial flavour'' is present in many parts of [[problem-solving]].

====Geometry and topology====
[[Geometry]] deals with spatial relationships, using fundamental qualities or [[axiom]]s. Such axioms can be used in conjunction with mathematical definitions for points, straight lines, curves, surfaces, and solids to draw logical conclusions.  See also [[List of geometry topics]]

;[[Convex geometry]] and [[discrete geometry]]
: Includes the study of objects such as [[polytopes]] and [[polyhedra]]. See also [[List of convexity topics]]
;Discrete or [[combinatorial geometry]]
: The study of geometrical objects and properties that are [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] or [[combinatorial]], either by their nature or by their representation. It includes the study of shapes such as the [[Platonic solids]] and the notion of [[tessellation]].
;[[Differential geometry]]
: The study of geometry using calculus. It is very closely related to [[differential topology]]. Covers such areas as [[Riemannian geometry]], [[curvature]] and [[differential geometry of curves]]. See also the [[glossary of differential geometry and topology]].
;[[Algebraic geometry]]
: Given a [[polynomial]] of two real [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], then the points on a plane where that function is zero will form a curve. An [[algebraic curve]] extends this notion to polynomials over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] in a given number of variables. Algebraic geometry may be viewed as the study of these curves. See also the [[list of algebraic geometry topics]] and [[list of algebraic surfaces]].
;[[Topology]]
: Deals with the properties of a figure that do not change when the figure is continuously deformed. The main areas are point set topology (or [[general topology]]), [[algebraic topology]], and the topology of [[manifold]]s, defined below.
:;[[General topology]]
:: Also called ''point set topology''. Properties of [[topological space]]s. Includes such notions as [[open set|open]] and [[closed set|closed]] [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[compact space]]s, [[continuous function]]s, [[limit of a sequence|convergence]], [[separation axiom]]s, [[metric space]]s, [[dimension theory]].  See also the [[glossary of general topology]] and the [[list of general topology topics]].
:;[[Algebraic topology]]
:: Properties of algebraic objects associated with a topological space and how these algebraic objects capture properties of such spaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16072">'''Data-driven control systems''' are a broad family of [[Control theory|control systems]], in which the [[System identification|identification]] of the process model and/or the design of the controller are based entirely on ''experimental data'' collected from the plant &lt;ref&gt;Bazanella, A.S., Campestrini, L., Eckhard, D. (2012). Data-driven controller design: the &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; approach. Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-007-2300-9}}, 208 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In many control applications, trying to write a mathematical model of the plant is considered a hard task, requiring efforts and time to the process and control engineers. This problem is overcome by ''data-driven'' methods, which allow to fit a system model to the experimental data collected, choosing it in a specific models class. The control engineer can then exploit this model to design a proper controller for the system. However, it is still difficult to find a simple yet reliable model for a physical system, that includes only those dynamics of the system that are of interest for the control specifications. The ''direct'' data-driven methods allow to tune a controller, belonging to a given class, without the need of an identified model of the system. In this way, one can also simply weight process dynamics of interest inside the control cost function, and exclude those dynamics that are out of interest.

== Overview ==

The ''standard'' approach to control systems design is organized in two-steps: 
# Model identification aims at estimating a nominal model of the system &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} = G\left(q; \widehat{\theta}_N\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the unit-delay operator (for discrete-time transfer functions representation) and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\theta}_N&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of parameters of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; identified on a set of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; data. Then, validation consists in constructing the ''uncertainty set'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; that contains the true system &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; at a certain probability level.
# Controller design aims at finding a controller &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; achieving closed-loop stability and meeting the required performance with &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Typical objectives of [[System Identification|system identification]] are to have &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; as close as possible to &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;, and to have &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; as small as possible. However, from an [[System identification#Identification for control|identification for control]] perspective, what really matters is the performance achieved by the controller, not the intrinsic quality of the model.

One way to deal with uncertainty is to design a controller that has an acceptable performance with all models in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, including &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;. This is the main idea behind [[robust control]] design procedure, that aims at building frequency domain uncertainty descriptions of the process. However, being based on worst-case assumptions rather than on the idea of averaging out the noise, this approach typically leads to ''conservative'' uncertainty sets. Rather, data-driven techniques deal with uncertainty by working on experimental data, and avoiding excessive conservativism.

In the following, the main classifications of data-driven control systems are presented.

=== Indirect and direct methods ===

The fundamental distinction is between '''indirect''' and '''direct''' controller design methods. The former group of techniques is still retaining the standard two-step approach, ''i.e.'' first a model is identified, then a controller is tuned based on such model. The main issue in doing so is that the controller is computed from the estimated model &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; (according to the [[Stochastic control#Certainty equivalence|certainty equivalence]] principle), but in practice &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} \neq G_0&lt;/math&gt;. To overcome this problem, the idea behind the latter group of techniques is to map the experimental data ''directly'' onto the controller, without any model to be identified in between.

=== Iterative and noniterative methods ===

Another important distinction is between '''iterative''' and '''noniterative''' (or '''one-shot''') methods. In the former group, repeated iterations are needed to estimate the controller parameters, during which the [[Optimization_problem|optimization problem]] is performed based on the results of the previous iteration, and the estimation is expected to become more and more accurate at each iteration. This approach is also prone to on-line implementations (see below). In the latter group, the (optimal) controller parametrization is provided with a single optimization problem. This is particularly important for those systems in which iterations or repetitions of data collection experiments are limited or even not allowed (for example, due to economic aspects). In such cases, one should select a design technique capable of delivering a controller on a single data set. This approach is often implemented off-line (see below).

=== On-line and off-line methods ===

Since, on practical industrial applications, open-loop or closed-loop data are often available continuously, '''on-line''' data-driven techniques use those data to improve the quality of the identified model and/or the performance of the controller each time new information is collected on the plant. Instead, '''off-line''' approaches work on batch of data, which may be collected only once, or multiple times at a regular (but rather long) interval of time.

== Iterative feedback tuning ==

The iterative feedback tuning (IFT) method was introduced in 1994 &lt;ref&gt;Hjalmarsson, H., Gevers, M., Gunnarsson, S., &amp; Lequin, O. (1998). Iterative feedback tuning: theory and applications. IEEE control systems, 18(4), 26–41.&lt;/ref&gt;, starting from the observation that, in identification for control, each iteration is based on the (wrong) certainty equivalence principle.

IFT is a model-free technique for the direct iterative optimization of the parameters of a fixed-order controller; such parameters can be successively updated using information coming from standard (closed-loop) system operation.

Let &lt;math&gt;y^d&lt;/math&gt; be a desired output to the reference signal &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; the error between the achieved and desired response is &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}(\rho)=y(\rho)-y^d&lt;/math&gt;. The control design objective can be formulated as the minimization of the objective function:

:&lt;math&gt; J(\rho) = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{t=1}^N E\left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)^2\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Given the objective function to minimize, the ''quasi-Newton method'' can be applied, i.e. a gradient-based minimization using a gradient search of the type:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_{i+1} = \rho_i - \gamma_i R_i^{-1}  \frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}(\rho_i). &lt;/math&gt;

The value &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the step size, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate positive definite matrix and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is an approximation of the gradient; the true value of the gradient is given by the following:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dJ}{d\rho} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained through the following three-step methodology:

# Normal Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as reference; collect N measurements of the output &lt;math&gt;y(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(1)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Gradient Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and 0 as reference &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; inject the signal &lt;math&gt;r-y^{(1)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt; such that it is summed to the control variable output by &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, going as input into the plant. Collect the output, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(2)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Take the following as gradient approximation: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho) = \frac{\delta C}{\delta \rho} (\rho) y^{(2)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

A crucial factor for the convergence speed of the algorithm is the choice of &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;; when &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt; is small, a good choice is the approximation given by the Gauss–Newton direction:

: &lt;math&gt; R_i = \frac 1 N \sum_{t=1}^N \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i) \frac{\delta \widehat{y}^T}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i).&lt;/math&gt;

== Noniterative correlation-based tuning ==

Noniterative correlation-based tuning (nCbT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller&lt;ref&gt;van Heusden, K., Karimi, A. and Bonvin, D. (2011), Data-driven model reference control with asymptotically guaranteed stability. Int. J. Adapt. Control Signal Process., 25: 331–351. doi:10.1002/acs.1212&lt;/ref&gt;. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denotes an unknown LTI stable SISO plant, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined reference model and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined weighting function. An LTI fixed-order controller is indicated as &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)=\beta^T \rho&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \rho \in \mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of LTI basis functions. Finally, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal LTI controller of any structure, guaranteeing a closed-loop function &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; when applied to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The goal is to minimize the following objective function:

: &lt;math&gt;J(\rho)=\left\| F \bigg( \frac{ K^* G-K(\rho)G }{ (1+K^* G)^2 } \bigg) \right\|_2^2. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;J(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is a convex approximation of the objective function obtained from a model reference problem, supposing that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ (1+K(\rho)G) } \approx \frac{1}{ (1+K^*G) }&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is stable and minimum-phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the scheme in figure.

[[File:Noniterative Correlation-based Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The idea is that, when ''G'' is stable and minimum phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The input signal &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; is supposed to be a persistently exciting input signal and &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be generated by a stable data-generation mechanism. The two signals are thus uncorrelated in an open-loop experiment; hence, the ideal error &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The control objective thus consists in finding &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; are uncorrelated.

The vector of ''instrumental variables'' &lt;math&gt;\zeta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \zeta(t)=[r_W (t+\ell_1 ),r_W (t+\ell_1-1),\ldots,r_W (t),\ldots,r_W (t-\ell_1) ]^T &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; is large enough and &lt;math&gt;r_W (t)=Wr(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate filter.

The correlation function is:

: &lt;math&gt;f_{N,\ell_1} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \zeta(t) \varepsilon(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

and the optimization problem becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho} = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} f_{N,\ell_1}^T f_{N,\ell_1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting with &lt;math&gt;\phi_r (\omega)&lt;/math&gt; the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;, it can be demonstrated that, under some assumptions, if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is selected as:

:&lt;math&gt;W(e^{-j\omega}) = \frac{F(e^{-j\omega})(1-M(e^{-j\omega}))}{\phi_r (\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;

then, the following holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N,\ell_1 \to \infty, \ell_1/N \to \infty} \widehat{\rho} = \rho^*.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stability constraint ===

There is no guarantee that the controller &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes &lt;math&gt;J_{N,\ell_1}&lt;/math&gt; is stable. Instability may occur in the following cases:

* If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is non-minimum phase, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; may lead to cancellations in the right-half complex plane.
* If &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; (even if stabilizing) is not achievable, &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be stabilizing.
* Due to measurement noise, even if &lt;math&gt;K^*=K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stabilizing, data-estimated &lt;math&gt;\widehat{K}(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be so.

Consider a stabilizing controller &lt;math&gt;K_s&lt;/math&gt; and the closed loop transfer function &lt;math&gt;M_s=\frac{K_s G}{1+K_s G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Define:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) := M_s - K(\rho) G (1-M_s) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta(\rho) := \left\| \Delta(\rho) \right\|_\infty. &lt;/math&gt;

:'''Theorem''' 
:''The controller &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes the plant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if

# &lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) &lt;/math&gt; is stable
# &lt;math&gt;\exist \delta_N \in (0,1) &lt;/math&gt; s.t. &lt;math&gt; \delta (\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;''

Condition 1. is enforced when:

* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stable
* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; contains an integrator (it is canceled).

The model reference design with stability constraint becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_s = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J(\rho) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \text{s.t. } \delta(\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;

A '''convex data-driven estimation''' of &lt;math&gt;\delta(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained through the [[discrete Fourier transform]]. 

Define the following:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \widehat{R}_r (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) r(t) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2 \\[4pt]
&amp; \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) \varepsilon(t,\rho) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For '''stable minimum phase plants''', the following '''convex data-driven oprimization problem''' is given:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\widehat{\rho} &amp; = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) \\[3pt]
&amp; \text{s.t.} \\[3pt]
&amp; \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \leq \delta_N \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_r (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \\[4pt]
\omega_k &amp; = \frac{2 \pi k}{2\ell_2+1}, \qquad k=0,\ldots,\ell_2+1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Virtual reference feedback tuning ==

Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

VRFT was first proposed &lt;ref&gt;Guardabassi, Guido O., and Sergio M. Savaresi. "Approximate feedback linearization of discrete-time non-linear systems using virtual input direct design." Systems &amp; Control Letters 32.2 (1997): 63–74.&lt;/ref&gt; as &lt;math&gt;VRD^2&lt;/math&gt; and then fixed and extended  for LTI &lt;ref&gt;Campi, Marco C., Andrea Lecchini, and Sergio M. Savaresi. "Virtual reference feedback tuning: a direct method for the design of feedback controllers." Automatica 38.8 (2002): 1337–1346.&lt;/ref&gt; and LPV &lt;ref&gt;Formentin, S., Piga, D., Tóth, R., &amp; Savaresi, S. M. (2016). Direct learning of LPV controllers from data. Automatica, 65, 98–110.&lt;/ref&gt; systems.

The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)&lt;/math&gt; from the measured output signal &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model M and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference from the measured output signal y.]]

The virtual signals are &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)=M^{-1} y(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; e_v (t)=r_v (t) - y(t). &lt;/math&gt;

The optimal controller is obtained from noiseless data by solving the following optimization problem:

: &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho}_\infty = \underset{\rho}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \lim_{N \to \infty} J_{vr} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

where the optimization function is given as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; J_{vr}^N (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left(u(t)-K(\rho) e_v(t) \right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

{{term|[[Chain rule]]}}
{{defn|The '''chain rule''' is a [[formula]] for computing the [[derivative]] of the [[Function composition|composition]] of two or more [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. That is, if ''f'' and ''g'' are functions, then the chain rule expresses the derivative of their composition {{math|''f'' {{large|∘}} ''g''}} (the function which maps ''x'' to ''f''(''g''(''x'')) ) in terms of the derivatives of ''f'' and ''g'' and the [[pointwise product|product of functions]] as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)'=(f'\circ g)\cdot g'.&lt;/math&gt;

This may equivalently be expressed in terms of the variable. Let {{math|1=''F'' = ''f'' {{large|∘}} ''g''}}, or equivalently, {{math|1=''F''(''x'') = ''f''(''g''(''x''))}} for all ''x''. Then one can also write
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f'(g(x)) g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The chain rule may be written in [[Leibniz's notation]] in the following way. If a variable ''z'' depends on the variable ''y'', which itself depends on the variable ''x'', so that ''y'' and ''z'' are therefore [[dependent variable]]s, then ''z'', via the intermediate variable of ''y'', depends on ''x'' as well.  The chain rule then states,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{dy} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}. &lt;/math&gt;

The two versions of the chain rule are related; if &lt;math&gt;z=f(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dx}=\frac{dz}{dy}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(y)g'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

In mathematics, '''Legendre moments''' are a type of [[image moment]] and are achieved by using the [[Legendre polynomial]].  Legendre moments are used in areas of image processing including: pattern and object recognition, image indexing, line fitting, feature extraction, edge detection, and texture analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Lakshmi Deepika, C. et al. "Palmprint authentication using modified legendre moments", Procedia Computer Science, 2010, Vol.2, pp.&amp;nbsp;164–172&lt;/ref&gt;  Legendre moments have been studied as a means to reduce image moment calculation complexity by limiting the amount of information redundancy through approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Huazhong Shu, et al. "An Efficient Method for Computation
of Legendre Moments", Academic Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legendre moments&lt;ref&gt;Pew-Thian Yap. "An Efficient Method for the Computation of Legendre Moments", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence ( Volume: 27, Issue: 12, Dec. 2005 ) &lt;/ref&gt; ==
With order of ''m'' + ''n'', and object intensity function ''f''(''x'',''y''):
 
:&lt;math&gt; L_{pq}=\frac{(2m+1)(2n+1)} 4 \int\limits_{-1}^1 \int\limits_{-1}^1 P_m(x) P_n(y)f(x,y) \,dx\, dy&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'',''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ...{{math|∞|size=150%}} with the ''n''th-order Legendre polynomials being:

:&lt;math&gt;P_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n a_{k,n}x^k=\frac{(-1)^n}{2^n n!} \left( \frac{d}{dx} \right) [(1-x^2)^n] &lt;/math&gt;

which can also be written:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_n(x) &amp; =\sum_{k=0}^{D(n)}(-1)^k \frac{(2n-2k)!}{2^n k!(n-k)!(n-2k)!} x^{n-2k} \\[5pt]
&amp;  = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n(n!)^2}x^n-\frac{(2n-2)!}{2^n 1!(n-1)!(n-2)!} x^{n-2} + \cdots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''(''n'') = floor(''n''/2). The set of Legendre polynomials {''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')} form an orthogonal set on the interval [−1,1]: 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 P_n(x)P_m(x) \, dx = \frac{2}{2n+1}\delta_{nm}&lt;/math&gt;

A [[recurrence relation]] can be used to compute the Legendre polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt;(n+1)P_{n+1}(x)-(2n+1)xP_n(x)+nP_{n-1}(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;

''f''(''x'',''y'') can be written as an infinite series expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials  [−1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x'',''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1.]:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty \sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda_{mn}P_m(x)P_n(y)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- In [[algebra]], a locally nilpotent derivation of a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is a special kind of a [[Derivation (differential algebra)|derivation]] of a ring.--&gt;

One motivation for the study of locally nilpotent derivations comes from the fact that some of the counterexamples to [[Hilbert's 14th problem]] are obtained as the kernels of a derivation on a polynomial ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Daigle |first=Daniel |title=Hilbert's Fourteenth Problem and Locally Nilpotent Derivations |url=http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~ddaigle/articles/H14survey.pdf |website=[[University of Ottawa]] |access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of characteristic zero, to give a locally nilpotent derivation on the integral domain &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, finitely generated over the field, is equivalent to giving an action of the [[additive group]] &lt;math&gt;(k,+)&lt;/math&gt; to the affine variety &lt;math&gt;X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Roughly speaking, an affine variety admitting "plenty" of actions of the additive group is considered similar to an affine space.{{vague|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name="AFKKZ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arzhantsev|first1=I.|last2=Flenner|first2=H.|last3=Kaliman|first3=S.|last4=Kutzschebauch|first4=F.|last5=Zaidenberg|first5=M.|title=Flexible varieties and automorphism groups|journal=Duke Math. J.|date=2013|volume=162|issue=4|pages=767–823|doi=10.1215/00127094-2080132|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.5375.pdf|arxiv=1011.5375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- In affine [[algebraic geometry]], locally nilpotent derivations are used to study derivations are used to study &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{C},+)&lt;/math&gt;-actions on affine varieties. Roughly speaking, an affine variety &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be [[Flexible variety|flexible]], and thus similar to an affine space, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; admits plenty of such actions, or equivalently, if its coordinate ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[X]&lt;/math&gt; has a lot of locally nilpotent derivations.--&gt;

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Recall that a [[Derivation (differential algebra)|derivation]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a map &lt;math&gt;\partial\colon\, A\to A &lt;/math&gt; satisfying the [[product rule|Leibniz rule]] &lt;math&gt;\partial (ab)=(\partial a)b+a(\partial b)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;a,b\in A &lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] over a field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, we additionally require &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-linear, so &lt;math&gt;k\subseteq \ker \partial&lt;/math&gt;.

A derivation &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''locally nilpotent derivation'' (LND) if for every &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a positive integer  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\partial^{n}(a)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[Graded ring|graded]], we say that a locally nilpotent derivation &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; is ''homogeneous'' (of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;\deg \partial a=\deg a +d&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of locally nilpotent derivations of a ring &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this set has no obvious structure: it is neither closed under addition (e.g. if  &lt;math&gt;\partial_{1}=y\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\partial_{2}=x\tfrac{\partial}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\partial_{1},\partial_{2}\in \operatorname{LND}(k[x,y])&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;(\partial_{1}+\partial_{2})^{2}(x)=x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\partial_{1}+\partial_{2}\not\in \operatorname{LND}(k[x,y])&lt;/math&gt;) nor under multiplication by elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\in \operatorname{LND}(k[x])&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;x\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\not\in\operatorname{LND}(k[x])&lt;/math&gt;). However, if &lt;math&gt;[\partial_{1},\partial_{2}]=0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\partial_{1},\partial_{2}\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\partial_{1}+\partial_{2}\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Freudenburg" /&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;\partial\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h\in\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;h\partial\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Relation to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-actions ==
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an algebra over a field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of characteristic zero (e.g. &lt;math&gt;k=\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;). Then there is a one-to-one corresponence between the locally nilpotent &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-derviations on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Group-scheme action|actions]] of the additive group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; on the affine variety &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} A&lt;/math&gt;, as follows.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freudenburg|first1=G.|title=Algebraic theory of locally nilpotent derivations|date=2006|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-29521-1|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.10&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} A&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to an &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-algebra homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\rho\colon A\to A[t]&lt;/math&gt;. Any such &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; determines a locally nilpotnent derivation &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; by taking its derivative at zero, namely &lt;math&gt;\partial=\epsilon \circ \tfrac{d}{dt}\circ \rho,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; denotes the evaluation at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;. 
Conversely, any locally nilpotent derivation &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; determines a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\rho\colon A\to A[t]&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt; \rho=\exp (t\partial)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{t^{n}}{n!}\partial^{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that the conjugate actions correspond to conjugate derivations, i.e. if &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in \operatorname{Aut} A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\alpha\circ\partial \circ \alpha^{-1}\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exp(t\cdot \alpha\circ\partial \circ \alpha^{-1})=\alpha \circ \exp(t\partial)\circ \alpha^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

== The kernel algorithm ==
The algebra &lt;math&gt;\ker \partial&lt;/math&gt; consists of the invariants of the corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action. It is algebraically and factorially closed in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg" /&gt; A special case of [[Hilbert's fourteenth problem|Hilbert's 14th problem]] asks whether &lt;math&gt;\ker \partial&lt;/math&gt; is finitely generated, or, if &lt;math&gt;A=k[X]&lt;/math&gt;, whether the [[GIT quotient|quotient]] &lt;math&gt;X/\!/\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; is affine. By [[Zariski's finiteness theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zariski|first1=O.|title=Interprétations algébrico-géométriques du quatorzième problème de Hilbert|journal=Bull. Sci. Math. (2)|date=1954|volume=78|pages=155–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is true if &lt;math&gt;\dim X\leq 3&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, this question is highly nontrivial even for &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb{C}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n\geq 4&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;n\geq 5&lt;/math&gt; the answer, in general, is negative.&lt;ref name="derksen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Derksen|first1=H. G. J.|title=The kernel of a derivation|journal=J. Pure Appl. Algebra|date=1993|volume=84|issue=1|pages=13–16|doi=10.1016/0022-4049(93)90159-Q|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/002240499390159Q/1-s2.0-002240499390159Q-main.pdf?_tid=d1b1181a-a831-11e7-962f-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1507031938_0ee032807aa55bfa8c109ead979e3df1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case &lt;math&gt;n=4&lt;/math&gt; is open.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg" /&gt;

However, in practice it often happens that &lt;math&gt;\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt; is known to be finitely generated: notably, by the Maurer&amp;ndash;Weitzenböck theorem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seshadri|first1=C.S.|title=On a theorem of Weitzenböck in invariant theory|journal=J. Math. Kyoto Univ.|date=1962|volume=1|pages=403–409|doi=10.1215/kjm/1250525012|url=https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.kjm/1250525012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the case for ''linear'' LND's of the polynomial algebra over a field of characteristic zero (by ''linear'' we mean homogeneous of degree zero with respect to the standard grading).

Assume &lt;math&gt;\ker \partial&lt;/math&gt; is finitely generated. If &lt;math&gt;A=k[g_1,\dots, g_n]&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely generated algebra over a field of characteristic zero, then &lt;math&gt;\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt; can be computed using van den Essen's algorithm,&lt;ref name="van den Essen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=van den Essen|first1=A.|title=Polynomial automorphisms and the Jacobian conjecture|date=2000|publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag|location=Basel|isbn=3-7643-6350-9|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-0348-8440-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows. Choose a ''local slice'', i.e. an element &lt;math&gt;r\in \ker \partial^{2}\setminus \ker \partial&lt;/math&gt; and put &lt;math&gt;f=\partial r\in \ker\partial&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\pi_{r}\colon\, A\to (\ker \partial)_{f}&lt;/math&gt; be the ''Dixmier map'' given by &lt;math&gt;\pi_{r}(a)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!}\partial^{n}(a)\frac{r^{n}}{f^{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. Now for every &lt;math&gt;i=1,\dots, n&lt;/math&gt;, chose a minimal integer &lt;math&gt;m_{i}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h_{i}\colon = f^{m_{i}}\pi_{r}(g_{i})\in \ker\partial&lt;/math&gt;, put &lt;math&gt;B_{0}=k[h_{1},\dots, h_{n},f]\subseteq \ker \partial&lt;/math&gt;, and define inductively &lt;math&gt;B_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to be the subring of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt; \{h\in A: fh\in B_{i-1}\}&lt;/math&gt;. By induction, one proves that &lt;math&gt;B_{0}\subset B_{1}\subset \dots \subset\ker \partial &lt;/math&gt; are finitely generated and if &lt;math&gt;B_{i}=B_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;B_{i}=\ker \partial&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;B_{N}=\ker \partial&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. Finding the generators of each &lt;math&gt;B_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and checking whether &lt;math&gt;B_{i}=B_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is a standard computation using [[Gröbner bases]].&lt;ref name="van den Essen" /&gt;

== Slice theorem ==
Assume that &lt;math&gt;\partial\in\operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; admits a ''slice'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;s\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\partial s=1&lt;/math&gt;. The ''slice theorem''&lt;ref name="Freudenburg" /&gt; asserts that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial algebra &lt;math&gt;(\ker\partial) [s]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial=\tfrac{d}{ds}&lt;/math&gt;.

For any local slice &lt;math&gt;r\in\ker\partial \setminus \ker\partial^{2}&lt;/math&gt; we can apply the slice theorem to the [[Localization of a ring|localization]] &lt;math&gt;A_{\partial r}&lt;/math&gt;, and thus obtain that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is ''locally'' a polynomial algebra with a standard derivation. In geometric terms, if a [[geometric quotient]] &lt;math&gt;\pi\colon\,X\to X/\!/\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; is affine (e.g. when &lt;math&gt;\dim X\leq 3&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Zariski's finiteness theorem|Zariski theorem]]), then it has a Zariski-open subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic over &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;U\times \mathbb{A}^{1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; acts by translation on the second factor.

However, in general it is not true that &lt;math&gt;X\to X//\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; is locally trivial. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deveney|first1=J.|last2=Finston|first2=D.|title=A proper &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{5}&lt;/math&gt; which is not locally trivial|journal=Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.|date=1995|volume=123|issue=3|pages=651–655|doi=10.2307/2160782|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1995-123-03/S0002-9939-1995-1273487-0/S0002-9939-1995-1273487-0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; let &lt;math&gt;\partial=u\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}+v\tfrac{\partial}{\partial y}+(1+uy^2)\tfrac{\partial}{\partial z}\in \operatorname{LND}(\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,u,v])&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt; is a coordinate ring of a singular variety, and the fibers of the quotient map over singular points are two-dimensional.

If &lt;math&gt;\dim X=3&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=X\setminus U&lt;/math&gt; is a curve. To describe the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action, it is important to understand the goemetry &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. Assume further that &lt;math&gt;k=\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[Smooth variety|smooth]] and [[contractible]] (in which case &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is smooth and contractible as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaliman|first1=S|last2=Saveliev|first2=N.|title=&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_{+}&lt;/math&gt;-Actions on contractible threefolds|journal=Michigan Math. J.|date=2004|volume=52|issue=3|pages=619–625|doi=10.1307/mmj/1100623416|url=https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.mmj/1100623416|arxiv=math/0209306}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and choose &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; to be minimal (with respect to inclusion). Then [[Shulim Kaliman|Kaliman]] proved&lt;ref name="Kaliman" /&gt; that each irreducible component of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a ''polynomial curve'', i.e. its [[Normalization of an algebraic variety|normalization]] is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{1}&lt;/math&gt;. The curve &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; for the action given by Freudeburg's (2,5)-derivation (see [[#Examples|below]]) is a union of two lines in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; may not be irreducible. However, it is conjectured that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is always [[contractible]].&lt;ref name="Seattle"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaliman|first1=S.|title=Actions of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{*}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_{+}&lt;/math&gt; on affine algebraic varieties|journal=Proc.

== Examples ==
;Example 1
The standard coordinate derivations &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt; of a polynomial algebra &lt;math&gt;k[x_1,\dots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt; are locally nilpotent. The corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_a&lt;/math&gt;-actions are translations: &lt;math&gt;t\cdot x_{i}=x_{i}+t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t\cdot x_{j}=x_{j}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j\neq i&lt;/math&gt;.

Every LND of &lt;math&gt;k[x_1,x_2]&lt;/math&gt; can be conjugated to &lt;math&gt;f(x_1)\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x_2}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;f(x_1)\in k[x_1]&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, for every &lt;math&gt;0\neq \partial \in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; there exist &lt;math&gt;f_{1},f_{2}\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\ker\partial=k[f_{1},f_{2}]&lt;/math&gt; (but, in contrast to the case &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not necessarily a polynomial ring over &lt;math&gt;\ker \partial&lt;/math&gt;).

Moreover,&lt;ref name="Daigle" /&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\deg x_{1},\deg x_{2},\deg x_{3}&lt;/math&gt; are relatively prime, then &lt;math&gt;\deg f,\deg g&lt;/math&gt; are relatively prime as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zurkowski|first1=V.D.|title=Locally finite derivations.|url=http://www.math.ru.nl/~maubach/Research/zurkowski.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freudenburg" /&gt;

;Bonnet's theorem
A quotient morphism &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^{3}\to \mathbb{A}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; of a &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action is [[Surjective function|surjective]]. In other words, for every &lt;math&gt;0\neq \partial \in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, the embedding &lt;math&gt;\ker\partial\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; induces a surjective morphism &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}A\to \operatorname{Spec}\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bonnet"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonnet|first1=P.|title=Surjectivity of quotient maps for algebraic &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{C},+)&lt;/math&gt;-actions and polynomial maps with contractible fibers|journal=Transform.

This is no longer true for &lt;math&gt;n\geqslant 4&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. the image of a quotient map &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^{4}\to\mathbb{A}^{3}&lt;/math&gt; by a &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action &lt;math&gt;t\cdot (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)=(x_1,x_2,x_3-tx_2,x_4+tx_1)&lt;/math&gt; (which corresponds to a LND given by &lt;math&gt;x_1\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x_4}-x_2\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x_3})&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^{3}\setminus \{(x_1,x_2,x_3): x_{1}=x_{2}=0,x_{3}\neq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

;[[Shulim Kaliman|Kaliman]]'s theorem
Every fixed-point free action of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^{3}&lt;/math&gt; is conjugate to a translation. In other words, every &lt;math&gt;\partial \in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; such that the image of &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; generates the unit ideal (or, equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; defines a nowhere vanishing vector field), admits a slice. This results answers one of the conjectures from [[Challenging problems on affine n-space|Kraft's list]].&lt;ref name="Kaliman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaliman|first1=S.|title=Free &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_{+}&lt;/math&gt;-actions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^3&lt;/math&gt; are translations|journal=Invent.

The points &lt;math&gt;(x_1,1,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_1,-1,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; are in the same orbit of the corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_a&lt;/math&gt;-action if and only if &lt;math&gt;x_{1}\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;; hence the (topological) quotient is not even Hausdorff, let alone homeomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

;Principal ideal theorem
Let &lt;math&gt;\partial\in\operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[faithfully flat]] over &lt;math&gt;\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the ideal &lt;math&gt;\ker \partial \cap \operatorname{im}\partial&lt;/math&gt; is [[Principal ideal|principal]] in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="DK" /&gt;

=== Triangular derivations ===
Let &lt;math&gt;f_1,\dots,f_n&lt;/math&gt; be any system of variables of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;; that is, &lt;math&gt;A=k[f_1,\dots, f_n]&lt;/math&gt;. A derivation of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called ''[[triangular derivation|triangular]]'' with respect to this system of variables, if &lt;math&gt;\partial f_1\in k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial f_{i} \in k[f_1,\dots,f_{i-1}]&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;. A derivation is called ''triangulable'' if it is conjugate to a triangular one, or, equivalently, if it is triangular with respect to some system of variables. Every triangular derivation is locally nilpotent. The converse is true for &lt;math&gt;\leq 2&lt;/math&gt; by Rentschler's theorem above, but it is not true for &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;.

;Bass's example
The derivation of &lt;math&gt;k[x_1,x_2,x_3]&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;x_1\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x_2}+2x_2x_1\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x_3}&lt;/math&gt; is not triangulable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bass|first1=H.|title=A non-triangular action of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^{3}&lt;/math&gt;|journal=Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra|date=1984|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.1016/0022-4049(84)90019-7|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/0022404984900197/1-s2.0-0022404984900197-main.pdf?_tid=50771326-a908-11e7-9eac-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1507124063_3fcfbdbda79e843702a5ad0e30700dde}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the fixed-point set of the corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action is a quadric cone &lt;math&gt;x_2x_3=x_2^2&lt;/math&gt;, while by the result of Popov,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Popov|first1=V. L.|title=On actions of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;|journal=Algebraic groups, Utrecht 1986|pages=237–242|doi=10.1007/BFb0079241}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fixed point set of a triangulable &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;Z\times \mathbb{A}^{1}&lt;/math&gt; for some affine variety &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;; and thus cannot have an isolated singularity.

;Freudenburg's theorem
The above necessary geometrical condition was later generalized by Freudenburg.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_tr"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freudenburg|first1=G.|title=Triangulability criteria for additive group actions on affine space|journal=J. Pure Appl. Algebra|date=1995|volume=105|issue=3|pages=267–275|doi=10.1016/0022-4049(96)87756-5|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/0022404996877565/1-s2.0-0022404996877565-main.pdf?_tid=5643c458-a902-11e7-abe3-00000aacb35e&amp;acdnat=1507121496_17a3984fc09fd5f59e4057f25ebb546f}}&lt;/ref&gt; To state his result, we need the following definition:

A [[corank]] of &lt;math&gt;\partial\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal number &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; such that there exists a system of variables &lt;math&gt;f_1,\dots, f_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f_1,\dots, f_j\in\ker\partial&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}\partial&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; minus the corank of &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;.

We have &lt;math&gt;1\leq \operatorname{rank}\partial \leq n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}(\partial)=1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if in some coordinates, &lt;math&gt;\partial=h\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x_{n}}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;h\in k[x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_tr" /&gt;

Theorem: If &lt;math&gt;\partial\in \operatorname{LND}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is triangulable, then any hypersurface contained in the fixed-point set of the corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-action is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;Z\times \mathbb{A}^{\operatorname{rank} \partial}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_tr" /&gt;

In particular, LND's of maximal rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; cannot be triangulable. Such derivations do exist for &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;: the first example is the ''(2,5)-homogeneous derivation'' (see above), and it can be easily generalized to any &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Fr_(2,5)" /&gt;

== Makar-Limanov invariant ==
{{Main|Makar-Limanov invariant}}

The intersection of the kernels of all locally nilpotent derivations of the coordinate ring, or, equivalently, the ring of invariants of all &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;-actions, is called "Makar-Limanov invariant" and is an important algebraic invariant of an affine variety. For example, it is trivial for an affine space; but for the [[Koras–Russell cubic threefold]], which is [[Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{3}&lt;/math&gt;, it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaliman|first1=S.|last2=Makar-Limanov|first2=L.|title=On the Russell-Koras contractible threefolds|journal=J.

Mathematicians seek and use [[patterns]]&lt;ref name=future/&gt;&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt; to formulate new [[conjecture]]s; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by [[mathematical proof]]. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] and [[logic]], mathematics developed from [[counting]], [[calculation]], [[measurement]], and the systematic study of the [[shape]]s and [[motion (physics)|motions]] of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as [[History of Mathematics|written records]] exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

[[Logic|Rigorous arguments]] first appeared in [[Greek mathematics]], most notably in [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. Since the pioneering work of [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1858–1932), [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943), and others [[Foundations of mathematics|on axiomatic systems in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century]], it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing [[truth]] by [[Mathematical rigor|rigorous]] [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from appropriately chosen [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the [[Renaissance]], when mathematical innovations interacting with new [[timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific discoveries]] led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642) said, "The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus du Sautoy]], ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sr3fm A Brief History of Mathematics: 1.

Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, D.

Mathematics is essential in many fields, including [[natural science]], engineering, medicine, finance and the [[social sciences]]. [[Applied mathematics]] has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and [[game theory]]. Mathematicians engage in [[pure mathematics]], or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind. Practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wigner1960 /&gt;

The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstractions]]. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abstract representations of numbers in the animal and human brain |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=21 |issue=8 |date=Aug 1998 |pages=355–61 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01263-6 |pmid=9720604 |ref=harv |last1=Dehaene |first1=Stanislas |last2=Dehaene-Lambertz |first2=Ghislaine |last3=Cohen |first3=Laurent}}&lt;/ref&gt; was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.

As evidenced by [[tally sticks|tallies]] found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to [[counting|count]] physical objects, [[prehistoric]] peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time&amp;nbsp;– days, seasons, years.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Raymond L. Wilder, ''Evolution of Mathematical Concepts; an Elementary Study'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000&amp;nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]], when the [[Babylonia]]ns and Egyptians began using [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1990, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient mathematical texts from [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] are from 2000–1800 BC. Many early texts mention [[Pythagorean triple]]s and so, by inference, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in [[Babylonian mathematics]] that [[elementary arithmetic]] ([[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]]) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system, and used a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system, still in use today for measuring angles and time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 24–27}}

Beginning in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], the [[Ancient Greeks]] began a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right with [[Greek mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heath |first=Thomas Little |url=https://books.google.com/?id=drnY3Vjix3kC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=A History of Greek Mathematics: From Thales to Euclid |location=New York |publisher=Dover Publications |date=1981 |orig-year=originally published 1921 |isbn=978-0-486-24073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 300 BC, [[Euclid]] introduced the [[axiomatic method]] still used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. His textbook ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 119}} The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be [[Archimedes]] (c. 287–212 BC) of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]].{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 120}} He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of [[solids of revolution]] and used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 130}} Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are [[conic sections]] ([[Apollonius of Perga]], 3rd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 145}} [[trigonometry]] ([[Hipparchus of Nicaea]] (2nd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 162}} and the beginnings of algebra ([[Diophantus]], 3rd century AD).{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 180}}

The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and were transmitted to the [[Western world]] via [[Islamic mathematics]]. Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition of [[sine]] and [[cosine]], and an early form of [[infinite series]].

[[File:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A page from al-Khwārizmī's ''Algebra'']]
During the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]], especially during the 9th and 10th&amp;nbsp;centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of [[Islamic mathematics]] was the development of [[algebra]]. Other notable achievements of the Islamic period are advances in [[spherical trigonometry]] and the addition of the [[decimal point]] to the Arabic numeral system. Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarismi]], [[Omar Khayyam]] and [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]]. 

During the [[early modern period]], mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in [[Western Europe]]. The development of [[calculus]] by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics. [[Leonhard Euler]] was the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and discoveries. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who made numerous contributions to fields such as [[algebra]], [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[differential geometry and topology|differential geometry]], [[matrix theory]],[[number theory]], and [[statistics]]. In the early 20th century, [[Kurt Gödel]] transformed mathematics by publishing his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]], which show that any axiomatic system that is consistent will contain unprovable propositions.

Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January&amp;nbsp;2006 issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The number of papers and books included in the ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9&amp;nbsp;million, and more than 75&amp;nbsp;thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical [[theorem]]s and their [[mathematical proof|proofs]]."{{sfn|Sevryuk|2006|pp=101–09}}

===Etymology===
The word ''mathematics'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] μάθημα (''máthēma''), meaning "that which is learnt",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=mathematic |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307093926/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=March 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "what one gets to know", hence also "study" and "science". The word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.&lt;ref&gt;Both senses can be found in Plato. {{LSJ|maqhmatiko/s|μαθηματική|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adjective is {{lang|grc|μαθηματικός}} (''mathēmatikós''), meaning "related to learning" or "studious", which likewise further came to mean "mathematical". In particular, {{lang|grc|μαθηματικὴ τέχνη}} (''mathēmatikḗ tékhnē''), {{lang-la|ars mathematica}}, meant "the mathematical art".

Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in [[Pythagoreanism]] was known as the ''mathēmatikoi'' (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant "teachers" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense.

In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term ''mathematics'' more commonly meant "astrology" (or sometimes "astronomy") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, [[Saint Augustine]]'s warning that Christians should beware of ''mathematici'', meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lion Hunting and Other Mathematical Pursuits: A Collection of Mathematics, Verse, and Stories by the Late Ralph P. Boas, Jr | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Boas, Ralph | authorlink=Ralph P. Boas Jr. | year=1995 | orig-year=1991 | page=257 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-EWj5WtQHgC&amp;pg=PA257 | chapter=What Augustine Didn't Say About Mathematicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form {{lang|fr|les mathématiques}} (and the less commonly used singular derivative {{lang|fr|la mathématique}}), goes back to the Latin neuter plural {{lang|la|mathematica}} ([[Cicero]]), based on the Greek plural {{lang|el|τὰ μαθηματικά}} (''ta mathēmatiká''), used by [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective ''mathematic(al)'' and formed the noun ''mathematics'' anew, after the pattern of ''[[physics]]'' and ''[[metaphysics]]'', which were inherited from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''sub'' "mathematics", "mathematic", "mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the noun ''mathematics'' takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to ''maths'' or, in North America, ''math''.&lt;ref name=maths&gt;[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114982 "maths, ''n.''"] and [http://oed.com/view/Entry/114962 "math, ''n.3''"].

==Definitions of mathematics==
{{main|Definitions of mathematics}}
[[File:Fibonacci.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo Fibonacci]], the Italian mathematician who introduced the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] invented between the 1st and 4th&amp;nbsp;centuries by Indian mathematicians, to the Western World]]
Mathematics has [[definitions of mathematics|no generally accepted definition]].&lt;ref name=Mura/&gt;&lt;ref name=Runge/&gt; [[Aristotle]] defined mathematics as "the science of quantity", and this definition prevailed until the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Philosophy of Mathematics |last=Franklin |first=James |date=2009-07-08 |isbn=9780080930589 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as [[group theory]] and [[projective geometry]], which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.&lt;ref name="Cajori"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Mathematics |publisher=American Mathematical Society (1991 reprint) |author=Cajori, Florian |authorlink=Florian Cajori |year=1893 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGJRjIC9fZgC&amp;pg=PA285 285–86] |isbn=978-0-8218-2102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics, some emphasize its abstractness, some emphasize certain topics within mathematics. Today, no consensus on the definition of mathematics prevails, even among professionals.&lt;ref name="Mura"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Images of Mathematics Held by University Teachers of Mathematical Sciences |author=Mura, Roberta |journal=Educational Studies in Mathematics |date=Dec 1993 |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=375–385 |ref=harv |doi=10.1007/BF01273907 |jstor=3482762}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science.&lt;ref name="Runge"&gt;{{cite book |title=Iris Runge: A Life at the Crossroads of Mathematics, Science, and Industry |publisher=Springer |author1=Tobies, Renate |author2=Helmut Neunzert |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EDm0eQqFUQ4C&amp;pg=PA9 9] |isbn=978-3-0348-0229-1 |quote=[I]t is first necessary to ask what is meant by ''mathematics'' in general. Illustrious scholars have debated this matter until they were blue in the face, and yet no consensus has been reached about whether mathematics is a natural science, a branch of the humanities, or an art form.|title-link=Iris Runge }}&lt;/ref&gt; A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable.&lt;ref name=Mura/&gt; Some just say, "Mathematics is what mathematicians do."&lt;ref name=Mura/&gt;

Three leading types of definition of mathematics are called [[logicist]], [[intuitionist]], and [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]], each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought.&lt;ref name=Snapper&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2689412 |title=The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism, and Formalism |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=September 1979 |first=Ernst |last=Snapper |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=207–16 |id= |jstor=2689412 |ref=harv|bibcode=1975MathM..48...12G }}&lt;/ref&gt; All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.&lt;ref name=Snapper/&gt;

An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was [[Benjamin Peirce]]'s "the science that draws necessary conclusions" (1870).&lt;ref name="Peirce"&gt;{{cite book |title=Linear Associative Algebra |author=Peirce, Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Peirce |year=1882 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=De0GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906135700/https://books.google.com/books?id=De0GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] advanced the philosophical program known as [[logicism]], and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of [[symbolic logic]]. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's "All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic" (1903).&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kj0a_aV2mxIC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=5|title=The Principles of Mathematics|year=1903|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intuitionist]] definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."&lt;ref name=Snapper/&gt; A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct.

[[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalist]] definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. [[Haskell Curry]] defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of Mathematics |publisher=Elsevier |author=Curry, Haskell |authorlink=Haskell Curry |year=1951 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZHrBQgp1bkC 56] |isbn=978-0-444-53368-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[formal system]] is a set of symbols, or ''tokens'', and some ''rules'' telling how the tokens may be combined into ''formulas''. In formal systems, the word ''axiom'' has a special meaning, different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth". In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.

===Mathematics as science===
[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], known as the prince of mathematicians]]
The German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".&lt;ref name="Waltershausen"/&gt; More recently, [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has called mathematics "the Queen of Science&amp;nbsp;... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicolas Bourbaki |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |access-date=26 October 2017 |series=A Brief History of Mathematics |first=Marcus |last=du Sautoy |station=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2010 |time=min. 12:50 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216050402/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |archivedate=December 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original Latin ''Regina Scientiarum'', as well as in German ''Königin der Wissenschaften'', the word corresponding to ''science'' means a "field of knowledge", and this was the original meaning of "science" in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization restricting the meaning of "science" to ''[[natural science]]'' follows the rise of [[Baconian method|Baconian science]], which contrasted "natural science" to [[scholasticism]], the [[Organon|Aristotelean method]] of inquiring from [[first principles]]. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]], or [[physics]]. [[Albert Einstein]] stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."&lt;ref name=certain&gt;Einstein, p. 28. The quote is Einstein's answer to the question: "How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" This question was inspired by [[Eugene Wigner]]'s paper "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally [[falsifiability|falsifiable]], and thus not a science according to the definition of [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists |author1=Shasha, Dennis Elliot |author2=Lazere, Cathy A. |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] convinced many mathematicians{{Who|date=January 2011}} that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that "most mathematical theories are, like those of [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[hypothesis|hypothetico]]-[[deductive]]: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."&lt;ref&gt;Popper 1995, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Other thinkers, notably [[Imre Lakatos]], have applied a version of [[falsificationism]] to mathematics itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos]] (1976), ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hps.elte.hu/~kutrovatz/LakatosEng.pdf |title=Gábor Kutrovátz, "Imre Lakatos's Philosophy of Mathematics" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view is that certain scientific fields (such as [[theoretical physics]]) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the [[deductive reasoning|exploration of the logical consequences]] of assumptions. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ..." in his ''History of Western Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others{{Who|date=August 2009}} feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of ''Science and Mathematics'', indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, [[land measurement]], architecture and later [[astronomy]]; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus |journal=Physics Today |volume=54 |issue=8 |page=48 |author=Meinhard E. Mayer |year=2001 |bibcode=2001PhT....54h..48J |doi=10.1063/1.1404851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact, that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]".&lt;ref name=wigner1960&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |ref=harv |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].

For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant, proofs from "The Book" of God according to [[Paul Erdős]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proofs from ''The Book'' |last1=Aigner |first1=Martin |last2=Ziegler |first2=Günter&amp;nbsp;M. |authorlink2=Günter M. Ziegler |publisher=Springer |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-540-40460-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.

==Notation, language, and rigor==
{{main|Mathematical notation}}
[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]], who created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today]]

Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archivedate=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language."&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c–o–w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after – the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''."&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for "[[if and only if]]" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".

[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "[[theorem]]s", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics&lt;!--This part needs improvement |&gt;&gt;--&gt;. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.&lt;ref&gt;Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 "A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly", (in reference to the Haken–Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic.&lt;ref&gt;"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil." [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|0-486-61630-4}}. p. 1, "Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields of mathematics==
{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}
[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|An [[abacus]], a simple calculating tool used since ancient times]]
Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].

===Foundations and philosophy===
In order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. [[Category theory]], which deals in an abstract way with [[mathematical structure]]s and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Howard Hodgkin &amp; Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer–Hilbert controversy]].

Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].

[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model&amp;nbsp;– the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5Qj76uCbF?url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

===Pure mathematics===
====Quantity====
{{Main|Arithmetic}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.

As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s ("[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s, which are used to represent [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to [[complex number]]s. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of "[[infinity]]". According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.

|-

|}

====Structure====
{{Main|Algebra}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Many mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].

By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

|}

====Space====
{{Main|Geometry}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of space originates with [[geometry]]&amp;nbsp;– in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincaré conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proved only with the help of computers.

====Change====
{{Main|Calculus}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.

===Applied mathematics===
{{Main|Applied mathematics}}
[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.

In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].

====Statistics and other decision sciences====
{{Main|Statistics}}
Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes sense" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];&lt;ref&gt;[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians "make sense of the data" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]&amp;nbsp;– with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.}}

[[Statistical theory]] studies [[statistical decision theory|decision problems]] such as minimizing the [[risk]] ([[expected loss]]) of a statistical action, such as using a [[statistical method|procedure]] in, for example, [[parameter estimation]], [[hypothesis testing]], and [[selection algorithm|selecting the best]]. In these traditional areas of [[mathematical statistics]], a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an [[objective function]], like expected loss or [[cost]], under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.&lt;ref name="RaoOpt"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Arthanari |editor1-first=T.S. |editor2-last=Dodge |editor2-first=Yadolah |editor2-link=Yadolah Dodge |last=Rao |first=C.R. |authorlink=C.R.

====Computational mathematics====
[[Computational mathematics]] proposes and studies methods for solving [[mathematical problem]]s that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. [[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]]. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].

==Mathematical awards==
Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the [[Fields Medal]],{{sfn|Monastyrsky|2001|p=1|ps=: "The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics."}}{{sfn|Riehm|2002|pp=778–82}} established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.

The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.

A famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called "[[Hilbert's problems]]", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a $1&amp;nbsp;million reward.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11770">{{math|}}The '''Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC)''' is an alphanumerical [[classification scheme]] collaboratively produced by staff of, and based on the coverage of, the two major mathematical reviewing databases, [[Mathematical Reviews]] and [[Zentralblatt MATH]]. The MSC is used by many mathematics [[Academic journal|journals]], which ask authors of [[research papers]] and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The current version is MSC2010.

== Structure ==

The MSC is a hierarchical scheme, with three levels of structure. A classification can be two, three or five digits long, depending on how many levels of the classification scheme are used.

The first level is represented by a two digit number, the second by a letter, and the third by another two digit number. For example:

* '''53''' is the classification for [[differential geometry]]
* '''53A''' is the classification for classical differential geometry
* '''53A45''' is the classification for [[Euclidean vector|vector]] and [[tensor]] analysis

=== First level ===
At the top level, 64 mathematical disciplines are labeled with a unique 2 digit number. As well as the typical areas of mathematical research, there are top level categories for "[[History]] and [[Biography]]", "[[Mathematics Education]]", and for the overlap with different sciences. [[Physics]] (i.e. mathematical physics) is particularly well represented in the classification scheme with a number of different categories including:
* [[Fluid mechanics]]
* [[Quantum mechanics]]
* [[Geophysics]]
* [[Optics]] and [[electromagnetic theory]]

All valid MSC classification codes must have at least the first level identifier.

=== Second level ===

The second level codes are a single letter from the Latin alphabet. These represent specific areas covered by the first level discipline. The second level codes vary from discipline to discipline.

For example, for differential geometry, the top-level code is '''53''', and the second-level codes are:
* '''A''' for classical differential geometry
* '''B''' for local differential geometry
* '''C''' for global differential geometry
* '''D''' for symplectic geometry and contact geometry

In addition, the special second level code "-" is used for specific kinds of materials. These codes are of the form:

* '''53-00''' General reference works (handbooks, dictionaries, bibliographies, etc.)
* '''53-01''' Instructional exposition (textbooks, tutorial papers, etc.)
* '''53-02''' Research exposition (monographs, survey articles)
* '''53-03''' Historical (must also be assigned at least one classification number from Section 01)
* '''53-04''' Explicit machine computation and programs (not the theory of computation or programming)
* '''53-06''' Proceedings, conferences, collections, etc.

The second and third level of these codes are always the same - only the first level changes. For example, it is not valid to use '''53-''' as a classification. Either '''53''' on its own or, better yet, a more specific code should be used.

=== Third level ===

Third level codes are the most specific, usually corresponding to a specific kind of mathematical object or a well-known problem or research area.

The third-level code '''99''' exists in every category and means ''none of the above, but in this section''

== Using the scheme ==

The AMS recommends that papers submitted to its journals for publication have one primary classification and one or more optional secondary classifications. A typical MSC subject class line on a research paper looks like

MSC Primary 03C90; Secondary 03-02;

=={{anchor|MOS|AMS Classification|MSC1990|MSC2000|MSC2010}}History==
{{expand section|date=January 2014}}
According to the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) help page about MSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/help/field_help.html#mscp]&lt;/ref&gt; the MSC has been revised a number of times since 1940. Based on a scheme to organize AMS's ''Mathematical Offprint Service'' (MOS scheme), the ''AMS Classification'' was established for the classification of reviews in ''Mathematical Reviews'' in the 1960s. It saw various ad-hoc changes. Despite its shortcomings, [[Zentralblatt für Mathematik]] started to use it as well in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, a jointly revised scheme with more formal rules was agreed upon by Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt für Mathematik under the new name Mathematics Subject Classification. It saw various revisions as ''MSC1990'', ''MSC2000'' and ''MSC2010''.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Wegner. ''Indexierung mathematischer Literatur Die Revision der Mathematics Subject Classification MSC''. Institute of Mathematics, TU Berlin. http://fidmath.de/fileadmin/download/graz_wegner.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Mathematical Reviews and zbMATH started collecting input from the mathematical community on the next revision of MSC, which is due to be released in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://msc2020.org Announcement of the plan to revise the Mathematics Subject Classification]&lt;/ref&gt; The original classification of older items has not been changed. This can sometimes make it difficult to search for older works dealing with particular topics. Changes at the first level involved the subjects with (present) codes 03, 08, 12-20, 28, 37, 51, 58, 74, 90, 91, 92.

== Relation to other classification schemes ==

For physics papers the [[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]] (PACS) is often used. Due to the large overlap between mathematics and physics research it is quite common to see both PACS and MSC codes on research papers, particularly for multidisciplinary journals and repositories such as the [[arXiv]].

The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] (CCS) is a similar hierarchical classification scheme for [[computer science]]. There is some overlap between the AMS and ACM classification schemes, in subjects related to both mathematics and computer science, however the two schemes differ in the details of their organization of those topics.

The classification scheme used on the arXiv is chosen to reflect the papers submitted. As arXiv is multidisciplinary its classification scheme does not fit entirely with the MSC, ACM or PACS classification schemes. It is common to see codes from one or more of these schemes on individual papers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10303">In the [[scale-free network]] theory ([[network theory|mathematical theory of networks]] or [[graph theory]]), a '''mediation-driven attachment (MDA) model''' appears to embody a [[preferential attachment]] rule tacitly rather than explicitly. According to MDA rule, a new node first picks a node from the existing network at random and connect itself not with that but with one of the neighbors also picked at random.

Barabasi and Albert in 1999 noted through their seminal paper &lt;ref&gt;A. -L. Barab\'{a}si and R. Albert, Science '''286''' 509 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; noted that (i) most natural and man-made  networks are not static, rather they grow with time and (ii) new nodes do not connect with an already connected one randomly rather preferentially with respect to their degrees. The later mechanism is called preferential attachment (PA) rule which embodies the rich get richer phenomena in economics. In their first model, known as the [[Barabási–Albert model]], Barabási and Albert (BA model) choose

: &lt;math&gt; \Pi(i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_{j=1} k_j}&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the new node picks a node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from the labelled nodes of the existing network. It directly embodies the rich get richer mechanism.

Recently, Hassan ''et al.'' proposed a mediation-driven attachment model which appears to embody the PA rule but not directly rather in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, Liana Islam and Syed Arefinul Haque, Degree distribution, rank-size distribution, and leadership persistence in mediation-driven attachment networks Physica A 469 23 (2017) https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2016.11.001&lt;/ref&gt; In the MDA model, an incoming node choose an existing node to connect by first picking one of the existing nodes at random which is regarded as mediator. The new node then connect with one of the neighbors of the mediator which is also picked at random. Now the question is: What is the probability &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; that an already existing node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is finally picked to connect it with the new node? Say, the node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has degree &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; and hence it has &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; neighbors. Consider that the neighbors of  &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; are labeled &lt;math&gt;1,2,\ldots ,k_i&lt;/math&gt; which have degrees &lt;math&gt;k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_{k_i}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. One can reach the node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from each of these &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; nodes with probabilities inverse of their respective degrees, and each of the &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; nodes are likely to be picked at random with probability &lt;math&gt;1/N&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the probability &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; of the MDA model is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)= \frac 1 N \left[ \frac 1 {k_1}+ \frac 1 {k_2} + \cdots + \frac 1 {k_{k_i}} \right] =\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{k_i} \frac 1 {k_j}} N.&lt;/math&gt;
It can be re-written as

: &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i) = \frac{k_i}N \cdot \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{k_i} \frac 1 {k_j}}{k_i},&lt;/math&gt;

where the factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{k_i}{\frac{1}{k_j}}}{k_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of the harmonic mean (IHM) of degrees of the &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; neighbors of the node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Extensive numerical simulation suggest that for small &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the IHM value of each node fluctuate so wildly that the mean of the IHM values over the entire network bears no meaning. However, for large &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; (specially &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; approximately greater than 14) the distribution of IHM value of the entire network become left skewed Gaussian type and mean starts to have a meaning which becomes a constant value in the large &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; limit. In this limit one finds that &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)\propto k_i&lt;/math&gt; which is exactly the PA rule. It implies that the higher the links (degree) a node has, the higher its chance of gaining more links since they can be reached in a larger number of ways through mediators which essentially embodies the intuitive idea of rich get richer mechanism. Therefore, the MDA network can be seen to follow the PA rule but in disguise. Moreover, for small &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the MFA is no longer valid rather the attachment probability &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; becomes super-preferential in character.

The idea of MDA rule can be found in the growth process of the [[weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)]]. An existing node (the center of each block of the WPSL is regarded as nodes and the common border between blocks as the links between the corresponding nodes) during the process gain links only if one of its neighbor is picked not itself. It implies that the higher the links (or degree) a node has, the higher its chance of gaining more links since they can be reached in a larger number of ways. It essentially embodies the intuitive idea of PA rule. Therefore, the dual of the WPSL is a network which can be seen to follow preferential attachment rule but in disguise. Indeed, its degree distribution is found to exhibit power-law as underlined by Barabasi and Albert as one of the essential ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, M. Z. Hassan and N. I. Pavel, “Scale-free network topology and multifractality in a  weighted planar stochastic lattice” New Journal of Physics '''12''' 093045 ( 2010) http://doi:10{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.1088/1367-2630/12/9/093045&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, M. Z. Hassan and N. I. Pavel, Scale-free coordination number disorder and multifractal size disorder in weighted planar stochastic lattice, J. Phys: Conf. Ser, '''297''' 012010 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Degree distribution:]] The two factors that the mean of the IHM is meaningful and it is independent of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; 
implies that one can apply the mean-field approximation (MFA). That is, within this approximation one can replace the true IHM value &lt;math&gt;\beta/m&lt;/math&gt; of each node by their mean, where the factor &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; that the number of edges the new nodes come with is introduced for latter convenience. The rate equation to solve then becomes exactly like that of the BA model and hence the network that emerges following MDA rule is also [[scale-free]] in nature. The only difference is that the exponent &lt;math&gt;\gamma={{1}\over{\beta(m)}}+1&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; where as in the BA model &lt;math&gt;\gamma=3&lt;/math&gt; independent of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Deg dist gm-page-0.jpg|thumb|Plots of degree distribution for the MDA model. The distinct plots are for incoming nodes coming edges ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15 and ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;100. In the inset we show the variation in the exponent of the degree distribution as a function of&amp;nbsp;''m''.]]

==Leadership persistence probability==
In the growing network not all nodes are equally important. The extent of their importance is measured by the value of their degree &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Nodes which are linked to an unusually large number of other nodes, i.e. nodes with exceptionally high &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; value, are known as hubs. They are special because their existence make the mean distance, measured in units of the number of links, between nodes incredibly small thereby playing the key role in spreading rumors, opinions, diseases, computer viruses etc.&lt;ref&gt;R. Pastor-Satorras, A. Vespignani., Phys. Rev. Lett. '''86''' 3200(2001).&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, important to know the properties of the largest hub, which we regard as the leader. Like in society, the leadership in a growing network is not permanent. That is, once a node becomes the leader, it does not mean that it remains the leader ''ad infinitum''. An interesting question is: how long does the leader retain this leadership property as the network evolves? To find an answer to this question, we define the leadership persistence probability &lt;math&gt;F(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; that aleader retains its leadership for at least up to time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Persistence probability has been of interest in many different systems ranging from coarsening dynamics to fluctuating interfaces or polymer chains.

[[File:Persistence-page-0.jpg|thumb|The two plots at the top reveal the power-law behavior of the leadership persistence probability. To appreciate the role of m we give leadership persistence probability for two values (m=1 and m=100) in the same plot: (a) BA networks and (b) MDA networks. The two plots at the bottom are for the persistence exponent as a function of m in (c) BA networks and (d) MDA networks.]]

The basic idea of the MDA rule is, however not completely new as either this or models similar to this can be found in a few earlier works, albeit their approach, ensuing analysis and their results are different from ours. For instance, Saramaki and Kaski presented a random-walk based model.&lt;ref&gt;Saramaki and K. Kaski, Physica A '''341''', 80 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another model proposed by Boccaletti  ''et al.'' may appear similar to ours, but it markedly differs on closer look.&lt;ref&gt;S. Boccaletti, D.-U. Hwang and V. Latora, I. J. Bifurcation and Chaos '''17''' 2447  (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, Yang {\it et al.} too gave a form for &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; and resorted to mean-field approximation.&lt;ref&gt;X.-H. Yang, S. -L. Lou, G. Chen, S.-Y. Chen, W. Huang, Physica A
'''392''' 3531 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nature of their expressions are significantly different from the one studied by Hassan ''et al.''. Yet another closely related model is the Growing Network with Redirection (GNR) model presented by Gabel, Krapivsky and Redner where at each time step a new node either attaches to a randomly chosen target node with probability  &lt;math&gt;1-r&lt;/math&gt;, or to the parent of the target with probability  &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Krapivsky and S. Redner, Phys. Rev. E '''63''', 066123 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The GNR model with &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt; may appear similar to the MDA model. However,  it should be noted that unlike the GNR model, the MDA model is for undirected networks, and that the new link can connect with any neighbor of the mediator-parent or not. One more difference is that, in the MDA model new node may join the existing network with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; edges and in the GNR model it is considered &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt; case only.

==Nature of mathematics==
*[[Definitions of mathematics]] – Mathematics has no generally accepted definition. Different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions, all of which are controversial.
*[[Philosophy of mathematics]] – its aim is to provide an account of the nature and methodology of mathematics and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives.

===Mathematics is===
*an [[academic discipline]] – branch of knowledge that is taught at all levels of education and researched typically at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
*a [[formal science]] – branch of knowledge concerned with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules of inference. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the physical world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4144">{{short description|Mathematical theorem used in numerical analysis}}
In [[numerical analysis]], the '''Peano kernel theorem''' is a general result on error bounds for a wide class of numerical approximations (such as [[numerical quadrature|numerical quadratures]]), defined in terms of [[linear functionals]]. It is attributed to [[Giuseppe Peano]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/679940621|title=Numerical analysis|last=Ridgway Scott|first=L.|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=9780691146867|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=209|oclc=679940621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement of theorem ==
Let  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; be the space of all [[differentiable function]]s &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined for &lt;math&gt;x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; that are of [[bounded variation]] on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be a [[linear functional]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\nu+1&lt;/math&gt; times [[continuously differentiable]] and that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; ''annihilates'' all polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;\leq \nu&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.&lt;math display="block"&gt;Lp=0,\qquad \forall p\in\mathbb{P}_\nu[x].&lt;/math&gt;Suppose further that for any [[bivariate function]] &lt;math&gt;g(x,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g(x,\cdot),\,g(\cdot,x)\in C^{\nu+1}[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, the following is valid:&lt;math display="block"&gt;L\int_a^bg(x,\theta)\,d\theta=\int_a^bLf(x,\theta)\,d\theta,&lt;/math&gt;and define the '''Peano kernel''' of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; as&lt;math display="block"&gt;k(\theta)=L[(x-\theta)^\nu_+],\qquad\theta\in[a,b],&lt;/math&gt;introducing notation&lt;math display="block"&gt;(x-\theta)^\nu_+ = \begin{cases} (x-\theta)^\nu, &amp; x\geq\theta, \\ 0, &amp; x\leq\theta. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;The ''Peano kernel theorem'' then states that &lt;math display="block"&gt;Lf=\frac{1}{\nu!}\int_a^bk(\theta)f^{(\nu+1)}(\theta)\,d\theta,&lt;/math&gt;provided &lt;math&gt;k\in\mathcal{V}[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277275036|title=A first course in the numerical analysis of differential equations|last=Iserles|first=Arieh|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521734905|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge|pages=443–444|oclc=277275036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bounds ====
Several bounds on the value of &lt;math&gt;Lf&lt;/math&gt; follow from this result:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
|Lf|&amp;\leq\frac{1}{\nu!}\|k\|_1\|f^{(\nu+1)}\|_\infty\\[5pt]
|Lf|&amp;\leq\frac{1}{\nu!}\|k\|_\infty\|f^{(\nu+1)}\|_1\\[5pt]
|Lf|&amp;\leq\frac{1}{\nu!}\|k\|_2\|f^{(\nu+1)}\|_2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_\infty&lt;/math&gt;are the [[Taxicab norm|taxicab]], [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean]] and [[Maximum norm|maximum]] [[Norm (mathematics)|norms]] respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Application ==
In practice, the main application of the Peano kernel theorem is to bound the error of an approximation that is exact for all &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathbb{P}_\nu&lt;/math&gt;. The theorem above follows from the [[Taylor polynomial]] for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with integral remainder:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(x)=f(a) + {} &amp; (x-a)f'(a) + \frac{(x-a)^2}{2}f''(a)+\cdots \\[6pt]
&amp; \cdots+\frac{(x-a)^\nu}{\nu!}f^\nu(a)+
\frac{1}{\nu!}\int_a^x(x-a)^\nu f^{(\nu+1)}(\theta)\,d\theta,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

defining &lt;math&gt;L(f)&lt;/math&gt; as the error of the approximation, using the [[Linear map|linearity]] of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; together with exactness for &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathbb{P}_\nu&lt;/math&gt; to annihilate all but the final term on the right-hand side, and using the &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)_+&lt;/math&gt; notation to remove the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-dependence from the integral limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/examples/D3Ll.pdf|title=Numerical Analysis|last=Iserles|first=Arieh|date=1997|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof School''' is a school in San Francisco for pupils who love mathematics. The school opened in the fall of 2015 with 45 students in grades 6–10.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Bizjournals.com_July_5_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2014/10/31/stem-education-math-skills-add-up-at-proof-school.html |title=Math skills add up at Proof School – San Francisco Business Times |newspaper=Bizjournals.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, 94.4 students in grades 6–12 are enrolled in Proof School for the academic year (2018–2019).

==Academics==

Proof School is a full-curriculum day school that emphasizes communication, collaboration, and problem solving. The school is accredited by [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].

The school year is divided into 5 'blocks', each of which consist of 6 normal academic weeks and a build week.

Each student has 5 courses: 4 'morning' courses that vary across grades, and a math class. The morning courses meet twice a week: once for 70 minutes, and once for 90 minutes. The math courses meet for two hours and ten minutes every day. 

The (non-post-calculus) math classes focus on a different subject each block: Block 1 is Combinatorics, Block 2 is Algebra, Block 3 is Geometry, Block 4 is Algebra and Pre-Calculus, and Block 5 is Number Theory.

Broadly speaking, '''pure mathematics''' (or '''fundamental mathematics'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/m2r/?q=content/2018-2019|title=2018-2019 {{!}} M2R Fundamental Mathematics Grenoble|website=www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[mathematics]] that studies entirely abstract [[concept]]s.  This has been a recognizable category of mathematical activity from the 19th century onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piaggio|first1=H|title=Three Sadleirian Professors: A.R. Forsyth, E.W. Hobson and G.H. Hardy|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Sadleirian_Professors.html|website=MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|publisher=St. Andrews University|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of [[navigation]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[economics]], [[engineering]], and so on.

Another view is that pure mathematics is ''not necessarily'' [[applied mathematics]]: it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world.&lt;ref name=Magid/&gt; Even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians.

To develop accurate models for describing the real world, many applied mathematicians draw on tools and techniques that are often considered to be "pure" mathematics. On the other hand, many pure mathematicians draw on natural and social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research.

==History==

===Ancient Greece===
Ancient Greek mathematicians were among the earliest to make a distinction between pure and applied mathematics. [[Plato]] helped to create the gap between "arithmetic", now called [[number theory]], and "logistic", now called [[arithmetic]]. Plato regarded logistic (arithmetic) as appropriate for businessmen and men of war who "must learn the art of numbers or [they] will not know how to array [their] troops" and arithmetic (number theory) as appropriate for philosophers "because [they have] to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=The age of Plato and Aristotle|pages=86|quote=Plato is important in the history of mathematics largely for his role as inspirer and director of others, and perhaps to him is due the sharp distinction in ancient Greece between arithmetic (in the sense of the theory of numbers) and logistic (the technique of computation). Plato regarded logistic as appropriate for the businessman and for the man of war, who "must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array his troops." The philosopher, on the other hand, must be an arithmetician "because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euclid of Alexandria]], when asked by one of his students of what use was the study of geometry, asked his slave to give the student threepence, "since he must make gain of what he learns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria |pages=101 |quote=Evidently Euclid did not stress the practical aspects of his subject, for there is a tale told of him that when one of his students asked of what use was the study of geometry, Euclid asked his slave to give the student threepence, "since he must make gain of what he learns."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek mathematician [[Apollonius of Perga]] was asked about the usefulness of some of his theorems in Book IV of ''Conics'' to which he proudly asserted,&lt;ref name="Apollonius"&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Apollonius of Perga|pages=152|quote=It is in connection with the theorems in this book that Apollonius makes a statement implying that in his day, as in ours, there were narrow-minded opponents of pure mathematics who pejoratively inquired about the usefulness of such results. The author proudly asserted: "They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason." (Heath 1961, p.lxxiv).&lt;BR&gt;The preface to Book V, relating to maximum and minimum straight lines drawn to a conic, again argues that the subject is one of those that seem "worthy of study for their own sake." While one must admire the author for his lofty intellectual attitude, it may be pertinently pointed out that s day was beautiful theory, with no prospect of applicability to the science or engineering of his time, has since become fundamental in such fields as terrestrial dynamics and celestial mechanics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And since many of his results were not applicable to the science or engineering of his day, Apollonius further argued in the preface of the fifth book of ''Conics'' that the subject is one of those that "...seem worthy of study for their own sake."&lt;ref name="Apollonius"/&gt;

===19th century===
The term itself is enshrined in the full title of the [[Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics|Sadleirian Chair]], founded (as a professorship) in the mid-nineteenth century. The idea of a separate discipline of ''pure'' mathematics may have emerged at that time. The generation of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] made no sweeping distinction of the kind, between ''pure'' and ''applied''. In the following years, specialisation and professionalisation (particularly in the [[Weierstrass]] approach to [[mathematical analysis]]) started to make a rift more apparent.

===20th century===
At the start of the twentieth century mathematicians took up the [[axiomatic method]], strongly influenced by [[David Hilbert]]'s example. The logical formulation of '''pure mathematics''' suggested by [[Bertrand Russell]] in terms of a [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] structure of [[Proposition (mathematics)|proposition]]s seemed more and more plausible, as large parts of mathematics became axiomatised and thus subject to the simple criteria of ''[[rigorous proof]]''.

In fact in an axiomatic setting ''rigorous'' adds nothing to the idea of ''proof''. Pure mathematics, according to a view that can be ascribed to the [[Bourbaki group]], is what is proved. '''Pure mathematician''' became a recognized vocation, achievable through training.

The case was made that pure mathematics is useful in [[engineering education]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[A. S. Hathaway]] (1901) [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1901-07-06/S0002-9904-1901-00797-5/S0002-9904-1901-00797-5.pdf "Pure mathematics for engineering students"], [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 7(6):266–71.&lt;/ref&gt;
:There is a training in habits of thought, points of view, and intellectual comprehension of ordinary engineering problems, which only the study of higher mathematics can give.

==Generality and abstraction==
One central concept in pure mathematics is the idea of generality; pure mathematics often exhibits a trend towards increased generality. Uses and advantages of generality include the following:

* Generalizing theorems or mathematical structures can lead to deeper understanding of the original theorems or structures
* Generality can simplify the presentation of material, resulting in shorter proofs or arguments that are easier to follow.
* One can use generality to avoid duplication of effort, proving a general result instead of having to prove separate cases independently, or using results from other areas of mathematics.
* Generality can facilitate connections between different branches of mathematics. [[Category theory]] is one area of mathematics dedicated to exploring this commonality of structure as it plays out in some areas of math.

Generality's impact on [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is both dependent on the subject and a matter of personal preference or learning style.  Often generality is seen as a hindrance to intuition, although it can certainly function as an aid to it, especially when it provides analogies to material for which one already has good intuition.

As a prime example of generality, the [[Erlangen program]] involved an expansion of [[geometry]] to accommodate [[non-Euclidean geometries]] as well as the field of [[topology]], and other forms of geometry, by viewing geometry as the study of a space together with a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of transformations.  The study of [[number]]s, called [[algebra]] at the beginning undergraduate level, extends to [[abstract algebra]] at a more advanced level; and the study of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, called [[calculus]] at the college freshman level becomes [[mathematical analysis]] and [[functional analysis]] at a more advanced level.  Each of these branches of more ''abstract'' mathematics have many sub-specialties, and there are in fact many connections between pure mathematics and applied mathematics disciplines. A steep rise in [[abstraction]] was seen mid 20th century.

In practice, however, these developments led to a sharp divergence from [[physics]], particularly from 1950 to 1983. Later this was criticised, for example by [[Vladimir Arnold]], as too much [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], not enough [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]]. The point does not yet seem to be settled, in that [[string theory]] pulls one way, while [[discrete mathematics]] pulls back towards proof as central.

==Purism==
Mathematicians have always had differing opinions regarding the distinction between pure and applied mathematics. 
One of the most famous (but perhaps misunderstood) modern examples of this debate can be found in [[G.H. Hardy]]'s ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''.

It is widely believed that Hardy considered applied mathematics to be ugly and dull. Although it is true that Hardy preferred pure mathematics, which he often compared to [[painting]] and [[poetry]], Hardy saw the distinction between pure and applied mathematics to be simply that applied mathematics sought to express ''physical'' truth in a mathematical framework, whereas pure mathematics expressed truths that were independent of the physical world. Hardy made a separate distinction in mathematics between what he called "real" mathematics, "which has permanent aesthetic value", and "the dull and elementary parts of mathematics" that have practical use.

Hardy considered some physicists, such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], and [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], to be among the "real" mathematicians, but at the time that he was writing the ''Apology'' he also considered [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] to be "useless", which allowed him to hold the opinion that only "dull" mathematics was useful. Moreover, Hardy briefly admitted that—just as the application of [[matrix theory]] and [[group theory]] to physics had come unexpectedly—the time may come where some kinds of beautiful, "real" mathematics may be useful as well.

Another insightful view is offered by Magid:
{{quote|I've always thought that a good model here could be drawn from ring theory. In that subject, one has the subareas of [[commutative ring theory]] and noncommutative ring theory. An uninformed observer might think that these represent a dichotomy, but in fact the latter subsumes the former: a noncommutative ring is a not necessarily commutative ring. If we use similar conventions, then we could refer to applied mathematics and nonapplied mathematics, where by the latter we ''mean not necessarily applied mathematics''… [emphasis added]&lt;ref name=Magid&gt;Andy Magid, Letter from the Editor, in ''Notices of the AMS'', November 2005, American Mathematical Society, p.1173. [http://www.ams.org/notices/200510/commentary.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Subfields==
[[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]] is concerned with the properties of functions. It deals with concepts such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[limit of a function|limits]], [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]], thus providing a rigorous foundation for the [[calculus]] of infinitesimals introduced by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century. [[Real analysis]] studies functions of real numbers, while [[complex analysis]] extends the aforementioned concepts to functions of complex numbers.  [[Functional analysis]] is a branch of analysis that studies infinite-dimensional vector spaces and views functions as points in these spaces.

[[Abstract algebra]] is not to be confused with the manipulation of formulae that is covered in secondary education. It studies [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] together with [[binary operations]] defined on them. Sets and their binary operations may be classified according to their properties: for instance, if an operation is [[associative]] on a set that contains an identity element and inverses for each member of the set, the set and operation is considered to be a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. Other structures include [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[vector spaces]] and [[Lattice (group)|lattices]].

[[Combinatorics]] is a branch of mathematics concerning the study of finite or countable discrete structures. It also interacts with many other areas of mathematics. For example, additive combinatorics is related to [[number theory]] and [[analysis]], and [[graph theory]] comes from [[topology]].

[[Geometry]] is the study of shapes and space, in particular, groups of transformations that act on spaces. For example, [[projective geometry]] is about the group of projective transformations that act on the real projective plane, whereas [[inversive geometry]] is concerned with the group of inversive transformations acting on the extended complex plane.

[[Number theory]] is the theory of the positive [[integers]]. It is based on ideas such as divisibility and [[modular arithmetic|congruence]]. Its [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|fundamental theorem]] states that each positive integer has a unique prime factorization. In some ways it is the most accessible discipline in pure mathematics for the general public: for instance the [[Goldbach conjecture]] is easily stated (but is yet to be proved or disproved). In other ways it is the least accessible discipline; for example, Wiles' proof that Fermat's equation has no nontrivial solutions requires understanding [[automorphic forms]], which though intrinsic to nature have not found a place in physics or the general public discourse.

[[Topology]] is a modern extension of Geometry. Rather than focusing on the sizes of objects and their precise measurement, topology involves the properties of spaces or objects that are preserved under smooth operations such as bending or twisting (but not, for example, tearing or shearing). Topology's subfields interact with other branches of pure math: traditional topology uses ideas from [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]], such as metric spaces, and [[algebraic topology]] relies on ideas from [[combinatorics]] in addition to those of analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4333">In [[mathematic]]s and [[political science]], the '''quota rule''' states that when proportionally [[Apportionment (politics)|apportioning seats]], the number of representative seats that should be alloted to a given party should be no more than the upper or lower roundings (called upper and lower quotas) of the [[proportional representation]];&lt;ref name="maa"&gt;https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/apportioning-representatives-in-the-united-states-congress-the-quota-rule Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt; i.e if a party deserves 10.56 seats out of 15, the quota rule states that when the seats are alloted, the party may get 10 or 11 seats, but not lower or higher. The use of this rule is important when allocating seats in places such as the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and any place that uses proportional representation.

==Mathematics==
The rule can be rigorously defined as follows: Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be the population of the party, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be the total population, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be the number of available seats. The quota for that party is then

: &lt;math&gt; \frac P T \cdot S&lt;/math&gt;

When the quota results in a fractional value, the lower quota is the quota rounded down and the upper quota is the quota rounded up. Hence, the quota rule states that the only allocation for that party should be either the lower or upper quota.&lt;ref name="maa"/&gt; If at any time an allocation gives a party a greater or lesser number of seats than the upper or lower quota, that allocation (and by extension, the method used to allocate it) is said to be in violation of the quota rule.

===Relation to other apportionment paradoxes===
The [[Apportionment_paradox#Balinski–Young_theorem|Balinski–Young theorem]] proved in 1980 that if an apportionment method satisfies the quota rule, it must fail to satisfy some other [[apportionment paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~bosikiew/Math11008/imposs-apportion.pdf Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, although [[Largest remainder method|Hamilton's method]] satisfies the quota rule, it violates the [[Alabama paradox]] and the [[population paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;https://rangevoting.org/Apportion.html Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem itself is broken up into several different proofs that cover a wide number of circumstances.&lt;ref name="Balinski"&gt;http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/1338/1/WP-80-131.pdf Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, there are two main statements that apply to the quota rule:
*Any method that follows the quota rule must fail the population paradox.&lt;ref name="Balinski"/&gt;
*Any method that is free of both the Alabama paradox and the population paradox must necessarily fail the quota rule for some circumstances.&lt;ref name="Balinski"/&gt;

==Use in apportionment methods==
Different methods for allocating seats may or may not satisfy the quota rule. For example, Hamilton's method proportions seats equally until a fractional value is reached; the surplus seats are then given to the state with the largest fractional parts until there are no more surplus seats. Hamilton's method will always pass the quota rule, as there is no period in which a state can be allotted more than the upper quota or less than the lower quota.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.math.colostate.edu/~freeman/m130/apportionment1.pdf Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jefferson's method]], which was one of the first used by the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;http://people.cas.uab.edu/~jcmayer/Apportionment%202.pdf
Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes allocated more than is allowed, violating the quota rule.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.math.colostate.edu/~spriggs/m130/apportionment2.pdf Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt; This violation led to a growing problem where larger states receive more representatives than smaller states, which was not corrected until [[Webster/Sainte-Laguë method|Webster's method]] was implemented in 1842; Webster's method also violates the quota rule, although much more rarely.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.vcu.edu/~gasmerom/MAT131/lecture4.html Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The society hosts regular talks at the [[Centre for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge)|Centre for Mathematical Sciences]], including in the past by many well-known speakers in the field of mathematics. It publishes two magazines, [[Eureka (University of Cambridge magazine)|''Eureka'']] and ''QARCH''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archim.org.uk/|title=The Archimedeans|last=|first=|date=|website=www.archim.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of several aims of the society, as laid down in its constitution, is to encourage co-operation between the existing mathematical societies of individual [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|Cambridge colleges]], which at present are just the Adam's society of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] and the [[Trinity Mathematical Society]], but in the past have included many more.

The society is mentioned in [[G. H. Hardy]]'s essay [[A Mathematician's Apology]].

== Activity ==
The main focus of the society's activities are the regular talks, which generally concern topics from mathematics or theoretical physics, and are accessible to students on an undergraduate level. Among the list of recent speakers are [[Fields Medal|Fields medalists]] [[Michael Atiyah]], [[Wendelin Werner]] and [[Alain Connes]], as well as authors [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Simon Singh]]. Many of the speakers are international, and are hosted by The Archimedeans during their visit.

After exams and University-wide project deadlines, the society is also known to organise social events, which have shown to be highly popular.

== Publications ==
''Eureka'' is a mathematical journal that is published annually by The Archimedeans. It includes articles on a variety of topics in mathematics, written by students and academics from all over the world, as well as a short summary of the activities of the society, [[Problem set|problem sets]], puzzles, artwork and book reviews. The magazine has been published 60 times since 1939, and authors include many famous mathematicians and scientists such as [[Paul Erdős]], [[Martin Gardner]], [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Godfrey Hardy]], [[Béla Bollobás]], [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Roger Penrose]], [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], Fields Medallist [[Timothy Gowers]] and [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Paul Dirac]].

The journal is distributed free of charge to all current members of the Archimedeans. In addition, there are many subscriptions by other students, alumni and libraries. Subscriptions to ''Eureka'' are the society's main source of income.

The Archimedeans also publish ''QARCH'', a magazine containing problem sets and solutions or partial solutions submitted by readers. It is published on an irregular basis and distributed free of charge.
