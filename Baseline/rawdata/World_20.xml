{{See also|World population}}
'''[[Demographics]] of the [[world]]''' include [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health measures, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the human population of the planet [[Earth]]. 

The overall total population of the world is approximately 7.5 billion, as of March 2018. 

Its overall population density is 50 people per kmÂ² (129.28 per sq. mile), excluding Antarctica. Nearly two-thirds of the population lives in [[Asia]] and is predominantly urban and suburban, with more than 2.5 billion in the countries of [[China]] and [[India]] combined. The world's fairly low [[literacy]] rate (83.7%) is attributable to [[poverty]]. Lower literacy rates are common in [[South Asia]], [[West Asia]], and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

The world's largest ethnic group is [[Han Chinese]] with [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] being the world's most spoken language in terms of native speakers.

Human migration has been shifting toward cities and urban centers, with the urban population jumping from 29% in 1950, to 50.5% in 2005.&lt;ref name="cia world"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA.gov World Factbook - World Statistics] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |date=1 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working backwards from the United Nations prediction that the world will be 51.3 percent urban by 2010, Dr. Ron Wimberley, Dr. Libby Morris and Dr. Gregory Fulkerson estimated 23 May 2007 to be the first time the urban population outnumbered the rural population in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/go/7334/ World Population Becomes More Urban That Rural]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[China]] and [[India]] are the most populous countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html |title=Country Comparison :: Population |accessdate=28 September 2011 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[birth rate]] has consistently dropped in developed countries and until recently remained high in developing countries.

The [[total fertility rate]] of the World is estimated as 2.52 children per woman, which is above the global average for the [[replacement fertility rate]] of approximately 2.33 (as of 2003).&lt;ref name= variation&gt;{{cite journal|title=The surprising global variation in replacement fertility|vauthors=Espenshade TJ, Guzman JC, Westoff CF |year=2003|journal=Population Research and Policy Review | volume=22 |page=575 |doi=10.1023/B:POPU.0000020882.29684.8e |issue=5/6}}, Introduction and Table 1, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt; However, world [[population growth]] is unevenly distributed, with the total fertility rate going from .91 in [[Macau]], to 7.68 in [[Niger]]. The [[United Nations]] estimated an annual population increase of 1.14% for the year of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldpop.html |title=Census.gov |publisher=Census.gov |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current world population growth is approximately 1.09%&lt;ref name="cia world"/&gt;
&lt;!---There are approximately 3.38  billion females in the World. The number of males is about 3.41 billion. ---&gt;

People under 18 years of age made up over a quarter of the world population (29.3%), and people age 65 and over made up less than one-tenth (7.9%) in 2011.&lt;ref name="cia world"/&gt;

== History ==
Historical migration of human populations begins with the movement of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' out of Africa across [[Eurasia]] about a million years ago. ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' appear to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 50,000 - 60,000 years ago, and had spread across [[Prehistory of Australia|Australia]], [[History of Asia|Asia]] and [[Paleolithic Europe|Europe]] by 30,000 years BC. [[Models of migration to the New World|Migration to the Americas]] took place 20,000 to 15,000 years ago, and by 2,000 years ago, most of the [[Pacific Islands]] were colonized.

Until c.&amp;nbsp;10,000 years ago, humans lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They generally lived in small nomadic groups known as [[band societies]]. The advent of agriculture prompted the [[Neolithic Revolution]], when access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent [[human settlement]]s. About 6,000 years ago, the first proto-states developed in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]]'s [[Nile Valley]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]]. Early human settlements were dependent on proximity to [[water resources|water]] and, depending on the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], other [[natural resources]] used for [[subsistence]]. But humans have a great capacity for altering their [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] by means of technology.

Since 1800, the [[human population]] has increased from one billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/411162.stm | accessdate = 5 February 2008 | work=BBC News | title=World's population reaches six billion | date=5 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over seven billion,&lt;ref name=7billpop&gt;{{cite web|title=UN population estimates.|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/p2k0data.asp|work=Population Division, United Nations|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, some 2.5 billion out of 6.3 billion people (39.7%) lived in [[urban area]]s. In February 2008, the U.N. estimated that half the world's population would live in [[urban area]]s by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4561183.stm | work=BBC News | first=David | last=Whitehouse | title=Half of humanity set to go urban | date=19 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems for humans living in [[city|cities]] include various forms of pollution and [[crime]],&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!-- {{cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/usrv98.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825142912/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/usrv98.htm |archivedate=25 August 2009 |df= }} --&gt;http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/usrv98.pdf Urban, Suburban, and Rural Victimization, 1993â98] U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,.

==Cities==
The World has hundreds of major cities spread across 6 continents. Most are in coastal regions.

{{As of|2005}}, the World had 62 metropolitan areas with a population of over 3,000,000 people each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/2005_world_city_populations/2005_city_population_01.html 2005 World City Populations]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, about 3 billion people live in or around urban areas.&lt;ref name="cia world" /&gt;

== Population density ==
{{See also|List of countries by population density}}

[[File:Population density countries 2018 world map, people per sq km.svg|300px|thumb|Population density (people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by country, 2018]]

The [[world's population]] is 7 billion&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html U.S. &amp; World Population Clocks]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Earth]]'s total area (including land and water) is 510 million square kilometers (197 million square miles).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA - The World Factbook] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |date=1 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the worldwide human population density is 7 billion Ã· 510 million = 13.7 per kmÂ² (35.5 per sq. mile). If only the Earth's land area of 150 million kmÂ² (58 million sq. miles) is taken into account, then human population density increases to 46.7 per kmÂ² (117.2 per sq. mile). This calculation includes all continental and island land area, including [[Antarctica]]. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to 50 people per kmÂ² (129.28 per sq. mile).&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/popdensity.htm About.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that over half of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human inhabitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and that population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh water sources, this number by itself does not give any meaningful measurement of human population density.

Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are [[city-states]], [[microstates]] or [[Dependent territory|dependencies]].&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1| version=2008 revision  | format=PDF | publisher=United Nations | author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division | year=2009 | accessdate= 12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Monaco government uses a smaller surface area figure resulting in a population density of 18,078 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These territories share a relatively small area and a high [[urbanization]] level, with an economically specialized [[city]] population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].

{{Further information|List of religious populations}}

The table below lists religions classified by philosophy; however, religious philosophy is not always the determining factor in local practice. Please note that this table includes heterodox movements as adherents to their larger philosophical category, although this may be disputed by others within that category. For example, [[Cao ÄÃ i]] is listed because it claims to be a separate category from Buddhism, while [[HÃ²a Háº£o]] is not, even though they are similar [[new religious movement]]s.

The population numbers below are computed by a combination of census reports, random surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example United States or France), and self-reported attendance numbers, but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count. Some organizations may wildly inflate their numbers.

Since the late 19th century, the demographics of religion have changed a great deal. Some [[Western civilization|countries with a historically large Christian population]] have experienced a significant decline in the numbers of professed active Christians: see [[demographics of atheism]]. Symptoms of the decline in active participation in Christian religious life include declining recruitment for the [[priest]]hood and [[monastery|monastic life]], as well as diminishing attendance at [[Church service|church]].  On the other hand, since the 19th century, large areas of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] have been converted to Christianity, and this area of the world has the highest population growth rate.  In the realm of [[Western civilization]], there has been an increase in the number of people who identify themselves as [[secular humanism|secular humanists]]. In many countries, such as the People's Republic of China, communist governments have discouraged religion, making it difficult to count the actual number of believers. However, after the collapse of communism in numerous countries of Eastern Europe and the former [[Soviet Union]], religious life has been experiencing resurgence there, both in the form of traditional [[Eastern Christianity]] and in the forms of [[Neopaganism]] and [[Far Eastern religions]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The actual annual growth in the number of humans fell from its peak of 88.0 million in 1989, to a low of 73.9 million in 2003, after which it rose again to 75.2 million in 2006. Since then, annual growth has declined. In 2009, the human population increased by 74.6 million, which is projected to fall steadily to about 41 million per annum in 2050, at which time the population will have increased to about 9.2 billion.&lt;ref name="census1"/&gt; Each region of the globe has seen great reductions in growth rate in recent decades, though growth rates remain above 2% in some countries of the [[Middle East]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and also in [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpop.php U.S. Census Bureau, June 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701122431/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpop.php |date=1 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries experienced [[Population decline|negative population growth]], especially in [[Eastern Europe]] mainly due to low [[fertility rate]]s, high death rates and [[emigration]]. In [[Southern Africa]], growth is slowing due to the high number of [[HIV]]-related deaths. Some [[Western Europe]] countries might also encounter negative population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp?panel=2 UN population projections]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5tpNJ6FqS?url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp?panel=2 |date=28 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]]'s population began decreasing in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/02/japan-population |title=Japan sees biggest population fall |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population in the world increased from 1990 to 2008 with 1,423 million and 27% growth. Measured by persons, the increase was highest in [[India]] (290 million) and [[China]] (192 million). Population growth was highest in [[Qatar]] (174%) and [[United Arab Emirates]] (140%).&lt;ref name=IEApop2011&gt;[http://www.iea.org/co2highlights/co2Highlights.XLS CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion] Population 1971-2008 IEA  ([http://iea.org/co2highlights/co2highlights.pdf pdf] pages 83-85)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[The World Factbook|CIA - The World Factbook]], the country with the highest birth rate currently is Niger at 51.26 births per 1000 people. The country with the lowest birth rate is Japan at 7.64 births per 1000 people. Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, is at 7.42 births per 1000 people. As compared to the 1950s, birth rate was at 36 births per 1000 in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uneca.org/eca_programmes/food_security_and_sustainability/programme_overview/population/fertility/crude_world.htm Uneca.org: Crude Birth Rates - The World and its Major Regions, 1950-2050] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816073652/http://www.uneca.org/eca_programmes/food_security_and_sustainability/programme_overview/population/fertility/crude_world.htm |date=16 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; birth rate has declined by 16 births per 1000 people. In July 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health announced that the adolescent birth rate continues to decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jul2011/nichd-07.htm Federal report shows drop in adolescent birth rate, July 7, 2011 News Release - National Institutes of Health (NIH)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Birth rates vary even within the same geographic areas. In Europe, as of July 2011, Ireland's birth rate is 16.5 per cent, which is 3.5 per cent higher than the next-ranked country, the UK. France has a birth rate of 12.8 per cent while Sweden is at 12.3 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-has-one-of-highest-birth-and-lowest-death-rates-in-eu-189080-Jul2011/ |title=Ireland has one of highest birth and lowest death rates in EU |work=Thejournal.ie |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a 2.4% increase in live births in the UK in 2010 alone.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/13/more-midwives-birth-rate-40-year-high |title=Call for more midwives as birth rate reaches 40-year high |work=The Guardian |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest birth rate in the UK in 40 years.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; By contrast, the birth rate in Germany is only 8.3 per 1,000, which is so low that both the UK and France, which have significantly smaller populations, produced more births in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2011/0809/1224302081071.html |title=Germany faces up to its kinder surprise |work=The Irish Times |date=9 June 2018 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth rates also vary within the same geographic area, based on different demographic groups. For example, in April 2011, the U.S. CDC announced that the birth rate for women over the age of 40 in the U.S. rose between 2007 and 2009, while it fell among every other age group during the same time span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/04/01/cdc.births.decline/index.html |title=CDC records rise in birth rate for women over 40 |work=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Taiwan's government announced that its birth rate declined in the previous year, despite the fact that it implemented a host of approaches to encourage its citizens to have babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14525525 |title=Taiwanese birth rate plummets despite measures |work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth rates ranging from 10-20 births per 1000 are considered low, while rates from 40-50 births per 1000 are considered high. There are problems associated with both an extremely high birth rate and an extremely low birth rate. High birth rates can cause stress on the government welfare and family programs to support a youthful population. Additional problems faced by a country with a high birth rate include educating a growing number of children, creating jobs for these children when they enter the workforce, and dealing with the environmental effects that a large population can produce. Low birth rates can put stress on the government to provide adequate senior welfare systems and also the stress on families to support the elders themselves. There will be less children or working age population to support the constantly growing aging population.

See [[list of countries by death rate]] for worldwide statistics.

According to the [[World Health Organization]], the 10 leading [[causes of death]] in 2002 were:
&lt;!-- ref: http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf --&gt;
# 12.6% [[Ischemic heart disease]]
#  9.7% [[Cerebrovascular disease]]
#  6.8% [[Lower respiratory infection]]s
#  4.9% [[HIV/AIDS]]
#  4.8% [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]
#  3.2% [[Diarrhoeal disease]]s
#  2.7% [[Tuberculosis]]
#  2.2% [[Trachea/bronchus/lung cancers]]
#  2.2% [[Malaria]]
#  2.1% [[Road traffic accidents]]

Causes of death vary greatly between first and third world countries.

According to [[Jean Ziegler]] (the [[United Nations]] Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food for 2000 to March 2008), mortality due to [[malnutrition]] accounted for 58% of the total mortality in 2006: "In the world, approximately 62 millions people, all causes of death combined, die each year. In 2006, more than 36 millions died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in [[micronutrients]]".&lt;ref name=Ziegler&gt;[[Jean Ziegler]], ''[[L'Empire de la honte]]'', Fayard, 2007 {{ISBN|978-2-253-12115-2}}, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the roughly 150,000 people who died each day across the globe, about two thirdsâ100,000 per dayâdied of age-related causes in 2001, according to an article which counts all deaths "due to causes that kill hardly anyone under the age of 40" as age-related.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = 7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersource|| reference uses an extremely broad definition of "age-related" deaths, including even traffic accidents due to poor eyesight|date=June 2018}} In industrialized nations, the proportion was even higher according to that article, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

|}]]

The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] have the highest female ratio with 0.77 males per female. [[Qatar]] has the highest male ratio, with 2.87 males/female. For the group aged below 15, [[Sierra Leone]] has the highest female ratio with 0.96 males/female, and the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] are tied for the highest male ratio with 1.13 males/female (according to the 2006 [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]).

The value for the entire [[world population]] is 1.02 males/female,&lt;ref name="CIA Fact Book"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA Fact Book |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |publisher=The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |archivedate=1 February 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 1.07 at birth, 1.06 for those under 15, 1.02 for those between 15 and 64, and 0.78 for those over 65.

The "[[First World]]" [[G7]] members all have a sex ratio in the range of 0.95â0.98 for the total population, of 1.05â1.07 at birth, of 1.05â1.06 for the group below 15, of 1.00â1.04 for the group aged 15â64, and of 0.70â0.75 for those over 65.

Countries on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] tend to have a 'natural' ratio of about 1.05 at birth but a very high ratio of males for those over 65 ([[Saudi Arabia]] 1.13, [[United Arab Emirates]] 2.73, [[Qatar]] 2.84), indicating either an above-average mortality rate for females or a below-average mortality for males, or, more likely in this case, a large population of aging male [[foreign worker|guest workers]]. Conversely, countries of [[Eastern Europe]] (the [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]]) tend to have a 'normal' ratio at birth but a very low ratio of males among those over 65 (Russia 0.46, Latvia 0.48, Ukraine 0.52); similarly, [[Armenia]] has a far above average male ratio at birth (1.17), and a below-average male ratio above 65 (0.67). This effect may be caused by [[human migration|emigration]] and higher male mortality as result of higher post-Soviet era deaths; it may also be related to the enormous (by western standards) rate of alcoholism in the former Soviet states. Another possible contributory factor is an aging population, with a higher than normal proportion of relatively elderly people: we recall that due to higher differential mortality rates the ratio of males to females reduces for each year of age.

There is an inverse correlation between [[income and fertility]], wherein [[Developed country|developed countries]] usually have a much lower [[fertility rate]]. Various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]] may be involved, such as education and urbanization. [[Mortality rate]]s are low, [[birth control]] is understood and easily accessible, and costs are often deemed very high because of education, clothing, feeding, and social amenities. With wealth, contraception becomes affordable.  However, in countries like Iran where contraception was made artificially affordable before the economy accelerated, birth rate also rapidly declined.  Further, longer periods of time spent getting higher education often mean women have children later in life. Female labor participation rate also has substantial negative impact on fertility. However, this effect is neutralized among Nordic or liberalist countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage3.nifty.com/sociology/motion.html Graph Charts of TFR and FLR using Google Motion Chart using World Bank's World Development Index.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=November 2012}}

In [[undeveloped countries]] on the other hand, families desire children for their labour and as caregivers for their parents in old age. Fertility rates are also higher due to the lack of access to [[contraceptives]], generally lower levels of [[female education]], and lower rates of female employment in industry.

===Unemployment rate===
8.7% (2010 est.)
8.2% (2009 est.)
note: 30% combined unemployment and underemployment in many non-industrialized countries; developed countries typically 4%-12% unemployment (2007 est.)

===Demonym===
The [[demonym]] for Earth's inhabitants is [[wikt:Earthling|Earthling]] or, as either a noun or an adjective, [[wikt:Terran|Terran]].

{{Main article|Language family}}

Worldwide, [[English language|English]] is used widely as a [[lingua franca]] and can be seen to be the dominant language at this time. The world's largest language by native speakers is [[Mandarin Chinese]] which is a [[first language]] of around 960 million people, or 12.44% of the population, predominantly in [[Greater China]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is spoken by around 330 to 400 million people, predominantly in the [[Americas]] and [[Spain]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is spoken by around 280 million people. [[Hindi]] is spoken by about 200 million speakers, mostly in [[India]]. [[Bengali language|Bengali]] is spoken by around 230 million people, predominantly in India and Bangladesh. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is spoken by about 230 million speakers in [[Portugal]], [[Brazil]], [[East Timor]], and [[Southern Africa]].

There are numerous other languages, grouped into nine major families:

# [[Indo-European languages]] 46% ([[Europe]], [[Western Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[North Asia]], [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Oceania]])
# [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] 21% ([[East Asia]])
# [[NigerâCongo languages]] 6.4% ([[Sub-Saharan Africa]])
# [[Afro-Asiatic languages]] 6.0% ([[North Africa]] to [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Western Asia]])
# [[Austronesian languages]] 5.9% ([[Oceania]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]])
# [[Dravidian languages]] 3.7% ([[South Asia]])
# [[Altaic languages]] (controversial combination of Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic families) 2.3% ([[Central Asia]], [[North Asia]] ([[Siberia]]), and [[Anatolia]])&lt;ref&gt;Since the Mongolic and Tungusic language families have only a relatively small number of speakers, the majority of the Altaic percentage represents speakers of Turkic languages&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Austroasiatic languages]] 1.7% ([[Indochina|Mainland Southeast Asia]])
# [[TaiâKadai languages]] 1.3% ([[Southeast Asia]])

There are also hundreds of [[List of sign languages|non-verbal sign languages]].

The '''ecumene''' ([[American English|US]]) or '''oecumene''' ([[British English|UK]]; {{lang-grc-gre|Î¿á¼°ÎºÎ¿ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î·}}, ''oikoumÃ©nÄ'', {{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"inhabited") was an ancient Greek term for the known, the inhabited, or the habitable world. Under the [[Roman Empire]], it came to refer to [[civilization]] as well as the secular and religious imperial administration. In present usage, it is most often used in the context of "[[Ecumenism|ecumenical]]" and describes the [[Christian Church]] as a unified whole, or the unified modern world civilization. It is also used in [[cartography]] to describe a type of [[world map]] (''[[mappa mundi]]'') used in [[late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Herodotus world map-en.svg|thumb|right|200px|A modern depiction of the ecumene described by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term cited above is the [[grammatical gender|feminine]] [[present tense|present]] [[middle voice|middle]] [[participle]] of the verb {{lang|grc|Î¿á¼°ÎºÎ­Ï}} (''oikÃ©Å'', "to inhabit") and is a [[clipping (morphology)|clipped form]] of {{lang|grc|Î¿á¼°ÎºÎ¿ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î· Î³á¿}} (''oikoumÃ©nÄ gÄ'', "inhabited world").&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]. "Åcumene, ''n''."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greece==
[[Image:Claudius Ptolemy- The World.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] world map from the [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']] (Johannes Schnitzer, 1482).]]
[[Eratosthenes]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (276â196&amp;nbsp;BC) deduced the [[circumference of the Earth]] with remarkable accuracy (within 10% of the correct value). The Greek cartographer [[Crates of Mallus|Crates]] created a globe about 150&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Klein | first =Samuel John | contribution =Oecumene | year =2005 | title =Cartography Word of the Day | publisher =Designorati | url = http://designorati.com/articles/t1/cartography/462/cartography-word-of-the-day-oecumene.php | accessdate =2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] (83â161) calculated the Earth's surface in his [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']] and described the inhabited portion as spanning 180&amp;nbsp;degrees of [[longitude]] (from the [[Fortunate Isles]] in the west to [[Serae]] and [[Serica]] ([[China]]) in the east) and about 80&amp;nbsp;degrees of [[latitude]]{{refn|Although Ptolemy did not measure [[latitude]] with degrees but with hours of [[midsummer]] daylight, from 12 at the equator to 24 in the [[Arctic Circle|arctic]].}} (from [[Thule]] in the north to anti-[[MeroÃ«]] below the [[equator]]). Ptolemy was well aware that the Romans knew only about a quarter of the globe{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and his erroneous belief that the [[Indian Ocean]] was landlocked led to expectation of a [[terra incognita]] ("unknown land"). In fact, [[symmetry]] led him to expect that there should be three other continents to balance the ecumene: Perioeci ({{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"beside the ecumene"), Antoeci ("opposite the ecumene") and the [[Antipodes]] (âopposite the feetâ).

==Rome==
The cameo [[Gemma Augustea]] includes a Roman artistic personification of Oikoumene as she crowns an emperor, probably [[Augustus]], perhaps for bringing peace to the (Roman) world.

[[Image:THE FIRST COUNCIL OF NICEA.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.]]
The word was adopted within [[Christianity]] after [[Constantine the Great]]'s assembly of a [[synod]] of [[bishop]]s from all over the world at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.

By that time, the Greek term had come to refer more specifically to the civilized world and then simply the [[Roman Empire]]. This usage continued after the [[Diocletian#Reforms|Diocletian Reforms]] and the [[list of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperors]] used it to refer to their imperial administration. [[Constantinople]] was the "Ecumenical City" and, after 586, the Patriarch of Constantinople was known as the "[[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]". [[Pope Gregory I]] objected to the adoption of this style by [[John IV of Constantinople]], as it implied a universal jurisdiction he believed to be held by the [[Pope|bishop of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Schaff | first =Philip | author-link =Philip Schaff | contribution =Gregory and the Universal Episcopate | year =1882 | title =History of the Christian Church | volume =IV: Mediaeval Christianity: A.D. 590â1073 | place=Peabody, Massachusetts  | publisher =Hendrickson Publishers; 3rd edition (July 1, 1996)  | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc4.i.iv.iv.html | accessdate =2008-01-03 | isbn =978-1-56563-196-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Fifth Epistle berates John for having "attempted to seize upon a new name, whereby the hearts of all your brethren might have come to take offence",&lt;ref&gt;St&amp;nbsp;Gregory&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Great.

The name continues to be borne by the [[Greek Orthodox]] patriarchs, although with the more restricted sense that they are the bishops of the former imperial capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution =The Universal Patriarch | title =The Witness | volume =XXV, No. 13, August 3/16, 1981 | place=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher =Holy Transfiguration Monastery | url = http://www.homb.org/st_annas/Articles/UniversalPatriarch.pdf | accessdate =2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==

===Religion===
{{main|Ecumenism}}
[[Image:TaizÃ© prayer.JPG|thumb|right|220px|An ecumenical worship service at [[TaizÃ© Community]].]]
Especially in the 20th century, the term has been employed to refer to unified [[Christian Church]] which is the ultimate goal of [[Ecumenism]], a movement to promote cooperation among the various [[Christian denomination]]s. The movement is not accepted by many Christian groups. The work of ecumenism takes place in the form of negotiations conducted between committees of various denominations and also through the deliberations of inter-denominational organizations such as the [[World Council of Churches]]. Relevant issues include [[Baptism]], the [[Eucharist]] and [[Christian ministry|Ministry]].

===Culture===
[[File:Spread of Oecumene Mesopotamia.jpg|thumb|Known world of the Mesopotamian, Babylonian, and Assyrian cultures from documentary sources]]
In the context of [[cultural history]], [[Lewis Mumford]] used the term "ecumene" in an academic sense in his work, ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' (1934).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mumford | first = Lewis | author-link = Lewis Mumford | year = 1934 | title = Technics and Civilization | place = New York | publisher = Harcourt | url = http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/soc/technics.html | accessdate = 2008-01-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080720153921/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/soc/technics.html | archivedate = 2008-07-20 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]]  later popularized it in his [[The Rise of the West | ''Rise of the West'']] (1963), suggesting that a single global ecumene emerged through the dominance of European political institutions, science, technology, and economic forms from the late 18th century onwards. One could argue that prior to the great voyages of discovery carried out by [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Vasco da Gama]], and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], there were originally two separate ecumenesâone covering the [[Old World]] and one the [[New World|New]]. The Spanish [[conquistador]]es fused these two ecumenes to form a single integrated "[[World-systems theory|world system]]".

[[Peter Sloterdijk]] uses the terms "First Ecumene" and "Second Ecumene" in his book ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/01/world-interior-capital-peter-sloterdijk-review In the World Interior of Capital]'' (2014, original German: ''Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals'', 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/860834263|title= In the world interior of capital : for a philosophical theory of globalization|last= 1947-|first= Sloterdijk, Peter,|publisher= |others= Hoban, Wieland,|year= |isbn= 9780745647692|edition = English|location= Cambridge, UK|pages= 143â148|oclc= 860834263}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sloterdijk takes these terms directly from the work of [[Eric Voegelin]], specifically from ''Order and History'' vol. 4, ''The Ecumenic Age'' (1974), &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21151456|title= The collected works of Eric Voegelin|last= 1901-1985.|first= Voegelin, Eric,|date= 2007|origyear= 1989|publisher= [[Louisiana State University Press]]|others= Sandoz, Ellis, 1931-, Weiss, Gilbert,, Petropulos, William,|isbn= 9780826213013|location= Baton Rouge|oclc= 21151456}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2018}} which he quotes.

Note that the term "ecumene" can differ depending on the viewpoint from which it is perceived: for example, the Ancient Babylonians and the Ancient Greeks would each have known a different area of the world (though their worlds may have overlapped). Compare image to the right.

=== Cartography ===
The term is used in [[cartography]] and the historical cartography to describe a type{{which|date=March 2015}} of symbolic, schematic [[world map]] made in [[late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].

The connections and pathways of the internet could be seen as the pathways of [[neurons]] and [[synapse]]s in a global brain]]

The '''global brain''' is a neuroscience-inspired and futurological vision of the planetary [[information and communications technology]] [[computer network|network]] that interconnects all humans and their technological artifacts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heylighen|first1=F.|title=What is the global brain?|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GBRAIFAQ.html|website=Principa Cybernetica Web|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As this network stores ever more [[information]], takes over ever more functions of coordination and communication from traditional organizations, and becomes increasingly [[intelligent]], it increasingly plays the role of a [[brain]] for the planet [[Earth]].

==Basic ideas==
Proponents of the global brain hypothesis claim that the [[Internet]] increasingly ties its users together into a single information processing system that functions as part of the collective [[nervous system]] of the planet. The intelligence of this network is [[collective intelligence|collective]] or [[distributed cognition|distributed]]: it is not centralized or localized in any particular individual, organization or computer system. Therefore, no one can command or control it. Rather, it [[self-organization|self-organizes]] or [[emergence|emerges]] from the [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of [[humanâcomputer interaction|interactions]] between its components. This is a property typical of [[complex adaptive systems]].&lt;ref name=CAS-T-17/&gt;

The [[World-wide web]] in particular resembles the organization of a brain with its webpages (playing a role similar to [[neurons]]) connected by [[hyperlinks]] (playing a role similar to [[synapses]]), together forming an [[Association (psychology)|associative]] network along which information propagates.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"&gt;{{cite conference | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 =  Francis | last2 = Bollen | first2 = J. | date = 1996 | title = The World-Wide Web as a Super-Brain: from metaphor to model | editor-first = R. | editor-last = Trappl  | conference = Cybernetics and Systems' 96 | publisher = Austrian Society For Cybernetics | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/WWW-Super-Brain.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy becomes stronger with the rise of [[social media]], such as [[Facebook]], where links between personal pages represent relationships in a [[social network]] along which information propagates from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weinbaum | first = D. | date = 2012 | title = A Framework for Scalable Cognition: Propagation of challenges, towards the implementation of Global Brain models | publisher = GBI working paper 2012-02 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ECCO/ECCO-Papers/Weaver-Attention.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such propagation is similar to the [[spreading activation]] that [[neural networks]] in the brain use to process information in a parallel, distributed manner.

==History==
Although some of the underlying ideas were already expressed by [[Nikola Tesla]] in the late 19th century and were written about by many others before him,  the term âglobal brainâ was coined in 1982 by [[Peter Russell (writer)|Peter Russell]] in his book ''The Global Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Peter Russell (physicist) | last = Russell | first = P. | date = 1983 | title = The Global Brain: speculations on the evolutionary leap to planetary consciousness | location = Los Angeles | publisher = JP Tarcher }}&lt;/ref&gt; How the Internet might be developed to achieve this was set out in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Andrews | first = D. | date =  February 1986 | title = Information routeing groups â Towards the global superbrain: or how to find out what you need to know rather than what you think you need to know | journal = Journal of Information Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22â35 | doi=10.1057/jit.1986.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first peer-reviewed article on the subject was published by [[Gottfried Mayer-Kress]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer-Kress | first1 = G. | last2 = Barczys | first2 = C. | date = 1995 | title = The global brain as an emergent structure from the Worldwide Computing Network, and its implications for modeling | journal = The information society | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1â27 | url = http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | doi = 10.1080/01972243.1995.9960177 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120907044231/http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | archivedate = 2012-09-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the first [[algorithms]] that could turn the world-wide web into a collectively intelligent network were proposed by [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Johan Bollen]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Bollen | first1 = J. | authorlink2 = Francis Heylighen | last2 = Heylighen | first2 = Francis | date = 1996 | title = Algorithms for the self-organization of distributed, multi-user networks.

Reviewing the strands of intellectual history that contributed to the global brain hypothesis, [[Francis Heylighen]] distinguishes four perspectives: ''âorganicismâ'', ''âencyclopedismâ'', ''âemergentismâ'' and ''âevolutionary cyberneticsâ''. He asserts that these developed in relative independence but now are converging in his own scientific re-formulation.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 = Francis | date = 2011 | chapterurl = http://pcp.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-conceptions-Rodrigue.pdf | chapter = Conceptions of a Global Brain: an historical review | title = Evolution: Cosmic, Biological, and Social | editor1-last = Grinin | editor1-first = L.

=== Organicism ===
In the 19th century, the sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] saw society as a [[social organism]] and reflected about its need for a nervous system. Entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler|William Wheeler]] developed the concept of the ant colony as a spatially extended organism, and in the 1930s he coined the term [[superorganism]] to describe such an entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = William Morton Wheeler | last = Wheeler | first = William | date = 1911 | title = The Ant Colony as an Organism | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 22 | pages = 307â325 | doi=10.1002/jmor.1050220206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later adopted by thinkers such as [[Gregory Stock]] in his book [[Metaman]] and [[Joel de Rosnay]] to describe planetary society as a superorganism.

The mental aspects of such an organic system at the planetary level were perhaps first broadly elaborated by palaeontologist and Jesuit priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. In 1945, he described a coming âplanetisationâ of humanity, which he saw as the next phase of accelerating human âsocialisationâ. Teilhard described both socialization and planetization as irreversible, irresistible processes of ''macrobiological development'' culminating in the emergence of a [[noosphere]], or global mind (see Emergentism below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap VII â The Planetisation of Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent [[living systems theory]] describes both organisms and social systems in terms of the "critical subsystems" ("organs") they need to contain in order to survive, such as an internal transport system, a resource reserve, and a decision-making system. This theory has inspired several thinkers, including Peter Russell and Francis Heylighen to define the global brain as the network of information processing subsystems for the planetary social system.

=== Encyclopedism ===
In the perspective of encyclopedism, the emphasis is on developing a universal knowledge network. The first systematic attempt to create such an integrated system of the world's knowledge was the 18th century ''[[EncyclopÃ©die]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. However, by the end of the 19th century, the amount of knowledge had become too large to be published in a single synthetic volume. To tackle this problem, [[Paul Otlet]] founded the science of documentation, now called [[information science]]. In the 1930s he envisaged a [[World Wide Web]]-like system of associations between documents and telecommunication links that would make all the world's knowledge available immediately to anybody. [[H. G. Wells]] proposed a similar vision of a collaboratively developed world encyclopedia that would be constantly updated by a global university-like institution. He called this a [[World Brain]], as it would function as a continuously updated memory for the planet, although the image of humanity acting informally as a more organic global brain is a recurring motif in other of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=H.G. Wells | title=The New Machiavelli| quote="But the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's brains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great brain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was thinking them! ... And then I came back as if I came back to a refrain; â the ideas go on â as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in some great brain beyond our understanding...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], too, was inspired by the free-associative possibilities of the brain for his invention. The brain can link different kinds of information without any apparent link otherwise; Berners-Lee thought that computers could become much more powerful if they could imitate this functioning, i.e. make links between any arbitrary piece of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Berners-Lee|1999|pp=4, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful implementation of encyclopedism to date is Wikipedia, which integrates the associative powers of the world-wide-web with the collective intelligence of its millions of contributors, approaching the ideal of a global memory.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"/&gt; The [[Semantic web]], also first proposed by Berners-Lee, is a system of protocols to make the pieces of knowledge and their links readable by machines, so that they could be used to make automatic [[inference]]s, thus providing this brain-like network with some capacity for autonomous "thinking" or reflection.

=== Emergentism ===
This approach focuses on the emergent aspects of the evolution and development of [[complexity]], including the spiritual, psychological, and moral-ethical aspects of the global brain, and is at present the most speculative approach. The global brain is here seen as a natural and emergent process of planetary evolutionary development. Here again [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] attempted a synthesis of science, social values, and religion in his [[The Phenomenon of Man]], which argues that the ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' (drive, purpose) of universal evolutionary process is the development of greater levels of both complexity and consciousness. Teilhard proposed that if life persists then planetization, as a biological process producing a global brain, would necessarily also produce a global mind, a new level of planetary consciousness and a technologically supported network of thoughts which he called the ''[[noosphere]]''. Teilhard's proposed technological layer for the noosphere can be interpreted as an early anticipation of the Internet and the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap X â The Formation of the Noosphere }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist and philosopher [[Peter Russell (physicist)|Peter Russell]] elaborates a similar view, and stresses the importance of personal spiritual growth, in order to build and to achieve synergy with the spiritual dimension of the emerging superorganism. This approach is most popular in [[New Age]] circles, which emphasize growth in consciousness rather than scientific modelling or the implementation of technological and social systems.

===Evolutionary cybernetics===
[[Systems theory|Systems theorists]] and [[cybernetics|cyberneticists]] commonly describe the emergence of a higher order system in evolutionary development as a â[[metasystem transition]]â (a concept introduced by [[Valentin Turchin]]) or a âmajor evolutionary transitionâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The major evolutionary transitions | authorlink1 = EÃ¶rs SzathmÃ¡ry | first1 = EÃ¶rs | last1 = SzathmÃ¡ry | authorlink2 = John Maynard Smith | first2 = John | last2 = Maynard Smith | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 374 | pages = 227â232 | date = 16 March 1995 | doi = 10.1038/374227a0 | pmid=7885442| bibcode = 1995Natur.374..227S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a metasystem consists of a group of subsystems that work together in a coordinated, goal-directed manner. It is as such much more powerful and intelligent than its constituent systems. [[Francis Heylighen]] has argued that the global brain is an emerging metasystem with respect to the level of individual human intelligence, and investigated the specific evolutionary mechanisms that promote this transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2008 | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf | chapter = Accelerating socio-technological evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain | title = Globalization as evolutionary process: modeling global change | publisher = Routledge | page = 284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scenario, the Internet fulfils the role of the network of ânervesâ that interconnect the subsystems and thus coordinates their activity. The cybernetic approach makes it possible to develop mathematical models and simulations of the processes of [[self-organization]] through which such coordination and [[collective intelligence]] emerges.

== Recent developments ==
In 1994 [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], in his popular book ''[[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of Control]]'', posited the emergence of a "[[Collective consciousness|hive mind]]" from a discussion of cybernetics and evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=ooc&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Addison-Wesley| isbn = 0201577933| authorlink = Kevin Kelly (editor) | last = Kelly | first = Kevin| title = [[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization]]| location = Reading, Mass| date = 1994| pages = 5â28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Ben Goertzel]] founded the Global Brain group, a discussion forum grouping most of the researchers that had been working on the subject of the global brain to further investigate this phenomenon. The group organized the first international conference on the topic in 2001 at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

After a period of relative neglect, the Global Brain idea has recently seen a resurgence in interest, in part due to talks given on the topic by [[Tim O'Reilly]], the Internet forecaster who popularized the term [[Web 2.0]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | authorlink = Tim O'Reilly | first = Tim | last = O'Reilly | url = http://www.greenbiz.com/video/2012/03/22/towards-global-brain?ms=42144 | title = Towards a Global Brain | series = One Great Idea | date = March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yuri Milner]], the social media investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Chrystia | last = Freeland | website = blogs.reuters.com | url = http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/09/23/the-advent-of-the-global-brain/ | title = The advent of the global brain }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the Global Brain Institute (GBI) was founded at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] to develop a mathematical theory of the âbrainlikeâ propagation of information across the Internet. In the same year, [[Thomas W. Malone]] and collaborators from the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]]  have started to explore how the global brain could be âprogrammedâ to work more effectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Klein | first2 = M. | authorlink3 = Thomas W. Malone | last3 = Malone | first3 = Thomas W. | date = 2012 | title = Programming the Global Brain | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | page = 41 | url = http://cci.mit.edu/publications/CCIwp2011-04.pdf | doi=10.1145/2160718.2160731}}&lt;/ref&gt; using mechanisms of [[collective intelligence]]. The complexity scientist [[Dirk Helbing]] and his NervousNet group have recently started developing a "Planetary Nervous System", which includes a "Global Participatory Platform", as part of the large-scale [[FuturICT]] project, thus preparing some of the groundwork for a Global Brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Dirk Helbing | last1 = Helbing | first1 = Dirk | date = 2015 | chapter = Creating (âMakingâ) a Planetary Nervous System as Citizen Web | title = Thinking Ahead â Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society | pages = 189â194 | publisher = Springer International Publishing | chapterurl = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15078-9_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 [[Elon Musk]] founded the company [[Neuralink]], which aims to create a Neural Lace, which is a concept invented by the novelist [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]] and basically refers to a machine interface woven into the brain, to allow the user to access all available human information. A core driver behind this business idea is Mr Muskâs argument, that human beings soon have to embrace brain implants to stay relevant in a world which, he believes, will soon be dominated by [[artificial intelligence]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21719774-do-human-beings-need-embrace-brain-implants-stay-relevant-elon-musk-enters|title=Elon Musk enters the world of brain-computer interfaces|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm raised $27m from 12 Investors in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-startup-a7916891.html|title=Elon Musk could be about to spend $100m linking human brains to computers|date=2017-08-28|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==
A common criticism of the idea that humanity would become directed by a global brain is that this would reduce individual diversity and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rayward | first = W. B. | date = 1999 | title = H. G.

It is also inspired by the analogy between collective intelligence or [[swarm intelligence]] and [[insect societies]], such as beehives and ant colonies, in which individuals are essentially interchangeable. In a more extreme view, the global brain has been compared with the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goertzel | first = Ben | date = 2002 | title = Creating Internet Intelligence: Wild computing, distributed digital consciousness, and the emerging global brain | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers | url = {{google books|id=Vnzb-xLdvv8C|plainurl=yes}} | isbn = 9780306467356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the race of collectively thinking cyborgs conceived by the [[Star Trek]] science fiction franchise.

Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles â [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] â and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system â the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components â it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid â a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35984">'''Global commons''' is a term typically used to describe international, supranational, and global [[natural resources|resource]] domains in which [[common-pool resource]]s are found. Global [[commons]] include the earth's shared natural resources, such as the high [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and [[outer space]] and the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/delc/GlobalCommons/tabid/54404/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyberspace]] may also meet the definition of a global commons.

==Definition and usage==
"Global commons" is a term typically used to describe [[international]], [[supranational]], and global resource domains in which common-pool resources are found. In [[economics]], [[Common good (economics)|common goods]] are [[Rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]] and [[Excludability|non-excludable]], constituting one of the four main types of [[Good (economics)|goods]].&lt;ref&gt;For current definitions of public goods see any mainstream microeconomics textbook, e.g.: Hal R. Varian, ''Microeconomic Analysis'' {{ISBN|0-393-95735-7}}; [[Andreu Mas-Colell|Mas-Colell]], Whinston &amp; Green,  ''Microeconomic Theory'' {{ISBN|0-19-507340-1}}; or Gravelle &amp; Rees, ''Microeconomics'' {{ISBN|0-582-40487-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[common-pool resource]], also called a common property resource, is a special case of a common good (or [[public good]]) whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential users.  Examples include both natural or human-made resource domains (e.g., a "fishing hole" or an irrigation system). Unlike [[global public good]]s, global common-pool resources face problems of congestion, overuse, or degradation because they are subtractable (which makes them [[rivalrous]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0 521 40599 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "commons" originates from the term [[common land]] in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=neeson |first=Jeanette M. |last=Neeson |title=Commoners: Common Right, Enclosure and Social Change in England, 1700â1820 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1996 |ISBN=978-0521567749}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Commoners rights" referred to traditional rights held by commoners, such as [[mowing]] [[meadow]]s for [[hay]] or [[grazing]] [[livestock]] on common land held in the [[open field system]] of old [[English common law]].  [[Enclosure]] was the process that ended those traditional rights, converting open fields to [[private property]].  Today, many commons still exist in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and the [[United States]], although their extent is much reduced from the millions of acres that existed until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |last=Callander |first=Robin Fraser |year=1987 |title=A pattern of Landownership in Scotland: With Particular Reference to Aberdeenshire |place=Finzean |publisher=Haughend |oclc=60041593}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are still over 7,000 registered commons in England alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls DEFRA Database of registered common land in England] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129020728/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls |date=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "global commons" is typically used to indicate the earth's shared natural resources, such as the deep [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[outer space]] and the Northern and Southern [[polar region]]s, the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Global Environmental Politics (2nd edition) |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location=Cheltenham, UK |author=Dauvergne, Peter (ed.) |year=2012 |isbn=978-1849809405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''World Conservation Strategy'', a report on conservation published by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) in collaboration with [[UNESCO]] and with the support of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF):
{{quote|"A commons is  a tract of land or water owned or used jointly by the members of a community. The global commons includes those parts of the Earth's surface beyond [[Jurisdiction#National|national jurisdictions]]&amp;nbsp;â notably the open ocean and the living resources found there&amp;nbsp;â or held in common&amp;nbsp;â notably the atmosphere. The only landmass that may be regarded as part of the global commons is Antarctica ..."&lt;ref name="WCS"&gt;[http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/WCS-004.pdf " Chapter 18, The global commons." ''World Conservation Strategy'', International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, accessed 22 May 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Today, the [[Internet]], [[World Wide Web]] and resulting [[cyberspace]] are often referred to as global commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cigionline.org/publications/2012/10/internet-global-commons Raymond, Mark (2012). "The Internet as a Global Commons?" ''Governing the Internet: Chaos, Control or Consensus?'' The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other usages sometimes include references to open access information of all kinds, including arts and culture, language and science, though these are more formally referred to as the [[common heritage of mankind]].&lt;ref&gt;Baslar, Kemal (1998).

==Management of the global commons==
The key challenge of the global commons is the design of governance structures and management systems capable of addressing the complexity of multiple public and private interests, subject to often unpredictable changes, ranging from the local to the global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Global Environmental Commons: Analytical and Political Challenges in Building Governance Mechanisms |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Brousseau, Eric |year=2012 |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0199656202 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with global public goods, management of the global commons requires pluralistic legal entities, usually international and supranational, public and private, structured to match the diversity of interests and the type of resource to be managed, and stringent enough with adequate incentives to ensure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=International Law and Global Public Goods in a Legal Pluralist World |author=Shaffer, Gregory |journal=European Journal of International Law |date=August 2012 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=669â693 |doi=10.1093/ejil/chs036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such management systems are necessary to avoid, at the global level, the classic [[tragedy of the commons]], in which common resources become [[overexploited]].&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |year=1968 |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243â1248 |pmid=5699198 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H}} Also available here [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several key differences in management of resources in the global commons from those of the commons, in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc/article/view/305/229 |title=Design principles for global commons: natural resources and emerging technologies |author=Stern, Paul C |journal=International Journal of the Commons |volume=5 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level.  Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools are less likely to be relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of [[unintended consequences]] that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the [[carbon dioxide emissions]] that drive [[climate change]] continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Irreversible Climate Change Due to Carbon Dioxide Emissions. |author=Solomon, S. |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2009 |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1704â1709 |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.1704S |doi=10.1073/pnas.0812721106 |pmid=19179281 |pmc=2632717 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and species extinctions last forever.  Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at the global level, there are significant differences in [[externalities]] between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.

Several [[environmental protocol]]s have been established (see [[List of international environmental agreements]]) as a type of [[international law]], "an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources."&lt;ref&gt;Kanie, Norichike (2007). "Governance with Multi-lateral Environmental Agreements: A healthy or ill-equipped fragmentation?" ''Global Environmental Governance: Perspectives on the Current Debate'', Walter Hoffmann and Lydia Swart (eds.): 67-86. New York: Center for UN Reform Education.&lt;/ref&gt; International environmental protocols came to feature in [[environmental governance]] after trans-boundary [[pollution|environmental problems]] became widely perceived in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;Haas, Keohane and Levy (1993). ''Institutions for the Earth: Sources of effective international environmental protection.'' Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference]] in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated.&lt;ref name="zurn"&gt;ZÃ¼rn, Michael (1998). "The Rise of International Environmental Politics: A Review of Current Research."  ''World Politics'', 50(4):617-649.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are not a panacea for global commons issues.  Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the [[lowest common denominator]], and lack monitoring and enforcement. They also take an incremental approach to solutions where [[sustainable development]] principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.

===The global ocean===
{{Main article|World ocean|Water cycle}}

The global or [[world ocean]], as the interconnected system of the [[Earth]]'s [[ocean]]ic (or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]]) [[water]]s that comprise the bulk of the [[hydrosphere]], is a classic global commons.  It is divided into a number of principal oceanic areas that are delimited by the [[continent]]s and various oceanographic features.  In turn, oceanic waters are interspersed by many smaller seas, gulfs, and bays.  Further, most freshwater bodies ultimately empty into the ocean and are derived through the Earth's [[water cycle]] from ocean waters.  The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]] is a body of [[public international law]] governing relationships between nations in respect to navigational rights, [[mineral rights]], and jurisdiction over coastal waters.  Maritime law, also called [[Admiralty law]], is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities and [[Conflict of laws|private international law]] governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans. It deals with matters including marine commerce, [[marine navigation]], [[shipping]], [[sailor]]s, and the transportation of passengers and goods by sea. However, these bodies of law do little to nothing to protect deep oceans from human threats.

In addition to providing significant means of transportation, a large proportion of all [[life]] on Earth exists in its ocean, which contains about 300 times the habitable volume of terrestrial habitats.  Specific marine habitats include [[coral reef]]s, [[kelp forest]]s, [[seagrass meadow]]s, [[tidepool]]s, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean ([[pelagic]]) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] to huge [[cetaceans]] (whales) 30 [[meters]] (98 [[foot (length)|feet]]) in length.

At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine life resources provide food (especially [[fishery|food fish]]), medicines, and raw materials. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the [[carbon cycle]]) and of air (such as [[Global climate model|Earth's respiration]], and movement of energy through [[ecosystem]]s including the ocean). Marine organisms contribute significantly to the [[oxygen cycle]], and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's [[climate]].&lt;ref name="DMS"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm3h1q666x206h46 |title=Planktonic dimethylsulfide and cloud albedo: An estimate of the feedback response |author=Foley, Jonathan A., Karl E.

The United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]) has identified several areas of need in managing the global ocean: strengthen national capacities for action, especially in developing countries; improve fisheries management;     reinforce cooperation in semi-enclosed and regional seas; strengthen controls over ocean disposal of hazardous and nuclear wastes; and advance the Law of the Sea. Specific problems identified as in need of attention include [[Current sea level rise|rising sea levels]]; [[Marine pollution|contamination]] by hazardours chemicals (including oil spills); microbiological contamination; ocean acidification; [[Algal bloom#Harmful algal blooms|harmful algal blooms]]; and [[over-fishing]] and other [[overexploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4/report/10_Placing_Environment_at_the_Core.pdf |title=Global environment outlook: environment for development (GEO4) |publisher=World Commission on Environment and Development, The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). |authorlink=Section F,  Chapter 10: From the Periphery to the Core of Decision Making â Options for Action |year=2007 |isbn=978-9280728361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] Environmental Initiative program has identified a need for a worldwide system of very large, highly protected marine reserves where fishing and other extractive activities are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewenvironment.org/campaigns/global-ocean-legacy/id/8589941025 |title=Global Ocean Legacy |publisher=Environmental Initiative, Pew Charitable Trusts |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmosphere===
{{Main article|Air pollution|Climate change|Global warming}}

The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. A primary concern for management of the global atmosphere is [[air pollution]], the introduction into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] of [[chemical]]s, [[particulates]], or [[biomolecule|biological materials]] that cause discomfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as food crops, or damage the [[natural environment]] or [[built environment]]. [[Stratosphere|Stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's [[ecosystems]].

Pollution of breathable [[Air pollution|air]] is a central problem in the management of the global commons. Pollutants can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and may be natural or man-made.  Although controversial and limited in scope by methods of enforcement, in several parts of the world the [[polluter pays principle]], which makes the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]], is accepted. It has strong support in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Community]] (EC) countries. It is also known as extended producer responsibility (EPR). EPR seeks to shift the responsibility dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it attempts to internalise the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically resulting in producers improving the [[Waste management|waste profile]] of their products, decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for [[reuse]] and [[recycling]].

The 1979 [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]], or CLRTAP, is an early international effort to protect and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. It is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), directed by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE).  The [[Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]], or Montreal Protocol (a protocol to the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]]), is an international [[treaty]] designed to protect the [[ozone layer]] by phasing out the production of numerous substances believed to be responsible for [[ozone depletion]]. The treaty was opened for signature on 16 September 1987, and entered into force on 1 January 1989.

[[Global dimming]] is the gradual reduction in the amount of global direct [[irradiance]] at the [[Earth]]'s surface, which has been observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. Global dimming is thought to have been caused by an increase in [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[sulfate aerosol]]s in the atmosphere due to human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter7.pdf |title=Couplings between changes in Climate System and the Biogeochemistry, 7.5.3 |author1=Keneth L. Denman |author2=Guy Brasseur |publisher=IPCC |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-04-09 |format=PDF |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has interfered with the  [[hydrological cycle]] by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a [[global cooling|cooling]] effect that may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gas]]es on [[global warming]].

Along with global warming, generalized [[climate change]] is an ongoing global commons concern.  Although global warming is now a generally accepted scientific observation, the precise causes of global warming are still a matter of research and debate. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) is an international environmental treaty that sets binding obligations on industrialised countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and prevent potentially harmful anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) interference in the climate system.&lt;ref name="unfccc2005"&gt;{{cite web |title=Article 2 |work=The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. |quote=Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner |url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |accessdate=15 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028023600/http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |archivedate=28 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 192 parties to the convention, including 191 states and the [[European Union]], but not all have ratified and implemented the protocol.&lt;ref name=UNamend&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=21 January 2013 |work=United Nations |url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |title=7.c Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114190559/http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar regions===
{{Main article|Polar regions|Climate change in the Arctic|Antarctic cooling controversy}}

The eight Arctic nations  [[Canada]],  [[Denmark]] ( [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]),  [[Norway]], the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Sweden]], [[Finland]],  [[Iceland]], and [[Russia]], are all members of the treaty organization, the [[Arctic Council]], as are organizations representing six [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]]. The Council operates on consensus basis, mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |title=Chronological lists of ratifications of, accessions and successions to the Convention and the related Agreements |publisher=United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414043900/http://www.un.org/depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |archivedate=14 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the [[Antarctic Treaty]] and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System or ATS, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to [[Antarctica]], Earth's only continent without a native human population. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and currently having 50 signatory nations, sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans [[Military activity in the Antarctic|military activity on that continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |title=Information about the Antarctic Treaty and how Antarctica is governed. |accessdate=February 6, 2011 |date=December 28, 2005 |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308064504/http://www.polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |archivedate=March 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change in the Arctic region is leading to widespread ecosystem restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Footprints of climate change in the Arctic marine ecosystem. |author=Wassmann, P. |journal=Global Change Biology |year=2011 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=1235â1249 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02311.x |display-authors=etal|bibcode=2011GCBio..17.1235W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of species is changing along with the structure of food webs. Changes in ocean circulation appear responsible for the first exchanges of zooplankton between the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions in perhaps 800,000 years. These changes can allow the transmission of diseases from subarctic animals to Arctic ones, and vice versa, posing an additional threat to species already stressed by habitat loss and other impacts. Where these changes lead is not yet clear, but are likely to have far-reaching impacts on Arctic marine ecosystems.

===Outer space===
{{Main article|Outer space|Space law}}

Management of [[outer space]] global commons has been contentious since the successful launch of the [[Sputnik]] satellite by the former [[Soviet Union]] on 4 October 1957.  There is no clear boundary between [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, although there are several standard boundary designations: one that deals with [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]] (the [[KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line]]), one that depends on the velocity of charged particles in space, and some that are determined by human factors such as the height at which human blood begins to boil without a pressurized environment (the [[Armstrong line]]).

[[Space policy]] regarding a country's [[List of space agencies|civilian space program]], as well as its policy on both [[Militarisation of space|military use]] and [[Commercialization of space|commercial use]] of outer space, intersects with [[science policy]], since national space programs often perform or [[Funding of science|fund research]] in [[space science]], and also with [[defense policy]], for applications such as [[spy satellite]]s and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s.  It also encompasses government regulation of third-party activities such as commercial [[communications satellite]]s and [[private spaceflight]]&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Nathan C. |title=Space Policy:An Introduction |year=1992 |publisher=Iowa State University Press |location=Ames, IA |isbn=0-8138-1024-8 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the creation and application of [[space law]] and [[space advocacy]] organizations that exist to support the cause of space exploration.

The [[Outer Space Treaty]] provides a basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national [[sovereignty]]. It also prohibits the deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s in outer space. The treaty was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of mid-year, 2013 the treaty has been ratified by 102 states and signed by an additional 27 states.

Beginning in 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have concerned the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional [[space law]] treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. Still, there remain no legal prohibitions against deploying conventional weapons in space and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 [[Moon Treaty]] turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.

In 1976 eight equatorial states ([[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Republic of Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Zaire]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Indonesia]]) met in [[BogotÃ¡]], Colombia to make the "Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries," also known as "the BogotÃ¡ Declaration", a claim to control the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country. These claims are not internationally accepted.

The [[International Space Station program]]me is a joint project among five participating space agencies: [[NASA]], the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (RSA), [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA). National budget constraints led to the merger of three space station projects into the [[International Space Station]]. In 1993 the partially built components for a Soviet/Russian space station [[Mir-2]], the proposed American [[Space Station Freedom|Freedom]], and the proposed European [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] merged into this multinational programme.&lt;ref name="ISSBook"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0387781440 |date=17 June 2008 |publisher=Springer-Praxis |author=John E. Catchpole |title=The International Space Station: Building for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The ISS is arguably the most expensive single item ever constructed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical.whatitcosts.com/facts-space-station.htm|title=How Much the International Space Station (ISS) Cost to Build|author=|date=14 April 2016|website=whatitcosts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be one of the most significant instances of international cooperation in modern history.

According to the original Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the RSA, the International Space Station was intended to be a laboratory, observatory and factory in space. It was also planned to provide transportation, maintenance, and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars and asteroids. In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, it was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Payette |first=Julie |title=Research and Diplomacy 350 Kilometers above the Earth: Lessons from the International Space Station |journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy |date=10 December 2012 |volume=1 |issue=4 |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2012/research-and-diplomacy-350-kilometers-above-earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and educational purposes.&lt;ref name=USNSP&gt;{{cite web |title=National Space Policy of the United States of America |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |publisher=White House; USA Federal government |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711205103/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
{{Main article|Digital commons (economics)}}

As a global system of [[computer]]s interconnected by [[telecommunication]] technologies consisting of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government resources, it is difficult to argue that the [[Internet]] is a global commons.  These computing resources are largely privately owned and subject to [[private property]] law, although many are government owned and subject to [[public law]]. The [[World Wide Web]], as a system of interlinked [[hypertext]] documents, either [[public domain]] (like Wikipedia itself) or subject to [[copyright law]], is, at best, a mixed [[good (economics)|good]].

The resultant [[Virtuality|virtual]] space or [[cyberspace]], however, is often viewed as an electronic global commons that allows for as much or more [[freedom of expression]] as any [[public space]]. Access to those [[Digital commons (economics)|digital commons]] and the actual freedom of expression allowed does vary widely by geographical area.  Management of the electronic global commons presents as many issues as do other commons.  In addition to issues related to [[digital divide|inequity in access]], issues such as [[net neutrality]], [[Internet censorship]], [[Internet privacy]], and electronic [[surveillance]] arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Governance of Cyberspace: Politics, Technology and Global Restructuring |publisher=Routledge |author=Loader, Brian D |year=2004 |isbn=978-0415147248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1901 Eastern Telegraph cables.png|300px|thumb|[[Eastern Telegraph]] cable network in 1901]]
A '''global network''' is any [[communication network]] which spans the entire [[Earth]]. The term, as used in this article refers in a more restricted way to ''bidirectional'' communication networks, and to technology-based networks. Early networks such as [[international mail]] and unidirectional communication networks, such as [[radio network|radio]] and [[television network|television]], are described elsewhere.

The first global network was established using [[electrical telegraph]]y and global span was achieved in 1899. The [[public switched telephone network|telephony network]] was the second to achieve global status, in the 1950s. More recently, interconnected [[IP network]]s (principally the [[Internet]], with estimated 2.5 billion users worldwide in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;http://export.gov/northcarolina/build/groups/public/@eg_us_nc/documents/webcontent/komarketingpresentation065541.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[GSM]] [[mobile communication]] network (with over 6 billion worldwide users in 2014) form the largest global networks of all.

Setting up global networks requires immensely costly and lengthy efforts lasting for decades. Elaborate interconnections, [[Telephone exchange|switching]] and [[routing]] devices, laying out physical carriers of information, such as land and [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]] and [[earth station]]s must be set in operation. In addition, international [[communication protocol]]s, legislation and agreements are involved.

Global networks might also refer to networks of individuals (such as [[Scientific collaboration network|scientists]]), communities (such as [[city network|cities]]) and organizations (such as [[Civil society#Global|civil organizations]]) worldwide which, for instance, might have formed for the management, mitigation and resolval of [[global issue]]s.

==Satellite global networks==

[[Communication satellite]]s are an important part of global networks. However, there are specific [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) global [[satellite constellation]]s, such as [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]], [[Globalstar]] and [[Orbcomm]], which are comprised by dozens of similar satellites which are put in orbit at regularly spaced positions and form a [[mesh network]], sometimes sending and receiving information directly among themselves. Using [[VSAT]] technology, [[satellite internet access]] has become possible.

==Mobile wireless networks==

It is estimated that 80% of the global mobile market uses the GSM standard, present in more than 212 countries and territories. Its [[wikt:ubiquity|ubiquity]] makes international [[roaming]] very common between mobile phone operators, enabling subscribers to use their phones in many parts of the world. In order to achieve this, these networks must be interconnected by way of [[peering]] arrangements, and therefore the GSM network is a truly global one.

==Network interconnection==

The telegraph and [[telex]] communication networks have been phased out, so [[interconnection]] among existing global networks arise at several points, such as between the voice [[telephony]] and digital [[data network]]s, and between these and satellite networks. Many applications run now on several networks, such as [[VoIP]] (voice over IP). [[Mobile communication]] (voice and data) networks are also intimately intertwinned, because the majority of 21st century [[cell phone]]s have both voice and data (internet navigation and [[email]]ing) capabilities.

Digital global networks require huge carrying capacity in the main [[internet backbone|backbone]]s. This is currently achieved by [[fiber optic cable]]s.

==Social and economic impact==
The Canadian [[sociologist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] was the first to forecast the huge impact of the matrix of global networks upon [[society]], coining the term [[global village (term)|global village]]. His work, however, related to radio and television networks, which are [[broadcast]] (unidirectional) networks, thus predating the much larger impact of the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Harasim, L. (Ed.) - [https://books.google.com/books?id=9RAnJzaiqvMC Global Networks: Computers and International Networks, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

Global networks have revolutionized human communication several times. The first to do so was the electrical telegraph. Its impact was so large that it has been dubbed the [[Victorian Internet]]. It was expanded many times in its coverage with the advent of [[radiotelegraphy]], and with text messaging using [[telex]] machines.

The Internet and mobile communication networks have made possible entirely new forms of [[social interaction]], activities and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread [[usability]] and access, and instant communication from any connected point to another. Thus, its [[Internet#Social impact|social impact]] has been, and still is, enormous. Finally, the impact on governance have been significant facilitating the emergence of 'transnational policy networks' &lt;ref&gt;Stone, Diane. Knowledge actors and transnational governance: The private-public policy nexus in the global agora. Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Global news flow''' (also referred to as '''international news flow''') is a field of study that deals with the news coverage of events in foreign countries.

The unequal representation of the world and the under-representation of [[developing countries]] have been already of a great concern at least since the 1950s, since they influence the way people perceive the world and the image of countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (1954). How Nations See Each Other? Paris: UNESCO Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was later addressed in the [[MacBride report]], and his set of recommendations for a [[New World Information and Communication Order]]. The unequal representation of the world has been also linked to the [[World System Theory]], and the unequal economic structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, T. K. (1998).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40567">'''International broadcasting''' is [[broadcasting]] that is deliberately aimed at a foreign, rather than a domestic, audience. It usually is broadcast by means of [[longwave]], [[mediumwave]], or (more usually) [[shortwave]] radio, but in recent years has also used direct [[satellite]] broadcasting and the [[internet]] as means of reaching audiences.

Although radio and television programs do travel outside national borders, in many cases reception by foreigners is accidental. However, for purposes of [[propaganda]], transmitting religious beliefs, keeping in touch with colonies or expatriates, education, improving trade, increasing national prestige, or promoting tourism and goodwill, broadcasting services have operated '''external services''' since the 1920s.

== History ==
International broadcasting, in a limited extent, began during [[World War I]], when German and British stations broadcast press communiquÃ©s using [[Morse code]]. With the severing of Germany's undersea cables, the wireless telegraph station in [[Nauen]] was the country's sole means of long-distance communication.

The US Navy Radio Service radio station in New Brunswick, Canada, transmitted the '[[Fourteen Points]]' by wireless to Nauen in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 56&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Nauen station broadcast the news of the abdication of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] on November 10, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Printing Office. ''International Law Documents: Neutrality, Conduct and Conclusion of Hostilities''. 1919, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi 1901 wireless signal.jpg|thumb|[[Guglielmo Marconi]] carried out the first short wave transmissions over a long distance.]]
[[Guglielmo Marconi]] pioneered the use of [[short wave]] radio for long distance transmissions in the early 1920s. Using a system of parabolic reflector antennae, Marconi's assistant, [[Charles Samuel Franklin]], rigged up a large antenna at [[Poldhu|Poldhu Wireless Station]], [[Cornwall]], running on 25&amp;nbsp;kW of power. In June and July 1923, wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi's yacht ''Elettra'' in the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]].&lt;ref name="Bray"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC|title=Innovation and the Communications Revolution: From the Victorian Pioneers to Broadband Internet|author=John Bray|year=2002|publisher=IET|pages=73â75}}&lt;/ref&gt; High speed shortwave telegraphy circuits were then installed from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]] from 1926.&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt;

The Dutch began conducting experiments in the shortwave frequencies in 1925 from [[Eindhoven]]. The radio station [[PCJJ]] began the first international broadcasting on March 11, 1927 with programmes in Dutch for colonies in the [[Dutch West Indies]] and [[Dutch East Indies]] and in German, Spanish and English for the rest of the world. The popular [[Happy Station]] show was inaugurated in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bureauafrique.nl/autresdepartements/africa/Radionetherlandsturns60/aboutrnw_history ''History of Radio Netherlands''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228214010/http://www.bureauafrique.nl/autresdepartements/africa/Radionetherlandsturns60/aboutrnw_history |date=2009-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Marconi also turned his attention toward long distance broadcasting on shortwave. His first such broadcasts took place to commemorate [[Armistice Day]] in the same year. He continued running a regular international broadcast that was picked up around the world, with programming from the [[2LO]] station, then run by the [[BBC]]. The success of this operation caught the BBC's attention, and rented out a shortwave transmitting station in [[Chelmsford]], with the callsign G5SW, to Marconi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/Wavescan/wavescan090920.html|title=Daventry Calling - 2: Station G5SW Chelmsford }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC Empire Service]] was finally inaugurated on December 19, 1932, with transmissions aimed towards Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;BBC World Service. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/timeline.shtml ''World Service timeline''].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===
Other notable early international broadcasters included [[Vatican Radio]] (February 12, 1931), [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]], the official service of the Soviet Union (this has since been renamed the [[Voice of Russia]], following the collapse of the Soviet Union). Clarence W. Jones started transmitting on Christmas Day, 1931 from Christian missionary radio station [[HCJB]] in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]. Broadcasting in South Asia was launched in 1925 in [[Ceylon]] - [[Radio Ceylon]], now the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] is the oldest in the region.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17049, Joseph Goebbels spricht.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Joseph Goebbels]] headed [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]]. International broadcasting was an important element in [[Nazi propaganda]].]]
Shortwave broadcasting from [[Nauen]] in Germany to the USA, Central and South America, and the Far East began in 1926. A second station, [[Zeesen short-wave transmitter (1931)|Zeesen]], was added in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 49&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1932, the German [[Reichspost]] assumed control of the Nauen station and added to its shortwave and longwave capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000:57&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[Adolf Hitler]] assumed power in 1933, shortwave, under the ''Auslandsrundfunk'' (Foreign Radio Section), was regarded as a vital element of [[Nazi propaganda]].

German shortwave hours were increased from two hours a day to 18 per day, and eventually twelve languages were broadcast on a 24-hour basis, including English. A 100 [[kilowatt]] transmitter and antenna complex was built at [[Zeesen]], near Berlin. Specialty target programming to the United States began in 1933, to South Africa, South America, and East Asia in 1934, and South Asia and Central America in 1938. German propaganda was organized under [[Joseph Goebbels]], and played a key role in the [[German annexation of Austria]] and the [[Munich Crisis]] of 1938.

In 1936, the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Radio Union]] recognized Vatican Radio as a "special case" and authorized its broadcasting without any geographical limits. On December 25, 1937, a Telefunken 25-kW transmitter and two directional antennas were added. Vatican Radio broadcast over 10 frequencies.&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600"&gt;Levillain 2002: 1600&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nationalist forces received a powerful [[Telefunken]] transmitter as a gift of Nazi Germany to aid their propaganda efforts, and until 1943 [[Radio Nacional de EspaÃ±a]] collaborated with the Axis powers to retransmit in Spanish news from the official radio stations of Germany and Italy.

=== World War II ===
During the [[Second World War]], Russian, German, British, and Italian international broadcasting services expanded. In 1942, the United States initiated its international broadcasting service, the [[Voice of America]]. In the Pacific theater, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] used shortwave radio to keep in touch with the citizens of the Japanese-occupied Philippine Islands.

Several announcers who became well known in their countries included [[British Union of Fascists]] member [[William Joyce]], who was one of the two "[[Lord Haw-Haw]]"s; Frenchmen [[Paul Ferdonnet]] and [[AndrÃ© Olbrecht]], called "the traitors of [Radio] Stuttgart"; and Americans [[Frederick William Kaltenbach]], "Lord Hee-Haw", and [[Mildred Gillars]], one of the two announcers called "[[Axis Sally]]". Listeners to German programs often tuned in for curiosity's sakeâat one time, German radio had half a million listeners in the U.S.--but most of them soon lost interest. Japan had "Tokyo Rose", who broadcast Japanese propaganda in English, along with American music to help ensure listeners.

During World War II, Vatican Radio's news broadcasts were banned in Germany. During the war, the radio service operated in four languages.&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600"/&gt;

The British launched [[Radio SEAC]] from Colombo, [[Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka) during World War II. The station broadcast radio programs to the allied armed forces across the region from their headquarters in Ceylon.

Following the war and German partition, each Germany developed its own international broadcasting station: [[Deutsche Welle]], using studios in [[Cologne]], West Germany, and [[Radio Berlin International]] (RBI) in East Germany. RBI's broadcasts ceased shortly before the reunification of Germany on October 3, 1990, and Deutsche Welle took over its transmitters and frequencies.

=== Cold War Era ===
The Cold War led to increased international broadcasting (and [[radio jamming|jamming]]), as Communist and non-Communist states attempted to influence each other's domestic population. Some of the most prominent Western broadcasters were the [[Voice of America]], the [[BBC World Service]], and the (covertly) CIA-backed [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. The Soviet Union's most prominent service was [[Radio Moscow]] (now the Voice of Russia) and China used [[Radio Peking]] (then [[Radio Beijing]], now [[China Radio International]]). In addition to the U.S.-Soviet cold war, the Chinese-Russian border dispute led to an increase of the numbers of transmitters aimed at the two nations, and the development of new techniques such as playing tapes backwards for reel-to-reel recorders.

West Germany resumed regular shortwave broadcasts using Deutsche Welle on May 3, 1953. Its Julich transmitter site began operation in 1956, with eleven 100-kW Telefunken transmitters. The Wertachtal site was authorized in 1972 and began with four 500-kW transmitters. By 1989, there were 15 transmitters, four of which relayed the Voice of America.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 51&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in East Germany, the Nauen site began transmitting Radio DDR, later Radio Berlin International, on October 15, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 58&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Antenna system used Radio-Liberty 02.jpg|thumb|400px|Diagrams showing coverage of the [[Radio Liberty]] transmission site at [[Playa de Pals|Playa de Pals, Spain]] {{FFDC|Antenna system used Radio-Liberty 02.jpg|9 May 26|date=March 2012}}]] --&gt;
In addition to these states, international broadcast services grew in Europe and the [[Middle East]]. Under the presidency of [[Gamal Nasser]], [[Egypt]]ian transmitters covered the Arab world; Israel's service, [[Kol Yisrael]], served both to present the Israeli point of view to the world and to serve the [[Jewish diaspora]], particularly behind the [[Iron Curtain]].

[[Radio RSA]], as part of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, was established in 1966 to promote the image of South Africa internationally and reduce criticism of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz 2001: 287&lt;/ref&gt; It continued in 1992, when the post-apartheid government renamed it [[Channel Africa]].

Ironically, the isolationist [[Albania]] under [[Enver Hoxha]], virtually a [[hermit kingdom]], became one of the most prolific international broadcasters during the latter decades of the Cold War, with [[Radio Tirana]] one of the top five broadcasters in terms of hours of programming produced.

=== Today ===
At the end of the [[Cold War]], many international broadcasters cut back on hours and foreign languages broadcast, or reemphasized other language services. For example, in 1984, Radio Canada International broadcast in English, French, German, Spanish, Czech/Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. In 2005, RCI broadcast in English, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, and Spanish. There is a bigger trend towards TV (e.g. BBC World News, NHK World, CCTV-9) and news websites. Some services, such as Swiss Radio International, left shortwave altogether and exist in Internet form. In addition, new standards, such as [[Digital Radio Mondiale]], are being introduced, as well as sending programs over the Web to be played back later, as "[[podcast]]s".

International broadcasting using the traditional audio-only method will not cease any time soon due to its cost efficiencies. However, international broadcasting via television is considered more strategically important at least since the early 2000s.

The [[BBC World Service]] was the first broadcaster to consider setting up a satellite television news and information channel as far back as 1976, but ceded being the first to [[CNN]] (that had primary access to [[Canada]] soon after launch). The defunct BBC World Service [[Antigua]] Relay Station was built in 1976, but its setup costs were not known to have been part of the BBCWS decision processes at the time.

In the early 1990s, many international (as well as domestic) 24-hour news and information channels launched as part of the post-[[Cold War]] prosperity bubble. There was another burst of global news channels launching in the late 2000s as part the developing world trying to catch up with the developed world in this area.

== Reasons for international broadcasting ==
Broadcasters in one country have several reasons to reach out to an audience in other countries. The examples given below are not meant to be exhaustive, but are illustrative.

One clear reason is for ideological, or [[propaganda]] reasons. Many government-owned stations portray their nation in a positive, non-threatening way. This could be to encourage business investment and/or tourism to the nation. Another reason is to combat a negative image produced by other nations or internal dissidents, or insurgents. [[Radio RSA]], the broadcasting arm of the apartheid South African government, is an example of this. A third reason is to promote the ideology of the broadcaster. For example, a program on [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]] from the 1960s to the 1980s was ''What is Communism?''

A second reason is to advance a nation's foreign policy interests and agenda by disseminating its views on international affairs or on the events in particular parts of the world. During the [[Cold War]] the American [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]] and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]] and Indian Radio [[All India Radio|AIR]] were founded to broadcast news from "behind the Iron Curtain" that was otherwise being censored and promote dissent and occasionally, to disseminate [[disinformation]]. Currently the US operates similar services aimed at [[Cuba]] and the [[People's Republic of China]].

The [[BBC World Service]], the [[Voice of America]], [[All India Radio]] and other western broadcasters have emphasized news broadcasts, particularly to countries that are experiencing repression or civil unrest and whose populations are unable to obtain news from non-government sources. In the case of emergencies, a nation may broadcast special programs overseas to inform listeners what is occurring. During Iraqi missile strikes on Israel during the 1991 Gulf War, [[Kol Israel]] relayed its domestic service on its shortwave service.

Besides ideological reasons, many stations are run by religious broadcasters and are used to provide religious education, religious music, or worship service programs. For example, [[Vatican Radio]], established in 1931, broadcasts such programs. Another station, such as [[HCJB]] or [[Trans World Radio]] will carry brokered programming from evangelists. In the case of the [[Broadcasting Services of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], both governmental and religious programming is provided.

Stations also broadcast to international audiences for cultural reasons. Often a station has an official mandate to keep expatriates in touch with the home country. Many broadcasters often relay their national domestic service on shortwave for that reason. Other reasons include teaching a foreign language, such as [[Radio Exterior de EspaÃ±a]]'s Spanish class, ''Un idioma sin fronteras'', or the Voice of America's broadcasts in [[Special English]]. In the case of major broadcasters such as the [[BBC World Service]] or [[Radio Australia]], there is also an educational outreach.

An additional reason for international broadcasting is to maintain contact with a country's citizens travelling abroad or expatriates who have emigrated and share news from home as well as cultural programming. This role of external shortwave broadcasting has declined as advances in communications have allowed expatriates to read news from home and listen and watch to domestic broadcasts in their own language via the internet and satellite. A number of international services such as the original [[BBC Empire Service]], [[Radio Netherlands]], France's Poste Colonial (now [[Radio France International]]) and others were founded in part with the goal of helping draw overseas empires closer to the [[mother country]] and provide closer cultural and communication connections between the home country and its colonies, a role that became largely obsolete due to [[decolonization]].

== Means to reach an audience ==
Because of this many broadcasters are discovering they can reach a wider audience through other methods (particularly the internet and satellite television) and are cutting back on (or even entirely dropping) shortwave.

An international broadcaster has several options for reaching a foreign audience:
* If the foreign audience is near the broadcaster, high-power longwave and mediumwave stations can provide reliable coverage.
* If the foreign audience is more than 1,000 kilometers away from the broadcaster, shortwave radio is reliable, but subject to interruption by adverse solar/geomagnetic conditions.
* An international broadcaster may use a local mediumwave or FM radio or television relay station in the target country or countries.
* An international broadcaster may use a local shortwave broadcaster as a relay station.
* Neighboring states, such as [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]], may broadcast television programs to each other's viewing public.

An international broadcaster such as the BBC, Radio France International or Germany's Deutsche Welle, may use all the above methods. Several international broadcasters, such as [[Swiss Radio International]], have abandoned shortwave broadcasting altogether, relying on Internet transmissions only. Others, such as the BBC World Service, have abandoned shortwave transmissions to North America, relying on local relays, the Internet, and satellite transmissions

=== Mediumwave and longwave broadcasts ===
Most radio receivers in the world receive the [[mediumwave]] band (530&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1710&amp;nbsp;kHz), which at night is capable of reliable reception from 150 to 2,500&amp;nbsp;km distance from a transmitter. Mediumwave is used heavily all over the world for international broadcasting on a formal and informal basis.

In addition, many receivers used in Europe and Russia can receive the [[longwave]] broadcast band (150 to 280&amp;nbsp;kHz), which provides reliable long-distance communications over continental distances.

=== Shortwave broadcast ===
[[Shortwave receiver]]s are capable of receiving [[shortwave]] transmissions (2,000 to 30,000&amp;nbsp;kHz or 2 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz). Depending on time of day, season of year, solar weather and Earth's geomagnetic field, a signal might reach around the world.

[[Image:RCI-BC-ANZ431-dbu.png|thumb|300px|This sort of map is used by radio engineers to determine the best frequencies to reach international audiences on shortwave bands. In this case, a transmitter is sited in the Southern [[Vancouver Island]], using a frequency of 12095 kHz and transmitting at the 500 kW power level. The picture shows a good signal over the Southern Pacific. The signal fades out as it approaches the [[Eastern states of Australia|East Coast of Australia]].]]

In previous decades shortwave (and sometimes high-powered mediumwave) transmission was regarded as the main (and often the ''only'') way in which broadcasters could reach an international audience. In recent years the proliferation of technologies such as satellite broadcasting, the Internet, and rebroadcasts of programming on AM and FM within target nations has meant that this is no longer necessarily the case.

Transmitter output power has increased since 1920. Higher transmitter powers do guarantee better reception in the target area. Higher transmitter power in most cases counteracts the lesser effects of [[radio jamming|jamming]].
* 1950s : 100&amp;nbsp;kW
* 1960s : 200&amp;nbsp;kW, early 1960s (2 x 100&amp;nbsp;kW 'twinned')
* 1970s : 300&amp;nbsp;kW, but many 250&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters sold
* 1980s : 500&amp;nbsp;kW sometimes transmitters were "doubled up" to produce 1000&amp;nbsp;kW output
* 1980s-present: 600&amp;nbsp;kW single, 1200&amp;nbsp;kW from twinned transmitters.

International stations generally use special [[HRS type antennas|directional antennas]] to aim the signal toward the intended audience and increase the [[Effective radiated power|effective power]] in that direction. Use of such antennas for international broadcasting began in the mid-1930s and became prominent by the 1950s. By using antennas which focus most of their energy in one direction, a modern station may achieve the equivalent, in that direction, of tens of millions of [[watt]]s of radio power.

=== Digital Audio Broadcasting ===
Some international broadcasters have become available via [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) in Europe in the 1990s, and in a similar limited way in the Americas via in-band FM ([[IBOC]]) DAB systems in the US in the 2000s. This is a popular method to reach listeners in cars that would otherwise not be accessible during that part of the day. However, in terms of the global international broadcasting audience the DAB listener base is very smallâone can assume that it is less than 2% of the listener base globally.

=== Television ===
International broadcasting via 24 hour TV news channels has its origins in North America in the early 1980s. CNN technically was the first 24-hour international news channel as it was made available in Canada soon after launch. The BBC World Service considered setting up a global TV news channel as far back as 1975, but abandoned the idea for internal reasons.

Notwithstanding a large number of international 24-hour television news and information broadcasters, the television percentage of viewers is still fairly small when compared to global radio listener numbers.

The rural populations of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (as well as East Asia) have radio listener bases that are far larger than the largest international TV broadcaster could hope for, yet they could be considered underserved since the end of the Cold War (when these regions had more radio broadcasts targeted at them).

==== Streaming video sites ====
Many international television broadcasters (as well as domestic television broadcasters) have set up accounts on streaming video sites like [[YouTube]] to allow their news and information broadcasts to be globally distributed. The viewer numbers for these sites may seem huge. Cable, TVRO and terrestrial television broadcasters probably have 100 to 1,000 times larger audiences for their international broadcasting content.

International broadcasters known to maintain their own streaming video sites (not authoritative):

* [[Al Jazeera English]]
* [[BBC World News]]
* [[CNN International]]
* [[DD News]]
* [[Deutsche Welle|DW]]
* [[France 24]]
* [[i24NEWS]]
* [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly known as âRussia Todayâ)
* [[Sky News]]
* [[WION (TV channel)|WION]] (World is One News)

=== RSS feeds and email ===
Many international broadcasters (television or radio) can reach "unreachable" audiences via email and RSS feeds. This is not at all unusual, as the first commonly agreed international broadcast was a Morse Code telegram transmitted from US President Wilson to the German Kaiser (mid-1918) via a high powered longwave transmitter on the US East Coast (this important event in international broadcasting history was described in depth in the IEEE "The History of International Broadcasting" first volume). As Morse Code is considered to be a data format, with email and RSS merely being refinements of the technology it can be said that international broadcasting has a deep relationship with modern-day datacasting.

The reach of RSS and email for international broadcasters is not really known that well, especially considering that emails get forwarded. The numbers for active RSS and email audiences are probably 5 to 20 times larger than for streaming video. It may take into the 2010s to get meaningful numbers with respect to the size of these audiences for assorted technical reasons related to the RSS and email technologies.

Email and RSS feeds can traverse telecommunications barriers that streaming video cannot, thus the larger expected audience numbers. The global economic downturn of 2008-2009 will probably increase the email and RSS audience sizes as fewer people will be able to afford high speed internet connections in North America, Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions.

== Listeners ==
An international broadcaster may have the technical means of reaching a foreign audience, but unless the foreign audience has a reason to listen, the effectiveness of the broadcaster is in question.

One of the most common foreign audiences consists of expatriates, who cannot listen to radio or watch television programs from home. Another common audience is [[Shortwave listening|radio hobbyists]], who attempt to listen to as many countries as possible and obtain verification cards or letters (''QSLs''). These audiences send letters and in response few radio stations write them back. These kind of Listeners often take part in weekly and monthly quizzes and contests started by many radio stations. A third audience consists of journalists, government officials, and key businesspersons, who exert a disproportionate influence on a state's foreign or economic policy.

A fourth, but less publicized audience, consists of intelligence officers and agents who monitor broadcasts for both [[open-source intelligence]] clues to the broadcasting state's policies and for hidden messages to foreign agents operating in the receiving country. The BBC started its monitoring service in Caversham, Reading in 1936 (now [[BBC Monitoring]]). In the United States, the [[United States Director of National Intelligence|DNI]] [[Open Source Center]] (formerly the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]]) provides the same service. Copies of OSC/FBIS reports can be found in many U.S. libraries that serve as government depositories. In addition, a number of hobbyists listen and report "spook" transmissions.

Without these four audiences, international broadcasters face difficulty in getting funding. In 2001, for example, the BBC World Service stopped transmitting shortwave broadcasts to North America, and other international broadcasters, such as YLE Radio Finland, stopped certain foreign-language programs.

However, international broadcasting has been successful when a country does not provide programming wanted by a wide segment of the population. In the 1960s, when there was no BBC service playing rock and roll, Radio Television Luxembourg ([[RTL Group|RTL]]) broadcast rock and roll, including bands such as [[the Beatles]], into the United Kingdom. Similar programming came from an unlicensed, or "pirate" station, [[Radio Caroline]], which broadcast from a ship in the international waters of the North Sea.

== Restricting reception ==
In many cases, governments do not want their citizens listening to international broadcasters. In Nazi Germany, a major propaganda campaign, backed by law and prison sentences, attempted to discourage Germans from listening to such stations. The practice was made illegal in 1939.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Mann 2002: 93"&gt;Hughes and Mann 2002: 93&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the German government sold a cheap, 76-[[Reichsmark]] [[VolksempfÃ¤nger|"People's Receiver"]], as well as an even cheaper 35-Reichsmark receiver,&lt;ref name="Hughes and Mann 2002: 93"/&gt; that could not pick up distant signals well.&lt;ref name="Graef 2005: 36"&gt;Graef 2005: 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was copied by Stalin's Soviet Union, which had a nearly identical copy manufactured in the Tesla factory in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="Graef 2005: 36"/&gt;
In North Korea, all receivers are sold with fixed frequencies, tuned to local stations.

The most common method of preventing reception is [[radio jamming|jamming]], or broadcasting a signal on the same frequencies as the international broadcaster. Germany jammed the BBC European service during the Second World War. Russian and Eastern European jammers were aimed against [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]], other Western broadcasters, and against Chinese broadcasters during the nadir of Sino-Soviet relations. In 2002, the Cuban government jammed the [[Voice of America]]'s [[Radio y TelevisiÃ³n MartÃ­|Radio MartÃ­]] program and the Chinese government jammed [[Radio Free Asia]], [[Voice of America]], [[Radio Taiwan International]] as well broadcasts made by adherents of [[Falun Gong]].

North Korea restricts most people to a single fixed frequency mediumwave receiver; those who met political requirements and whose work absolutely required familiarity with events abroad were allowed shortwave receivers.&lt;ref&gt;Martin 2006: 495&lt;/ref&gt; Another method of reaching people with government radio programming, but not foreign programming, is the use of radio broadcasting by direct broadcasting to loudspeakers.&lt;ref&gt;Goetz, Philip W. ''The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'', 1991 edition, {{ISBN|0-85229-400-X}}, p 315&lt;/ref&gt;
David Jackson, director of the Voice of America, noted "The North Korean government doesn't jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse. But people figure out ways to listen despite the odds. They're very resourceful."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, David. "The Future of Radio II". ''World Radio TV Handbook'', 2007 edition. 2007, Billboard Books. {{ISBN|0-8230-5997-9}}. p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another method of preventing reception involves moving a domestic station to the frequency used by the international broadcaster. During the Batista government of Cuba, and during the Castro years, Cuban medium-wave stations broadcast on the frequencies of popular South Florida stations. In October 2002, Iraq changed frequencies of two stations to block the Voice of America's [[Radio Sawa]] program.

Jamming can be defeated by using very efficient transmitting antennas, carefully choosing the transmitted frequency, changing transmitted frequency often, using [[Single-sideband modulation|single sideband]], and properly aiming the receiving antenna.

S.|title=International communication: History, conflict, and control of the global metropolis|year=1993|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for international communication was due to the increasing effects and influences of globalization. As a field of study, international communication is a branch of [[communication studies]], concerned with the scope of "government-to-government", "business-to-business", and "people-to-people" interactions at a global level.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, international communication is being taught at colleges across the United States. Due to the increasingly globalized market, employees who possess the ability to effectively communicate across cultures are in high demand. International communication "encompasses political, economic, social, cultural and military concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortner|first=R. S.|title=International communication: History, conflict, and control of the global metropolis|year=1993|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==

===Communication and empire===
Efficient communication networks played crucial roles in establishing ancient imperial authority and international trade. The extent of empire could be used as an 'indication of the [[communication efficiency|efficiency of communication]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Innis|first=H.|title=Empire and communications|year=1972|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=Toronto|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient empires such as Rome, Persia and China, all utilized writing in collecting information and dispersing, creating enormous postal and dispatch systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=S.|title=News and society in the Greek pols|year=1996|publisher=Duck worth|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as in fifteenth century, news had been disseminated trans-nationally in Europe. 'The wheat traders of Venice, the silver traders of Antwerp, the merchants of Nuremberg and their trading partners shared economic newsletters and created common values and beliefs in the rights of capital.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voltmeter|first=Ingrid|title=International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The advent of telegraph and timeâspace compression===
{{see also|time space compression}}
In 1837, [[Samuel Morse]] invented [[telegraph]]. Given its speed and reliability in delivering information, telegraph offered opportunities for capital and military expansion. As showed in Table 1.1, the establishment of cable hardware signifies global power order in late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

===The era of news agencies===
The newspaper industry and international telegraph networks mutually facilitated each other. As the supply and demand of newspaper industry rapidly increased in nineteenth century, [[news agencies]] were established successively. [[The French Havas Agency]] was founded in 1835, the German agency [[Wolff]]in 1849 and the British [[Reuters]] in 1851. These three European agencies, which started to operate internationally, were all subsidized by their respective governments.

=== Radio broadcasting ===
Western countries seized the chances to implement radio communication after the first radio transmissions of human voice in 1902. But the two mechanisms of radio broadcasting were distinctively different. In the USA, [[the Radio Act of 1927]] confirm its status as an advertising-funded commercial enterprise, while in Britain, the public broadcasting pioneer [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] set up in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War and the Second World War, radio broadcasting played a significant role in both domestic public opinion management and international diplomacy propaganda abroad. Even in the Cold War times, this radio-dominated international communication still featured in propaganda respective ideologies. The prominent example is [[Voice of America|the Voice of America]], which ran a global network to indoctrinate "American dream" to its international audience.

===Demanding a new communication order===
Since the cold war officially ended in 1990, the intense relations of super powers halted with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the emergence of the Third World countries, the unequally developed communication order can no longer exist. The Third World called for ceasing their marginalized communication status. Especially when international communications stepped into the information age, 'the convergence of telecommunication and computing and the ability to move all type of data â pictures, words, sounds â via the Internet have revolutionized international information exchange.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thussu|first=D.K.|title=International Communication: Continuity and Change|year=2006|publisher=Hodder Education|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Considerations for international communication ===
When communicating internationally it is important to take culture into consideration. Though English has become the language of business, many businesses fail to recognize that the language used does not determine how business is conducted. Therefore, it is important to understand that intercultural and international communication are interchangeable.

As a tourist it may be acceptable to maintain the cultural norms from a country of origin when visiting, though attempting to adapt would be appreciated. However, when conducting business it is important to recognize cultural differences, especially when communicating.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Robert. "Intercultural Business Communication". Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 16 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century there was a large amount of research based on the needs of those that travel abroad in order to commercialize products or services. The list of researchers includes Hofstede, 1991; Storti, 1994; Ansari &amp; Jackson, 1995; Cushner &amp; Brislin, 1996; Adler, 1997; Mead, 1998; and Marx, 1999. From those studies Gibson's volume becomes an important source of information for business professionals interested in succeeding internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Robert|title=Intercultural Business Communication|url=http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/information/tesl-ej/ej33/r8.html|website=Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=16 November 2014|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by Douglas Storey, there was a change in style and strategy of American diplomacy since 1979 after the first addition of Glen Fisher's book appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storey|first1=Douglas|title=International Communication|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/216913937|publisher=Journalism Quarterly|accessdate=18 November 2014|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the reason for international communication it is important to understand that international communication is not limited to the language spoken during communication.

== Scope and approaches of international communication research ==
International communication is widely spread and multilayered in contemporary society, however it is not considered as a separate academic discipline because of its overlapping with other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=R.|title=Defining international communication as a field|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1992|issue=69|pages=543â553}}&lt;/ref&gt; International communication is 'a topic field rather than a discipline field' and international communication studies is a mode of 'organizing inquiry'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=J.|title=Genealogical notes on "the field"|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=4|pages=132â139|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01313.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D. H. Downing]] proposed ten categories within which international communication should be conducted
# [[theories of international communication]]
# [[core international communication processes]]
# [[global media firms]]
# [[global media policies]]
# [[Global news flow]]s
# [[world cinema]]
# [[development communication]]

One of the most obvious manifestations of international communication are [[world news]], when the media of one country cover news from abroad. But, apart from journalism, international communication also occurs in other areas (culture, technology, sciences) and the nature of the "information" that is circulated can be classified in a wide variety of categories, such as cultural (music, films, sports, TV shows from one country to another), scientific (research papers published abroad, scientific exchange or cooperation), and intelligence (diplomacy reports, international espionage, etc.).

Typically the study of international communication includes a deep attention to the circulation of news among different countries (and the resulting imbalances, from which came the concept of [[news flow]]), the power of media organizations (such as [[media conglomerate|conglomerates]] and news agencies), issues such as [[cultural imperialism]] and [[media imperialism]], and the political role that international cooperation can have in enhancing the media industry (and society as a whole) in a given region, such as proposed by [[development communication]] or [[communication for development]].

Some renowned scholars in international communication include [[Wilbur Schramm]], [[Ithiel de Sola Pool]], [[Johan Galtung]], [[Anthony Smith (producer)|Anthony Smith]], Robert Stevenson, [[Jeremy Tunstall]], [[Armand Mattelart]], [[Oliver Boyd-Barrett]], Ali Mohammadi, [[Annabelle Sreberny]], [[Cees J. Hamelink]], [[Daya Kishan Thussu]] and [[Chris Paterson]]. The ''[[International Communication Gazette]]'' and the ''[[Journal of International Communication]]'' are reference journals in this field.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The '''international community''' is a phrase used in [[geopolitics]] and [[international relations]] to refer to a broad group of people and governments of the world. It does not refer literally to all nations or states in the world. The term is typically used to imply the existence of a common point of view towards such matters as specific issues of [[human rights]]. An example Of International Community is the united nations. Activists, politicians and commentators often use the term in calling for action to be taken; e.g., action against what is in their opinion [[political repression]] in a target country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LQNYlTa1-YUC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=international+community+term&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw_Nukme7VAhWSHsAKHYBXApUQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=international%20community%20term&amp;f=false|title=United States Hegemony and the Foundations of International Law|last=Byers|first=Michael|last2=Nolte|first2=Georg|date=2003-05-29|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=|isbn=9781139436632|location=|pages=30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is commonly used to imply legitimacy and consensus for a point of view on a disputed issue; e.g., to enhance the credibility of a majority vote in the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gaJ9FCXnX5IC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=%22international+community%22+general+assembly&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfvYDRmu7VAhWkB8AKHSFDB1sQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22international%20community%22%20general%20assembly&amp;f=false|title=Law-Making in the International Community|last=Danilenko|first=GennadiÄ­ MikhaÄ­lovich|date=1993-01-01|publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]]|year=|isbn=0792320395|location=|pages=204|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's [[Western world|the west]], of course, nothing more, nothing less. Using the term 'international community' is a way of dignifying the west, of globalising it, of making it sound more respectable, more neutral and high-faluting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/aug/24/whatthehellistheinternati|title=What the hell is the international community?|author=Martin Jacques|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Midgard (SÃ¶ 56, Fyrby).jpg|350px|right|thumb|The runes ''a:miÃ¾karÃ¾i'', [[Old Norse]] ''Ã  MiÃ°garÃ°i'', meaning "in Midgard" â "in Middle Earth", on the [[Fyrby Runestone]] (SÃ¶ 56) in [[SÃ¶dermanland]], [[Sweden]].]]

'''Midgard''' (an anglicised form of [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] {{lang|non|MiÃ°garÃ°r}}; [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|Middangeard}}, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] ''MidgÃ¥rd'', [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|Middilgard}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|Mittilagart}}, [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''Midjun-gards''; "middle yard") is the name for [[Earth]] (equivalent in meaning to the Greek term {{lang |grc|[[Ecumene|Î¿á¼°ÎºÎ¿ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î·]]}}, "inhabited") inhabited by and known to [[mannaz|humans]] in early Germanic cosmology, and specifically one of the [[Norse cosmology|Nine Worlds]] in [[Norse mythology]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|middangeard}}
{{wiktionary|ð¼ð¹ð³ð¾ð¿ð½ð²ð°ðð³ð}}
This name occurs in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] literature as {{lang|non|MiÃ°garÃ°r}}. In [[Old Saxon]] ''[[Heliand]]'' it appears as {{lang|osx|Middilgard}} and in [[Old High German]] poem ''[[Muspilli]]'' it appears as {{lang |goh|Mittilagart}}. The [[Gothic language|Gothic]] form {{lang|got|Midjungards}} is attested in the [[Gospel of Luke]] as a translation of the Greek word {{lang |grc|[[Ecumene|Î¿á¼°ÎºÎ¿ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î·]]}}. The word is present in [[Old English]] epic and poetry as {{lang |ang|Middangeard}}; later transformed to {{lang |enm|MiddellÃ¦rd}} or {{lang |enm|Mittelerde}} ("[[Middle-earth (disambiguation)|Middle-earth]]") in [[Middle English]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Midgard | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | contribution = Midgard}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All these forms are from a [[Common Germanic]] ''*midja-gardaz'' (''*meddila-'', ''*medjan-''), a compound of ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/midjaz|*midja-]]'' "middle" and ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/gardaz|*gardaz]]'' "yard, enclosure".
In early Germanic cosmology, the term stands alongside ''[[:wikt:world|world]]'' ([[Old English]] ''weorold'', [[Old Saxon]] ''werold'', [[Old High German]] ''weralt'', [[Old Frisian]] ''warld'' and [[Old Norse]] ''verÇ«ld''), from a [[Common Germanic]] compound ''*wira-alÄiz'', the "age of men".&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir E. (2003). ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology''.  Leiden: Brill. p. 462. {{ISBN|90-04-12875-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Norse==
Midgard is a realm in [[Norse mythology]]. It is one of the Nine Worldsâthe only one that is completely visible to mankind (the others may intersect with this visible realm but are mostly invisible). Pictured as placed somewhere in the middle of [[Yggdrasil]], Midgard is between the land of [[Niflheim]]âthe land of iceâto the north and [[Muspelheim]]âthe land of fireâto the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Midgard|title=Midgard {{!}} Norse mythology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midgard is surrounded by a world of water, or ocean, that is impassable. The ocean is inhabited by the great sea serpent [[JÃ¶rmungandr]] (MiÃ°garÃ°sormr), who is so huge that he encircles the world entirely, grasping his own tail. The concept is similar to that of the [[Ouroboros]]. Midgard was also connected to Asgard, the home of the gods, by the [[BifrÃ¶st]], the rainbow bridge, guarded by [[Heimdallr]].

In Norse mythology, ''MiÃ°garÃ°r'' became applied to the wall around the world that the gods constructed from the eyebrows of the giant [[Ymir]] as a defense against the [[JÃ¶tunn|Jotuns]] who lived in [[Jotunheim]], east of ''Manheimr'', the "home of men", a word used to refer to the entire world. The gods slew the giant [[Ymir]], the first created being, and put his body into the central void of the universe, creating the world out of his body: his flesh constituting the land, his [[Ymir's blood|blood]] the oceans, his bones the mountains, his teeth the cliffs, his hairs the trees, and his brains the clouds. Aurgelmir's skull was held by four dwarfs, Nordri, Sudri, Austri, and Vestri, who represent the four points on the compass and became the dome of heaven. The sun, moon, and stars were said to be scattered sparks in the skull.

[[Image:SÃ¶ 56, Fyrby.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Fyrby Runestone.]]
According to the [[Eddas]], Midgard will be destroyed at [[RagnarÃ¶k]], the battle at the end of the world. JÃ¶rmungandr will arise from the ocean, poisoning the land and sea with his venom and causing the sea to rear up and lash against the land. The final battle will take place on the plane of [[VÃ­grÃ­Ã°r]], following which Midgard and almost all life on it will be destroyed, with the earth sinking into the sea, only to rise again, fertile and green when the cycle repeats and the creation begins again.

Although most surviving instances of the word Midgard refer to spiritual matters, it was also used in more mundane situations, as in the [[Viking Age]] [[runestone]] poem from the inscription [[Fyrby Runestone|SÃ¶ 56]] from Fyrby:

The [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] form {{lang|sv|MidgÃ¥rd}} or {{lang|da|Midgaard}}, the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] {{lang|no|Midgard}} or {{lang|no|MidgÃ¥rd}}, as well as the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] form {{lang|is|MiÃ°garÃ°ur}}, all derive from the Old Norse term.

==Old and Middle English==
The name ''middangeard'' occurs six times in the [[Old English language|Old English]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', and is the same word as Midgard in [[Old Norse]]. The term is equivalent in meaning to the Greek term [[Oikoumene]], as referring to the known and inhabited world.

The concept of Midgard occurs many times in [[Middle English]]. The association with ''earth'' (OE ''eorÃ°e'') in Middle English ''middellÃ¦rd'', ''middelerde'' is by [[popular etymology]]; the continuation of ''geard'' "enclosure" is ''[[yard (land)|yard]]''. An early example of this transformation is from the [[Ormulum]]:

::''Ã¾att ure Drihhtin wollde / ben borenn i Ã¾iss middellÃ¦rd''

::that our Lord wanted / be born in this middle-earth.

The usage of "[[Middle-earth]]" as a name for a setting was popularized by Old English scholar [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and other fantasy works; he was originally inspired by the references to ''middangeard'' and ''[[Ãarendel]]'' in the Old English poem ''[[Crist]]''.

==Old High German==
''Mittilagart'' is mentioned in the 9th-century [[Old High German]] ''[[Muspilli]]'' (v. 54) meaning "the world" as opposed to the sea and the heavens:
::''muor varsuuilhit sih, suilizot lougiu der himil,''
::''mano uallit, prinnit mittilagart''

::Sea is swallowed, flaming burn the heavens,
::Moon falls, Midgard burns

'''Global communication''' is the term used to describe ways to connect, share, relate and mobilize across geographic, political, economic, social and cultural divides. It redefines soft and hard power as well as information power and diplomacy in ways not considered by traditional theories of [[International relations theory|international relations]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Global Communication implies a transfer of knowledge and ideas from centers of power to peripheries and the imposition of a new intercultural hegemony by means of the "[[soft power]]" of global news and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tehranian|first1=Maijd|title=Global Communication and international relations: changing paradigms and policies|journal=The International Journal of Peace Studies|url=http://www.gmu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''study of global communication''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies the continuous flows of information used in transferring values, opinions, knowledge, culture across boundaries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=="International" Or "Global"==
With the end of the twentieth century and the turn of a new millennium, the global arena and the field of international communication were undergoing significant changes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some authors started to use the term global communication because it goes beyond the bounds of individual states and emphasizes communication between and among peoples across borders and, importantly, the rise of transnational media corporations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[International communication]] traditionally refers to communication between and among nation-states and connotes issues of national sovereignty, control of national information resources, and the supremacy of national governments.

Nevertheless, earlier International communication theories have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The old theories only explain part of the global picture and the theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term "global", implies a declining role of the state and state sovereignty. As a term, "international" has within it notions of bilateral or multilateral decisions. "Global" could be seen as an aspiration, also as a fear, of the weakening of the state. In addition, global may imply something more pervasive, more geographically inclusive than international. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

The study of global communication increased dramatically after World War II due to military considerations coupled with their economic and political implications. Earlier attempts at theorizing have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

More global communication research was written in the decade from 1945â1955; most of the research of the 1950s dealt with propaganda and the cold war. By 1970, global communication research had grown to include a great variety of subjects, especially comparative mass communication systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |edition=1st |title=The Handbook of Comparative Communication Research |url= |publisher=Routledge |date=2012-03-21 |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-415-80275-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; communication and national development and propaganda and public opinion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frederick |first1=Howard H. |title=Global communication and international relations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RBsQAQAAMAAJ|isbn=9780534193447 |date=1993-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of global communication scholars, previous theories of [[Modernization theory|modernization]], dependency, and [[cultural imperialism]] have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication. The old theories only explain part of the global picture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mcphail |first1=Thomas L. |title=Global Communication Theories, stakeholders, and Trends |date=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Communication.html?id=MAco-KZGZNIC|isbn=9781444358100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological development===
The emergence of global communication technologies may be considered the origin of the field of global communication in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Numerous technical advances such as the creation of a new major global communication phenomenon, [[Telecommunication convergence|convergence]], digital environments and the internet are some of the major engines driving the change from [[international communication]] to global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Global power shifts===
With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union's collapse|Soviet Union]], the shadow of [[Cold War]] has lifted to reveal shifting political, economic, and cultural alliances and conflicts. The increasing importance of these currents, especially in the cultural sphere, demands a reconsideration of the nature of the international communication field within the rubric of international relations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Communication in Transition: The End of Diversity?|url = https://www.amazon.com/Global-Communication-Transition-Diversity-Values-ebook/dp/B00YFRD9G6/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450650195&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=global+communication+in+transition|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc|date = 1996-02-05|first = Hamid|last = Mowlana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News agencies and propaganda===
Three key players are usually recognized as the founders of the international [[News agency|news agencies]]. In 1835, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] created the world's first news agency; In 1849, [[Bernhard Wolff]] started publishing stock market news and daily reports from Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt; In 1849, [[Paul Reuter|Paul Julius Freiherr von Reuter]] established his own commercial service, the [[Reuters|Reuter]] agency, and organized a worldwide exchange of news in 1870.

In 1859, Reuter, [[Havas]] and the German [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau|Wolff]] agency reached an agreement to exchange news from all over the world, which was known as the League of Allied Agencies, or the " Ring Combination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "The Ring Combination": Information, Power, and the World News Agency Cartel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YDVlAAAAMAAJ|publisher = University of Chicago, Department of History|date = 1999-01-01|first = Alexander Scott|last = Nalbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Associated Press|American News Agency Associated Press]] was founded and was formally admitted into the "Ring Combination" in 1887.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Theoretical approaches and perspectives ==

=== Transcultural political economy ===

Transcultural Political Economy is a concept that is presented in Global Communications by Paula Chakravartty and Yeuzhi Zhao. This concept looks at global communications and media studies in three major areas: global flows of information and culture, decentralizing the conceptual parameters of global information and media studies, and the normative debates in global communications in the context of neoliberalism. Transcultural Political Economy is a multidisciplinary study that focuses on the tensions between political economy and cultural studies. It "integrate[s] institutional and cultural analyzes and address urgent questions in global communications in the context of economic integration, empire formation, and the tensions associated with adapting new privatized technologies, neoliberalized and globalized institutional structures, and hybrid cultural forms and practices". Transcultural Political Economy addresses the issues surrounding the practice of neoliberalism and its creation of unequal power structures within the world system.

=== Globalization theory ===
{{See also|Globalization}}

Globalization theory was popularized in the 1990s as a model for understanding global communication. The concept of [[globalization]] inspired a number of theories from various schools of thought in communication studies that each emphasize different aspects of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization, development and the mass media |last=Sparks |first=Colin |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7619-6161-1 |location=Thousand Oaks, California |pages=126â149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many globalization theories highlight actors in the business sector as leaders in the processes of global integration. Transnationalizing business is often celebrated as progression toward a more interconnected world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Globalization theories are often associated with theories of modernity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some scholars view globalization as the social, political, economic, and cultural integration of societies into a capitalist system; Others see globalization as a successor to modernity, while some see it as an iteration of imperialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some question the usefulness and legitimacy of globalization theory, arguing that it does not adequately conceptualize current international relations or function as a lens through which to examine everyday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Globalization Theory: A Post Mortem |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/pal/ip/2005/00000042/00000001/art00002 |journal=International Politics |date=2005-03-01 |pages=2â74 |volume=42 |issue=1 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800098 |first=Justin |last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars criticize globalization theories as overzealous toward and unrealistic about the extent of global integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why the World Isn't Flat in International Politics: Enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last=Ghemawat |first=Pankaj |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-205-77876-8 |location=United States |pages=322â327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars criticize social theorists for offering opinions and predictions based on theory with little practical evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, some scholars work to dispute the pessimistic views of globalization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Art |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Jervis |editor2-first=Robert |title=International politics: enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last1=Micklethwait |first1=John |last2=Woolridge |first2=Adrian |chapter=Why the Globalization Backlash is Stupid in International Politics |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn= |location=United States |pages=348â354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World systems theory ===
World-system theory is a macro-sociological perspective that seeks to explain the dynamics of the "capitalist world economy" as a "total social system". A world-system is what Wallerstein terms a "world-economy", integrated through the market rather than a political centre, in which two or more regions are interdependent with respect to necessities like food, fuel, and two or more polities compete for domination without the emergence of one single centre forever.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfrank, Walter L. (2000). "Paradigm Regained? The Rules of Wallerstein's World-System Method. Journal of World-Systems Research. Vol. 6. N. 2 pp. 150-195&lt;/ref&gt; World-system theory was first articulated by Immanuel Wallerstein. There are three major sources of the world-system theory which conceived by Wallerstein: the Annales school's general methodology, Marx's focus on accumulation process and competitive class struggles and so on, and dependence theory's neo-Marxist explanation of development processes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y The dictionary of anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell]'', {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the transnational division of labor, world-system divides the world into core countries, peripheral countries, semi-peripheral countries and external areas. The core countries usually developed a strong central governments, extensive bureaucracies and large mercenary armies, which permit the local bourgeoisie to obtain control over international commerce and extract capital surpluses from the trade for benefits.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Paul Halsall(1997) [https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Wallerstein.asp Modern History Sourcebook: ''Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral countries often lack strong central governments or been controlled by core countries, they export raw materials and rely on coercive labor practices.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Semi-peripheries which served as buffers between the core and the peripheries. They retain limited but declining access to international banking and the production of high-cost high-quality manufactured goods.[3] External areas such as Russia maintain their own economic systems, they want to remain outside the modern world economy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modernisation theory ===

The theory of modernization was developed by Daniel Lerner (1958) in the "Passing of traditional society." Lerner's description of "modernised" is an individual having the ability to be empathetic and being able to see oneself in another person's situation. This concept has come from the transition of traditional societies to modern societies, where modern societies is distinctively industrial, urban, literate, and participant. This theory looks at development in a linear fashion, concluding that nations need to develop into a modern society to make it a sustainable and flourishing nation. Developing modernized societies include technological advancement, and developing media sectors to help create a participatory culture. 
&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, D. (1958). The passing of traditional society: Modernising the Middle East. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-colonialism ===
''See also:'' [[Post-structuralism]], [[imperialism]], [[modernity]],

Post-colonialism is a theoretical approach to looking at literature that examines the colonizer-colonized experience. It deals with the adaptation of formerly colonized nations and their development in cultural, political, economical aspects. Some Notable theoreticians include: [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Edward Said]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[R Siva Kumar]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[Derek Gregory]].

=== Cultural imperialism ===
Cultural imperialism is a mighty civilization exerts culture influence over another. Less economically prominent cultures often import culture from Western countries, which have the economic means to produce a majority of the world's cultural media, mostly via the global transmission of media.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ketchum, [http://classroom.synonym.com/meaning-cultural-imperialism-7841.html What Is the Meaning of Cultural Imperialism?]&lt;/ref&gt; The weak civilization adopts the mighty civilization's customs, philosophies, worldviews and general ways of life. The theoretical foundations of the academic study of cultural imperialism mostly come from Michel Foucault's concept of biopower, governmentality and Edward SaÃ¯d's concept of Post-colonialism, which theories see cultural imperialism as the cultural legacy of colonialism or forms of Western hegemony. Media effect study which integrated with political-economy traditional is the core argument of cultural imperialism. There are two opposite effects of media study. The negative one is that Western media imposes socio-political conflicts to the developing country and the latter one's resistance to the media effects to preserve their traditional cultural identities.&lt;ref&gt;G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), ''American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects are the issues of the process of civilization such as women's right or racial equality with exposing to Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). ''Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; Now the term of cultural imperialism usually refers to America's global culture expansion to the rest of world, which include brand name products, video media, fast food and so on.

=== Communication for development (C4D) ===
[[Communication for Development|Communication for Development (C4D)]] is a [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] oriented aspect of global communication studies that approaches [[Global Development|global development]] with a focus on action and participation for social change enacted through communication systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evaluating Communication for Development: A Framework for Social Change|last = Lennie &amp; Tacchi|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D underlines "voice, citizenship and collective action" as central values that promote citizen-led development where the visiting party provides guidance rather than direction within the host community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speaking up and talking back?: Media empowerment and civic engagement among east and southern African youth|last = Tufte, Wildermuth, Hansen-Skovmoes, &amp; Mitullah|first = |publisher = [UNESCO] International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, Nordicom.|year = 2013|isbn = |location = GÃ¶teborg, Sweden|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D often incorporates bottom-up theories of social change with the aim to create sustainable change which is believed to be more likely to occur if the efforts are planned, implemented, and sustained by community members themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some development workers and academics suggest that a shared definition of communication for development should be clarified, because disagreement within the field can detract from the characteristics that most scholars view as central to current development, including [[participatory action research]] (PAR).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many C4D projects revolve around media systems as a central site for social change,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which differentiates C4D from other approaches to development. Theories behind C4D highlight that development projects should be contextually situated and that communication technology will affect different types of social change accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Global media studies ===
Global media studies is a field of media study in a global scope. Media study deals with the content, history and effects of media. Media study often draws on theories and methods from the disciplines of cultural studies, rhetoric, philosophy, communication studies, feminist theory, political economy and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan, Daniel and Katz, Elihu (1992). ''Media Events''. London, England: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-55956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these study approaches, political economic analysis is non-ignorable in understanding the current media and communication developments. But the political economic research has become more resilient because of stronger empirical studies, and the potential connections to policy-making and alternative praxis.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Wasko (2009). Global Media Studies. Television &amp; New Media. Volume 10 Number 1 January 2009 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country has its own distinct media ecosystem. The media of mainland China is state-run, so the political subjects are under the strict regulations set by the government while other areas such as sports, finance, and increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face less regulation from government.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cfr.org/about/ Council on Foreign Relations.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has a well-developed media sector, but the mass media is threatened by the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism which hinder the form of Canada's media identity.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, John A. (1969). ''Mass Media in Canada''. The Ryerson Press. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the media in America are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenues from advertisings, subscriptions and the sale of copyrighted materials. Currently, six corporations (Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom and CBS Corporation) have controlled roughly 90% of the America media.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Lutz (2012) ''[http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6 These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America.]'' Business Insider. 14 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Such successes come from the policies of the federal government or the tendency to natural monopolies in the industry.

== Central debates ==

=== Global power shifts ===

[[Frog#Locomotion|Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s world system theory develops a basic framework to understand global power shifts in the rise of the modern world. Wallerstein proposes four different categories: '''core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external''', in terms of different region's relative position in the world system. The core regions are the ones that benefited the most from the capitalist world economy, such as England and France. The peripheral areas relied on and exported raw materials to the core, such as Eastern Europe and Latin America. The semi-peripheries are either core regions in decline or peripheries attempting to improve their relative position in the world system, such as Portugal and Spain. The external areas managed to remain outside the modern world economy, such as Russia.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/wallerstein_summary.php/ Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of global power shifts in the 21st century. One is traditional power transition amongst states, which follows Wallerstein's world system theory. For instance, the global power shifts from the West to the East since the rise of Asia. The other is power diffusion, the way that power move from states to non-states actors. For instance, "climate change, drug trade, financial flows, pandemics, all these things that cross borders outsider the control of governments."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/joseph_nye_on_global_power_shifts/transcript?language=en#t-832180/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global public sphere ===
[[Public sphere]] theory, attributed to [[JÃ¼rgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]], is a theory that in its basic premise conceives of [[democratic governments]] as those that can stand criticism that comes from public spheres. [[Public sphere]]s are places, physical or imagined, where people discuss any kind of topic, particularly topics of a societal or political nature. Global public sphere is, therefore, a public that is made of people from across the globe, who come together to discuss and act on issues that concern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of global public sphere is linked to the shift of public sphere, from restricted to nation-state, to made of individuals and groups connected across as well as within borders.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, it can be argued that philosophers have been thinking about versions of a common space for all people to debate in; however, a global public sphere that can fit the description above began to appear much later. In the second half of the 20th century, the legacy of World War II and technological advancements created a new sense of the global and started the economic and political phenomena that we now call [[globalization]]. This includes the expansion of humankind into space, which gave individuals the sense of a global unity, the growth of satellite technology, which allowed for people across the globe to view the same television channels, and the internet, which can provide access to an unprecedented amount of information and spaces to connect with other people.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Cultural industries ===
The term "[[culture industry]]" appeared in the [[post-war period]]. At that time, culture and industry were argued to be opposites.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditctab20103_en.pdf|title = Creative Economy 2010 Report|date = 2010|publisher = UNCTAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural industry|Cultural industries]]" are also referred to as the "[[Creative industries]].

==== Definitions and scope of cultural industries ====

In the present day, there remain different interpretations of culture as an industry. For some, cultural industries are simply those industries that produce cultural goods and services.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the cultural industries are regarded as those industries that "combine the creation, production and commercialization of contents which are intangible and cultural in nature. These contents are typically protected by copyright and they can take the form of goods or services". According to [[UNESCO]], an essential part of cultural industries is that they are "central in promoting and maintaining cultural diversity and in ensuring democratic access to culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity |title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cultural industries" combines the cultural and economic, which gives the cultural industries a distinctive profile.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, the "cultural industries" have recently been defined as a set of economic activities that combine the functions of conception, creation and production of culture with more industrial functions in the large-scale manufacture and commercialization cultural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Politiques-ministerielles/Etudes-et-statistiques|title = de la prospective et des statistiques|last = |first = |date = 2006|journal = DÃ©partement des Ã©tudes|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, economic activities involved in the preservation of heritage are also included in the definition of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/87-542-x/2011001/section/s3-eng.htm|title=Defining culture|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global cultural industries ====
Since the rise of the cultural industries has occurred simultaneously with [[economic globalization]], cultural industries have close connections with globalization and global communication.

[[Herbert Schiller]] argued that the 'entertainment, communications and information (ECI) complex were having a direct impact on culture and human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Culture Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science Press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Herbert Schiller|Schiller]] argued, the result of transnational corporate expansion is the perpetuation of [[cultural imperialism]], defined as "the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Cultural Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of transnational corporate expansion, which began in the 1970s with the emergence of [[Free trade zone|Export Processing Zones]] in developing countries, is focused on the development of [[global production networks]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Creative Industries|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Polity Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7456-4839-2|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=19â24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was described as a "new international division of labour" (NIDL) by the German political economists FrÓ§bel et al. (1980).

Ernst and Kim have argued that GPNs are changing the nature of the multinational corporation itself, from "stand alone overseas investment projects, to "global network [[flagship]]s" that integrate their dispersed supply, knowledge and customer bases into global and regional production networks", entailing a shift from top-down hierarchical models of corporate control to increasingly networked and collective forms of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Production Networks, Knowledge Diffusion, and Local Capacity Formation|last = Ernst,.D. &amp; Kim,L.|first = |date = 2002|journal = Research Policy 31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global media empires ====
The largest firms in media and media-related industries have a very high international profile.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Global media empires such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[News Corporation]], [[Time Warner|Time-Warner]] and [[Viacom]]-[[CBS]] now derive 25-45 per cent of their revenues outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Global Media|last = Flew.T|first = |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Basingstoke, UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often argued that the global media are dominated by a small number of powerful media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Herman and McChesney (1997) argued that the global media were "dominated by three or four dozen large [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporations]] (TNCs) with fewer than ten mostly US-based media conglomerates towering over the global market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Global Media: The New Missionaries of Global Capitalism|last = Herman,E.S &amp; McChesney, R.W|first = |publisher = Cassell|year = 1997|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Manfred Steger]] has observed that " to a very large extent, the global cultural flows of our time are generated and directed by global media empires that rely on powerful communication technologies to spread their message."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last = Steger.M|first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that during the last two decades, a few very large TNCs would come to dominate the global market for entertainment, news, television, and film.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Diaspora ===
[[Diaspora]] is often confused with [[wikt:exodus|exodus]]. Diasporas are minority groups that have a sense of connection with a larger community outside of the borders they currently inhabit, and through diasporic media create a sense of a larger identity and community, whether imagined or real.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In scholarly work about diaspora in communication studies, the view of nation and culture as interchangeable terms is no longer prevalent. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] theorized of hybridity, which he distinguished from "old style pluralism", "nomadic voyaging of the postmodern", and "global homogenization". Hybridity is the retention of an original identity and strong ties to an original country and tradition, but with the understanding that there is no unchanged, ideal nation of the past that they can return to. To be hybrid is to also adapt to a new culture and tradition without simply assimilating in it, but rather negotiating a place between the "original" and "new" cultures.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In Communication studies, diaspora is discussed as the identity that unifies people across time and space, sometimes existing in physical spaces and other times existing in imagined 'non-spaces'. However, it has been argued that the concept of 'diaspora' implies ethnic homogeneity and essentializes identity to only ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; One of the most cited and well-known works in the field of diasporic media is [[Hamid Naficy]]'s work on exiled Iranian Americans' creation of cable television in the United States.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Diasporic media refer to media that address the needs of particular ethnic, religious, and/or linguistic groups that live in multicultural settings {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . Diasporic media can be in the diaspora's traditional language or in another language, and they can include news or media from the "origin" country or they can contain the diaspora's local news or media. Diasporic media can be created in radio, television, film, music, in newspapers, magazines, and other publishing, as well as online. It can be argued that the development and spread of satellite television is an instrumental element of the growth of diasporic media today. Satellite television allowed migrants to access the news and popular culture from their homeland, as well as allowing people who speak the same language to access the same channels that might be produced outside of the "homeland"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diasporic Media Across Europe: Multicultural Societies and the UniversalismâParticularism Continuum|journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|pages = 481â498|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/13691830500058794|first = Myria|last = Georgiou|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary studies of diaspora show that diasporic media are part of the change in the tendency Immanuel Wallerstein described in his world systems theory. The world systems theory postulates that much of the flow of people in the world has been from the 'periphery', or economically-developing states, towards the centre; which are often metropolitan, economically-wealthy states that grew their wealth in colonialist entrepreneurship. However, contrary to the movement of people, the flow of information (including media products), has tended to be from the centre to the periphery.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Go with the Flow: Diasporas and Media|last = Sinclair|first = John|date = February 2000|journal = Television &amp; New Media|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Cunningham|first2 = Stuart|issue = 1:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology and media ===
The advancement of media and technology have played the pivotal role in process of [[globalization]] and global communication.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding the media|last = Devereux|first = Eoin|publisher = SAGE|year = 2007|isbn = 9781412929912|location = London, Los Angeles|pages = 28â30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cable television]], [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[digitalization]], direct broadcast [[satellite]]s as well as the [[Internet]] have created a situation where vast amounts of information can be transferred around the globe in a matter of seconds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

During the early 20th century, [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephony]], and [[radio]] started the process of global communication.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Media, Historic Development of|last = Monroe|first = E. Price|date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, Volume 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As media technologies developed intensely, they were thought to create, in Marshall McLuhanâ s famous words, a ââglobal village.ââ&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the worldâ s first [[artificial satellite]], on October 4, 1957, marked the beginning of technologies that would further interconnect the world.  The first live global television broadcast occurred when [[Neil Armstrong]] stepped onto the moon in July 1969.  In November 1972, pay TV caused expansion of cable when [[Service Electric]] offered Home Box Office over its cable system. By 2000, over direct broadcast satellite, a household could receive channels from all over the world. Now with the [[World Wide Web]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablet devices]], smart televisions and other digital media devices, billions of people are now able to access media content that was once tied to particular communications media ([[Input/output|print]], broadcast) or platforms ([[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], [[Film|cinema]]).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Justice ===
Justice in communication studies includes, but is not limited to, the concern with democratic process and fostering democratic publics  {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . [[JÃ¼rgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]] theorized of [[public sphere]] (in ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'') as the space that is created whenever matters of common concern are discussed between the state and civil society. Thus, public sphere includes not only the media, but also public protest in the form of marches, demonstrations, et cetera. There are, however, critiques of political economy in whose view it is impossible to work within the current system to produce democratic publics. Such a critique is that produced by [[Karl Marx]], who saw institutions such as parliament, the state, the 'acceptable' public sphere, economic enterprises, and so on as structurally produced and perpetuated by a capitalist system, and thus they can not be mobilized to change it. In such a system, there can only be illusory justice, which is fair only within the logic of the system. This illusion of justice is produced through dominating [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Justice and Communication: Mill, Marx, and Habermas|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|journal = Social Justice Research|date = 2009-02-19|issn = 0885-7466|pages = 134â155|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|language = en|first = Martin|last = Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue of justice in communication studies is the question of decolonizing research methods and theoretical discourse {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . The idea of decolonizing research comes from a rejection of the functionalist approach, which assumed that research can be conducted in a vacuum, free of ideology or the researcher's biases. This approach assumed cultures to be unchanging, homogenous, and isolated from each other. The purpose of decolonizing research and discourse is to 'uncloak' research as an unbiased power structure, and produce research that is more self-aware. The approach in decolonizing research methods attempts to create methodologies that treat the people in the study as participants or partners, rather than subjects - which is a term that in itself carries strong connotations of colonialism. Decolonizing research also involves moving away from Eurocentric models that are assumed to work anywhere else, and instead to create work that is more useful in local contexts. Decolonial approaches specifically seek to produce knowledge about the mechanisms and effects of colonialism. These approaches allow former subjects to 'talk back', which is a reflection of independent agency, on the colonizer's own terms of research, rather than to be 'given' a voice, which is an unequal power structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decolonial Methodologies: Social Justice Perspectives in Intercultural Technical Communication Research|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2190/TW.44.3.e|journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|pages = 297â327|volume = 44|issue = 3|doi = 10.2190/tw.44.3.e|first = Godwin Y.|last = Agboka|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tianxia'''''  ({{zh|c=[[wikt:å¤©ä¸|å¤©ä¸]]}}) or '''''All under Heaven''''' is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term for an ancient [[Culture of China|Chinese cultural]] concept that denoted either the entire geographical world or the metaphysical realm of mortals, and later became associated with political sovereignty. In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], ''tianxia'' denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the Emperor by universal and well-defined principles of order.  The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Imperial court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens, [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary states]], and finally ending with the fringe "[[barbarians]]".  

The center of this world view was not exclusionary in nature, and outer groups, such as ethnic minorities and foreign people, who accepted the mandate of the Chinese Emperor were themselves received and included into the Chinese ''tianxia''. However, as the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] in this context was a narrative device facilitating transitions between various ethnic Chinese political dynasties (with notable exceptions) this essentially made such people second-class citizens subservient to an ethno-Chinese polity. In classical Chinese political thought, the "Son of Heaven" ([[Emperor of China]]) ({{zh|c=å¤©å­|p=tiÄnzÇ|w = t'ien&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-tzu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}), having received the [[Mandate of Heaven]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|å¤©|å½}}|p=tiÄnmÃ¬ng|l=heaven decree}}), would nominally be the ruler of the entire world.  Although in practice there would be areas of the known world which were not under the control of the Emperor, in Chinese political theory the rulers of those areas derived their power from the Emperor.

The larger concept of ''tianxia'' is closely associated with [[civilization]] and order in classical Chinese philosophy, and has formed the basis for the [[world view]] of the Chinese people and nations influenced by them since at least the first millennium BC. ''Tianxia'' has been independently applied by other countries in the [[East Asian cultural sphere]], including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.

==Historical and political development==
The ''tianxia'' [[world view]] was not fully developed during the [[Shang dynasty]].  Only during the [[Zhou dynasty]] when Heaven took on human deity traits (or at least when references to Heaven as such enter recorded history) did the concept of ''tianxia'' become common.  Terms like "Four Quarters" and "Ten Thousand States" appear in texts of the time; the term "Four Quarters" ({{zh|c=åæ¹|p=sÃ¬fÄng}}) means territory established by the royal court and governed by the Zhou kings from the capital, but with peripheral non-Han tribes on the outer borders and Han Chinese in the center.  The term "Ten Thousand States" ({{zh|t=è¬é¦|s=ä¸é¦|p=wÃ nbÄng}}) refers to both territory and the subjects who reside therein, both Han and "barbarian".  The Zhou kings received and empowered these "Ten Thousand States" by virtue of the [[Mandate of Heaven]].  This is some of the earliest evidence of the [[Hua-Yi distinction]].

During the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States period]]s in the latter half of the Zhou dynasty, the power of the feudal lords developed rapidly, and several non-Han regions became powerful [[State (Ancient China)|states]] themselves.  As many of these feudal states had shared cultural and economic interests, the concept of a great nation centered on the [[Yellow River Plain]] gradually expanded.  The term ''tianxia'' began to appear in classical texts such as the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' and ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]''.

The territory and governments of the Zhou dynasty and the [[Qin dynasty]] were unified after [[Qin's wars of unification|the conquests]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]], and the concept of ''tianxia'' was adapted to act as an actual geographic entity.  Qin Shi Huang's goal to "unify all under Heaven" was, in fact, representative of his desire to control and expand Chinese territory. At the founding of the [[Han dynasty]], the equivalence of ''tianxia'' with the Chinese nation evolved due to the feudal practice of conferring land and autonomy upon the aristocracy to avoid having to expend military expense in their subjugation.  Although many areas enjoyed great autonomy, the practice established and spread Chinese language and culture throughout an even wider territory.

Unification theme applied to ''tianxia'' can be seen in [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' where the supreme goal of offensive strategy was to conquer without destroying that which you sought to conquer:&lt;ref name="TheArtofWar" /&gt;

{{Quote|text=Your aim must be to take All-under-Heaven intact. Thus your troops are not worn out and your gains will be complete. This is the art of offensive strategy. |sign=[[Sun Tzu]]|source=''[[The Art of War]]'', Chapter III, Line 11}}

Unified China fractured into many different nations during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and with it went the practical use of the term ''tianxia''.  When [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]] reunited China under the [[Tang dynasty]] in the 7th century, some northern tribes, after being made vassal, referred to him as the "Khan of Heaven".

By the time of the [[Song dynasty]], China's northern borders were met by the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-led [[Liao dynasty]], the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin dynasty]], and the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]-led [[Western Xia]] kingdom.  After being threatened by these northern states and realizing the possible effects of a war to the country and people, the Song rulers invented a false concept of kinship with the Jurchens in an attempt to improve relations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The Mongols divided Chinese citizens into two types during the [[Yuan dynasty]]: those of the south, and those of the north.  When the [[Ming dynasty]] expelled the Mongols and reunited China under Han rule, the concept of ''tianxia'' returned largely as it was during the Han dynasty.

At the end of the Ming dynasty, criticisms of [[Neo-Confucianism]] and its mantras of "cultivation of moral character, establishment of family, ordering the state, and harmonizing ''tianxia''" (a quote from the [[Great Learning]]) became widespread, producing large shifts in [[Confucianism]].  Contemporary philosopher [[Wang Fuzhi]] believed that tianxia was of a fixed, unchangeable dimension, notwithstanding the fact that the Great Learning's mentioning of "harmonizing ''tianxia''" was actually in reference to government. Using these arguments, Wang was highly critical of Neo-Confucianism.  On the other hand, the collapse of the Ming dynasty and the establishment of the [[Qing dynasty]] by the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], people previously considered "fringe barbarians", heavily influenced people's views of ''tianxia''.  [[Gu Yanwu]], a contemporary of Wang Fuzhi, wrote that the destruction of the State was not equivalent to the destruction of ''tianxia''.  He argued that the Manchus simply filled the role of Emperor, and that the ''tianxia'' of traditional Chinese culture was thus carried on.

The idea of the absolute authority of the Chinese emperor and the extension of ''tianxia'' by the assimilation of vassal states began to fade for good with [[Earl Macartney]]'s embassy to China in 1793.  Earl Macartney hoped to deal with China as equal sovereign nations, as [[Great Britain]] would with other European nations of the time, and to persuade the Emperor to sign a trade agreement.  The [[Qianlong Emperor]] rejected his request, and stated that China was the foremost and most divine nation on Earth and had no interest in foreign goods, and rejected the idea that Great Britain could negotiate with China as an equal nation.  In the early 19th century, Britain's victory over Qing China in the [[First Opium War]] forced China to sign an [[unequal treaty]]. This marked the beginning of the end for the ''tianxia'' concept.

Following their defeat in the [[Second Opium War]], China was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Tianjin]], in which China was made to refer to Great Britain as a "sovereign nation", equal to itself.  This made it impossible for China to continue dealing with other nations under the traditional ''tianxia'' system, and forced it to establish a foreign affairs bureau.

Because Western nations' system of international affairs was based on the idea that the sovereign nations dealt with each other as equals, China's traditional ''tianxia'' [[world view]] slowly collapsed.  After China's defeat in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the Japanese terminated Korea's traditional status as a protectorate of China, and the system of feudal [[enfeoffment]] and vassalage that had been practiced since the Han dynasty came to an end, a move that greatly changed attitudes toward the ''tianxia'' concept.  At the end of the 19th century, Chinese Ambassador to Great Britain [[Xue Fucheng]] took the traditional [[Hua-Yi distinction]] in the ''tianxia'' world view and replaced it with a Chinese-foreigner distinction.

==Non-Chinese uses of the term==

===Japan===
References to ''tianxia'' first appear in Japanese history during the [[Kofun period]], approximately 250 to 538 AD.  At the time, Japanese rulers were respectful and submissive to the Chinese court, and Chinese immigrants (then called ''toraijin'' æ¸¡ä¾äºº) were received happily and sought after for their knowledge of the [[Chinese language]] and [[Chinese culture|culture]].  The excavated Eda Funayama grave mound in [[Kumamoto]] contained an iron sword with engraved [[Chinese characters|characters]] that dates to the late 5th century.  The characters on the sword refer to the king of the time as the "Grand King who rules all under ''Tianxia''" ({{zh|c=æ²»å¤©ä¸å¤§ç}}).  This discovery demonstrates that the Kofun-era Japanese (at least of that area) had begun viewing their realm to be a complete and divinely-appointed ''tianxia'' in its own right, separate from the ''tianxia'' of the older and larger Chinese empire.

According to the ''[[Book of Sui]]'', the [[Yamato period|Yamato]] king in 607 sent a hand-written epistle to [[Emperor Yang of Sui|Emperor Yang]] of the [[Sui dynasty]] in which he called himself the "[[Son of Heaven]] in the Land of the Rising Sun" ({{zh|c=æ¥åºèå¤©å­}}), showing that the Japanese notion of their independent ''tianxia'' had continued to that time.

With the development of ''[[RitsuryÅ]]'' in 7th-century Japan, a Sino-centric concept of ''tianxia'' was introduced and replaced older concepts.  The hallmark of ''RitsuryÅ'' â the concept of [[citizenship]] â necessarily accompanied its introduction into Japan, since Neo-Confucianism said that all were "Equal Citizens Under Heaven" ({{zh|c=å¤©ä¸å¬æ°}}).

In the journals of  [[Fujiwara no Kanezane]] (è¤åå¼å®ãä¹æ¢å¼å®), an official of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] whose journals became the ''GyokuyÅ'' (çè), he describes the founding of the Shogunate by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] as "beginning ''tianxia''".  His usage of ''tianxia'' is entirely ''RitsuryÅ'' in nature, and his phrase "beginning ''tianxia''" refers to the establishment of a new nation, [[jurisprudence]], and system of order.  However, even if Yoritomo had the intention to become a monarch-level ruler, Japan's ''tianxia'' concept had not achieved the Chinese level of an Emperor who governed feudal kingdoms and was entrusted with the ordering of the world by Heaven.  In the journals of GidÅ ShÅ«shin (ç¾©å å¨ä¿¡), GidÅ records a discussion he had with [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] where the ShÅgun repeatedly referred to his dominion as "''tianxia''".  In the [[Muromachi period]], people gradually began regarding the ShÅgun as the representative of Heaven.

As the Muromachi shogunate weakened, regional warlords began fighting with each other for control of the nation.  More powerful nobles, such as [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], controlled large areas and viewed their domains as ''tianxia''.  The term was used with increasing frequency as generals sought to reunify Japan, and came to be equivalent with the land of Japan itself.

By the [[Edo period]], the ''[[shÅgun]]'' was referred to as "Man of ''Tianxia''" and the Shogunate as "Court of ''Tianxia''".  The widespread adoption of the ''tianxia'' concept helped influence Japan's long period of isolation before the [[Meiji Restoration]].

===Korea===
Based on epitaphs dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, [[Goguryeo]] had concepts of [[Son of Heaven]] (å¤©å¸ä¹å­) and independent ''tianxia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yeongkwang |first1=Jo |title=Status and Tasks for Study of the Foreign Relations and World View of Koguryo in the Gwanggaeto Stele |journal=Dongbuga Yeoksa Nonchong |date=2015 |issue=49 |pages=70â76 |url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE06520451 |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=ko |issn=1975-7840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ê³ êµ¬ë ¤ì ì²íê´ |url=http://contents.history.go.kr/front/hm/view.do?treeId=010201&amp;tabId=01&amp;levelId=hm_013_0010 |website=ì°ë¦¬ì­ì¬ë· |publisher=National Institute of Korean History |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of [[Goryeo]] used the titles of [[emperor]] and Son of Heaven and positioned Goryeo at the center of the ''Haedong'' "East of the Sea" ''tianxia'', which encompassed the historical domain of the "''Samhan''", another name for the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Em |first1=Henry |title=The Great Enterprise: Sovereignty and Historiography in Modern Korea |date=2013 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822353725 |pages=24â26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxAd2Aw_jP0C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, with the fall of the Ming dynasty in China, a concept of Korea as the cultural center of Confucianism, or the "[[Sojunghwa|Little China]]" ({{Korean|ìì¤í|å°ä¸­è¯|labels=no}}), emerged among the Confucian literati of the Joseon dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Stefan |title=Writing the Nation: A Global Perspective |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9780230223059 |page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIODDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] concept of ''tianxia'' as well as [[cultural identity]] originate in the [[Yuan dynasty]]'s invasion in the 13th century.  The [[Tráº§n dynasty]]'s defeat of the Mongol-Chinese armies gave them the confidence to adopt their own ''tianxia'' view and become the official sustainers of the Kingdom of Vietnam.  From that time forward, the area from the [[Lingnan]] region of China to northern [[Vietnam]] was considered an independent ''tianxia''.  However, near the end of the [[LÃª dynasty]] in the late 18th century, the orthodox idea of Vietnam as the Vietnamese king's dynasty fell out of favor, and Vietnam was referred to as "Great South" until the European conquests of [[Southeast Asia]].

==Western calques==
The "all under the heaven" expression became the origin for the literary expressions denoting China in a number of Western languages, such as the Russian ''Podnebesnaya'' (ÐÐ¾Ð´Ð½ÐµÐ±ÐµÑÐ½Ð°Ñ, i.e. "Under the heaven"). The English term "Celestial Empire" is said to have been based on the title of Chinese emperors, ''tian zi'' (Son of Heaven).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Weekley, ''An etymological dictionary of modern English'', 1967. Page 270. (The ''tian zi'' etymology for the "Celestial Empire")&lt;/ref&gt;

In a theological context, the ''world'' is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred spheres. "[[Eschatology|End of the world]]" scenarios refer to the end of human history, often in religious contexts.

The [[history of the world]] is commonly understood as spanning the major geopolitical developments of about five millennia, from the [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] to the present. In terms such as [[world religion]], [[world language]], [[world government]], and [[world war]], the term ''world'' suggests an international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of every part of the world.

The [[world population]] is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly, the [[world economy]] is the sum of the economies of all societies or countries, especially in the context of [[globalization]]. Terms such as "[[world championship]]", "[[gross world product]]", and "[[world flags]]" imply the sum or combination of all [[sovereign state]]s.

==Etymology and usage==
The [[English language|English]] word ''[[:wikt:world|world]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''weorold (-uld), weorld, worold (-uld, -eld)'', a compound of ''[[were|wer]]'' "man" and ''eld'' "age," which thus means roughly "Age of Man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html ''American Heritage Dictionary'' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512075921/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Old English is a reflex of the [[Common Germanic]] ''*wira-alÄiz'', also reflected in [[Old Saxon]] ''werold'', [[Old Dutch]] ''werilt'', [[Old High German]] ''weralt'', [[Old Frisian]] ''warld'' and [[Old Norse]] ''verÇ«ld'' (whence the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''[[wikt:en:verÃ¶ld|verÃ¶ld]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir (2003). ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology'' Leiden: Brill. pg. 462. {{ISBN|90-04-12875-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The corresponding word in [[Latin]] is ''mundus'', literally "clean, elegant", itself a loan translation of Greek ''[[cosmos]]'' "orderly arrangement." While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a "domain of Man" (compare [[Midgard]]), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the [[chthonic]] sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of [[creation myth|creation]] as an act of establishing order out of [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].

"World" distinguishes the entire [[planet]] or [[population]] from any particular [[country]] or [[region]]: ''world affairs'' pertain not just to one place but to the whole world, and ''[[world history]]'' is a field of [[history]] that examines events from a global (rather than a national or a regional) perspective. ''Earth'', on the other hand, refers to the planet as a physical entity, and distinguishes it from other planets and physical objects.

"World" was also classically used to mean the material universe, or the cosmos: "The worlde is an apte frame of heauen and earthe, and all other naturall thinges contained in them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R|last=Record|year=1556|title=Castle of Knowledge}} cited in {{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|at=World, sense 8|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230262?rskey=BRZMwD|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earth was often described as "the center of the world".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book|author=Sacrobosco|title=Treatise on the Sphere|year=1230|at=trans by Lynn Thorndike, 1949|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519151919/http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|archivedate=2013-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be used attributively, to mean "global", or "relating to the whole world", forming usages such as [[world community]] or world canonical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawpark.jimdo.com''World Canonical Texts'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, a ''world'' may refer to any planet or [[heavenly body]], especially when it is thought of as inhabited, especially in the context of [[science fiction]] or [[futurology]].

''World'', in its original sense, when qualified, can also refer to a particular domain of [[human]] [[experience]].

* The ''world of work'' describes paid work and the pursuit of a [[career]], in all its social aspects, to distinguish it from home life and [[academia|academic]] study.
* The ''fashion world'' describes the environment of the designers, [[fashion house]]s and [[consumer]]s that make up the [[fashion industry]].
* historically, the ''[[New World]]'' vs. the ''[[Old World]]'', referring to the parts of the world colonized in the wake of the [[age of discovery]]. Now mostly used in zoology and botany, as in [[New World monkey]].

==Philosophy==
[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' triptych by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] ({{Circa|1503}}) shows the "garden" of mundane pleasures flanked by [[Paradise]] and [[Hell]]. 

The exterior panel shows the world before the appearance of humanity, depicted as a [[flat earth|disc]] enclosed in a [[firmament|sphere]].]]

In philosophy, the term world has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up [[reality]] or the physical [[universe]]. In others, it can mean have a specific [[ontology|ontological]] sense (see [[world disclosure]]). While clarifying the [[concept]] of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of [[Western philosophy]], this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heidegger |first=Martin |title=Basic Problems of Phenomenology |location=Bloomington |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1982 |page=165 |isbn=0-253-17686-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.

===Parmenides===
The traditional interpretation of [[Parmenides]]' work is that he argued that the everyday perception of reality of the physical world (as described in ''[[Parmenides#The Way of Opinion (doxa)|doxa]]'') is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.

===Plato===
In his [[Allegory of the Cave]], [[Plato]] distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world.

===Hegel===
In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s [[philosophy of history]], the expression ''Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht'' (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.

===Schopenhauer===
''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' is the central work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].
Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.

===Wittgenstein===
Two definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. "The world is everything that is the case," wrote [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his influential ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', first published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=3 December 2017|first1=Anat|first2=Anat|last1=Biletzki|last2=Matar|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition would serve as the basis of [[logical positivism]], with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.

===Heidegger===
[[Martin Heidegger]], meanwhile, argued that "the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world".&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger (1982), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already "thrown" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of "[[world disclosure]]" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work ''[[Being and Time]]''.

===Freud===
In response, [[Sigmund Freud]] proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.

===Other===
Some philosophers, often inspired by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], argue that metaphysical concepts such as possibility, probability, and necessity are best analyzed by comparing ''the'' world to a range of [[possible world]]s; a view commonly known as [[modal realism]].

==Religion and mythology==

[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Yggdrasil]], a modern attempt to reconstruct the Norse [[world tree]] which connects the [[heaven]]s, the world, and the [[underworld]].]]
[[Mythological cosmology|Mythological cosmologies]] often depict the world as centered on an ''[[axis mundi]]'' and delimited by a boundary such as a [[Oceanus|world ocean]], a [[JÃ¶rmungandr|world serpent]] or similar. In some religions, worldliness (also called carnality{{citation needed|date=October 2018}})&lt;ref&gt;Hemer, C. J. âWorldly.â Edited by Geoffrey W. Bromiley. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised. Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1979â1988.&lt;/ref&gt; is that which relates to this world as opposed to other worlds or realms.

===Buddhism===

In [[Buddhism]], the world means society, as distinct from the [[monastery]]. It refers to the material world, and to worldly gain such as wealth, reputation, jobs, and war. The spiritual world would be the path to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and changes would be sought in what we could call the psychological realm.

===Christianity===

In [[Christianity]], the term often connotes the concept of the [[fall of man|fallen]] and corrupt world order of human society, in contrast to the [[World to Come]]. The world is frequently cited alongside ''the [[flesh (theology)|flesh]]'' and ''the [[Devil]]'' as a source of [[temptation]] that Christians should flee. [[Monk]]s speak of striving to be "''in'' this world, but not ''of'' this world"âas [[Jesus]] saidâand the term "worldhood" has been distinguished from "monkhood", the former being the status of merchants, princes, and others who deal with "worldly" things.

This view is clearly expressed by king [[Alfred the Great]] of England (d. 899) in his famous Preface to the ''[[Cura Pastoralis]]'':
{{quote|"Therefore I command you to do as I believe you are willing to do, that you free yourself from worldly affairs ''([[Old English]]: woruldÃ°inga)'' as often as you can, so that wherever you can establish that wisdom that God gave you, you establish it. Consider what punishments befell us in this world when we neither loved wisdom at all ourselves, nor transmitted it to other men; we had the name alone that we were Christians, and very few had the practices."}}

Although Hebrew and Greek words meaning "world" are used in Scripture with the normal variety of senses, many examples of its use in this particular sense can be found in the teachings of [[Jesus]] according to the [[Gospel of John]], e.g. 7:7, 8:23, 12:25, 14:17, 15:18-19, 17:6-25, 18:36. For contrast, a relatively newer concept is [[Catholic imagination]].

''[[Contemptus mundi]]'' is the name given to the recognition that the world, in all its vanity, is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from God by stifling our desire for the good and the holy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm Contemptus mundi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140237/http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been criticized as a "pastoral of fear" by modern historian [[Jean Delumeau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm Parish Missions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605035017/http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Vatican Council]], there was a novel attempt to develop a positive theological view of the World, which is illustrated by the pastoral optimism of the constitutions ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', ''[[Unitatis redintegratio]]'' and ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]''.

====Eastern Christianity====

In Eastern Christian monasticism or [[asceticism]], the world of mankind is driven by passions. Therefore, the passions of the World are simply called "the world". Each of these passions are a link to the world of mankind or order of human society. Each of these passions must be overcome in order for a person to receive salvation ([[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]). The process of theosis is a personal relationship with God. This understanding is taught within the works of ascetics like [[Evagrius Ponticus]], and the most seminal ascetic works read most widely by Eastern Christians, the [[Philokalia]] and the [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]] (the works of Evagrius and [[John Climacus]] are also contained within the Philokalia). At the highest level of world [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] is [[hesychasm]] which culminates into the [[theoria|Vision of God]].

====Orbis Catholicus====

''Orbis Catholicus'' is a Latin phrase meaning ''Catholic world'', per the expression [[Urbi et Orbi]], and refers to that area of [[Christendom]] under [[papal supremacy]]. It is somewhat similar to the phrases secular world, Jewish world and [[Islamic world]].

===Islam===
{{Main|Dunya}}
''Dunya'' derives from the root word "dana" that means to bring near. In that sense, "dunya" is "what is brought near".&lt;ref&gt;Attas, Islam and Secularism, p.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

===Hinduism===
'''Hinduism''' is an [[Indian religion]] and ''[[dharma]]'', or a way of life,{{refn|group=note|name="definition"}} widely practised in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It includes a number of Indian religious traditions with a loose sense of interconnection, as different from Jainism and Buddhism, and (since medieaval and modern times) Islam and Christianity. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world,{{refn|group=note|See:

'''World energy consumption''' is the total [[energy]] used by the entire human [[civilization]]. Typically measured per year, it involves all energy harnessed from every [[energy development|energy source]] applied towards humanity's endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector, across every country. It does not include energy from food, and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented.  Being the power source metric of civilization, World Energy Consumption has deep implications for humanity's socio-economic-political sphere.

Institutions such as the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA), and the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA) record and publish energy data periodically. Improved data and understanding of World Energy Consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns, which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions.

Closely related to energy consumption is the concept of total [[primary energy]] supply (TPES), which - on a global level - is the sum of energy production minus storage changes. Since changes of energy storage over the year are minor, TPES values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption. However, TPES ignores conversion efficiency, overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency (e.g. [[coal]], gas and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]]) and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms (e.g. [[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic]] or [[hydroelectricity]]). The IEA estimates that, in 2013, total primary energy supply (TPES) was 1.575 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; [[Watt hour|Wh]] (= 157.5 PWh, 157,500 TWh, 5.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s, or 13,541 [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]) or about 18 TW-year.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2015"&gt;{{cite web|title= IEA - Key world energy statistics, 2015 |url=ftp://ftp.energia.bme.hu/pub/energetikai_alapismeretek/KeyWorld_Statistics_2015.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000â2012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth. The use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth, followed by hydropower and renewable energy. Renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period. The demand for nuclear energy decreased, in part due to nuclear disasters (e.g. [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] 1979, [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] 1986, and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] 2011).&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="undp"&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/environment-energy/www-ee-library/sustainable-energy/world-energy-assessment-energy-and-the-challenge-of-sustainability/World%20Energy%20Assessment-2000.pdf World Energy Assessment] (WEA). UNDP, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, World Energy Council, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, expenditures on energy totalled over 6 trillion USD, or about 10% of the world [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Europe spends close to one-quarter of the world's energy expenditures, North America close to 20%, and Japan 6%.&lt;ref&gt;Nathalie Desbrosses, [http://www.leonardo-energy.org/blog/world-energy-expenditures World Energy Expenditures], Leonardo Energy, Nov. 28 2011 (accessed 30 January 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

World [[primary energy|total primary energy supply]] (TPES), or "primary energy" differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers. For instance, when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline, so that it can be used in a car, and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers. World final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the world's primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity.

Also, one needs to bear in mind that there are different [[Energy quality|qualities of energy]]. Heat, especially at a relatively low temperature, is low-quality energy, whereas electricity is high-quality energy. It takes around 3&amp;nbsp;kWh of heat to produce 1&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity. But by the same token, a kilowatt-hour of this high-quality electricity can be used to pump several kilowatt-hours of heat into a building using a heat pump. And electricity can be used in many ways in which heat cannot. So the "loss" of energy incurred when generating electricity is not the same as a loss due, say, to resistance in power lines

In 2014, world primary energy supply amounted to 155,481&amp;nbsp;terawatt-hour (TWh) or 13,541&amp;nbsp;[[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]], while the world final energy consumption was 109,613&amp;nbsp;TWh or about 29.5% less than the total supply.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2016"/&gt; World final energy consumption includes products as lubricants, asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel. This non-energy use amounted to 
9,723 TWh (836 Mtoe) in 2015.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2017"/&gt;

The United States [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) regularly publishes a report on world consumption for most types of primary energy resources. For 2013, estimated world energy consumption was 5.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; joules, or 157,481&amp;nbsp;TWh. According to the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] the total world energy consumption in past years was 143,851 TWh in 2008, 133,602&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2005, 117,687&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2000, and 102,569&amp;nbsp;TWh in 1990.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2015" /&gt; In 2012 approximately 22% of world energy was consumed in North America, 5% was consumed South and Central America, 23% was consumed in Europe and Eurasia, 3% was consumed in Africa, and 40% was consumed in the Asia Pacific region.&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;

===Electricity generation===
The total amount of electricity consumed worldwide was 19,504&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2013, 16,503&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2008, 15,105&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2005, and 12,116&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2000. 
By the end of 2014, the total installed electricity generating capacity worldwide was nearly 6.142 [[Terawatt|TW]] (million MW) which only includes generation connected to local [[electricity grid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Electricity - Installed generating capacity, 2014 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2236.html#xx|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition there is an unknown amount of heat and electricity consumed off-grid by isolated villages and industries. 
In 2014, the share of world energy consumption for electricity generation by source was coal at 40.8%, natural gas at 21.6%, nuclear at 10.6%, hydro at 16.4%, other sources (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, etc.) at 6.3% and oil at 4.3%. 
Coal and natural gas were the most used energy fuels for generating electricity. 
The world's electricity consumption was 18,608&amp;nbsp;TWh {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} in 2012. 
This figure is about 18% smaller than the generated electricity, due to grid losses, storage losses, and self-consumption from power plants ([[gross generation]]). 
[[Cogeneration]] (CHP) power stations use some of the heat that is otherwise wasted for use in buildings or in industrial processes.

In 2016 while total world energy came from 80% fossil fuels, 10% biofuels, 5% nuclear and 5% renewable (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal), only 18% of that total world energy was in the form of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/shell-scenarios-energy-models/world-energy-model/_jcr_content/par/textimage.stream/1510344160326/d62f12b8fe88e85dc3349c38b1ca5e44cc22c5ccc6f70beed634020cfb527c82/shell-world-energy-model.pdf pg4&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the other 82% was used for heat and transportation.

Recently there has been a large increase in international agreements and national Energy Action Plans, such as the EU 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas.&lt;ref name="undp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Global energy: perspectives"&gt;{{cite book |last= NakiÄenoviÄ |first= NebojÅ¡a |last2= GrÃ¼bler|first2= Arnulf |last3= McDonald|first3= Alan | date= 1998 |title= Global energy: perspectives |location= Cambridge, New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0521642000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such initiative was the United Nations Development Programme's World Energy Assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="undp"/&gt; From 2000â2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history, with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil. During this period, oil, coal, and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy. The following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period.&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;

[[File:Japan energy and GDP.svg|thumb|right|'''GDP and energy consumption in Japan, 1958â2000:''' The data shows the correlation between GDP and energy use; however, it also shows that this link can be broken. After the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 the energy use stagnated while Japan's GDP continued to grow, after 1985, under the influence of the then much cheaper oil, energy use resumed its historical relation to GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/chouki/index.htm |title= Historical Statistics of Japan |publisher= Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications |accessdate= 3 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The energy consumption growth in the G20 slowed down to 2% in 2011, after the strong increase of 2010. The economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth. For several years now, the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish Chinese and Indian markets, while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies, high oil prices, resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/energy-press-releases/sluggish-growth-world-energy-demand-in-2011.php|title=Sluggish growth of World energy demand in 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] data from 1990 to 2008, the average energy use per person increased 10% while world population increased 27%. Regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008: the Middle East increased by 170%, China by 146%, India by 91%, Africa by 70%, Latin America by 66%, the USA by 20%, the EU-27 block by 7%, and world overall grew by 39%.

In 2008, total worldwide primary energy consumption was 132,000 terawatt-hours ([[TWh]]) or 474 exajoules ([[exajoules|EJ]]).&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web |work= Statistical Review of World Energy 2009 |publisher= [[BP]] |url= http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20â%20Consumption'!A1 |title= Consumption by fuel, 1965â2008 |format= XLS |date= 8 June 2009 |accessdate= 24 October 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130726202544/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20â%20Consumption'!A1 |archivedate= 26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, primary energy demand increased to 158,000 TWh (567&amp;nbsp;EJ).&lt;ref name=EIAIES2015&gt;{{cite web |title= International Energy Statistics|accessdate= 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy consumption in the [[Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors|G20]] increased by more than 5% in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009. In 2009, world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 1.1%, or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent ([[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]), as a result of the financial and economic crisis, which reduced world GDP by 0.6% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/publications/world-energy-statistics-supply-and-demand.php|title=World Energy Statistics â Energy Supply &amp; Demand |publisher= Enerdata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This evolution is the result of two contrasting trends: Energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries, specifically in Asia (+4%). Conversely, in OECD, consumption was severely cut by 4.7% in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels. In North America, Europe and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], consumptions shrank by 4.5%, 5% and 8.5% respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity. China became the world's largest energy consumer (18% of the total) since its consumption surged by 8% during 2009 (up from 4% in 2008). Oil remained the largest energy source (33%) despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time. Coal posted a growing role in the world's energy consumption: in 2009, it accounted for 27% of the total.

Most energy is used in the country of origin, since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials. In 2008, the share export of the total energy production by fuel was: oil 50% (1,952/3,941&amp;nbsp;Mt), gas 25% (800/3,149&amp;nbsp;bcm) and hard coal 14% (793/5,845&amp;nbsp;Mt).&lt;ref name=IEA20109&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] and [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2009/key_stats_2009.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2009] oil page 11, gas p.13, hard coal (excluding brown coal) p. 15 and electricity p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the world's high energy resources are from the conversion of the sun's rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet. Some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy, some is directly or indirectly usable; for example, via solar PV/thermal, wind, hydro- or wave power. The total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter ''(see [[solar constant]])'', though it fluctuates by about 6.9% during the year due to the Earth's varying distance from the sun. This value, after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the Earth, is the total rate of [[Solar energy#Energy from the Sun|solar energy]] received by the planet; about half, 89,000&amp;nbsp;TW, reaches the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= William |last= Schreiber |url= http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/196/schreiber.html |title= Solving the Energy Problem |work= MIT Faculty Newsletter |date=MayâJune 2007 |accessdate= 2016-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary, with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 0.4&amp;nbsp; yottajoule ([[Yottajoule|YJ]]) or 4 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; joules, and the available nuclear fuel such as [[uranium]] exceeding 2.5&amp;nbsp;YJ. Fossil fuels range from 0.6 to 3&amp;nbsp;YJ if estimates of reserves of [[methane clathrates]] are accurate and become technically extractable. The total power flux from the sun intercepting the Earth is 5.5&amp;nbsp;YJ per year, though not all of this is available for human consumption. The IEA estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of $48 trillion and "credible policy frameworks."&lt;ref name="IEAreport"&gt;{{cite news |title= IEA estimates $48tn investments till 2035 to meet global energy demands |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-03/energy-supply-requires-40-trillion-investment-to-2035-iea-says.html |accessdate= 4 June 2014 |publisher= [[Bloomberg News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to IEA (2012) the goal of limiting warming to 2&amp;nbsp;Â°C is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes. If action is not taken before 2017, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017. Fossil fuels are dominant in the global [[energy mix]], supported by $523 billion subsidies in 2011, up almost 30% on 2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/English.pdf IEA World Energy Outlook 2012 Executive Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emissions ===
[[Global warming]] [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] resulting from energy production are an [[environmental problem]]. Efforts to resolve this include the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the [[Paris_Agreement|Paris Agreement]] (COP 21, in 2015), international governamental agreements aiming to [[Climate change mitigation|reduce harmful climate impacts]], which a number of nations have signed. Limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, thought to be a risk by the [[Stockholm Environmental Institute|SEI]], is now doubtful.

To limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees Celsius rise would demand a 75% decline in [[carbon emissions]] in industrial countries by 2050, if the population is 10 billion in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;EnergilÃ¤get 2050 by prof. Cristian Azar and Kristian Lindgren [[Chalmers University of Technology|Chalmers]] [[GÃ¶teborg]] {{sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across 40 years, this averages to a 2% decrease every year. In 2011, the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem. Hypothetically, according to [[Robert Engelman]] (Worldwatch institute), in order to prevent collapse, human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population (2009).&lt;ref&gt;''State of the world 2009'', [[Worldwatch Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenhouse gases]] are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption. Large amounts of pollutants such as [[sulphurous oxide]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[particulate matter]] (PM) are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass; the [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by [[air pollution]].&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/|title=WHO - 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomass]] [[combustion]] is a major contributor.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|title= Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|title=WHO - Household air pollution and health |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to producing air pollution like [[fossil fuel]] combustion, most biomass has high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfpi.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/PFPI-biomass-carbon-accounting-overview_April.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fossil fuels ===
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}

The twentieth century saw a rapid twenty-fold increase in the use of fossil fuels. Between 1980 and 2006, the worldwide annual growth rate was 2%.&lt;ref name=EIA/&gt; According to the US [[Energy Information Administration]]'s 2006 estimate, the estimated 471.8&amp;nbsp;EJ total consumption in 2004, was divided as given in the table above, with fossil fuels supplying 86% of the world's energy:

====Coal====
{{Main article|Coal|List of countries by coal production}}

In 2000, China accounted for 28% of world coal consumption, other Asia consumed 19%, North America 25% and the EU 14%. The single greatest coal-consuming country is China. Its share of the world coal production was 28% in 2000 and rose to 48% in 2009. In contrast to China's ~70% increase in coal consumption, world coal use increased 48% from 2000 to 2009. In practice, the majority of this growth occurred in China and the rest in other Asia.&lt;ref name="energisve2010Coal"/&gt; China's energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector, the majority of which comes from coal consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Damien. "China's Coming Decade of Natural Gas". ''Asia's Uncertain LNG Future, NBR Special Report''. November 2013. Retrieved 8 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

World annual coal production increased 1,905&amp;nbsp;Mt or 32% in 6 years in 2011 compared to 2005, of which over 70% was in China and 8% in India. Coal production was in 2011 7,783&amp;nbsp;Mt, and 2009 6,903&amp;nbsp;Mt, equal to 12.7% production increase in two years.&lt;ref&gt;Key statistics 2012, 2010 and 2006 IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

If production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008, proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years. This is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe. Coal is the largest source of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions in the world. According to [[James Hansen]] the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from [[Coal mining|coal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/true-cost-coal.pdf The True Cost of Coal] 27 November 2008 pp. 66â69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Energy in Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[Energy in Australia|Australia]] exported together 57.1% of the world coal export in 2011. China, Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan had 65% share of all the world coal import in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Key statistics 2012 IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Oil ====
{{Main article|Petroleum|List of countries by oil production|List of countries by oil consumption}}

Coal fueled the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century. With the advent of the automobile, aeroplanes and the spreading use of electricity, [[Petroleum|oil]] became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century. The growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973. After the oil shocks of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]], during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 US dollars per barrel, there was a shift away from oil.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, p. 792&lt;/ref&gt; Coal, natural gas, and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency. In the U.S. the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon. Japan, which bore the brunt of the oil shocks, made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world.&lt;ref name = "IEAKey"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2006/key2006.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= International Energy Agency |title= Key World Energy Statistics |year= 2006 |accessdate= 3 April 2007 }} pp. 48â57&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 to 2008, the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased. From 2003 to 2008, coal was the fastest growing fossil fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Page numbers needed on book sources --&gt;

It is estimated that between 100 and 135 billion tonnes of oil has been consumed between 1850 and the present.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090507072830.htm How Much Oil Have We Used?], [[Science Daily]], 8 May 2009. Retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Natural Gas ====
{{Main article|Natural Gas|List of countries by natural gas production|List of countries by natural gas consumption}}

In 2009, the world use of natural gas grew 31% compared to 2000. 66% of this growth was outside EU, North America, Latin America, and Russia. Others include the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. The gas supply increased also in the previous regions: 8.6% in the EU and 16% in the North America 2000â2009.&lt;ref name="energilÃ¤get2010G"/&gt;

Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from [[Renewable resource|resources]] that are not significantly depleted by their use, such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal power|tides]], [[wave power|waves]] and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thebulletin.org/myth-renewable-energy |title= The myth of renewable energy |work= Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date= 2011-11-22 |accessdate= 2013-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy is gradually replacing conventional fuels in four distinct areas: [[electricity generation]], [[solar hot water|hot water]]/[[space heating]], [[motor fuel]]s, and [[Stand-alone power system|rural (off-grid)]] energy services.&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;REN21 (2010).

Based on [[REN21]]'s 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$214 billion in 2013, with countries like [[Renewable energy in China|China]] and the [[Renewable energy in the United States|United States]] heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels.&lt;ref name="ria21-GSR2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title= Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author= [[REN21]] |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6SKF06GAX?url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archivedate= 4 September 2014 |year= 2014 |pages= 13, 17, 21, 25 |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries.

From 2000 to 2013 the total renewable energy use has increased 6,450 TWh and total energy use 40,500 TWh.

==== Hydro ====
{{Main article|Hydroelectricity|Hydropower}}

Hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by [[hydropower]]; the production of electrical power through the use of the kinetic energy of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which continues the rapid rate of increase experienced between 2003 and 2009.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with {{convert|721|TWh|PJ|abbr=on|order=flip}} of production in 2010, representing around 17% of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10&amp;nbsp;GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] in Brazil, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title= Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |publisher= Worldwatch Institute |date= January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|worlds top 10 renewable electricity producers]] are primarily hydroelectric, one is wind.

==== Marine energy ====
{{Main article|Ocean energy}}
[[Marine energy]], also known as ''ocean energy'' and ''marine and hydrokinetic energy'' (MHK) includes [[tidal power|tidal]] and [[wave power|wave]] power and is a relatively new sector of renewable energy, with most projects still in the pilot phase, but the theoretical potential is equivalent to 4â18 million tonne of oil equivalent (toe). MHK development in U.S. and international waters includes projects using devices such as, wave energy converters in open coastal areas with significant waves, tidal turbines placed in coastal and estuarine areas, in-stream [[turbine]]s in fast-moving [[river]]s, ocean current turbines in areas of strong [[marine current]]s, and [[ocean thermal energy converter]]s in deep tropical waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tethys |url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wind ====
{{Main article|Wind power|Wind power by country}}

Wind power is growing at the rate of 17% annually, with a worldwide [[Installed wind power capacity|installed capacity]] of 432,883&amp;nbsp;megawatts (MW) at the end of 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gwec.net/global-figures/graphs/ |title= GWEC Global Statistics |author= Global Wind Energy Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;Lars Kroldrup.

==== Solar ====
{{Main article|Solar energy|Solar power|Solar power by country}}

Solar energy, radiant [[light]] and [[heat]] from the [[sun]], has been harnessed by humans since [[ancient history|ancient times]] using a range of ever-evolving technologies. Solar energy technologies include [[solar heating]], [[solar photovoltaics]], [[concentrated solar power]] and [[solar architecture]], which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces. The [[International Energy Agency]] projected that solar power could provide "a third of the global final energy demand after 2060, while CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would be reduced to very low levels."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of [[photovoltaic system]]s and [[solar thermal collector]]s to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]]. From 2012 to 2016 solar capacity tripled and now provides 1.3% of global energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Geothermal ====
{{Main article|Geothermal energy|Geothermal power}}

[[Geothermal energy]] is used commercially in over 70 countries.&lt;ref name="INEL"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[MIT]] |title= The Future of Geothermal Energy |url= http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 7 February 2007 |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110310030646/http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf |archive-date= 10 March 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, {{convert|200|PJ|TWh}} of electricity was generated from geothermal resources, and an additional {{convert|270|PJ|TWh}} of geothermal energy was used directly, mostly for space heating. In 2007, the world had a global capacity for {{val|10|u=GW}} of electricity generation and an additional {{val|28|u=GW}} of [[geothermal heating|direct heating]], including extraction by [[geothermal heat pumps]].&lt;ref name="Renewables2006"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st century |title= Renewables, Global Status Report 2006 |year= 2006 |accessdate= 3 April 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |archivedate= 18 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEO"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Ingvar B. |last1= Fridleifsson, |first2= Ruggero |last2= Bertani |first3= Ernst |last3= Huenges |first4= John W. |last4= Lund |first5= Arni |last5= Ragnarsson |first6= Ladislaus |last6= Rybach |date= 11 February 2008 |title= The possible role and contribution of geothermal energy to the mitigation of climate change |conference= IPCC Scoping Meeting on Renewable Energy Sources |editor= O.

==== Bio energy ====
{{Main article|Biomass|Biogas|Biofuel}}

Until the beginning of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel, today it has only a small share of the overall energy supply. Electricity produced from [[biomass]] sources was estimated at 44&amp;nbsp;GW for 2005. Biomass electricity generation increased by over 100% in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. A further 220&amp;nbsp;GW was used for heating (in 2004), bringing the total energy consumed from biomass to around 264&amp;nbsp;GW. The use of biomass fires for cooking is excluded.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt; World production of [[Ethanol fuel|bioethanol]] increased by 8% in 2005 to reach {{convert|33|GL|usgal|lk=on}}, with most of the increase in the United States, bringing it level to the levels of consumption in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt; [[Biodiesel]] increased by 85% to {{convert|3.9|GL|usgal}}, making it the fastest growing renewable energy source in 2005. Over 50% is produced in Germany.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt;

[[File:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|World energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]]

Energy consumption is loosely correlated with [[Gross National Product#Gross National Product|gross national product]] and climate, but there is a large difference even between the most highly developed countries, such as Japan and Germany with an energy consumption rate of 6&amp;nbsp;kW per person and the [[Energy use in the United States|United States]] with an energy consumption rate of 11.4&amp;nbsp;kW per person. In developing countries, particularly those that are sub-tropical or tropical such as India, the per person energy use rate is closer to 0.7&amp;nbsp;kW. Bangladesh has the lowest consumption rate with 0.2&amp;nbsp;kW per person.

The US consumes 25% of the world's energy with a share of global GDP at 22% and a share of the world population at 4.59%.&lt;ref name="World Population Prospects"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://esa.un.org/UNPP/ |title= World Population Prospects |publisher= United Nations |accessdate= 7 February 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070321013235/http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |archive-date= 21 March 2007 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant growth of energy consumption is currently taking place in China, which has been growing at 5.5% per year over the last 25 years. Its population of 1.3 billion people (19.6% of the world population&lt;ref name="World Population Prospects" /&gt;) is consuming energy at a rate of 1.6&amp;nbsp;kW per person.

One measurement of efficiency is [[energy intensity]]. This is a measure of the amount of energy it takes a country to produce a dollar of gross domestic product.

The table to the right shows the amounts of energy consumed worldwide in 2012 by four sectors, according to the [[Energy Information Administration]] of the [[US Department of Energy]]:
*Residential (heating, lighting, and appliances)
*Commercial (lighting, heating and cooling of commercial buildings, and provision of water and sewer services)
*Industrial users (agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction)
*Transportation (passenger, freight, and pipeline)
Of the total 120 PWh ({{val|120e15|ul=Wh}}) consumed, 19.4 were in the form of electricity, but this electricity required 61.7 PWh to produce. Thus the total energy consumption was around 160 PWh (ca {{val|550e15|ul=Btu}}).&lt;ref name=EIA2016/&gt; The efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Energy efficiency measures and technological improvements. |url= http://www.e8.org/index.jsp?numPage=138 |publisher= e8.org |accessdate= 21 January 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070204112155/http://www.e8.org/index.jsp?numPage=138 |archivedate= 4 February 2007 |df= dmy-all }} Article by group of ten leading electricity companies&lt;/ref&gt; The new generation of gas-fired plants reaches a substantially higher efficiency of 55%.

Another report gives different values for the sectors, apparently due to different definitions. According to this, total world energy use per sector in 2008 was industry 28%, transport 27% and residential and service 36%. Division was about the same in the year 2000.&lt;ref name="energisve2010xS"/&gt;

'''World news''' or '''international news''' or even '''foreign coverage''' is the [[news media]] jargon for news from abroad, about a  country or a global subject. For [[journalism]], it is a branch that deals with news either sent by [[foreign correspondent]]s or [[news agency|news agencies]], or â more recently â information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as [[telephone]], [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] or the [[internet]].

Although in most of the [[English-speaking world]] this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.

At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the [[Newspaper|courants]] of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the ''Daily Courant'' (England), the ''Nieuwe Tijudinger'' ([[Antwerp]]), the ''Relation'' ([[Strasbourg]]), the ''Avisa Relation oder Zeitung'' ([[WolfenbÃ¼ttel]]) and the ''Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland &amp; C.'' ([[Amsterdam]]). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that [[nation-state]]s were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the [[telegraph]] made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (France), [[Reuters]] (UK), Wolff (currently [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]], Germany) and the [[Associated Press|AP]] (US).

[[War journalism]] is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).

== Foreign correspondents ==
{{Main|Correspondent}}

There are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the '''foreign correspondent''' (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the '''special envoy''' (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).

The correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.

The number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/network_tv_news_investment.php] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India: 

35 â ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, SÃ£o Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich

24 â ''[[New York Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, SÃ£o Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo

19 â ''[[Financial Times]]'' (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

17 â ''[[Washington Post]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, BogotÃ¡, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo

15 â ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo

13 â ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

13 â ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul

12 â ''[[The Hindu]]'' (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington  

When reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called '''stringers'''. Since they have no salary, stringers usually produce material for several different companies at once.

== News agencies ==
{{Main|News agency}}
A '''news agency''' is an organization of [[journalist]]s established to supply [[news]] reports to news organizations: [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. Such an agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire or news service. The bulk of major news agency services contains foreign news.

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">The '''world to come''', '''age to come''', and '''heaven on Earth''' are [[eschatological]] phrases reflecting the belief that the [[World (theology)|current world]] or [[Dispensation (period)|current age]] is flawed or [[curse]]d{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and will be replaced in the future by a better world, age, or [[paradise]]. The concept is related to but differs from the concepts of [[heaven]], the [[afterlife]], and the [[Kingdom of God]] in that heaven is another place or state generally seen as above the world, the afterlife is generally an individual's life after death, and the [[Kingdom of God]] could be in the present (such as [[Realized eschatology]]) or the future.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Hindu eschatology==
[[Image:Kalki.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kalki]] with his  white horse]]
{{main|Hindu eschatology}}
In Hindu eschatology the current age is the [[Kali Yuga]], a period of decline. [[Kalki]] ('Destroyer of Filth') will appear to purge all evil, beginning a [[golden age]] of [[Satya Yuga]].

There have been a range of dates predicted, purportedly from different methods of calculation.&lt;ref name="Chandra"&gt;{{cite book|last = Chandra| first = Suresh| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses | publisher = Kindle Edition| date = Aug 15, 2012| location = | pages = | url =   | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri [[Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami]], for example, wrote 400 years ago in his ''Divya Maha Kala Gnana,'' or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign. This is not a rare occurrence and last happened in early 2012, passing without event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Santanu Acharya |url=http://ww-iii.tripod.com/hindu.htm |title=Hindu Prophecies: Translations from the Kalki Purana |publisher=Ww-iii.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of arrival of Kalki has not been consistently asserted by astrologers.&lt;ref name="Chandra"/&gt;

==Jewish eschatology==
[[File:Resurrection of the Dead vision.jpg|thumb|[[Resurrection of the dead]], fresco from the Dura-Europos synagogue]]
[[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|''HaOlam HaBa'']], or "the world to come", is an important part of [[Jewish eschatology]], although [[Judaism]] concentrates on the importance of ''HaOlam HaZeh'' ("this world").  The [[afterlife]] is known as ''Olam haBa'', ''[[Gan Eden#In Jewish eschatology|Gan Eden]]'' (the Heavenly Garden of Eden) and ''[[Gehenna|Gehinom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jews are told to live their lives on earth to the full, as their bodies will stay there but their souls live on. [http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/jewish-afterlife-beliefs.htm Jewish Afterlife Beliefs at SimpleToRemember.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/afterlife.html Afterlife at JewishVirtualLibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba: The Afterlife at JewFAQ.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Talmud]], any non-Jew who lives according to the [[Seven Laws of Noah]] is regarded as a ''[[Ger toshav]]'' (righteous gentile), and is assured of a place in the world to come, the final reward of the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot M'lakhim 8:11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'', an 1887 painting by [[Victor Vasnetsov]]. The [[Lamb of God]] is visible at the top.]]
{{main|Christian eschatology}}
Under [[Christian]] [[eschatology]], the phrase is found in the [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use#1988 ecumenical version .28ELLC.29|Nicene Creed (current Ecumenical version)]]: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christian-bible.com/Exegesis/creeds.htm |title=The Nicene Creed |publisher=Christian-bible.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found in the [[King James Version]] of the [[New Testament]] at {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:32|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|10:30|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|18:30|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|2:5|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|6:5|KJV}}. Other related expressions are "age to come" which is typically found in more recent translations, [[Kingdom of God]], [[Messianic Age]], [[Millennial Age]], [[The New Earth]] and [[New Jerusalem]], and [[dispensation of the fulness of times]] and possibly also [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].

==Zoroastrian eschatology==
In [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[eschatology]], the world to come is the ''[[frashokereti]]'', where the ''[[saoshyant]]'' will bring about a [[resurrection of the dead]] in the bodies they had before they died. This is followed by a [[last judgment]]. The ''[[yazata]]s'' [[Airyaman]] and [[Atar]] will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and the molten metal will then flow across the earth like a river. All humankindâboth the living and the resurrected deadâwill be required to wade through that river, but for the righteous (''[[ashavan]]'') it will seem to be a river of warm milk, while the wicked will be burned. The river will then flow down to [[hell]], where it will annihilate [[Angra Mainyu]] and the last vestiges of wickedness in the universe.

{{War}}
A '''world war''' is a large-scale [[war]] involving many of the countries of the world or many of the most powerful and [[List of countries and dependencies by population|populous ones]]. World wars span multiple countries on multiple [[continents]], with battles fought in many [[theater (warfare)|theaters]]. While a variety of global conflicts have been subjectively deemed "world wars", such as the [[Cold War]] and the [[War on Terror]], the term is widely and generally accepted only as it is retrospectively applied to two major international conflicts that occurred during the 20th century: [[World War I]] (1914â1918) and [[World War II]] (1939â1945).

==Origin of the term==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cited the first known usage in the [[English language]] to a [[Scotland|Scottish]] newspaper: the ''People's Journal'' in 1848: "A war among the great powers is now necessarily a world-war." The term "world war" had been used in 1850 by [[Karl Marx]] and his associate, [[Friedrich Engels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1887/12/15.htm|title=Introduction to Borkheim|last=Engels |first=Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''The Class Struggles in France''. [[Rasmus B. Anderson]] in 1889 described an episode in [[Teutonic mythology]] as a âworld warâ (Swedish: ''vÃ¤rldskrig''), justifying this description by a line in an [[Old Norse]] epic poem, "[[VÃ¶luspÃ¡]]: folcvig fyrst i heimi" ("The first great war in the world".)&lt;ref&gt;[[Rasmus BjÃ¶rn Anderson]] (translator: [[Viktor Rydberg]]), ''Teutonic Mythology'', vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-uJRw32enFQC&amp;pg=PT237 p. 139], London: S. Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1889 {{OCLC|626839}}.&lt;/ref&gt; German writer August Wilhelm Otto Niemann had used the term "world war" in the title of his anti-British novel, ''Der Weltkrieg: Deutsche TrÃ¤ume'' (''The World War: German Dreams'') in 1904, published in English as ''The Coming Conquest of England''.

In English, the term "First World War" had been used by [[Charles Ã  Court Repington]], as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of [[Harvard University]] in his diary entry of September 10, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qi.com/infocloud/the-first-world-war The First World War] Quite Interesting Ltd. Encyclopedia. Downloaded Feb. 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "World War I" was coined by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on page 28b of its June 12, 1939 issue. In the same article, on page 32, the term "World War II" was first used speculatively to describe the upcoming war. The first use for the actual war came in its issue of September 11, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/3195322/world-war-grey-friday/ |title=Grey Friday: TIME Reports on World War II Beginning |work=TIME |date=September 11, 1939 |accessdate=20 October 2014 |quote=World War II began last week at 5:20 a. m. (Polish time) Friday, September 1, when a German bombing plane dropped a projectile on Puck, fishing village and air base in the armpit of the Hel Peninsula.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week earlier, on September 4, the day after France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, the Danish newspaper ''[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]'' used the term on its front page, saying "The Second World War broke out yesterday at 11 a.m."&lt;ref&gt;"Den anden Verdenskrig udbrÃ¸d i Gaar Middags Kl. 11", ''Kristeligt Dagblad'', September 4, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Speculative fiction]] authors had been noting the concept of a Second World War in 1919 and 1920, when [[Milo Hastings]] wrote his [[dystopian]] novel, ''City of Endless Night''.
Other languages have also adopted the "world war" terminology, for example; in [[French language|French]]: "world war" is translated as ''guerre mondiale'', in [[German language|German]]: ''Weltkrieg'' (which, prior to the war, had been used in the more abstract meaning of a global conflict), in [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''guerra mondiale'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''guerra mundial'', in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''verdenskrig'', and in [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð°Ñ Ð²Ð¾Ð¹Ð½Ð°'' (''mirovaya voyna''.)

==First World War==
{{main|World War I}}
It occurred from 1914 to 1918 and in terms of human [[history of technology|technological history]], the scale of World War I was enabled by the technological advances of the [[second industrial revolution]] and the resulting [[globalization]] that allowed global power projection and [[mass production]] of military hardware. Wars on such a scale have not been repeated since the onset of the [[Atomic Age]] and the resulting danger of [[mutually-assured destruction]]. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing alliances (the [[German Empire|German]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empires against the [[British Empire|British]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], and [[French colonial empire|French]] Empires) was likely to lead to a worldwide conflict if a war broke out. Due to this fact, a very minute conflict between two countries had the potential to set off a [[domino effect]] of alliances, triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large overseas empires virtually guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide, as the colonies' resources would be a crucial strategic factor. The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other's colonies, thus spreading the wars far more widely than those of [[pre-Columbian]] times.

[[War crimes]] were perpetrated in World War I. [[chemical weapons in World War I|Chemical weapons]] were used in the First World War despite the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] having outlawed the use of such weapons in warfare. The Ottoman Empire was responsible for the [[Armenian genocide]], the death of over one million Armenians during the First World War.

==Second World War==
{{main|World War II}}{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
The Second World War occurred from 1939 to 1945 and is the only conflict in which [[atomic bombs]] have been used. [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], in [[Japanese Empire|Japan]], were [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|devastated]] by atomic bombs dropped by the United States. [[Nazi Germany]] was responsible for [[genocides]], most notably [[the Holocaust]], the killing of six million [[Jews]]. The [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Canada]] deported and [[interned]] minority groups within their own borders, and largely because of the conflict, many ethnic [[Germans]] were later expelled from [[Eastern Europe]]. Japan was responsible for attacking [[neutrality (international relations)|neutral nations]] without a [[declaration of war]], such as the [[bombing of Pearl Harbor]]. It is also known for its brutal treatment and killing of Allied [[prisoners of war]] and the inhabitants of [[Asia]]. It also used Asians as [[forced labor]]ers and was responsible for the [[Nanking massacre]] where 250,000 civilians in the city were brutally murdered by Japanese troops. [[Non-combatants]] suffered at least as badly as or worse than [[combatants]], and the distinction between combatants and non-combatants was often blurred by belligerents of [[total war]] in both conflicts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The outcome of World War II had a profound effect on the course of world history. The old European empires either collapsed or were dismantled as a direct result of the wars' crushing costs and, in some cases, their fall was due to the defeat of imperial powers. The United States became firmly established as the dominant global superpower, along with its ideological foe, the Soviet Union, in close competition. The two superpowers exerted political influence over most of the world's [[nation-states]] for decades after the end of the Second World War. The modern international security, economic, and diplomatic system was created in the aftermath of the wars.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Institutions such as the [[United Nations]] were established to collectivize international affairs, with the explicit goal of preventing another outbreak of general war. The wars had also greatly changed the course of daily life. Technologies developed during wartime had a profound effect on peacetime life as well, such as by advances in [[jet aircraft]], [[penicillin]], [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and [[electronic computers]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Third World War==
{{main article|World War III}}
Since the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during the Second World War, there has been a widespread and prolonged fear of a potential Third World War between nuclear-armed powers. The Third World War is generally considered a successor to the Second World War and is often suggested to become a [[nuclear war]], devastating in nature and likely much more violent than the First World War and the Second World War combined; in 1947, [[Albert Einstein]] commented that "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Alice | last = Calaprice | title = The new quotable Einstein | page = 173 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2005 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | isbn = 978-0-691-12075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7406337/ |title=The culture of Einstein|publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been anticipated and planned for by military and civil authorities and has been [[World War III in popular culture|explored in fiction]] in many countries. Concepts have ranged from purely-conventional scenarios, to limited use of nuclear weapons, to the complete destruction of the planet's surface.

Among these are former American, French, and Mexican government officials, military leaders, politicians, and authors: Despite their efforts, none of these wars are commonly deemed world wars.

Wars described by some historians as "World War Zero" include the [[Seven Years' War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/07/01/why-the-first-world-war-wasnt-really|title=Why the first world war wasn't really|journal=The Economist|date=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the onset of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2087924-world-war-zero-brought-down-mystery-civilisation-of-sea-people/|title=World War Zero brought down mystery civilisation of 'sea people'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
