'''Bilingual education''' involves teaching academic content in two languages, in a native and secondary language with varying amounts of each language used in accordance with the program model.Bilingual education refers to the utilization of two languages as means of instruction for students and considered part of or the entire school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/curriculum_handbook/413/chapters/Bilingual_Education@_Effective_Programming_for_Language-Minority_Students.aspx|title=Bilingual Education: Effective Programming for Language-Minority Students|last=ASCD|website=ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilingual education program models==
The following are several different types of bilingual education program models:
*[[Transitional bilingual education|Transitional Bilingual Education]]. This involves education in a child's native language, typically for no more than three years, to ensure that students do not fall behind in content areas like mathematics, science, and social studies while they are learning English. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. The goal is to help students transition to mainstream, English-only classrooms as quickly as possible, and the linguistic goal of such programs is English acquisition only. In a transitional bilingual program, the student's primary language is used as a vehicle to develop literacy skills and acquire academic knowledge. It is used to develop literacy and academic skills in the primary language
* '''Two-Way''' or '''Dual Language Immersion''' Bilingual Education. These programs are designed to help native and non-native English speakers become bilingual and biliterate. The two-way bilingual immersion program has 90% of the instructions in grade K-1 in minority language which is less supported by the broader society and 10% in the majority language . This proportion gradually changes in the majority language until the curriculum is equally divided in both languages by 5th grade.  The two-way bilingual immersion program is based on the principle of clear curriculum separation of the two languages of instruction. Teachers do not repeat or translate the subject matter in second language but strengthen concepts taught in one language across the two languages in a spiral curriculum in order to provide cognitive challenge(Thomas &amp; Collier. 1997). The languages of instructions are alternated by theme or content area.  This type of immersion is required to develop the dual language proficiency, as social language can be mastered in couple of years, but a higher level of competency is required to read social studies texts or solve mathematics word problems, roughly around 5 to 7 years (Collier, 1987).

The United States Congress introduced the Bilingual Act in 1968 defining bilingual education’s term program. This program of instruction is intended for children who are not fully proficient in the English language. Instructions are given so pupils can achieve the necessary competence in English as well as their native languages taking into consideration the children’s cultural heritage. This could be integrated into the subjects or courses of study enabling the students to grow effectively throughout the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.uslegal.com/bilingualism/landmark-legislation/bilingual-education-act-1968/|title=Bilingual Education Act (1968) – Education|last=Inc.|first=US Legal,|website=education.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1968) was another meaningful measure for bilingual education. Title VII (Bilingual Education Act) created federal guidelines for bilingual education. The decree recognized the “''Special educational needs of the large numbers children of limited English-speaking ability in the United States''.” Said Enactment specified the federal government’s obligation to provide subsidy for creative bilingual programs. Title VII was amended many times since its introduction. The decree became part of the America Schools Act in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/transitional-bilingual-education-programs-pros-cons.html|title=Transitional Bilingual Education Programs: Pros &amp; Cons {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual Immersion classrooms encourage students but with the permission it may be enthusiastic &amp;' native language development, making an important contribution to heritage language maintenance and allows language minority students to remain in classrooms with their native English-speaking peers, resulting in linguistic and socio-cultural advantages (Christian, 1996b). As of May 2005, there were 317 dual immersion programs operating in elementary schools in the United States in 10 different languages(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005).

Dual Language programs are less common in US schools, although research indicates they are extremely effective in helping students learn English well and aiding the long-term performance of English learners in school. Native English speakers benefit by learning a second language. English language learners (ELLs) are not segregated from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005; Thomas &amp; Collier, 1997; Lindholm-Leary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; These students are taught in their mother tongue yet still in the typical 'American' classroom they need to be in, for both cognitive and social benefits. 
* Another form of Bilingual Education is a type of '''Dual Language''' program that has students study in two different ways: 1) A variety of academic subjects are taught in the students' second language, with specially trained bilingual teachers who can understand students when they ask questions in their native language, but always answer in the second language; and 2) Native language literacy classes improve students' writing and higher-order language skills in their first language. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. In this type of program, the native language classes do not teach academic subjects. The second-language classes are content-based, rather than grammar-based, so students learn all of their academic subjects in the second language.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlenm.org/what-is-dual-language-education.aspx|title=What is Dual Language Education?|website=dlenm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dual language is a type of bilingual education where students learn about reading and writing in two languages. In the United States, majority of programs are English and Spanish but new partner languages have emerged lately such as Japanese, Korean, French, Mandarin, and Arabic. The concept of Dual Language promotes bilingualism, improved awareness of cultural diversity, and higher levels of academic achievement by means of lessons in two languages.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"/&gt; 
* '''Late-Exit''' or '''Developmental''' Bilingual Education. Education is in the child's native language for an extended duration, accompanied by education in English. The goal is to develop literacy in the child's native language first, and transfer these skills to the second language. This education is ideal for many English learning students, but in many instances the resources for such education are not available.

==Myths surrounding bilingual education==
Many myths and much prejudice has grown around bilingual education. Researchers from the UK and Poland have listed the most entrenched misconceptions:&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB, Bator A |title=Perceived effectiveness of language acquisition in the process of multilingual upbringing by parents of different nationalities  |url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858 |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |pages=1–19 |year=2016 |doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* bi- or multilinguals are exceptions to the ‘default’ monolingual ‘norm’;
* in order to deserve the label ‘bi-/multilingual’, one needs to have an equal, ‘perfect’, ‘nativelike’ command of both/all her/his languages;
* childhood bilingualism may be detrimental to both linguistic and cognitive development and consequently lead to poorer results at school;
* exposing a child to more than one tongue may cause language impairment or deficits, or that for children already diagnosed with impairments two languages mean too much unnecessary pressure and effort;
*children do not have enough time to learn both languages, therefore it is better if they only acquire the majority language.

These are all harmful convictions which have long been debunked,&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/&gt; yet still persist among many parents. It is important to understand what constitutes the decision for sending children to a bilingual school. The decision should be based on, appropriate age, curriculum, and the preference of the child.&lt;ref name="biling"&gt;{{cite web|last=Racoma|first=Bernadine|title=The Pros and Cons of Sending Your Kids to a Bilingual School|url=https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/2014/03/the-pros-and-cons-of-sending-your-kids-to-a-bilingual-school-3924|website=Day Translations}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=June 2017|certain=y}}

In spite of these myths surrounding language education, there are numerous significant benefits to a child's development when exposed to secondary language education. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages has identified over twenty benefits to a child's development when provided adequate secondary language education, therefore debunking the vast majority of myths that may inhibit such education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crane |first1=John |title=When Will Public Elementary Schools in the US Finally Start Teaching Foreign Languages? |url=https://medium.com/@jcrane1/when-will-public-elementary-schools-in-the-us-finally-start-teaching-foreign-languages-6cbc2716161b |website=Medium.com |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==By country or region==

===Africa===
In the African region, Countries such as Mozambique have taken the lead in bilingual education. The Ministry of Education and Human Development has made primary education fully bilingual in 2017. Children will be taught 16 Mozambican dialects during their early years of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201503190228.html|title=Mozambique: Fully Bilingual Primary Education as From 2017|date=2015-03-19|work=Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique (Maputo)|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many African states introduce mother languages as subjects and education tools along commonly spoken international or foreign languages. Mother language instruction is terminated immediately during the schooling cycle and leaves only the international language established. It becomes a disadvantage that contributes to substantial lack of motivation on the part of teachers, students, and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/mother-language-education-africa|title=Mother language education in Africa|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{expand section|date=May 2016|1=e.g., [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-30424-3_122], [http://www.edqual.org/publications/published-research/clegg07.pdf.1], [http://www.praesa.org.za/files/2012/07/Paper6.pdf], [https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/sites/teacheng/files/C413%20Juba%20Publication_FINAL_WEB%20ONLY%20v3.pdf], [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMoWyso1vuQC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIIzAA], [https://books.google.com/books?id=D6iIlllyNCEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIRTAG], etc.}}

====Senegal====
Although bilingual schools exist, the majority of Senegalese schools teach in French and follow the French system. However, studies have shown that approximately 80% of teachers use a 'local language' in order to communicate with all of their students.&lt;ref name="World Data on Education, Senegal"&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. International Bureau of Education. [http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Senegal.pdf "World Data on Education, Senegal"]. UNESCO-IBE, 2010. Web. (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
[[Asia]] is the [[Earth|Earth's]] largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|eastern]] and [[northern hemisphere]]s. It includes a large number of countries, some of which are grouped into subregions.

====China====
In the [[Autonomous regions of China]] many children of the country's major ethnic minorities attend public schools where the medium of instructions is the local language, such as e.g. [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] or [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]. Traditionally, the textbooks there were little different from merely a translated version of the books used in the Chinese schools throughout the country; however, as of 2001, a move was on foot to create more teaching materials with locally based content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

|publisher= Springer|year= 2004
|isbn= 978-1-4020-8038-8|pages =119–120}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as second language are also offered in these minority schools, and the central government makes increasing efforts to make them more effective. A law passed in February 2001 provided for the Mandarin-as-second-language classes in the ethnic-minority schools to start in the early years of elementary school whenever local conditions permit, rather than in the senior years of elementary school, as it was practiced before.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it has been reported that Chinese has been used as the medium of instructions in some [[Autonomous county|autonomous counties]] even though less than 50% of the population "spoke and understood some Chinese"; this mismatch was thought to have contributed to the low grades earned by the students on the math and Chinese exams.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hong Kong =====
In [[Hong Kong]] where both [[English language|English]] and [[Cantonese]] are official, both languages are taught in school and are mandatory subjects. Either English or Cantonese is used as the medium of instruction for other subjects. Increasingly, there are a large number of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]-speaking schools in operation throughout Hong Kong as well since 1996. Study of Mandarin is mandatory in junior years (from Grade 1 to Grade 9). Hong Kong also has a bilingual education program using both Cantonese and Hong Kong Sign Language.

=====Macao=====
Chinese and Portuguese are the official languages of [[Macau]], but English plays an unofficial and highly prominent role. English is the language of instruction at the University of Macau and at some secondary schools. Other schools use Cantonese as the language of instruction. {{as of|2013}} there was one Portuguese-medium school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageonthemove.com/multilingual-macau/|title=Multilingual Macau|date=April 22, 2013|publisher=languageonthemove.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
{{More citations needed|date=March 2007}}
In Japan, the need for bilingualism (mostly Japanese and English) has been pointed out, and there are some scholars who advocate teaching children subjects such as mathematics using English rather than Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japansociology.com/2013/06/08/bilingual-education-in-japan/|title=Bilingual Education in Japan|date=2013-06-08|work=JAPANsociology|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this proposal, subjects such as history, however, would be taught solely in Japanese.

On the island of [[Hokkaido]], the indigenous and endangered [[Ainu language]] is receiving newfound interest with establishment of a small number of bilingual Ainu-Japanese elementary schools.

The largest non-Japanese, non-native to Japan minority are the [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]]. Bilingual education in [[Korean language]] is provided by Korean international schools, more of which are affiliated with [[Chongryon]].

====Middle East====

=====The Arab World=====
Schools in the [[Middle East]] follow dual or triple language programmes.  The triple language programme is most commonly found in [[Lebanon]], [[Tunisia]], [[Syria]], and often implemented as well in [[Egypt]].  History, grammar, literature and the [[Arabic language]] are taught in the native language (Arabic), whereas Mathematics and sciences are generally taught in English and/or French.  In Lebanon, however, science and mathematics are taught in either French or English, depending on the school's administration or the grade level.  It is not uncommon to find French- or English- only schools, though usually these institutions are primarily international establishments.

In most [[Gulf countries]] as well as [[Jordan]], English is introduced as a second language early on alongside the primary medium of instruction, Arabic.  In [[Iraq]] however, triple language programmes are, like in Lebanon and Syria, normal, except rather than using French, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is taught alongside Arabic and English due to Iraq's considerably sized Kurdish minority in the north, and bilingual official language policy regarding Kurdish.

In [[Morocco]], [[Berber languages|Berber]] can be used as a regional medium of elementary education, with widespread use of French and Arabic in higher grades. Due to Morocco's history of French colonialism, sole French-medium education is very widespread.

=====Israel=====
Normally, Israelis are taught in either Hebrew or Arabic depending on religion and ethnicity. Within the standard education system, thorough study of English is compulsory, and depending on the primary medium of education, Arabic or Hebrew are introduced as third languages with significantly lesser emphasis placed on achieving solid proficiency.  Within Hebrew-medium programmes, other foreign languages such as French, German, Russian, or Yiddish can often be studied as well.

Israel is also home to several international schools whereby the sole medium of education is either [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]]. In general, as English is taught early on across all Israeli schools, most Israelis become comfortably bilingual, much like what one would see in The Netherlands or Scandinavian countries. This in combination with a large proportion of English-language programming on television that is merely subtitled and seldom dubbed.

Recent peace initiatives have also led to a small number of bilingual and multi-religious schools in which both Hebrew and Arabic are used in equal emphasis.  The [[Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel]] runs four bilingual schools, and the [[Neve Shalom]] peace village also hosts a local school.

====Mongolia====
There has been long standing encouragement to teach at least one other language other than Mongolian. Traditionally [[Russian language]] was taught during middle school and high school. After the 1990 transition to democracy, English language has been gaining more ground in Mongolian schools. Today many public schools at all levels teach one other language that are usually English, Russian, Korean, Japanese or Chinese. Although the core curriculum is in Mongolian, it is generally encouraged by the government and the public that the students should have some command of a secondary language when they graduate from high school. Also there are other private schools that teach their curricula in English.

====South Asia====
[[South Asia]] is the [[south]]ern [[region]] of the [[Asia]]n [[continent]], comprising the [[Himalayas|sub-Himalayan]] [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) countries and, [[#Definition by South Asian Studies programs|for some authorities]], adjoining countries to the west and east.

=====Bangladesh=====
In Bangladesh, Bengali is the first language. However, it has a colonial past and English is widely used in administrations, schools, courts etc. Bangladeshi children start English as Second Language quite early in their age (mostly from age 5-6). In National Curriculum, English is given an importance and it is taught compulsorily until twelfth grade. There are Government approved curriculum as well as other international systems of Educations which maintains English as a 'medium of instruction'.

=====India=====
{{Main|Bilingualism in India}}
The official languages of the Union of [[India]] are [[Hindi]] and English, with 21 other regional languages holding co-official status, including: [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dogri]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Malayalam]], [[Meitei language|Manipuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu]].

Education in India follows the [[Three-language formula]], where children are to be taught English (or the medium of instruction in the school, grades 1-12), The Second Language (grades 1-10) is the Official language of the state (In most non-Hindi states) or Hindi (in the others), in a few states some schools offer a choice between the State Language and Hindi, and the third language (grades 5-8, often Hindi (in the non-Hindi states), the regional language of the state (if the student opted for Hindi as the second language,  a foreign language or Sanskrit). An exception is [[Tamil Nadu]] where only [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and English are taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

English-medium schools often find favour with parents, especially in urban areas, due to English's international prestige, India's Colonial heritage, its usage in Indian business and it being the medium of instruction in most Indian universities.

=====Philippines=====
In July 2009 [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] moved towards [[Education in the Philippines#Breakdown of the Program|mother-tongue based learning]] initially by issuing an order which allowed two alternative three-year bridging plans. Depending on the bridging plan adopted, the Filipino and English languages are to be phased in as the language of instruction beginning in the third and fourth grades.&lt;ref&gt;.

In 2007, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed a directive in Spain that would reintroduce teaching and learning the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getrealphilippines.com/blog/2012/07/re-introduction-of-spanish-mandated-by-arroyo-in-2007-trumpeted-by-bs-aquino-today/|title=Re-introduction of Spanish mandated by Arroyo in 2007, trumpeted by BS Aquino today|date=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order, Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007, issued on November 29, 2007, ordered the Department of Education to encourage the teaching and learning of the Spanish language throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/2007/11/29/memorandum-order-no-276-s-2007/|title= Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007|date=November 29, 2007|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Government of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Singapore=====
In Singapore, education is bilingual. The medium of instruction is in English and the learning of the mother tongue is compulsory. The mother tongue subject is usually [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the other official languages of Singapore. They are taught till pre-university level. Previously, students either attended an English-medium or a "vernacular school", which taught in one of the mother tongues. In 1960, government legislation standardised the primary medium of instruction to English, with the different vernacular languages ("mother tongue") allocated as the second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Development of Education in Singapore since 1965|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1121703274255/1439264-1153425508901/Development_Edu_Singapore_draft.pdf |accessdate=29 November 2012 |work= Associate Professor Goh Chor Boon and Professor S. Gopinathan|publisher=National Institute of Education | date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students may also choose to learn a third language (German, French, Japanese, etc.) in secondary school and junior college or, if their respective school does not offer the language, at a [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|MOE]] Language Centre. This option is limited however, to the top 10% of any PSLE cohort; prospective third language students must have also scored A grades for English and their second language. Singaporean students returning from abroad who did not learn a second language may be exempted from their mother tongue and learn another second language in place of the mother tongue; however, such exemptions are rare and only granted on a case-to-case basis.

=====Thailand and Malaysia=====
Since the mid-1990s bilingual approaches to schooling and higher education have become popular in parts of [[South-east Asia]], especially in [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] where different models have been applied, from L2 immersion (content taught in a non-native language) to parallel immersion, where core subjects are taught in both the mother-tongue and a second language (usually English).

English has been taught in schools in Malaysia as it is a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country (former British colony). During the 1980s to 1990s, when schools were nationalised under the government of Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]], English became a second language instead of the primary language of instruction. The Malaysian government reversed its decision to have Maths and Science taught in English, but is implementing different programmes designed to improve English language teaching within schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia drops English language teaching|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/10/malaysia-tefl|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision has raised numerous debates, with various groups arguing for and against the use of English in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The sad state of English in Malaysia|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/malaysia/sad-state-english-malaysia|publisher=[[AsiaOne]]|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the existence of vernacular schools and prominent usage of dialects, some Chinese and Indian children become trilingual, speaking Malay, English and their mother tongue or dialect. However, English is still widely spoken as a [[de facto]] language of trade and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Language Development in Singapore and Malaysia|chapter=The Malaysian Sociolinguistic Situation:An Overview|page=7|first1=Irene F.H.|last1=Wong|first2=Henry|last2=Thambyrajah|editor-first=Anna|editor-last=Kwan-Terry|date=1991|publisher=[[NUS Press|Singapore University Press]]|isbn=9789971691493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulties and disputes characteristic of the US experience have not been replicated in these Asian countries, though they are not without controversy.  Generally, it can be said that there is widespread acknowledgment of the need to improve English competence in the population, and bilingual approaches, where language is taught through subject content, are seen to be the most effective means of attaining this.  The most significant limiting factors are the shortage of teachers linguistically competent to teach in a second language and the costs involved in use of expatriate native speakers for this purpose.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], some schools teach bilingual programs which cater to children speaking languages other than English. Baldauf&lt;ref&gt;(2005)&lt;/ref&gt; explains that these programs are now beginning to benefit from more government support. Bilingual education for Indigenous students, however, has only received intermittent official backing. In the Northern Territory, for example, bilingual programs for Indigenous students begun with Federal Government support in the early 1970s, but by December 1998 the Northern Territory Government had announced its decision to shift $3 million away from the 29 bilingual programs to a Territory-wide program teaching English as a second language. Within 12 months though the government had softened its position. Most bilingual programs were allowed to continue under the guise of two-way education. Then on 24 August 2005, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced that the government would be "revitalizing bi-lingual education" at 15 Community Education Centres: [[Alekerange, Northern Territory|Alekerange]], [[Angurugu, Northern Territory|Angurugu]], [[Borroloola, Northern Territory|Borroloola]], [[Gapuwiyak, Northern Territory|Gapuwiyak]], [[Gunbalanya, Northern Territory|Gunbalanya]], [[Kalkaringi, Northern Territory|Kalkaringi]], [[Lajamanu, Northern Territory|Lajamanu]], [[Maningrida, Northern Territory|Maningrida]], [[Milingimbi Island|Milingimbi]], [[Ramingining, Northern Territory|Ramingining]], [[Ngkurr, Northern Territory|Ngkurr]], Shepherdson College, [[Numbulwar, Northern Territory|Numbulwar]], [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] and [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]]. This revitalisation is conceived as part of an effort aimed at "providing effective education from pre-school through to senior secondary at each of the Territory's 15 Community Education Centres". As Harris &amp; Devlin (1986) observe, "Aboriginal bilingual education in Australia represents much more than a range of education programs. It has been a measure of non-Aboriginal commitment to either assimilation or cultural pluralism". In 2008 it again shifted with the government attempting to force the nine remaining bilingual schools to teach the first four hours of classes in English.

===Europe===
The ''[[European Schools]]'' group is a network of thirteen private schools in EU countries that provide multilingual and multicultural education at nursery, primary and secondary levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Locations of the European Schools |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/locations |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Organisation of studies |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/studies/studies-organisation |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]] has three official languages: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. The constitution guarantees free education, so private schools can use any language, but state(-recognised) schools teach in the language of the language area where it is located. For [[Brussels]], which is an officially bilingual French-Dutch area, schools use either Dutch or French as medium.

Even though Belgium has two major languages (Dutch in Flanders, and French in Wallonia), bilingual instruction does rarely occur since Belgian law only permits education in one official language. In Flanders, bilingual instruction is only allowed as a short-term project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=Exploring bilingualism in a monolingual school system: insights from Turkish and native students from Belgian schools|journal=British Journal of Sociology of Education|date=1 May 2010|volume=31|issue=3|pages=307–321|doi=10.1080/01425691003700540|url=https://ugent.academia.edu/OrhanAgirdag/Papers/202294/Exploring_Bilingualism_In_a_Monolingual_School_System_Insights_From_Turkish_and_Native_Students_From_Belgian_Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
{{See also|Language policy in France}}
[[France]] has one official language, [[French language|French]]. However, regional provincial languages including [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have charter protection, and bilingual education programmes and regional language course electives have been established. However, due to the strict French-language policy imposed by national government, there is no centrally allocated funding for any of these programmes. All funding is at the municipal level, with many of the regional languages face extreme endangerment. France is known for wanting to maintain its lingual and cultural roots, and speaking a language other than French or mixing French with other languages is looked down on. This is apparent the French educational system, where French is highly prioritized over other languages and emphasis is put not only on the maintenance of the French language, but also on pushing students not to integrate French with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costa|first=James|date=6 Mar 2010|title=France and Language (s): Old Policies and New Challenges in Education. Towards a Renewed Framework?|url=|journal=Archive ouverte en Sciences de l'Homme et de la Société|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
In the [[Netherlands]], there are around 100 bilingual schools. In these schools, the first language is Dutch, whereas the second language is usually English and occasionally German. In the province of [[Friesland]], where [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is an official language, some primary schools are trilingual, teaching in Dutch, West Frisian, and English. Most bilingual secondary schools are TVWO (Bilingual Preparatory Scientific Education), but THAVO (Bilingual Higher General Secondary Education) and TVMBO-TL (Bilingual Preparatory Vocational Education - Theoretical Learning Pathway)&lt;ref&gt;TVMBO-TL was recently introduced at O.R.S. Lek en Linge, Culemborg https://www.lekenlinge.nl/downloaddocument?pid=163&amp;doc=KDEyKS10d2VldGFsaWctdm1iby10LnBkZg==&lt;/ref&gt; have been introduced, too.

====Republic of Ireland====
The Republic of Ireland has two official languages, [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. With the [[Irish language]] facing endangerment, as well as the presence of regions where Irish is still spoken as native (referred to as the [[Gaeltacht]]), the [[Irish constitution]] protects and reserves the right for education to be established through the medium of either official language, and it thus is.

An Irish-medium school is referred to as [[Gaelscoil]] (plural, Gaelscoileanna) This movement has been met with some success in that 10% of the schooling in Ireland is conducted in Irish. The movement has also been successful in setting up schools in both urban and rural areas, ranging from Dublin and Cork, to the traditional Gaeltacht regions.

====Spain====

=====Andalusia=====
In [[Andalusia]] (Spain's second southernmost region), things have changed drastically concerning bilingual education since the introduction of the Plurilingualism Promotion Plan by the autonomous government. The plan was born as the realization for the Andalusian territory of the European language policies regarding the teaching and learning of languages. With special strength in the past ten years bilingual education has worked at most elementary schools.

In addition to this new European scene, the Scheme for the Promotion of Plurilingualism has learned a lot from the first experimental bilingual sections set up in some schools by the Andalusian government in 1998. Following the content-based approach, French and German were used to partly teach other subjects. This successful experience, as show the international tests that the students have been given, is the starting point for a more ambitious scene, where 400 schools will be involved in the next four years, more languages, especially English, will take part, and a lot of investigation and implementation of the Integrated Curriculum of languages must be carried out.

Being aware of the necessity of the Andalusian people to adapt to the new scenario, a major government plan, called "strategies for the second modernization of Andalusia", was designed in 2003. The document also underlined language diversity as a source of richness and a valuable heritage of humankind which needs to be looked after.

It was then clear that a scheme was needed to carry out this new language policy in the territory, especially affecting education, with clear goals, timing and funding.

The scheme is to be developed through five major programmes and also an organization and assessment plan.

The programmes are:
*Bilingual schools
*Official Schools of Languages
*Plurilingualism and teachers
*Plurilingualism and society
*Organization and assessment plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205105956/http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-date=2009-02-05|title=Plurilingualism Promotion Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Basque Country, Navarre, Galicia, Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands=====
In addition to [[Castilian Spanish]] being the primary [[official language]] of [[Spain]], the kingdom also has several co-official regional languages which enjoy equal and unbiased constitutional protection and promotion: [[Catalan language|Catalan/Valencian]] (in [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]), [[Galician language|Galician]] (in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), [[Basque language|Basque]] (in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the northern zone of [[Navarre]]) and [[Aranese]] (in [[Val d'Aran]], [[Catalonia]]).

Many schools are bilingual in the regional language as well as Castilian at both the elementary and secondary levels. Regional universities also often provide programmes through the regional medium. Education in all co-official languages uses to receive both national and regional funding.

Unlike [[France]] in which regional languages face incredible endangerment and possible extinction, Spain's long-established approach to making regional bilingual education mandatory has served often as a model for both the survival and thriving state of the languages indigenous to the country.

====Sweden====
[[Sweden]] has one official language and five recognized minority languages,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is to great extent the only one of these in which education is offered. During the 21st century more and more schools started to offer national programs in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=The International School Consultancy Group|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom and dependencies====
The British Isles have several indigenous languages apart from [[English language|English]]. These include [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (official in Wales), [[Irish Language|Irish]], [[Manx Gaelic]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and the [[Scots language]] (which is sometimes considered as a dialect of English).

[[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and the [[Isle of Man]] have each established bilingual programmes which provide education through the medium of their indigenous language. Most often, except for the cases of Manx and Cornish, these programmes exist where the language is spoken communally as a first language.

=====Wales=====
Roughly a quarter of schoolchildren in Wales now receive their education through the [[Welsh medium education|medium of Welsh]], and children wishing to join a Welsh medium school ({{Lang-cy|ysgol Gymraeg}}) do not have to speak Welsh to go to one if they are young enough to learn the language quickly. Welsh medium education has met with great success across Wales since the first such schools opened in the 1940s. There are current plans to extend further provision in urban centres such as [[Cardiff]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Swansea]] and [[Llanelli]] to cater for growing demand; this has caused controversy in some areas.

Welsh-speaking areas use Welsh-medium education almost exclusively. Parents have a legal right for their children to receive education in Welsh, and each local authority caters for this. In the Western flank of Wales, [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Ceredigion]], [[Gwynedd]] and [[Anglesey]], most primary and secondary schools are Welsh medium or have bilingual streams. Some 75-80% of all pupils in [[Carmarthenshire]] and [[Ceredigion]] receive their education through the medium of Welsh, with this figure increasing in Gwynedd to around 90%.

In English-medium schools, the study of Welsh is compulsory and must be taught from age 5 to age 16 in all state-funded schools.

=====Northern Ireland=====
Irish Gaelic received official recognition in Northern Ireland for the first time in 1998 under the [[Good Friday Agreement]]. A cross-border body known as [[Foras na Gaeilge]] was established to promote the language in both Northern Ireland and the Republic.
The British government in 2001 ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Irish Gaelic (in respect only of Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, thus giving it a degree of protection and status somewhat comparable to the Welsh language in Wales and Scottish Gaelic in Scotland. This included a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters (whilst the Ulster variant of [[Scots language|Scots]], known as [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]], was specified under Part II of the Charter.)

The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 states: "It shall be the duty of the Department (of Education) to encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium education."

There are no Ulster Scots-medium schools, even at primary level.

===Americas===

====North America====

=====Canada=====
{{Main|Official bilingualism in Canada}}

======English and French======
In [[Canada]], education is under provincial jurisdiction. However, the federal government has been a strong supporter of establishing Canada as a bilingual country and has helped pioneer the [[French immersion]] programs in the public education systems throughout Canada. In French-immersion, students with no previous French language training, usually beginning in Kindergarten or grade 1, do all of their school work in French. Depending on provincial jurisdiction, some provinces also offer an extended French program that begins in grade 5 which offers relatively more courses in French. In this case the student takes French immersion until grade nine but may continue throughout their high school education. Similar English-immersion programmes also exist for Francophone children.

Education is generally monolingual in either English or French according to the majority population within which a school is located.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The second official language is introduced with allocated time provided each week for instruction in the language as a subject.

======Quebec======
Quebec is Canada's only legally monolingual French-speaking province. Based on section 59 of Canada's Constitution Act of 1982, provides that not all of the language rights listed under Canada's official bilingualism policy in previous section 23 will apply in Quebec. Specifically:

(1) In Quebec, a child may be educated in English only if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in English.

(2)In New Brunswick, Canada's only officially bilingual province, students have the right to education in the official language which they understand; students able to understand both languages have the right to education in either system.

(3) In the rest of Canada, a child may be educated in French if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in French, or if at least one parent has French as his or her mother tongue (defined in section 23 as "first language learned and still understood").

One practical consequence of this asymmetry is that all migrants who arrive in Quebec from foreign countries are required to place their children in French-language schools. This includes immigrants whose mother tongue is English and immigrants who received their schooling in English.

On the other hand, Section 23 provides a nearly universal right to English-language schooling for the children of Canadian-born anglophones living in Quebec.
Section 23 also provides, in theory, a nearly universal right to French-language schooling for the children of all francophones living outside Quebec, including immigrants from French-speaking countries who settle outside Quebec, and who are Canadian citizens.

Another element of asymmetry between Quebec and most anglophone provinces is that while Quebec provides public English-language primary and secondary education throughout the province, most other provinces provide French-language education only "where numbers warrant."

======First Nations reserves and Inuit settlements======
Canada also has bilingual programmes for [[First Nations]]' languages on numerous [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian aboriginal]] reserves in combination with either English, French, or both. Some programmes are gradually being established, whilst others are already long established. Most notable bilingual programmes that exist include [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Cree]], [[Blackfoot]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], and Pacific Coast [[Salish languages]].

Many of these programmes were set up in the late 1980s and early 1990s by academic [[linguists]] wishing to preserve the languages, respectively - especially in areas where there either is a healthy speaking base, or an endangerment of as low as two remaining speakers of a language. Prior to this, as late as the 1970s and early 1980s, First Nations and [[Inuit]] in Canada, as Native Americans in the United States, were forced into [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]] imposed on them by the Canadian government to integrate indigenous cultures into European-Canadian society. This came with the dramatic loss of the languages, religious beliefs, and cultures themselves due to widespread use of corporal punishment and mental abuse. As of 2010, new programmes are mushrooming across Canada to try to save what is left, but are often met with mixed success and funding challenges at federal, provincial, and reserve levels.

======Other minority languages======
In the province of [[British Columbia]], the city of [[Vancouver]] since 2002 has established a new bilingual Mandarin Chinese-English immersion programme at the elementary school level in order to accommodate Vancouver's both historic and present strong ties to the Chinese-speaking world, already in itself having a very sizeable Chinese population local to the city. Six Vancouver schools have thus far adopted the programme, and a secondary school track to continue thereupon is being designed. Other suburbs within what is referred to as the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]] are also considering adopting the programme into a small number of schools. Similar programmes are being developed for both [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] to serve in representing the large South Asian cultural community and its interests in the [[City of Surrey]]. By default, most schools in British Columbia teach through English, with French immersion options available. In both English and French-medium schools, one can study and take government exams in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] at the secondary level.

In [[Alberta]], the city of [[Edmonton]] has had a well established Chinese (Mandarin) bilingual education program ([[Edmonton Chinese Bilingual Education Association]]) since 1982. The program is currently offered in 13 schools throughout the city consisting of 6 elementary schools, 4 junior high schools and 3 high schools. Students enrolled in any of the elementary schools spend half a day learning in Chinese and the other half in English.

In [[Manitoba]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] communities have played an extensive role in the development and history of the province. Bilingual Ukrainian-English education programmes have therefore long been established, alongside smaller programmes introducing and implementing [[French language|French]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] in the town of [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], and [[First Nations]]' languages.

Private Islamic and Jewish schools across Canada also have bilingual and trilingual programmes that include [[Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]], respectively.

In [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] and other parts of [[Nova Scotia]], a number of secondary schools now offer the option of taking introductory courses in [[Scottish Gaelic]], as reflecting upon the province's both intimate and dark history with the Gaelic language and Highland Scottish diaspora.

=====United States=====
[[File:SER-Niños Charter School.jpg|thumb|[[SER-Niños Charter School]], a bilingual [[charter school|state charter school]] in the [[Gulfton, Houston|Gulfton]] area of [[Houston]], [[Texas]]]]
Bilingual education in the U.S. focuses on English Language Learners (ELL).

The emphasis on English rejects that the student has a dominant language as part of their identity and culture that will continue to develop with time. According to the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] website, a bilingual education program is "an educational program for [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] students". (The Office of English Language Acquisition, 2009).{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The term "limited English proficiency" remains in use by the federal government, but has fallen out of favor elsewhere. According to [http://www.bankstreet.edu/literacyguide/ell.html Bankstreet's Literacy Guide] this shift is due to the fact that the term ELL represents a more accurate reflection of language acquisition. The term "English language learner" is now preferred in schools and educational research to refer to a student whose first language is not English and who needs language support services in order to succeed in school.

In the United States, proponents of the practice argue that it will not only help to keep non-English-speaking children from falling behind their peers in math, science, and social studies while they master English, but such programs teach English better than English-only programs. For many students, the process of learning literacy and a new language simultaneously is simply an overwhelming task, so bilingual programs began as a way to help such students develop native language literacy first - research by Cummins,&lt;ref&gt;(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; a central researcher in the field, shows that skills such as literacy developed in a first language will transfer to English. Opponents of bilingual education argue that it delays students' mastery of English, thereby retarding the learning of other subjects as well. In [[California]], where at least one-third of students were enrolled in bilingual classes in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="'70s 270"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= |pages= 270–271|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been considerable politicking for and against bilingual education.

The very first instance of bilingual education in the United States occurred with Polish immigrants in the first permanent English settlement of [[Virginia]] in what is now the United States. The Poles provided the community with manufactured pitch necessary to prevent the sinking of ships, and glass works among other industries. When the [[House of Burgesses]] met in 1619, the rights extended only to Englishmen. The Poles, in turn, launched the first recorded strike in the New World.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"&gt;{{cite book |title= In Quest of a Cultural Identity: An Inquiry for the Polish Community|last= Seidner|first= Stanley S.|year= 1976|publisher= IUME, Teachers College, [[Columbia University]]|location= New York, New York|id= ERIC ED167674|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED167674&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED167674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In dire need of their skills and industries, the Poles received the "[[rights of Englishmen]]," and established the first bilingual schools with subjects taught in English and Polish.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"/&gt;  From this first documented historic beginning, bilingual education existed in some form or another in the United States. During the 18th century, Franciscan missionaries from California to Texas used indigenous languages for translating and teaching the Catholic catechism to Native Americans. By the mid-19th century, private and public bilingual schools had include such native languages as Czech, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.&lt;ref name="The American bilingual Tradition"&gt;{{cite book |title= The American bilingual Tradition|last= Kloss|first= Heinz|origyear= 1977|year= 1998|publisher= Newbury House|location= Rowley, MA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohio became the first state in 1839, to adopt a bilingual education law, authorizing German-English instruction at parents' request. Louisiana enacted an identical provision for French and English in 1847, and the New Mexico Territory did so for Spanish and English in 1850.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"&gt;{{cite book |title= Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice|last= Crawford|first= James|year= 1999|publisher= BES|location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, about a dozen states had passed similar laws. Elsewhere, many localities provided bilingual instruction without state sanction, in languages as diverse as Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Czech, and Cherokee.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt; Beginning in 1959, public schools in Miami introduced bilingual programs. In 1968 the U.S., with Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or, informally, the [[Bilingual Education Act]], Congress first mandated bilingual education in order to give immigrants access to education in their "first" language. The Act was amended in 1988.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt;  Federal spending on bilingual education jumped from $7.5 million in 1968 to $150 million by 1979.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

A 1974 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling, ''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'', gave further momentum to bilingual education.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;  Here, the Court held that [[San Francisco]] schools violated minority language students' rights when they educated students in the same classes as other students&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; without special provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/17_02/Bili172.shtml Bilingual Education Is A Human and Civil Right - Volume 17 No. 2 - Winter 2002/2003 - Rethinking Schools Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together, the [[Bilingual Education Act]] and the ''Lau v. Nichols'' ruling mandated that schools needed to at least provide some type of services to support English language learners, though neither specified what type of educational program needed to be provided.  As such, both bilingual and English-only programs flourished after the law's passage and the court ruling.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

The [[Bilingual Education Act]] was terminated in 2001 by new federal education policy, with the passage of [[No Child Left Behind]] by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. This law offers no support for native language learning, but rather emphasized accountability in English only, and mandates that all students, including ELLs, are tested yearly in English.

The majority of U.S. high school students in the United States are required to take at least one to two years of a second language.  The vast majority of these classes are either French or Spanish.  In a large number of schools this is taught in a manner known as [[Language immersion|FLES]], in which students learn about the second language in a manner similar to other subjects such as mathematics or science.  Some schools use an additional method known as [[FLEX (Language Teaching)|FLEX]] in which the "nature of the language" and culture are also taught. High school education almost never uses "immersion" techniques.

======Controversy in the United States======
In recent times there has been a lot of discussion about bilingual education. In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, [[Horne v. Flores]], the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI ([[Structured English Immersion]]) is significantly more effective than bilingual education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Proponents of bilingual education claim that it is not only easier for students to learn English if they are literate in their first language, but that such students will learn English better and become bilingual and biliterate.&lt;ref&gt;(see Krashen, 2002; August &amp; Hakuta, 1997; Crawford, 2000; Cummins, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; One study shows that English language learners introduced to a transitional bilingual program gained a fair amount of English comprehension and reading skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tong |first=F. |author2=Lara-Alecio, R. |author3=Irby, B. |author4=Mathes, P. |author5=Kwok, O. |date=2008 |title=Accelerating Early Academic Oral English Development in Transitional Bilingual and Structured English Immersion Programs |journal=American Educational Research Journal |url=https://doi.org/10.3102/0002831208320790 |accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents further claim that effective bilingual programs strive to achieve proficiency in both English and the students' home language. Dual language or Two-Way bilingual programs are one such approach, whereby half of the students speak English and half are considered English language learners (ELLs). The teacher instructs in English and in the ELLs' home language. The dual purpose of this type of classroom is to teach the children a new language and culture, and language diversity in such classrooms is seen as a resource. Programs in English only eradicate the native languages immigrants bring to this country, while dual language bilingual programs serve to maintain such languages in an "additive" context, where a new language is added without the first being lost. One paper states that two-way developmental bilingual education programs in elementary school have the most success in language minority students' long term academic achievement. These students will maintain their gains in academic performance in secondary level academic classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collier |first=Virginia P. |date=Fall 1995 |title=Acquiring a Second Language for School |journal=Directions in Language &amp; Education - National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education |volume=1 |issue=4 |quote=To assure cognitive and academic success in a second language, a student's first language system, oral and written, must be developed to a high cognitive level at least through the elementary-school years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study shows the positive results of a two-way bilingual education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and Second Language Learning |date=March 1999 |title=Two-Way Bilingual Education Programs in Practice: A National and Local Perspective |journal=Center for Applied Linguistics |url=http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/ed379915.html |accessdate=2008-03-14 |quote=Two-way programs provide both sets of students with ample exposure to the two languages, allowing them to progress academically in both languages and gain an appreciation of another culture. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314215044/http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/ed379915.html |archivedate=14 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that the transitional bilingual education method can improve development of the native language without hindering the development of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duran |first=L.K. |author2=Roseth, C.J. |author3=Hoffman, P. |date=2010 |title=An experimental study comparing English-only and Transitional Bilingual Education on Spanish-speaking preschoolers' early literacy development |journal=Early Chilhood Research Quarterly |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.10.002 |accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some mistakenly believe that once a student can converse in English (Basic interpersonal communication skills - BICS), they will naturally perform well academically (cognitive academic language proficiency - CALP) in English. It has been postulated that BICS and CALP are two different sets of skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   |last =Carrasquillo  | first =Angela L  |author2=Rodriguez, Vivian  | title =Language Minority Students in the Mainstream Classroom | publisher =Multilingual Matters Ltd. | year =1996  | location =Bristol, PA  | page =202 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED392281&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED392281  | isbn =1-85359-297-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of bilingual education claim that students with other primary languages besides Spanish are placed in Spanish classes rather than taught in their native languages&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; and that many bilingual education programs fail to teach students English.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; Critics of bilingual education have claimed that studies supporting bilingual education tend to have poor methodologies and that there is little empirical support in favor of it.

The controversy over bilingual education is often enmeshed in a larger political and cultural context. Opponents of bilingual education are sometimes accused of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]]. This is especially so in the case of such groups as [[English First (lobbying organization)|English First]], which is a conservative organization that promotes the stance that English should be the official language of the United States. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and other cities, Minister of education of the [[Young Lords]], Tony Baez and others held marches and other activities to promote bilingual education. Proponents of bilingual education are frequently accused of practicing [[identity politics]], to the detriment of children and of immigrants.
:"To aid and monitor the education of English language learners (ELL)through mother-tongue and English education, the federal government enacted the Bilingual Education Act (Title V11) of the elementary and secondary Education Act in 1968. As an offshoot of president Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, the act strove to help disenfranchised language-miniority students, especially Hispanics. Unfortunately, the acts aims were somewhat ambiguous. As Crawford (2000a) writes 'enacted at the apex of the Great Society, bilingual education act of 1968 passed congress without a single dissent. Americans have spent the past 30 years debating what it was meant to accomplish'." (p.&amp;nbsp;107).&lt;ref&gt;Ovando, Carlos J. (2003). "Bilingual Education in the United States: Historical Development and Current Issues" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ666800 (Bilingual Research Journal, 27(1), 1-24.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

======California======
[[California]] is the state with the highest number of English Learners (ELs) in the United States. One out of three students in California is an EL.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; In June 1998, [[Proposition 227]] was passed by 61% of the California electorate. This proposition mandates that ELs be placed in structured English immersion for a period "not normally to exceed one year," then be transferred to mainstream classrooms taught "overwhelmingly in English."&lt;ref&gt;[http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm State of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618094226/http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |date=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposition also gave parents the possibility to request alternative programs for their children, however, the availability of waivers and information to parents have been a challenge in the implementation of this proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish et al., (2002). "Proposition 227 and Instruction of English Learners in California: Evaluation Update" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED482963&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED482963 (U.S. Department of Education)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the California Department of Education contracted with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) and WestEd to conduct a five-year evaluation of the effects of Proposition 227.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |title=American Institutes for Research (AIR) |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913185100/http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study methodology focused on "A combination of student achievement analysis, phone interviews, case study site visits, and written surveys was used to examine such questions as how the proposition was implemented, which EL services are most and least effective, and what [[unintended consequence]]s resulted from Proposition 227's implementation."

The authors caution about the limitations in the statewide data. California does not have the capacity to link student academic progress over time across years; however, using student-level linked data over time from the Los Angeles Unified School District, and complementing that analysis with surveys, site visits and interviews, the study found "no conclusive evidence favoring one instructional program over another." Students who remained in bilingual education have similar academic growth trajectories when compared with students who switched to English Immersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |title=WestEd: Effects of the Implementation of Proposition 227 on the Education of English Learners, K-12: 2002 Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711042851/http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |archive-date=2007-07-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

California, among other states, also has many public schools which have Immersion programs, most commonly Spanish/English Immersion but also including other languages. Immersion programs include native speakers of both languages and include instruction in both languages, with primary (grade) schools typically having 90% instruction in the minority language in the early grades, transitioning to 50% instruction in each of the minority language and English in the upper grades.

Proposition 227 has been repealed in 2016 by [[California Proposition 58 (2016)]].

======Arizona======
California was followed by [[Arizona]] in the passage of similar legislation, [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|Arizona Proposition 203]], which ended several programs previously available to ESL students. Arizona was the first state to provide bilingual education in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

======Georgia======
During the 1990s the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] increased its foreign born population by 233%. That was the second largest increase in the country, and Georgia is the sixth fastest growing state in the United States. Georgia has the seventh largest illegal immigrant population in the country; in the 2000 census 228,000 illegal immigrants lived in the state. During the 1980s and 1990s a labor shortage in the carpet industry contributed to an increase in the Hispanic population of Whitfield County, Georgia. Today almost half of the students in the Dalton (the hub of Whitfield County) public schools are Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2416 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Whitfield County]&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin Mitchell, a local Dalton lawyer, founded the [[Georgia Project]] in 1996 to help teach the influx of Hispanic students who have moved into the Dalton public schools. The Georgia Project partners with the [[University of Monterrey]] in Monterrey, [[Mexico]] to bring teachers from Mexico to Georgia Schools. Sixty teachers from the University of Monterrey have taught in Georgia since 1997, and they typically teach for two to three years on [[H-1B visa]]s. The Georgia Project also has a Summer Institute that trains American teachers to speak Spanish and learn about Mexican culture. The Georgia Project is a bilingual/bicultural program that is primarily funded from federal education appropriations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communityresourcebank.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=874 National Immigration Forum: Community Resource Bank, Success Stories, The Georgia Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

======Native American Reservations======
Following similar [[First Nations]]' models to [[Canada]], academic [[linguists]] throughout the [[United States]] are working closely with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservations communities to establish immersion and second-language programs for a number of respective tribal languages including [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Hopi]], [[Cherokee]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Lakhota]], and [[Sioux]], among others. Due to the combination of often a violent and isolative relationship between European settlers and Native Americans, their languages and communities have suffered dramatically in terms of facing extreme endangerment or extinction. The success of these programmes is mixed, depending largely on how healthy the status of the language in question is.

However, English-medium education still remains most widely used. Native programs often suffer a lack of state support in terms of funding or encouragement due in large part to the strong preference towards a melting-pot society. [[Native American boarding schools]], which enforced white American values and the English language were extensively used as late as the 1990s, and were notorious for implementing corporal punishment if a Native child was caught speaking his or her language or freely practicing their tribal faith.

====South America====

=====Argentina=====
There are many English-Spanish schools in Argentina. Several of them are in the provinces where the Irish who were part of the local Elite used to live. While medium to big sized cities are likely to have several bilingual schools, bilingual education remains an exception rather than the norm and is generally reserved for the upper classes. There is not a nationally encompassing bilingual program available for public schools. Because of the ties that have historically bound private education to religious institutions, many of the bilingual schools in the country are Roman Catholic schools. For example, out of the three available bilingual schools in a medium-sized city such as Mar del Plata, two of them (Holy Mary of Northern Hills and Holy Trinity College) are practicing Roman Catholic schools. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Effects of mother-tongue instruction ==
Continuing to foster the abilities of children's mother tongue along with other languages has proven essential for their personal and educational development because they retain their cultural identity and gain a deeper understanding of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=Jim|date=2001|title=Bilingual children’s mother tongue: Why is it important for education|url=|journal=Sprogforum|volume=19|pages=15–20|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two 2016 studies of mother-tongue instruction in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively show that it had positive outcomes for the students in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seid|first=Yared|date=2016-12-01|title=Does learning in mother tongue matter?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33232">'''Children’s rights education''' (or children’s human rights education) is the teaching and practice of children’s rights in schools and educational institutions, as informed by and consistent with the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. When fully implemented, a children's rights education program consists of both a curriculum to teach children their human rights, and framework to operate the school in a manner that respects children's rights. Articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42] of the Convention on the Rights of the Child require children to be educated about their rights.

In addition to meeting legal obligations of the Convention to spread awareness of children’s rights to children and to adults, teaching children about their rights has the benefits of improving their awareness of rights in general, making them more respectful of other people's rights, and empowering them to take action in support of other people's rights. Early programs to teach children about their rights, in Belgium, Canada, England and New Zealand have provided evidence of this.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt;&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt;&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6 /&gt; Children's rights in schools were taught and practiced as an ethos of 'liberating the child' well before the UN Convention was written, and that this practice helped to inform the values and philosophy of the Convention, the IBE and UNESCO, though sadly these practices, and this history are not really acknowledged or built-upon by the UN. This is one reasons that children's rights have not become a foundation of schools despite 100 years of struggle.&lt;ref name="newman movement"&gt;Newman, Michael (2015) Children’s Rights in our Schools – the movement to liberate the child, an introduction to the New Ideals in Education Conferences 1914-1937, [https://www.academia.edu/14081708/Regaining_the_History_of_Childrens_Rights_in_Schools_Through_the_New_Ideals_in_Education_Conferences_1914-37 www.academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of children’s human rights education==
Children’s human rights education refers to education and educational practices in schools and educational institutions that are consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name=empower&gt;Howe, R.B. and Covell, K. (2007). ''Empowering Children: Children’s Rights Education as a Pathway to Citizenship''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krappman&gt;Krappman, L. (2006). "The rights of the child as a challenge to human rights education." ''Journal of Social Science Education.'' Retrieved from: http://www.jsse.org/2006-1/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osler&gt;Osler, A., and Starkey, H. (2006). "Education for democratic citizenship: A review of research, policy and practice 1995-2005." ''Research Papers in Education,'' 21 (4), 433-466.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of education that takes seriously the view that children are bearers of human rights, that children are citizens in their own right, that schools and educational institutions are learning communities where children learn (or fail to learn) the values and practices of human rights and citizenship, and that educating children about their own basic human rights is a legal obligation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

Children's rights education is education where the rights of the child, as described in the Convention, is taught and practiced in individual classrooms. But in its most developed form, children’s rights are taught and practiced in a systematic and comprehensive way across grade levels, across the school, and across school districts. With full-blown children’s rights education, children’s rights are not simply an addition to a particular subject or classroom. Rather, the rights of the child are incorporated into the school curricula, teaching practices, and teaching materials across subjects and grade levels and are the centerpiece of school mission statements, behavior codes, and school policies and practices.&lt;ref name=implement&gt;Covell, K., Howe, R.B., and McNeil, J.K. (2010). "Implementing children’s human rights education in schools." ''Improving Schools,'' 13 (2), 117-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully developed children’s rights education means that all members of the school community receive education on the rights of the child. The Convention serves as a values framework for the life and functioning of the school or educational institution and for efforts to promote a more positive school climate and school culture for learning.

A core belief in children’s rights education is that when children learn about their own basic human rights, this learning serves as an important foundation for their understanding and support of human rights more broadly.

==Education and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child==
The Convention on the Rights of the child has important implications for the education of children. Approved by the [[United Nations]] in 1989, the Convention is the most widely ratified and most quickly ratified country in world history. Only two countries – the [[United States]] and [[South Sudan]] – have yet to ratify the [[treaty]].&lt;ref name=CRIN&gt;Child Rights Information Network (2008).  [http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie ''Convention on the Rights of the Child''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103092514/http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie# |date=2012-11-03 }}.

(1999). ''A Commentary on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verhellen&gt;Verhellen, E. (1994). ''Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' Kessel-Lo, Belgium: Garant&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bueren&gt;Van Bueren, G. (1992). ''The international Law on the Rights of the Child.'' Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the Convention, a legally binding treaty, states parties have the obligation to make their laws, policies, and practices consistent with the provisions of the Convention, if not immediately, then over time.

In the Convention are numerous articles that deal with education and with children’s rights education. Eugeen Verhellen has divided the Convention’s provisions on education along three tracks.&lt;ref name=verhellen2&gt;Verhellen, E. (1993). "Children’s rights and education." ''School Psychology International,'' 14 (3), 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; First is the child’s right to education on the basis equal opportunity ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art28 article 28]). This includes the right to free primary education and to accessible secondary and higher education. Second are the child’s rights in education (articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art2 2], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art12 12], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art13 13], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art14 14], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art15 15], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art19 19]). This includes the right to non-discrimination, participation, protection from abuse and violence, and freedom of thought, expression, and religion. Third are the child’s rights through education (article [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42]). This refers to education where children are able to know and understand their rights and to develop respect for human rights, including their own human rights.

This third track of education spells an obligation by countries and education authorities to provide for children’s human rights education. Article 29 of the Convention requires that 'the education of the child shall be directed to the development of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.' This presumes knowledge and understanding of rights. Article 42 requires that countries 'undertake to make the principles of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike.'

Mindful of this duty of disseminating knowledge and recognizing its importance, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Convention, has repeatedly urged countries to incorporate children’s rights into the school curricula and ensure that children know and understand their rights on a systematic and comprehensive basis.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=un&gt;United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (1991). ''General Guidelines Regarding the Form and Content of Initial Reports.'' CRC/C/5. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hodgkin&gt;Hodgkin, R., and Newell, P. (1998). ''Implementation handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' New York: UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value of children’s human rights education==
Children’s rights education in schools has value because it fulfills the obligations of countries to respect the rights of the child and implement the provisions of the Convention. But beyond the fulfillment of a legal obligation, children’s rights education has value for children. Felisa Tibbitts has suggested that child rights education can be expected to affect learners in three ways.&lt;ref name=tibbitts&gt;Tibbitts, F. (1997). ''An Annotated Primer for Selecting Democratic and Human Rights Education Teaching Materials.'' Amsterdam: Open Society Institute/Human Rights education Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  First is in the providing of basic information and knowledge on the nature of rights and the specific rights that children are to enjoy. Children can be expected to have a more accurate and deeper understanding of rights. Second is in attitudes, values, and behaviors consistent with the understanding of rights. Children can be expected to have greater respect for the rights of others as shown in their attitudes and behaviors. Third is in empowering children to take action in support of the rights of others. Tibbitts refers to this as the 'transformational model' of rights education. Children here are more likely to take a stand in preventing or redressing human rights abuses. An example would be to support a victim of [[bullying]] and stand up against a bully in the school playground.

Research by Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130405010253/http://www.cbu.ca/crc/ Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe]&lt;/ref&gt; (see the section on evaluations of children’s human rights education) shows evidence of the above effects.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (1999). "The Impact of Children’s Rights Education: A Canadian study." ''International Journal of Children’s Rights,'' 7, 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moral&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2001).

"'If there’s a dead rat, don’t leave it.' Young children's understanding of their citizenship rights and responsibilities." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 38 (3), 321-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to children who have not received children’s rights education, children who have received children's rights education are more likely to have an accurate and adult-like understanding of rights, to understand that rights and responsibilities are related, and to display socially responsible behaviors in support of the rights of others.

==Implementation of children’s human rights education==

===Early initiatives===
Including Janusz Korczak and his rights based Warsaw orphanage, Homer Lane and his Little Commonwealth (1913) of delinquent 'prisoners', A.S. Neill's Summerhill School (1921) there have been many schools and children's communities around the world that have been founded on the rights of children. Indeed, inspired by Montessori, Homer Lane and Harriet Finley Johnson, a community of teachers, educationalists, suffragists, politicians, inspectors and cultural contributors formed a community called the  New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/New-Ideals-in-Education-Conferences-386690128169894/?ref=bookmarks New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newman movement"/&gt; Their founding value was 'the liberation of the child' and they sought, shared and celebrated examples of practice in schools, prisons and child communities. They contributed to the 'child centred' primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Selleck, R.J.W. (1972) English Primary Education and the Progressives, 1914-1939, p156 Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul London and Boston {{ISBN|0710072082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been an overlooked history of the culture of the rights of the child, one that needs to be shared and celebrated to help empower children and those adults who work with them. &lt;!-- (Commenting this out for now, as it's a non sequitur. If you can add some context as to why this is pertinent to the topic, please do. Thanks!) The autobiographical novel by A.S. Neill, ''[[A Dominie's Log]]'' (1915), is a diary of a headteacher trying to liberate his children as the First World War begins.--&gt;

Since the approval by the United Nations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, various efforts have been made to provide children's rights education in schools.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=educate&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K. (2013). ''Education in the Best Interests of the Child: A Children’s Rights Perspective on Closing the Achievement Gap.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives have been undertaken mainly at the level of individual classrooms and schools. Among the earliest initiatives was one in a primary school in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=belgium&gt;DeCoene, J., and  De Cock, R. (1996). "The Children's Rights Project in the Primary School 'De vrijdagmarkt' in Bruges. In E. Verhellen (Ed.), ''Monitoring children’s rights.'' (pp. 627-636). The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a comprehensive child rights education project that was introduced in the early 1990s at De Vrijdagmarkt Primary School. It involved children ages 3 to 12 with the objective of educating them about the contents of the Convention, using democratic [[pedagogy]] and ensuring child participation in the learning process. Children were taught about their rights under the Convention through a variety of media including art and poetry. Art activities included newspaper collages representing examples of rights violations. Allowance was made for child-initiated and small group activities, role-play, and group discussion. Activities that were selected were ones of relevance and interest to the children. Younger children, for example, learned about the right to food by creating a very large doll with illustrations of food. Older children engaged in discussions and role-play regarding rights to [[adoption]], education, and family.

Further examples of early initiatives were in classrooms in [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], [[Canada]], in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; [[Curriculum]] materials based on the Convention were developed in collaboration with children and their teachers for three grade levels. At the grade 6 level (children aged 11 to 13 years), education focused on introducing child rights in terms of their relevance to the individual child. Issues included healthy living, personal safety, families and family life, drug use, and decision-making. For example, to learn about their right to protection from [[narcotics]], students role-played children and drug dealers and examined ways of dealing with pressure to try or sell drugs. At the grade 8 level (ages 13 to 15 years), the focus was on relationships of relevance to the child. The curriculum included units on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Youth justice in Canada|youth justice]], [[child abuse]], and exploitation. For example, students analyzed popular song lyrics to discuss how rights in sexuality are represented in music, and they completed cartoons that involved the competing considerations of freedom of speech and rights against [[discrimination]].  The grade 12 curriculum (for ages 17 to 19) expanded the sphere of children’s rights knowledge with application to global issues. These issues included war-affected children and [[child labor]]. At this level, activities included holding a mock UN Conference on war-affected children where small groups had responsibility for representing the players at the conference, and a [[sweatshop]] talk show in which groups researched child labor and then held a talk show to discuss their findings.

===Hampshire, England===
Writings about the initiative in Cape Breton schools inspired a major initiative in [[Hampshire|Hampshire County]], [[England]], called Rights, Respect and Responsibility or the RRR initiative. It is among the best known and most promising models of children’s human rights education to date.&lt;ref name=implement /&gt;&lt;ref name=rrr&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2008). "Rights, Respect and Responsibility: Final Report on the County of Hampshire Rights Education Initiative." Available at:  {{cite web |url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106212258/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an initiative that features not only individual classrooms and schools but a whole school district. The RRR initiative was impelled by the recognition among senior education administrators in Hampshire of the need for a shared values framework and positive school climate for improved learning and educational outcomes. They also were motivated by their reading of the success of the rights education project in Cape Breton.

After study leave in Cape Breton, a group of Hampshire administrators and teachers decided to pilot test and then launch their own version of child rights education in Hampshire. After successful pilot testing in 2002, they officially launched RRR in 2004.&lt;ref name=hants&gt;Hampshire Education Authority (2003). "The case for RRR." Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223170331/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |archivedate=2012-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To put the objectives of RRR into effect, Hampshire authorities—with funding from the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]]—devised a three-year strategic plan of implementation. This included provisions for teacher training, development of resources, and monitoring of developments. The plan was that the initiative would first be introduced in infant, primary, and junior schools and then over time, as children went into higher grades, it would be introduced in secondary schools. By 2012, in varying degrees of implementation, the majority of Hampshire schools were participating in RRR.

The overall objective of RRR was to improve educational outcomes for children by transforming school cultures, building a shared values framework based on the Convention, and promoting educational practices consistent with the Convention. Knowledge and understanding of rights, respect, and social responsibility were to provide the values framework for all school policies, classroom practices, codes of conduct, mission statements, school regulations, and school curricula. The framework was to be put into effect across the whole school – across classrooms, across grade levels, across curricula, and across school practices. Of particular importance, consistent with children’s participation rights as described in article 12 of the Convention, behavior codes, rules, and regulations were to be developed in collaboration with the children, classroom teaching was to be democratic, and children were to be provided with numerous meaningful opportunities to participate in all aspects of school functioning.

===New Zealand===
Initiatives in Cape Breton and Hampshire have influenced developments in other schools, school districts, and even countries. Among the more ambitious developments have been seen in [[New Zealand]] where efforts are underway to make children’s human rights education a nationwide initiative. The context for the initiative is favorable. A strong human rights theme runs through New Zealand’s Education Act, national education goals, and national administrative guidelines.  In the early 2000s, initial discussions about incorporating children’s rights education into the New Zealand curriculum were given momentum by the evidence provided from the Cape Breton and Hampshire County initiatives.&lt;ref name=hrie&gt;HRiE., (2009).

Like elsewhere, educators and human rights advocates in New Zealand had been concerned with poor achievement levels, bullying, and violent behaviors that are observed among a significant minority of children in schools. And also like elsewhere, teachers and administrators have been frustrated by the range of difficult demands in schools, the fragmentation of efforts to address common problems, and the disappointing results of those efforts. Learning about successes in the Cape Breton and Hampshire initiatives, the collaborative initiative Human Rights in Education/Mana Tika Tangata (HRiE) was formed. Its aim was to develop positive school cultures on the basis of the rights of the child and to improve achievement for all children through having schools and early childhood education centers become learning communities that know, promote, and live human rights and responsibilities.
 
To achieve this goal, HRiE has been following the Hampshire model in using children’s rights as an overarching and integrating values framework for teaching, learning, and school management and organization. All members of the school community – school leadership, teachers and other staff, students, boards of trustees, and parents – learn about children’s rights and the responsibilities that go with them. They recognize that every member of the school community has the right to be treated with dignity and to participate in effective education. Students are formally recognized as citizens of the school and country with explicit rights and responsibilities. They participate in decision-making across the school, and rights are embedded across the curriculum, school practices, and policies.

===Initiatives with preschool===
Children's rights education initiatives also have occurred at the preschool level. For example, Canadian educators Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn introduced rights education to an early childhood program group of 3 and 4 year-old children in [[British Columbia]] over a three-month period.&lt;ref name=wallberg&gt;Wallberg, P., and  Kahn, M. (2011). "The Rights Project: How rights education transformed a classroom." ''Canadian Children,'' 36 (1), 31-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of "The Rights Project" was motivated in large part by observations of the children’s self-focus and disregard for the feelings of their peers. Using a coloring book designed to teach very young children about their rights, the teachers hoped to shift the children’s focus from individual wants to community needs – to increase levels of cooperation, altruism, and empathy.

==Evaluations of children’s human rights education==
The earliest reported evaluation of a child rights education project was that of the initiative in Bruges.&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt; Involving children ages 3 to 12, the primary focus of the evaluation was on the students’ social behavior. Gains in social understanding, respectful behaviors, concern for others, and pro-social action were the key observed changes. For example, the children became more interested in social justice and rights-related issues such as peace, war, injustice, and hunger. And they wanted to discuss the rights of marginalized children – those living with disabilities, in institutions, and of ethnic minority status.

Similar outcomes were found in evaluations of the effects of children’s rights education in Cape Breton schools. Evaluations conducted on students in grades 6 and 8 (ages 12 and 14 years) showed improved [[classroom climate]], engagement, and behavior.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; At the grade 6 level differences were found in children’s understanding of rights, their acceptance of minority children, and their perceived levels of peer and teacher support. Teachers reported improved behavior and more positive classroom climate. In addition at the grade 8 level, children in rights-based classes showed increases in their self-esteem. Similar child-initiated projects to those reported from Bruges were seen also.  For example, at one school upon realizing that not every child in the area was assured their right to nutritious food, the students initiated a breakfast program by obtaining cooperation and donations from the local community. In a different school, the class decided to work at a local [[food bank]] to help children whose families were unable to provide sufficient nutritious food.

Anecdotal data from the teachers who used the grade 12 curriculum described how engaged their students were in the activities, and noted improvements in their students’ appreciation of global problems, and of the complexity and importance of respecting human rights. Students who had participated in the project completed a survey. The results showed them to be three times more likely than their peers to understand humanitarian assistance for children in difficult circumstances as a fundamental human right.

The most comprehensive evaluation data are of the Hampshire RRR initiative.&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6&gt;Covell, K., McNeil, J.K, and  Howe, R.B. (2009). "Reducing teacher burnout by increasing student engagement." ''School Psychology International,'' 30 (3), 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=implement /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp1&gt;Covell, K., and  Howe, R.B. (2011) "Rights, Respect and Responsibility in Hampshire County RRR and Resilience Report." Available at http://www3.hants.gov.uk/hampshire-rrr-resilience-full-report-2011.doc{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp2&gt;Covell, K, Howe, R.B., and Polegato, J. (2011). "Children’s human rights education as a counter to social disadvantage: A case study from England." ''Educational Research,'' 53,(2), 193- 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp3&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K., (2010). "Miseducating children about their rights." ''Education, Citizenship and Social Justice,'' 5 (2), 91-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp5&gt;Covell, K. (2010). "School engagement and rights-respecting schools." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 40 (1), 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Annual assessments over six years were conducted to assess the effects of the RRR. Included were children ages 4 – 14. Children and teachers in schools where RRR had been fully implemented were compared with those in demographically equivalent schools without RRR.  These comparisons showed the following effects of RRR. Across ages, children showed a greater understanding of rights and their relation to responsibilities, increased levels of self-regulation, confidence, effort and motivation, participation and engagement in school, and achievement. These cognitive and attitudinal changes were reflected in significant improvements in behaviors. Children were reported by both their classroom teachers and the school principal to be more respectful, cooperative, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of other children. Incidents of bullying were reduced dramatically with disagreements being resolved using the discourse of rights rather than through physical or verbal aggression.

Teaching in RRR schools also led to changes in the teachers. School administrators noted significant changes in teachers use of democratic teaching and positive classroom management, and in less confrontational dealings with their students. Teachers were listening to children and taking their views into account. And the greater the level of student engagement and participation, the more teachers showed gains in a sense of personal achievement and significant decreases in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.

Among all the positive findings of the evaluation of the RRR, the most intriguing was that at each time of measure the most disadvantaged school showed the greatest positive changes.&lt;ref name=comp2 /&gt; Improvements in engagement, behavior and academic achievement were remarkable, and have been attributed to how the RRR transformed the culture of the school. The evidence suggests that schools that are fully consistent with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child can mediate the effects of a challenging environment of rearing and help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers.&lt;ref name=educate /&gt;

==Other evaluations==
Although no formal evaluation has yet been published on the New Zealand initiative, anecdotal evidence suggests the outcomes are comparable to those reported from Hampshire.&lt;ref name=hrie /&gt; Teachers report improved learning environments and decreased stress.  "Makes me think critically about some of the things I do in my classroom", a teacher reported, "especially some of the aspects of my behavior management." Another stressed that she has "had fabulous response from the children."

Evaluation data from Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn show that their preschool rights project was highly successful.&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt; They found that teaching young children about their Convention rights in an age-appropriate way transformed the learning environment. As classroom rules were replaced with rights, less adult control was needed and group conversations changed from chaotic chatter to the respectful exchange of ideas. The children’s behavior toward each other changed markedly. Their interactions reflected an understanding of the universality of rights and the importance of protecting the rights of others. And even at this very young age, rights discourse replaced arguing; for example, "you are hurting my right to play" became an effective problem solver that replaced tears and fighting. Wallberg and Kahn conclude that the children’s recognition of the relationship between rights and responsibilities shifted their focus "from 'me' to 'we'."

The '''classical education movement''' advocates a form of education based in the traditions of [[Western culture]], with a particular focus on education as understood and taught in [[Classical antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].  The curriculum and pedagogy of classical education was first developed during the Middle Ages by [[Martianus Capella]] and systematized during the Renaissance by [[Petrus Ramus]]. Capella's original goal was to provide a systematic, memorable framework to teach all human knowledge.  The term "classical education" has been used in Western culture for several centuries, with each era modifying the definition and adding its own selection of topics.  By the end of the 18th century, in addition to the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] of the Middle Ages, the definition of a classical education embraced study of literature, poetry, drama, philosophy, history, art, and languages.&lt;ref name="EncycAmerEd1"&gt;{{citation

In the 20th and 21st centuries, it has been used to refer to a broad-based study of the [[liberal arts]] and sciences, as opposed to a practical or pre-professional program.&lt;ref name="EncycAmerEd1"/&gt;

There exist a number of informal groups and professional organizations which undertake the classical approach to classical education in earnest.  Within the secular classical movement, in the 1930s [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]] set forth the "Great Books" of Western civilization as center stage for a classical education curriculum.  Also some public schools (primarily charters) have structured their curricula and pedagogy around the trivium and integrate the teaching of values (sometimes called "character education") into the mainstream classroom.  There are several major societies and associations within the [[classical Christian education]] movement, including the Society for Classical Learning, the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]], [http://trinityschools.org/ Trinity Schools], and the CiRCE Institute.

The University of Pennsylvania seal (1894) depicted the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] as a stack of books providing the foundation for a 'modified' quadrivium of mathematics, natural philosophy (empirical science), astronomy, and theology.

==Three Phases of Modern Education Linked to Classical Education==
Classical education developed many of the terms now used to describe modern education.  Western classical education has three phases, each with a different purpose.  The phases are roughly coordinated with [[developmental psychology|human development]], and would ideally be exactly coordinated with each individual student's development.

* "Primary education" teaches students how to learn.
* "Secondary education" then teaches a conceptual framework that can hold all human knowledge (history), fills in basic facts and practices of major fields of knowledge, and develops the fundamental skills (perhaps in a simplified form) of every major human activity.
* "Tertiary education" then prepares a person to pursue an educated profession such as law, theology, military strategy, medicine, or science.

=== Primary education ===
In classical terms, primary education was the ''[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]'' comprising grammar, logic, and rhetoric.

Logic and rhetoric were often taught in part by the [[Socratic method]], in which the teacher raises questions and the class discusses them.  By controlling the pace, the teacher can keep the class very lively, yet disciplined.

==== Grammar ====
Grammar consists of [[language]] skills such as reading and the mechanics of writing.  An important goal of grammar is to acquire as many words and manage as many concepts as possible so as to be able to express and understand clearly concepts of varying degrees of complexity.  Classical education traditionally included study of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] to reinforce understanding the workings of languages and allow students to read the [[Classics]] of [[Western culture|Western Civilization]] untranslated.  In the modern renaissance of classical education, this period refers to the upper elementary school years.

==== Logic ====
[[Logic]] ([[dialectic]]) is the process of correct [[reasoning]].  The traditional text for teaching logic was [[Aristotle]]'s [[Aristotelian logic|Logic]].  In the modern renaissance of classical education, this logic stage (or dialectic stage) refers to the junior high or middle school aged student, who developmentally is beginning to question ideas and authority, and truly enjoys a debate or an argument.  Training in logic, both formal and informal, enables students to critically examine arguments and to analyze their own. The whole goal is to train the student's mind not only to grasp information, but to find the analytical connections between seemingly different facts/ideas, to find out why something is true, or why something else is false (in short, reasons for a fact).

==== Rhetoric ====
[[Rhetoric]]al debate and composition are taught to somewhat older (often high school aged) students, who by this point in their education have the concepts and logic to criticize their own work and persuade others.  According to [[Aristotle]] "Rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic", concerned with finding "all the available means of persuasion."  The student now learns to articulate answers to important questions in his/her own words, to try to persuade others with these facts, and to defend ideas against rebuttal.  The student learns to reason correctly in the Logic stage so that they can now apply those skills to Rhetoric.  Traditionally, students would read and emulate classical poets in learning how to present their arguments well.

=== Secondary education ===
Secondary education, classically the ''[[quadrivium]]'' or "four ways," consist of [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]].  Arithmetic is Number in itself, which is a pure abstraction; that is, outside of space and time.  Geometry is Number in space. Music is Number in time, and Astronomy is Number in space and time.&lt;ref name=EncycAmerEd1 /&gt;  Sometimes [[architecture]] was taught alongside these, often from the works of [[Vitruvius]].

History was always taught to provide a context and show political and military development.  The classic texts were from ancient authors such as [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Livy]], [[Cicero]], and [[Tacitus]].

Biographies were often assigned as well; the classic example being [[Plutarch]]'s ''Lives''.  Biographies help show how persons behave in their context, and the wide ranges of professions and options that exist.  As more modern texts became available, these were often added to the curriculum.

In the [[Middle Ages]], these were the best available texts.  In modern terms, these fields might be called [[history]], natural [[science]], [[accounting]] and [[business]], [[fine art]]s (at least two, one to amuse companions, and another to decorate one's domicile), [[military strategy]] and [[military tactics|tactics]], [[engineering]], [[agronomy]], and [[architecture]].

These are taught in a matrix of history, reviewing the natural development of each field for each phase of the trivium.  That is, in a perfect classical education, the historical study is reviewed three times: first to learn the grammar (the concepts, terms and skills in the order developed), next time the logic (how these elements could be assembled), and finally the rhetoric, how to produce good, humanly useful and beautiful objects that satisfy the grammar and logic of the field.

History is the unifying conceptual framework, because history is the study of everything that has occurred before the present.  A skillful teacher also uses the historical context to show how each stage of development naturally poses questions and then how advances answer them, helping to understand human motives and activity in each field.  The question-answer approach is called the "dialectic method," and permits history to be taught Socratically as well.

Classical educators consider the [[Socrates|Socratic]] method to be the best technique for teaching critical thinking.  In-class discussion and critiques are essential in order for students to recognize and internalize critical thinking techniques.  This method is widely used to teach both [[philosophy]] and [[law]].  It is currently rare in other contexts.  Basically, the teacher referees the students' discussions, asks leading questions, and may refer to facts, but never gives a conclusion until at least one student reaches that conclusion.  The learning is most effective when the students compete strongly, even viciously in the argument, but always according to well-accepted rules of correct reasoning.  That is, [[fallacy|fallacies]] should not be allowed by the teacher.

By completing a project in each major field of human effort, the student can develop a personal preference for further education and professional training.

=== Tertiary education ===
Tertiary education was usually an [[apprentice]]ship to a person with the desired profession.  Most often, the understudy was called a "secretary" and had the duty of carrying on all the normal business of the "master." [[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]] were both widely taught as tertiary subjects in Universities, however.

The early biographies of nobles show probably the ultimate form of classical education: a tutor.  One early, much-emulated classic example is of this tutor system is of [[Alexander the Great]], who was tutored by [[Aristotle]].

== Modern interpretations of classical education ==
There exist a number of modern groups and professional organizations which take the classical approach to education seriously, and who undertake it in earnest.

===Classical Christian education===
{{main|Classical Christian education}}
There are several major societies and associations within the [[classical Christian education]] movement, including the Society for Classical Learning, the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]], [http://trinityschools.org/ Trinity Schools], the Classic Learning Test, and the CiRCE Institute. 

These schools tend to rely for upon one or more of the visions of classical education represented by [[Dorothy Sayers]] essay "The Lost Tools of Learning",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Sayers, Dorothy  |title=The Lost Tools of Learning |url=http://www.cambridgestudycenter.com/artilces/Sayers1.htm |date=presented at Oxford in 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer Adler's [[Paideia Proposal]], Alfred North Whitehead's ''The Aims of Education,'' or Susan Wise Bauer's ''[https://welltrainedmind.com/ The Well Trained Mind]''.

Most classical Christian schools employ the trivium as three stages of learning which are linked to child development:

* Grammar: The fundamental rules of each subject
* Logic: The ordered relationship of particulars in each subject 
* Rhetoric: How the grammar and logic of each subject may be clearly expressed 

Classical Christian schools vary in their approach to the sectarian integration of Christian thinking. Some schools ask parents to sign a statement of faith before attending, some do not require this of parents but are clear in their sectarian teaching, others are consciously ecumenical.

===Classical secular education===
There exist a number of classical schools in the public/secular sector.  These schools, primarily charter schools, also structure their curricula and pedagogy around the trivium and integrate the teaching of values (sometimes called "character education") into the mainstream classroom without involving any particular religious perspectives.

Methods of classical education have also often been integrated into [[homeschooling]], particularly due to the publication of:
"The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home," by Jessie Wise and [[Susan Wise Bauer]] (W.W. Norton, 1999), is a modern reference on classical education, particularly in a homeschool setting. It provides a history of classical education, an overview of the methodology and philosophy of classical education, and annotated lists of books divided by grade and topic that list the best books for classical education in each category.

[[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]], both of the [[University of Chicago]] set forth in the 1930s to restore the "Great Books" of Western civilization to center stage in the curriculum. [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] is an example of this type of classical education at the college level.  Although the standard classical works&amp;mdash;such as the [[Harvard Classics]]&amp;mdash;most widely available at the time, were decried by many as out of touch with modern times, Adler and Hutchins sought to expand on the standard "classics" by including more modern works, and by trying to tie them together in the context of what they described as the "Great Ideas," condensed into a "Syntopicon" index and bundled together with a new "five foot shelf" of books as "The [[Great Books of the Western World]]." They were wildly popular during the 1950s, and discussion groups of aficionados were found all over the USA, but their popularity waned during the 1960s, and such groups are relatively hard to find today.  Extensions to the original set are still being published, encompassing selections from both current and older works which extend the "great ideas" into the present age and other fields, including civil rights, the global environment, and discussions of multiculturalism and assimilation.

==Classical Languages==
A more traditional, but less common view of classical education arises from the ideology of the Renaissance, advocating an education grounded in the languages and literatures of Greece and Rome. The demanding and lengthy training period required for learning to read Greek and Latin texts in their original form has been crowded out in most American schools in favor of more contemporary subjects.

The revival of "Classical Education" has resulted in Latin being taught at Classical Schools, but less often Greek.  It is worth noting that the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]] does require Latin for accreditation, and [[New Saint Andrews College]] requires both Latin and Greek to graduate with a 4-year degree.  A new group of schools, the [http://www.classicallatin.org Classical Latin School Association], does require Latin to be taught as a core subject.

Such an approach—an education in the [[classics]]—differs from the usual approach of the Classical education movement, but is akin to an education on "The Great Books" followed by [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]].

==Parallels in the East==
In India, the classical education system is based upon the study and understanding of the ancient texts the [[Vedas]], a discipline called [[Vedanga]], and subjects based upon that foundation, referred to as [[Upaveda]] and incorporating medicine ([[Ayurveda]]), music, [[archery]] and other [[martial arts]].

Similarly, in China, the fulcrum of a classical education was the study and understanding of a core canon, the [[Four Books and Five Classics]].

In Taiwan, Classical Chinese takes up 35% of Chinese education in junior high school (7-9th grade, compulsory), and 65% in senior high school (10-12th grade).

In it, he argues that the scope of the classical [[liberal education]] is inadequate for today's society, and that people should also be conversant with the basic facts of science and technology, since they now form a much more important part of our lives than did the tertiary studies of antiquity. He argues for a new synthesis of science, engineering, and the humanities in which there is a balance between what ''can'' be done and what ''ought'' to be done, between human desires and earthly consequences, and between our ever-increasing power to affect our surroundings and the ever-present danger of destroying the ecological and environmental systems which allow us to exist.

'''Comparative education''' Comparative education is a discipline in the social sciences which entails the scrutiny and evaluation of different educational systems, such as those in various countries. Professionals in this area of endeavor are absorbed in advancing evocative terminologies and guidelines for education worldwide, enhancing educational structures and producing a context to which the success and effectivity of education programs and initiatives can be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bray|first=M|date=1995|title=Levels of Comparison in Education Studies.|url=|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=65|pages=472-490|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives and Scope ==
According to [[Harold J. Noah|Harold Noah]] (1985),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and Farooq Joubish (2009),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} comparative education has four purposes:
#To describe educational systems, processes, or outcomes.
#To assist in the development of educational institutions and practices.
#To highlight the relationships between education and society.
#To establish generalized statements about education that are valid in more than one country.
#To help the current generation, understand the nowardays education systems, with reference to the past.
Comparative education is often incorrectly assumed to exclusively encompass studies that compare two or more different countries. In fact, since its early days researchers in this field have often eschewed such approaches, preferring rather to focus on comparisons within a single country over time. Still, some large scale projects, such as the [[PISA]] and [[TIMSS]] studies, have made important findings through explicitly comparative macroanalysis of massive data sets. Recent examples in this regard include studies analyzing intra-European &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2018-03-29|title=Elementary Teacher Education in the Top Performing European TIMSS Countries: A Comparative Study|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ies/article/view/74480|journal=International Education Studies|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=152|doi=10.5539/ies.v11n4p152|issn=1913-9039}}&lt;/ref&gt; and intra-American&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2018-04-09|title=Comparing the Costs and Benefits of Attending the Top Three U.S. Elementary Teacher Education Programs|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/hes/article/view/74711|journal=Higher Education Studies|language=en-US|volume=8|issue=2|pages=70|doi=10.5539/hes.v8n2p70|issn=1925-475X}}&lt;/ref&gt; teacher education.

== Rationale for the Field ==
Many important educational questions can best be examined from an international and comparative perspective. For example, in the [[United States]] there is no nationwide certificate of completion of [[secondary education]]. This raises the question of what the advantages and disadvantages are of leaving such certification to each of the 50 states.{{By whom|date=June 2018}} Comparative education draws on the experience of countries such as [[Japan]] and [[France]] to show how a centralized system works, and what the advantages and disadvantages of a centralized certification are.

Critics of comparative education refer to it as Policy Borrowing.{{Definition needed|date=June 2018}}

== Disciplinary Identity ==
Comparative education is closely allied to, and may overlap with, [[international education]], [[international development education]], and [[comparative sociology]].

== Comparative and International Education Society ==
The [[Comparative and International Education Society]] (CIES) was founded in 1956 to foster "cross-cultural understanding, scholarship, academic achievement, and societal development through the international study of educational ideas, systems, and practices."

'''Content and language integrated learning''' ('''CLIL''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/knowledge-wiki/clil British Council BBC Teaching English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson &amp; McKinley|title=Integration of content and language learning|journal=TESOL Encyclopedia of English Language Teaching|date=Feb 2018|volume=1|url=http://www.englishappliedlinguistics.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419477/integration_of_content_and_langauge_tesol_encyclopedia_author_version.pdf|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach for learning content through an additional language (foreign or second), thus teaching both the subject and the language. 

==CLIL origin==
The term '''CLIL''' was created in 1994 by  [http://clil-cd.ecml.at/Team/Teammember4/tabid/941/language/en-GB/Default.aspx David Marsh] as a methodology similar to but distinct from [[language immersion]] and [[content-based instruction]]. The idea of its proponents was to create an "umbrella term" which encompasses different forms of using language as the medium of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.onestopenglish.com/clil/what-is-clil/ | title=What is CLIL? | work=Onestopenglish | accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology has been applied in a business context in many countries and widely accepted as an effective approach. In Italy for example, it is being used as an accelerated method to teach management concepts in English to business people. Among CLIL's proponents and practitioners there is Dr Maurizio Morselli, a Human Resources professional and Executive Coach, who believes that "this hybrid immersion approach produces a lot more immediate results and it appeals to self-motivated adult audiences who possess a basic knowledge and understanding of the target language".

==CLIL and language immersion==
CLIL is fundamentally based on methodological principles established by research on [[language immersion]]. This kind of approach has been identified as very important by the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2003:0449:FIN:EN:PDF Commission Of The European Communities Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: An Action Plan 2004 – 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; because: "It can provide effective opportunities for pupils to use their new language skills now, rather than learn them now for use later. It opens doors on languages for a broader range of learners, nurturing self-confidence in young learners and those who have not responded well to formal language instruction in general education. It provides exposure to the language without requiring extra time in the curriculum, which can be of particular interest in vocational settings." This approach involves learning subjects such as history, geography, managerial skills/concepts or others, through an additional language. It can be very successful in enhancing the learning of languages and other subjects, and helping children develop a positive attitude towards themselves as language learners. 

The European Commission has therefore decided to promote the training of teachers to "...enhancing the language competences in general, in order to promote the teaching of non-linguistic subjects in foreign languages".&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:320:0001:0003:EN:PDF Journal of the European Union Council Resolution of 21 November 2008 on a European strategy for multilingualism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An educational project called [http://e-clil.uws.ac.uk/ ECLIL] was also supported from the European Union within the [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/index_en.php Lifelong Learning Programme EACEA Agency], to develop interactive resources for European schools.&lt;/ref&gt;

==CLIL objectives==
CLIL objectives are varied, but among the most relevant ones the following can be pointed out (Coyle et al., 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Coyle, D., Hood, P. &amp; Marsh, D. (2010). CLIL. Cambridge: C.U.P.&lt;/ref&gt;: To improve the educational system. To establish the necessary conditions that will allow students to achieve the appropriate level of academic performance in CLIL subjects. To improve students’ proficiency in both their mother tongue and the target language, attaching the same importance to each. To develop the intercultural understanding. To develop social and thinking skills.

CLIL advocates claim that this educational approach (Lorenzo et al., 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, F., Trujillo, F. &amp; Vez, M. (2011). Educación bilingüe. Integración de contenidos y segundas lenguas. Madrid: Síntesis.&lt;/ref&gt;: Improves L1 and L2 development. Prepares students for the globalized world. Increases students’ motivation to learn foreign languages. Promotes the learning of a more extensive and varied vocabulary. Enhances students’ confidence in the target language. Improves language competence in the target language, CLIL being more beneficial that traditional foreign language teaching courses. Helps develop intercultural competence.

==CLIL in English as an international language==
The integration of content and language learning in [[international English|English as an international language]] (EIL) is found in approaches to [[bilingual education]].&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches include [[language immersion|immersion]], [[content-based instruction]] (CBI), content-based language teaching (CBLT), and the movement towards [[English-medium education|English medium instruction]] (EMI). All of these approaches raise a number of questions that a view of English as an international language has for content-integrated approaches (Thompson &amp; McKinley, 2018).&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplicity of terms===
The multiplicity of terms used to refer to instructional approaches for the integration of content and language learning (immersion, CBI, CBLT, CLIL, EMI) can be a source of confusion in EIL studies, although they all commonly share the purpose of additive bilingualism via a dual focus on content and language learning. Debate continues about the extent to which immersion, CBLT, CBI, and CLIL are different, similar, or the same. Some argue that CLIL represents an appropriate umbrella term that can be used to house various approaches towards content integration (e.g., immersion is a type of CLIL), where terms can be used interchangeably (e.g., CLIL and CBI are the same concept with a different name) (Cenoz et al., 2014).&lt;ref name="Cenoz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cenoz, Gennessee &amp; Gorter|title=Critical analysis of CLIL: Taking stock and looking forward.|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2014|volume=35|issue=3|pages=243-262}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that CLIL and CBI represent very different concepts, where CLIL represents the intersection between content and language from the content perspective (i.e., CLIL happens in content classes), while CBI is an attempt at responding to the content needs of learners in language classes (Dalton-Puffer et al., 2014).&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton-Puffer, Llinares, Lorenzo &amp; Nikula|title=“You can stand under my umbrella”: Immersion, clil and bilingual education. A response to Cenoz, Genesee &amp; Gorter (2013).|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2014|volume=35|issue=2|pages=213-218}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The similarities (and variability) between approaches lead to circular arguments about whether the key features of one approach are also shared by others (e.g., immersion and CLIL), and therefore they are indistinguishable. In some ways, this is an inevitable result of terms being used outside of academia, by educators applying ideas from one context to another,&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the lines of demarcation become more unclear as approaches are transported to different countries and contextualized to meet different learning situations.&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In EIL studies, different terms have been associated with different regions, such as CLIL, which is associated with Europe, and was “purposefully coined” by European educators and researchers attempting to influence language policy and ideology (Dalton-Puffer et al., 2014:214).&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; CLIL represented a deliberate attempt to develop a European model for additive bilingual education.&lt;ref name="Cenoz"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[policy-maker|policy makers]], educators, and researchers from international contexts have started to apply and develop CLIL approaches in distinctly non-European situations, and the term is now widely used within the wider international foreign language learning community.&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design and technology''' ('''D&amp;T''') is a school subject offered at all levels of primary and secondary school in England. It is used so children develop a range of designing skills and technology skills for example, using media to design their project and a saw to cut items. It first appeared as a titled subject in the first [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum of England, Wales and Northern Ireland]] in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/758394547|title=Debates in design and technology education|others=Owen-Jackson, Gwyneth, 1956-|isbn=9780415689045|location=London|oclc=758394547}}&lt;/ref&gt;. D&amp;T, or a similar form, has been taught in many countries around the world such as [[India]], United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Malta, China, South Africa, France and Finland &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/470685647|title=International handbook of research and development in technology education|date=2009|publisher=Sense Publishers|others=Jones, Alister., Vries, Marc J. de, 1958-, Buntting, Cathy M.|isbn=9789087908775|location=Rotterdam|oclc=470685647}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many international schools teach design and technology. As a school subject it involves students in designing in a practical context using a range or materials and media. It is also a university course in many countries, including Australia, Canada, the US, Singapore, South Africa, Netherlands and New Zealand, both for the preparation of teachers and for general education in areas such as [[industrial design]]. Some of the UK universities which deliver courses include: [[University of Brighton|Brighton]], [[Sheffield Hallam University|Sheffield Hallam]], [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths' College]] and [[Greenwich University|Greenwich]].

== Design and Technology qualifications ==

=== GCSE ===
With the first National Curriculum new [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE qualifications]] were introduced for D&amp;T in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Unlike the National Curriculum the previous subject titles were retained (e.g. [[craft, design and technology]] (CDT) and [[home economics]]) and others added (e.g. electronics, food technology, textiles technology and systems and control). These GCSE specifications had two assessed components:

* 40% of the final mark for  coursework
* 60% for an examination of general subject knowledge (materials, processes, techniques and sustainability etc.).

GCSE D&amp;T titles available included:

*GCSE Design and Technology: Electronic Products
*GCSE Design and Technology: Food Technology
*GCSE Design and Technology: Graphic Products
*GCSE Design and Technology: Resistant Materials
*GCSE Design and Technology: [[Systems and Control]]
*GCSE Design and Technology: Textiles Technology
*GCSE Design and Technology: Product Design

=== GCSE D&amp;T (2017 onwards) ===
Since September 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-design-and-technology|title=GCSE design and technology|last=|first=|date=4 November 2015|website=Gov.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new GCSE has been taught in England that incorporates all material areas (with the exception of food which is now a separate GCSE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-food-preparation-and-nutrition|title=GCSE Food preparation and nutrition|last=|first=|date=20 February 2015|website=Gov.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Similar to the previous GCSE, the new [[GCSE Specifications|specifications]] have two assessed components - an exam and a non-examined assessment (NEA) but with a 50:50 split of the marks. 

=== A level ===
[[Advanced Level (UK)|A and AS level]] examinations prepare students for individualised learning and problem solving, which is essential in business and industry. Time management is a key factor to candidates' success within the coursework elements of the qualification. The examinations are as rigorous as any other subject. Indeed, due to the complexity and variety of tasks and organisation skills required this examination and course is very demanding. The subject covers activities from [[Control engineering|control]] technology to aesthetic product design. Students have to use all types of computer software including [[computer-aided design]] and [[Computer-aided manufacturing|manufacture]], [[spreadsheet]]s and computer presentations.  Outputs from such work are often sent to [[CNC]] machines for manufacture.

== International Baccalaureate ==
IB Design Technology (DT) is an elective subject offered in many [[International Baccalaureate]] schools globally. Design is also offered in the [[IB Middle Years Programme]] as a compulsory subject for grades 6–10, and at the [[IB Diploma Programme|Diploma Programme]] level (grades 11-12). IB Design Technology is very similar in content to ''Design Technology'', which is widely offered in the national curricula of [[Education in England|England]], [[Education in Australia|Australia]], [[Education in Canada|Canada]], [[Education in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and many African nations. It is one of the [[IB Group 4 subjects|Group 4 sciences]].

The primary focus of MYP Design is to give students an understanding of the [[design cycle]], through a practical programme. The student will complete projects based on solving a real and authentic problem. Students document their progress as they follow the design cycle to come to a feasible solution. They create the solution and then evaluate it following thorough testing.

The Diploma Programme of Design Technology is a two-year introduction to designing, a range of fundamentals of technology, and global technological issues. It provides students with the knowledge to be able to design and make in school workshops, and also to develop an informed literacy about technology in general. Because it is an international curriculum it has a particular focus on global environmental issues. It covers core topics in human factors and ergonomics, resource management and sustainable production, modeling, raw materials to final production,  innovation and design, classic design. It covers advanced higher level topics in user centered design, sustainability, innovation and markets, and commercial production. The diploma is accepted for university entrance in many countries, and is a good preparation for careers in areas such as engineering, architecture, product design, interior design, design and education.

== Scotland ==

== Awards ==
In the UK, the [[Arkwright Scholarships Trust]] awards two-year scholarships to students who are taking GCSE/Scottish Standard Grade in design &amp; technology. The Arkwright Engineering Scholarships support students through their A levels/Scottish Highers and encourage them to study engineering or a related area of design at a top university or through a high-quality industrial apprenticeship.

Despite purported and intended benefits, systematic studies have not shown benefits to diversity training and instead show that they backfire and lead to reductions in diversity and to discrimination complaints being taken less seriously.&lt;ref name="ethics.harvard.edu"&gt;{{Cite web | last1 = Dobbin | first1 = Frank | last2 = Kalev | first2 = Alexandra | url = http://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/why-diversity-management-backfires-and-how-firms-can-make-it-work|title=Why Diversity Management Backfires (And How Firms Can Make it Work)|website=ethics.harvard.edu | publisher = [[Edmond J.

==Controversial issues==
According to Hans Bader, its opponents consider it an oppressive [[ideology]] and reeducation tactic that actually reduces the ability of organizations to attain their goals. It has been suggested that diversity training reinforces differences between individuals instead of fostering their commonalities, thus helping to further racialize the workplace, creating situations where people "tiptoe" around issues such as how to relate to people of different cultures as opposed to people learning to [[communicate]] with and truly understand each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bader | first = Hans | url = https://cei.org/blog/diversity-training-backfires | title = Diversity training backfires | publisher = [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] | website = cei.org| date = 26 December 2007 | access-date = 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs which established specific responsibility for diversity, such as [[equal opportunity]] staff positions or diversity task forces, have proven most effective in general. However, the results also indicate that [[White people|White]] females benefit significantly more from diversity training. The benefits for [[African American]] females and males were appreciably lower than European American females. [[Social network|Networking]] and [[mentor]]ing, which were considered bias mitigating approaches, served [[African Americans|African American]] females the most. African American males were the least likely to benefit from any of the methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalev | first1 = Alexandra | last2 = Dobbin | first2 = Frank | last3 = Kelly | first3 = Erin | title = Best practices or best guesses?

They argue that attempting to see both sides of a controversial issue builds empathy and allows working environments to function better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = Sue | last2 = Brzuzy | first2 = Stephanie | last3 = Gerdes | first3 = Karen | last4 = Hurdle | first4 = Donna | title = Using structured controversy to teach diversity content and cultural competence | journal = Journal of Teaching in Social Work | volume = 23 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 55&amp;ndash;71 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | date = 2003 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandra Kalev conducted a comprehensive review of cultural diversity training conducted in 830 midsize to large U.S. workplaces over a thirty one year period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/19/AR2008011901899.html|title=Most Diversity Training Ineffective, Study Finds|last=Vedantam|first=Shankar|date=2008-01-20|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The results showed that diversity training was followed by a 7.5 percent drop in the number of women in management. The percentage of black men in top positions fell by 12 percent. Black, female managers fell by 10 percent. Similar effects were shown for Latinos and Asians. The study did not find that all diversity training is ineffective. Mandatory training programs offered to protect against discrimination lawsuits were called into question. Voluntary diversity training participation to advance organization’s business goals was associated with increased diversity at the management level.

== Purported benefits ==
An analysis of data from over 800 firms over 30 years shows that diversity training and grievance procedures backfires and leads to reductions in the diversity of the firms workforce.&lt;ref name="ethics.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Other research shows that people "were less likely to take discrimination complaints seriously against companies who had diversity programs".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news| last = McElroy | first = Molly | url = http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/04/03/diversity-programs-give-illusion-of-corporate-fairness-study-shows/ | title = Diversity programs give illusion of corporate fairness, study shows | work = UW Today | publisher = [[University of Washington]] | date = 3 April 2013 |access-date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As organizations and communities are becoming more [[Globalization|globalized]], there is a need for an expansion in relation to communication among individuals from all over the world, operating within a diverse environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240550|title=The Myriad Benefits of Diversity in the Workplace|last=Abreu|first=Kim|work=[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]|access-date= 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe it is beneficial for companies to train a diverse staff, as a reflection of the market in which you wish to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Armache | first = Jalal | title = Diversity in the workplace: benefits and challenges | journal = Journal of International Diversity | volume = 2012 | issue = 1 | pages = 59&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = | date = March 2012 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/75172682/diversity-workplace-benefits-challenges | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jalai Armache, in a heterogeneous workplace environment filled with people knowledgeable of those with different backgrounds and nationalities, there is ability to easily expand an organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17541">'''Drug education''' is the planned provision of information, resources, and skills relevant to living in a world where [[drugs|psychoactive substances]] are widely available and commonly used for a variety of both medical and non-medical purposes, some of which may lead to harms such as [[drug overdose|overdose]], [[injury]], infectious [[disease]] (such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis C]]), or [[substance dependence|addiction]].

==Benefits==
Planning includes developing strategies for helping children and young people engage with relevant drug-related issues during opportunistic and brief contacts with them as well as during more structured sessions.  Drug education enables children, youth and adults to develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes to appreciate the benefits of living healthily (which may or may not include the use of psychoactive substances), promote responsibility towards the use of drugs and relate these to their own actions and those of others, both now and in their future lives. It also provides opportunities for people to reflect on their own and others' attitudes to various psychoactive substances, their use and the people who use them.

==Drug education campaigns &amp; programs==
Drug education can be given in numerous forms, some more effective than others. Examples include [[advertising]] and awareness raising campaigns such as the UK Government’s [[FRANK (drugs)|FRANK]] campaign or the US "media campaign".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediacampaign.org/ Media campaign]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there are school based drug education programs like [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|DARE]] or that currently being evaluated by the UK Blueprint Programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.gov.uk/young-people/blueprint Blueprint], ''Home office.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; In efforts to prevent problematic substance use, drug education may perpetuate myths and stereotypes about psychoactive substances and people who use them.&lt;ref name=Tupper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Drugs, discourses and education: A critical discourse analysis of a high school drug education text|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|year=2008|volume=29|issue=2|pages=223–238|doi=10.1080/01596300801966864}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug education can also take less explicit forms; an example of this is the Positive Futures Programme, funded by the UK government as part of its drug strategy. This programme uses [[sport]] and the [[arts]] as catalysts to engage young people on their own turf, putting them in contact with positive role models (coaches/trained youth workers). After building a trusting relationship with a young person, these role models can gradually change attitudes towards drug use and steer the young person back into education, [[training]] and [[employment]]. This approach reaches young people who have dropped out of mainstream education. It also has additional benefits for the community in reduced [[crime]] and [[anti-social behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.gov.uk/publication-search/young-people/0607_YPSMPG11 Positive Futures Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

==School-based drug education ==
School-based drug education began with the anti-alcohol "[[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] education" programmes of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in the United States and Canada in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Jerome|title=100 years of 'just say no' versus 'just say know': Reevaluating drug education goals for the coming century|journal=Evaluation Review|year=1998|volume=22|issue=1|pages=15–45|doi=10.1177/0193841x9802200102}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In many respects, the WCTU's [[progressive education]] agenda set the template for much of what has been done since in the name of drug education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Sex, Drugs and the Honour Roll: The Perennial Challenges of Addressing Moral Purity Issues in Schools|journal=Critical Public Health|year=2013|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115–131|doi=10.1080/09581596.2013.862517}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Past research into drug education has indicated that to be effective it must involve engaging, interactive learning strategies that stimulate higher-order thinking, promote learning and be transferable to real life circumstances. Current challenges from this approach exist in adopting evidence-based school drug education programmes.&lt;ref name=Cahil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cahil|first=H. W.|title=Challenges in adopting evidence-based school drug education programmes|journal=Drug &amp; Alcohol Review|year=2007|volume=26|issue=6|pages=673–679|doi=10.1080/09595230701613593}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 June 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, in the majority of countries where preventive drug education programs and courses exist, they are established and funded by the Government. These education programs aim to educate adolescents about [[Recreational drug use|illicit drug use]] in an effort to prevent illegal drug use while highlighting the dangers of [[substance abuse|problematic substance use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Midford|first=R|title=Is Australia ‘fair dinkum’ about drug education in schools?|journal=Drug &amp; Alcohol Review|year=2007|volume=26|issue=4|pages=421–427|doi=10.1080/09595230701373842}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 June 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Government]] has implemented a range of drug education programs through the [[National Drug Education Strategy (NDES)]] by providing schools with effective drug education programmes. The program aims  to manage drug related issues and incidents within schools .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Schools Drug Education Strategy 2009|url=http://www.education.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2203/NationalDrugEducationStrategy.pdf|work=Northern Territory Government|publisher=Department of Education and Children Services|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421035758/http://www.education.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2203/NationalDrugEducationStrategy.pdf|archivedate=21 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2015 the [http://www.health.gov.au/ Australian Government Department of Health] launched the [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] portal as part of its response to the findings from the National Ice Taskforce report.&lt;ref&gt;Grass roots a key to tackling ice https://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr2015-nash053.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prime Minister of Australia, JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, SYDNEY https://www.pm.gov.au/media/2015-12-06/joint-doorstop-interview-sydney&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] is an online portal that facilitates access to interactive evidence-based drug education resources and prevention programs for school communities. [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] builds on existing drug education resources developed by researchers at the [https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/ National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC)] such as the [https://www.climateschools.com.au/ Climate Schools programs] that have been proven to reduce alcohol and drug related harms and increase student well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Champion|title=A cross-validation trial of an Internet-based prevention program for alcohol and cannabis: Preliminary results from a cluster randomised controlled trial|journal=Aust NZ J Psychiatry|date=2015|volume=50|pages=64–73|doi=10.1177/0004867415577435|url=http://anp.sagepub.com/content/50/1/64|accessdate=2 February 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newton, N.|title=Internet-based prevention for alcohol and cannabis use: final results of the Climate Schools course|journal=Addiction|date=2010|volume=105|issue=4|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02853.x/full|accessdate=2 February 2016|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02853.x|pages=749–759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newton, N.|title=Delivering prevention for alcohol and cannabis using the internet: A cluster randomised controlled trial|journal=Preventive Medicine|date=2009|volume=48|issue=6|pages=579–584|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743509002072|accessdate=2 February 2016|ref=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743509002072|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Department of Health and Aging]] identified that analgesics (90%), alcohol (80-90%) and tobacco (30-60%) were the most widely utilised substances among adolescents. In addition to this, cannabis was another commonly used illicit substance that accounted for 33% usage among adolescents aged 14–17 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton|first=B|title=School drug education in New South Wales: Moral panic and the individualisation youth drug use|journal=Social Alternatives|year=2005|volume=24|issue=4|pages=50–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to government funded programs, a number of not-for-profit organisations (such as [[Life Education Australia]] also provide drug education programs to adolescents. These preventative programs aim to deliver a progressive approach that will motivate and encourage young people to make positive decisions in life. Emphasis within these programs is also placed in focusing on deterring [[peer pressure]] as a means of empowering adolescents and promoting autonomy. This approach reaches 750,000 primary and secondary students in Australia each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joyce|first=R|author2=O’Connor, L.|title=Life Education: Research and Evaluation.|journal=Life Education|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== D.A.R.E, Drug Abuse Resistance Education ==
D.A.R.E stands for Drug Abuse Resistance Education. In the United States, D.A.R.E is implemented in elementary school classrooms, 5th grade to educate students on drugs effects and temptations they may encounter. The program implemented in public and private school systems to prepare 5th graders for middle school, as well as all further education.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukes|first=Richard L.|last2=Stein|first2=Judith A.|date=August 1997|title=Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)|url=|journal=Evaluation Review|volume=21.4|pages=483|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although D.A.R.E is implemented to prevent students from doing drugs in the future, there is little evidence to suggest it actually prevents students from doing drugs. In the article, “Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education” by Dukes and Stein, a [[chi-squared test]] was performed to see if there was a significant difference between high school students that received D.A.R.E training and those who did not receive D.A.R.E and its relation to drug use. The study found that there is no significant difference between the drug use of students that received D.A.R.E and students that did not. One of the main reasons the authors mentioned D.A.R.E had little correlation with Drug use is that there are other external causes that only affect some students, which can lead them into the direction of drug use. Additionally, the time that students received D.A.R.E (5th grade), and the time that the students encounter drugs may be many years after, so students may have little remembrance of the program. However, the United States schools continue to implement the program in classrooms because the police officers that come into classrooms can serve as community role models to students, and all students are different so it may steer them away from drugs in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukes|first=Richard L.|last2=Stein|first2=Judith A.|date=August 1997|title=Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)|url=|journal=Evaluation Review|volume=21.4|pages=483|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Steroid use in high schools ==
Steroid use is a common form of drug use in high schools across the United States. Many students, specifically males, use steroids to increase their performance in athletic events. Many professional athletes, for example professional cyclist, Lance Armstrong, and former professional MLB player, Alex Rodriguez both were nationally recognized as steroid users. Additionally in an article in the ''Journal of Molecular &amp; Cellular Endocrinology,'' it states that in a survey of  212 Canadian national track athletes, over 10% of them would take an illegal drug if it was undetectable, if it could help them win an Olympic gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anawalt|first=Bradley D.|date=March 2018|title=Detection of Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Use by Elite Athletes and by Members of the General Public|url=|journal=Molecular &amp; Cellular Endocrinology|volume=464|pages=21-27|via=EBSCOhost, doi:10.1016/j.mce.2017.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many adolescents idolize athletes, so when they find out there is a way to enhance their performance, and that elite athletes are using them, steroids may be used by students. 

An article in the ''Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Substance Abuse'' ran a study on two southern California high schools in middle class suburbs, and the high school students use of Anabolic Androgenic Steroids. It surveyed students on if they use steroids, knew the side effects of steroids, and additionally their use of other prevalent drugs. The article specifically found that male students that were athletes were more likely to use steroids than students that are female or non- athlete students in general. Most students that participated in steroids played the sports, football or soccer, and were most likely to do steroids if they participated in both sports. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorang|first=Melissa|date=September 2011|title=Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Use in Teens: Prevalence, Demographics, and Perception of Effects|url=|journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Substance Abuse|volume=20|pages=358–369|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;Professional sports, influence young athletes, and when pro- athletes participate in drugs, it can lead young adults to use drugs without realizing the side effects and consequences that come along with drug use.

Also, a study in the ''journal of Drugs: Education, Prevention &amp; Policy'' discusses alcohol and drug prevention programs in Australia for students in grades 8 and 9. It goes into detail about the student's between 13 and 15 years old, to see if alcohol and drug prevention programs have an actual effect on preventing substance abuse. The study comes to conclusion that when the students went through a drug and alcohol prevention program, they were less likely to develop a drug or alcohol problem. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Midford|first=Richard|last2=et al.|date=April 2012|title=Alcohol Prevention: What Can Be Expected of a Harm Reduction? Focused School Drug Education Program?|url=|journal=Drugs: Education, Prevention &amp; Policy|volume=19, no. 2|pages=102-110|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology and Drug Education ==
The University of North Carolina Greensboro has researched the drug prevention program, All Stars, Sr.,. The program is developing education through technology (videos), so that health education programs could reach schools in rural communities. The technology programs would provide drug/ health education in general with qualified instructors, in areas that do not have programs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyrick|first=David L|last2=et. al|date=July 2010|title=Going the Distance: Delivery of High School Drug Prevention via Distance Education|url=|journal=American Journal of Distance Education|volume=24.3|pages=151-162|via=EBSCOhost,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation ==
Recent studies have identified that a gap between the theory of education programmes and the implementation exists.&lt;ref name=Cahil/&gt; This is regards to the collaborative learning approach and difficulties with teachers adopting these interactive drug education programmes. The practical implications of these findings are that professional training and support are required to increase the effectiveness of teaching staff, and the uniform implementation of drug curriculum.&lt;ref name=Cahil/&gt; Additional drug education research in the future should acknowledge the complexities of implementing these programmes in a school environment. Furthermore, additional support for teachers, counselors, school administrators and other education professionals should be integrated as a means of being realistic about what constitutes effective drug education and maintaining a high quality standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Teaching teachers to just say 'know': Reflections on drug education|journal=Teaching and Teacher Education|year=2008|volume=24|issue=2|pages=356–367|doi=10.1016/j.tate.2007.08.007}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education''' is the process of facilitating [[learning]], or the acquisition of [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, [[values]], [[belief]]s, and [[habit (psychology)|habits.]] Educational methods include [[storytelling]], [[discussion]], [[teaching]], [[training]], and directed [[research]]. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also [[autodidacticism|educate themselves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The methodology of teaching is called [[pedagogy]].

Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as [[preschool]] or [[kindergarten]], [[primary school]], [[secondary school]] and then [[college]], [[university]], or [[apprenticeship]].

A [[right to education]] has been recognized by some governments and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="ICESCR-art13.1"&gt;Article 13 of the [[United Nations]]' 1966 [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] recognizes a universal right to education. ''ICESCR'', Article 13.1&lt;/ref&gt; In most regions, education is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] up to a certain age.

==Etymology==
[[Etymologically]], the word "education" is derived from the Latin ''[[wikt:en:educatio#Latin|ēducātiō]]'' ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēducō]]'' ("I educate, I train") which is related to the [[homonym]] ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēdūcō]]'' ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ''[[wikt:en:e-#Latin|ē-]]'' ("from, out of") and ''[[wikt:en:duco#Latin|dūcō]]'' ("I lead, I conduct").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=educate educate].

Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-[[Literacy|literate]] societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their [[knowledge]] beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mind of Egypt: History and Meaning in the Time of the Pharaohs | author=Assmann, Jan | year=2002 | page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Matteo Ricci]] (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' published in 1607]]

[[Plato]] founded the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], the first institution of higher learning in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of [[Ancient Greece]]. There, the great [[Library of Alexandria]] was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Very Short History of the World''; Penguin Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]], [[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE), of the [[State of Lu]], was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his [[Analects]] were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/03/150325-confucius-china-asia-philosophy-communist-party-ngbooktalk/|title=Why Is Confucius Still Relevant Today?

The [[Aztecs]] also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in [[Nahuatl]] called ''tlacahuapahualiztli.'' It means "the art of raising or educating a person"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Education through Dance and Ceremony: A Mexica Palimpsest|last=Colin|first=Ernesto|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=9781349470945|location=New York|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of strengthening or bringing up men."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind|last=León-Portilla|first=Miguel|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0806105697|location=Norman|pages=134–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Non-Western Educational Traditions: Alternative Approaches to Educational Thought and Practice|last=Reagan|first=Timothy|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=2005|isbn=978-0805848571|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the word ''neixtlamachiliztli'', which is "the act of giving wisdom to the face."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These concepts underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next generation the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the purpose of individual development and his integration into the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the [[Fall of Rome]], the [[Catholic Church]] became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages|title=Science owes much to both Christianity and the Middle Ages : Soapbox Science|website=blogs.nature.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church established [[cathedral schools]] in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into [[medieval universities]] and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; During the High Middle Ages, [[Chartres Cathedral]] operated the famous and influential [[School of Chartres|Chartres Cathedral School]]. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Thomas Aquinas]] of the [[University of Naples]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1088, the [[University of Bologne]] is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.&lt;ref&gt;Nuria Sanz, Sjur Bergan: "The heritage of European universities", 2nd edition, Higher Education Series No. 7, Council of Europe, 2006, ISBN, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, [[Islamic science]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] flourished under the Islamic [[caliphate]] which was established across the Middle East, extending from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the [[Indus]] in the east and to the [[Almoravid Dynasty]] and [[Mali Empire]] in the south.

[[The Renaissance]] in Europe ushered in a [[Scientific revolution|new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry]] and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations&amp;nbsp;– as with the [[Jesuit China missions]] who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like [[Euclid's Elements]] for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of [[Confucius]] for European audiences. [[The Enlightenment]] saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.

In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or [[homeschooling|otherwise]], is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth, [[UNESCO]] has calculated that in the next 30&amp;nbsp;years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K.: [http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html ''Schools Kill Creativity''].

==Formal education==
Formal education occurs in a [[learning environment|structured environment]] whose explicit purpose is teaching [[student]]s. Usually, formal education takes place in a [[school]] environment with [[classroom]]s of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most [[Educational management|school systems]] are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, [[school organizational models|organizational models]], design of the physical [[learning space]]s (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://enhancinged.wgbh.org/started/what/formal.html|title = Enhancing Education|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|title =Perspectives Competence Centre, Lifeling Learning Programme|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141015103040/http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|archivedate =15 October 2014|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preschool===
[[File:Parent's day at Eirfan's Kindergarten.jpg|thumb|Young children in a [[kindergarten]] in Japan]]
{{Main|Early childhood education}}
Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter [[primary education]]. These are also known as [[nursery schools]] and as [[kindergarten]], except in the US, where kindergarten is a term often used to describe the earliest levels of primary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecs.org/kindergarten-policies/|title=50-State Comparison: State Kindergarten-Through-Third-Grade Policies|website=www.ecs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kindergarten "provide[s] a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ross|first=Elizabeth Dale|title=The Kindergarten Crusade: The Establishment of Preschool in the United States|year=1976|publisher=Athens: Ohio University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary===
[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|Primary school students with their teacher, [[Colombia]], 2014]]
{{Main|Primary education}}
Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first five to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Education For All]] programs driven by [[UNESCO]], most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and [[secondary education]] is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate [[middle school]]s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools ''or ''elementary schools''. Primary schools are often subdivided into [[infant school]]s and [[junior school]].

In India, for example, [[Compulsory education#Variation in countries|compulsory education]] spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national [[curriculum]] framework designed by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].

===Secondary===

In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during [[adolescence]]. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive [[primary education]] for [[minor (law)|minors]], to the optional, selective [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], "postsecondary", or "[[Higher education|higher]]" education (e.g. [[university]], vocational school) for [[adult]]s. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or [[high school]]s, [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], [[lyceum]]s, middle schools, [[college]]s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling.

Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada, and [[Australia]], primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give [[common knowledge]], to prepare for [[higher education]], or to train directly in a [[profession]].

Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required [[skilled worker]]s. In order to meet this new job demand, [[High school (North America)|high schools]] were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] or skilled [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.

Secondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of [[Public education|public schools]], [[fee-paying school]]s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.

[[Community college]]s offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.

===Tertiary (higher)===

{{see also|Higher education|Adult education}}
[[File:Michelle Obama speaking at Peking university.jpg|thumb|Universities often host prominent guest speakers for student audiences, e.g. [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Michelle Obama]] delivering remarks at [[Peking University]], [[Beijing]], [[China]]]]
Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or [[secondary school]]. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[vocational education|vocational education and training]]. Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.

Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or [[foundation degree]] qualification. In most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national [[economies]], both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.

University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as [[tertiary education]]) and the [[graduate student|graduate]] (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as [[graduate school]]). Some universities are composed of several colleges.

One type of university education is a [[liberal arts]] education, which can be defined as a "[[college]] or [[university]] [[curriculum]] aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, [[vocational education|vocational]], or technical curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Liberal Arts: ''Britannica Concise Encyclopædia''| work = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although what is known today as liberal arts education began in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =Philip | last =Harriman | title = Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College| year =1935|jstor=1975506 | pages =63–71 | volume =6 | issue =2 | journal =The Journal of Higher Education | ref =harv | doi =10.2307/1975506}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "[[liberal arts college]]" is more commonly associated with institutions in the [[United States]] such as [[Williams College]] or [[Barnard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Inside Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/06/liberalarts|accessdate=2015-01-08|date=2009-04-06|first=Elizabeth|last=Redden|title=A Global Liberal Arts Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocational===
[[File:Fotothek df n-10 0000828.jpg|thumb|Carpentry is normally learned through [[apprenticeship]] with an experienced carpenter]]
{{Main|Vocational education}}

[[Vocational education]] is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an [[apprenticeship]] or [[internship]] as well as institutions teaching courses such as [[carpentry]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]] and [[the arts]].

===Special===
{{Main|Special education}}
In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by [[physicians]] or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like [[Itard]], [[Édouard Séguin|Seguin]], [[Samuel Gridley Howe|Howe]], [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|Gallaudet]]) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.  In its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.&lt;ref name="Credo Reference"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Education|year=2004|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other educational forms==

===Alternative===
{{Main|Alternative education}}
While considered "alternative" today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times. After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. [[Alternative education]] developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of [[traditional education]]. A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including [[alternative school]]s, [[autodidacticism|self learning]], [[homeschooling]], and [[unschooling]]. Example [[alternative school]]s include [[Montessori method|Montessori schools]], [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] (or [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]] schools), [[List of Friends Schools|Friends schools]], [[Sands School]], [[Summerhill School]], [[Walden's Path]], [[The Peepal Grove School]], [[Sudbury Valley School]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti schools]], and [[open classroom]] schools. [[Charter school]]s are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the US and gained greater importance in its public education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED535992.pdf|title = Federal Investment in Charter Schools|date = October 2011|accessdate = 2 October 2015|website = Institute of Education Sciences|publisher = Center for American Progress|last = Lazarin|first = Melissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/10/charter-schools_n_4419341.html|title = Charter Schools Continue Dramatic Growth Despite Controversies|date = 10 December 2013|accessdate = 2 October 2015|newspaper = The Huffington Post|last = Resmovits|first = Joy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as [[Friedrich Fröbel]]'s approach to [[early childhood education]] in 19th-century Germany has been incorporated into contemporary [[kindergarten]] classrooms. Other influential writers and thinkers have included the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]; the [[United States|American]] [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]] [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]; the founders of [[educational progressivism|progressive education]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]]; and educational pioneers such as [[Maria Montessori]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]], and more recently [[John Caldwell Holt]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Frederick Mayer]], [[George Dennison]], and [[Ivan Illich]].

===Indigenous===
[[File:Schoolyard essay2.JPG|thumb|alt=Na Schoolyard.|[[Indigenous education|Teaching indigenous knowledge]], models, and methods in [[Yanyuan County]], [[Sichuan]], China]]
{{Main|Indigenous education}}
[[Indigenous education]] refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to "reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3099875|author1=May, S.  |author2=Aikman, S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing Current Issues and Developments|journal=Comparative Education|volume= 39|issue=2 |year=2003|pages= 139–45|doi=10.1080/03050060302549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal learning===
{{main|Informal learning}}
'''Informal learning''' is one of three forms of learning defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at [[home]], [[employment|work]], and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.  For many learners, this includes [[language acquisition]], [[cultural norm]]s, and [[manners]].

In informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner.  If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned.&lt;ref name=Rogoff&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0091732X16680994 | volume=40 | title=The Organization of Informal Learning | year=2016 | journal=Review of Research in Education | pages=356–401 | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = Barbara | last2 = Callanan | first2 = Maureen | last3 = Gutiérrez | first3 = Kris D. | last4 = Erickson | first4 = Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139519526.028 | title=Informal Learning in Museums | journal=The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences | pages=461–478 | last1 = Crowley | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Pierroux | first2 = Palmyre | last3 = Knutson | first3 = Karen| year=2014 | isbn=9781139519526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While informal learning often takes place outside educational [[school|establishments]] and does not follow a specified curriculum, it can also occur within educational settings and even during formal learning situations. Educators can structure their lessons to directly utilize their students informal learning skills within the education setting.&lt;ref name=Rogoff/&gt;

In the late 19th century, education through play began to be recognized as making an important contribution to child development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GH | last =Mead | title = The Relation of Play to Education| journal = University Record| year =1896| pages =141–45 | volume =1 | url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1896.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GE | last =Johnson | title = Education through recreation| publisher = Cleveland Foundation, Ohio| year =1916|  url=https://archive.org/stream/educationthrough00johnuoft#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L.P. Jacks]], also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: "A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =LP | last =Jacks | title = Education through recreation| publisher = New York: Harper and Brothers| year =1932| pages =1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Sha | last =Ullah | title = Learning surgically oriented anatomy in a student-run extracurricular club: an education through recreation initiative| journal = Anat Sci Educ| year =2012| pages =165–70 | volume =5 |pmid=22434649 | doi=10.1002/ase.1273 | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1175&amp;context=vivianmcalister&amp;type=additional | last2 =Bodrogi | first2 =Andrew | last3 =Cristea | first3 =Octav | last4 =Johnson | first4 =Marjorie | last5 =McAlister | first5 =Vivian C. | issue =3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been revived by the [[University of Western Ontario]] to teach [[anatomy]] to medical students.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170"/&gt;

===Self-directed learning===
{{Main|Autodidacticism}}
[[Autodidacticism]] (also autodidactism) is a term used to describe self-directed learning. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. [[List of autodidacts|Notable autodidacts]] include [[Abraham Lincoln]] (U.S. president), [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (mathematician), [[Michael Faraday]] (chemist and physicist), [[Charles Darwin]] (naturalist), [[Thomas Alva Edison]] (inventor), [[Tadao Ando]] (architect), [[George Bernard Shaw]] (playwright), [[Frank Zappa]] (composer, recording engineer, film director), and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (engineer, scientist, mathematician).

===Open education and electronic technology===
{{main|Open education|Educational technology}}

Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] teaming up to form [[edX]]. Other universities offering open education are prestigious private universities such as [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], the [[University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennylvania]], and [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], as well as notable public universities including [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua]], [[Peking University|Peking]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Michigan]], and [[University of Virginia]].

Open education has been called the biggest change in the way people learn since the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurobonkers.com/2012/08/02/the-single-biggest-change-in-the-way-we-learn-since-the-printing-press/ |title=Free courses provided by Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U.Penn, U. Michigan, U. Virginia, U. Washington |publisher=Neurobonkers.com |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harriet Swain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/01/university-campuses-decline-elearning-students?newsfeed=true |title=Will university campuses soon be 'over'?  |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2012-10-24 |location=London |date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.&lt;ref&gt;Cloete, ElsabeÂ. "Electronic Education System Model." Department of Computer Science and Information Systems in South Africa, 17 Oct. 2000. Web. 3 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some [[open universities]] do already offer conventional degrees such as the [[Open University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal "[[Academic capital|academic value]]" to traditional degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.good.is/posts/is-the-certificate-the-new-college-degree |title=Is the Certificate the New College Degree?  |publisher=Good.is |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=M. |date=2010 |title=Such a Deal?

A recent meta-analysis found that online and blended educational approaches had better outcomes than methods that used solely face-to-face interaction.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, [https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-based-practices/finalreport.pdf Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education sector ==
[[File:北师大西门.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing Normal University]], which is governed directly by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Education]], is an example of collaboration between different entities in the education sector]]
The education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. It involves a wide range of people ([[curriculum]] developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different contexts.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as [[Education policy|education policies]] and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation. They must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and improvement. Governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The education sector is fully integrated into society, through interactions with a large number of stakeholders and other sectors. These include parents, local communities, religious leaders, NGOs, stakeholders involved in health, [[child protection]], justice and law enforcement (police), media and political leadership.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Several UN agencies have asserted that [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]] should be integrated into school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development goals==
[[File:Education index UN HDR 2007 2008.PNG|thumb|World map indicating [[Education Index]] (according to 2007/2008 [[Human Development Report]])]]

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in September 2015, calls for a new vision to address the environmental, social and economic concerns facing the world today. The Agenda includes 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), including SDG 4 on education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals|last=|first=|publisher=UN|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1909, the ratio of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the 21st century, the majority of all children in most regions of the world attended school.

[[Universal Primary Education]] is one of the eight international [[Millennium Development Goals]], towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Liesbet Steer and Geraldine Baudienville 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4755&amp;title=funding-basic-education What drives donor financing of basic education?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Additionally, [[Transparency International]] has identified [[political corruption|corruption]] in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Addis Ababa |url=http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_aew_launch_en |title=Poor governance jeopardises primary education in Africa |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627021316/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_aew_launch_en |archive-date=27 June 2010 |website=Transparency International |date=23 February 2010 |access-date=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved. There is also economic pressure from some parents, who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A study conducted by the [[UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning]] indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite report |last=de Grauwe |first=A. |date=2009 |location=Paris |publisher=UNESCO-IIPE |url=http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html |title=Capacity development strategies |accessdate=2010-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505082915/http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;
* strategies must be context relevant and context specific;
* plans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;
* partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development while working towards some short-term achievements;
* outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;
* a certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade).

===Internationalization===
Nearly every country now has [[Universal Primary Education]].

Similarities – in systems or even in ideas – that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The European Socrates-[[Erasmus]] Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmus.ac.uk |title=Socrates-Erasmus Program |publisher=Erasmus.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitates exchanges across European universities. The [[Soros Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soros.org/ |title=Soros Foundation |publisher=Soros.org |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] have contributed to the internationalization of education. The global campus online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] and the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]] objectively monitor and compare the proficiency of students from a wide range of different nations.

===Education and technology in developing countries===
[[File:OLPC Haiti.jpg|thumb|right|The OLPC laptop being introduced to children in [[Haiti]]]]
{{Main|Education and technology}}

Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and [[developing countries]]. Charities like [[One Laptop per Child]] are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.

The [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC foundation]], a group out of [[MIT Media Lab]] and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a [[$100 laptop]] for delivering [[educational software]]. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.

In Africa, the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) has launched an "[[New Partnership for Africa's Development E-School Program|e-school program]]" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and [[internet access]] within 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/network-wifi/3361705/african-nations-embrace-e-learning-says-new-report/ |title=African nations embrace e-learning, says new report |publisher=PC Advisor |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nabuur.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021011082942/http://www.nabuur.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-10-11 |title=nabuur.com |publisher=nabuur.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; started with the support of former American President [[Bill Clinton]], uses the [[Internet]] to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.

[[India]] is developing technologies that will bypass land-based [[telephone]] and Internet infrastructure to deliver [[distance learning]] directly to its students. In 2004, the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] launched [[GSAT-3|EDUSAT]], a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |title=EDUSAT |publisher=[[ISRO]] |accessdate=2013-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227162328/http://isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |archivedate=27 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private vs public funding in developing countries===
Research into LCPS (low-cost private schools) found that over 5 years to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving [[Education for All]] (EFA) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/display&amp;type=Document&amp;id=65993|title=Low-cost private schools: evidence, approaches and emerging issues|publisher=Eldis|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable.
The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:
* Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be underrepresented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.
* Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government schools.
* Choice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.
* Cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: There is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.

The report showed some cases of successful voucher and subsidy programs; evaluations of international support to the sector are not widespread.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.

{{main|Educational theory}}

===Educational psychology===
{{Main|Educational psychology}}
[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology]] of [[school]]s as [[organization]]s. Although the terms "educational psychology" and "school psychology" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as [[:Category:Educational psychologists|educational psychologists]], whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as [[school psychologist]]s. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those with specific [[disabilities]].
[[File:2013. Донецк 336.jpg|thumb|Knowledge Day in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], 2013]]
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2006).

===The intelligence–education relationship===
{{Main|Psychology of education}}
[[Intelligence]] is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = S. | last2 = Marsh | first2 = H. | last3 = Sheppard | first3 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Seven year longitudinal study of the early prediction of reading achievement | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 349–61 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.77.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baltes | first1 = P. | last2 = Reinert | first2 = G. | year = 1969 | title = Cohort effects in cognitive development in children as revealed by cross sectional sequences | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 169–77 | doi=10.1037/h0026997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richards | first1 = M. | last2 = Sacker | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Lifetime Antecedents of Cognitive Reserve | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 614–24 | doi=10.1076/jcen.25.5.614.14581| pmid = 12815499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning modalities===
There has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. The most commonly employed learning modalities are:&lt;ref&gt;Swassing, R. H., Barbe, W. B., &amp; Milone, M. N. (1979). ''The Swassing-Barbe Modality Index: Zaner-Bloser Modality Kit''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Visual]]: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: learning based on listening to instructions/information.
* [[Kinesthetic]]: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.

Other commonly employed modalities include [[music]]al, [[interpersonal]], [[Verbal reasoning|verbal]], [[logical]], and [[intrapersonal]].

Dunn and Dunn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningstyles.net/ |title=Dunn and Dunn |publisher=Learningstyles.net | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as [[Joseph Renzulli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/renzulli.shtml |title=Biographer of Renzulli |publisher=Indiana.edu | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended varying teaching strategies. [[Howard Gardner]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm Thomas Armstrong's website] detailing Multiple Intelligences&lt;/ref&gt; identified a wide range of modalities in his [[Multiple Intelligences]] theories. The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] and [[Keirsey Temperament Sorter]], based on the works of [[Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keirsey.com/ |title=Keirsey web-site |publisher=Keirsey.com | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focus on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of [[David Kolb]] and [[Anthony Gregorc]]'s Type Delineator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |title=Type Delineator description |publisher=Algonquincollege.com |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301064219/http://algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; follows a similar but more simplified approach.

Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Barbe, W. B., &amp; Swassing, R. H., with M. N. Milone. (1979). ''Teaching through modality strengths: Concepts and practices''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |title=Learning modality description from the Learning Curve website |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404234142/http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |archivedate=4 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that [[learning styles]] such as Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic(VAK) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.&lt;ref name="titleGuy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/49-whats-the-point-of-school |title=Guy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School?|publisher=dystalk.com |accessdate=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Learner%20Responsibility.pdf | title = Learner Responsibility in Management Education, or Ventures into Forbidden Research (with Comments) | author = J.

[[Educational neuroscience]] is an emerging [[science|scientific]] field that brings together researchers in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[developmental cognitive neuroscience]], [[educational psychology]], [[educational technology]], [[education theory]] and other related disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes and education.&lt;ref name = AnsariCoch&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ansari | first1 = D | authorlink1 = | last2 = Coch | first2 = D | year = 2006 | title = Bridges over troubled waters: Education and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 146–51 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2006.02.007 | pmid = 16530462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = CochAnsari&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coch | first1 = D | authorlink1 = | last2 = Ansari | first2 = D | year = 2008 | title = Thinking about mechanisms is crucial to connecting neuroscience and education | journal = Cortex | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 546–47 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2008.06.001 | pmid = 18649878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Goswami2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goswami | first1 = U | year = 2006 | authorlink1 = | title = Neuroscience and education: from research to practice? | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 406–11 | doi = 10.1038/nrn1907 | pmid = 16607400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = MeltzoffScience09&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = AN | authorlink1 = | last2 = Kuhl | first2 = PK |last3 = Movellan | first3 = J | last4 = Sejnowski |first4 = TJ | year = 2009 | title =  Foundations for a New Science of Learning | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5938 | pages = 284–88 | doi = 10.1126/science.1175626 | pmc = 2776823 | pmid = 19608908| bibcode = 2009Sci...325..284M | citeseerx = 10.1.1.165.1628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in educational neuroscience investigate the [[neural]] mechanisms of [[Reading (process)|reading]],&lt;ref name = Goswami2006 /&gt; [[numerical cognition]],&lt;ref name = AnsariNRN08&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ansari | first1 = D | authorlink1 = | year = 2008 | title = Effects of development and enculturation on number representation in the brain | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience| volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 278–91 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2334 | pmid = 18334999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[attention]], and their attendant difficulties including [[dyslexia]],&lt;ref name=McCandlissNoble&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCandliss | first1 = BD | authorlink1 =  | last2 = Noble | first2 = KG | year = 2003 | title = The development of reading impairment: a cognitive neuroscience model | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disability Research Review | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 196–204 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.10080 | pmid = 12953299 | url = https://sacklerinstitute.org/cornell/people/bruce.mccandliss/publications/publications/McCandliss.Noble.2003.pdf | access-date = 24 October 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080827201638/http://www.sacklerinstitute.org/cornell/people/bruce.mccandliss/publications/publications/McCandliss.Noble.2003.pdf | archive-date = 27 August 2008 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all | citeseerx = 10.1.1.587.4158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = GabrieliScience09&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gabrieli | first1 = JD | year = 2009 | authorlink1 = | title = Dyslexia: a new synergy between education and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5938 | pages = 280–83 | doi = 10.1126/science.1171999 | pmid = 19608907| bibcode = 2009Sci...325..280G | url = http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~tsoule/neuro508/Gabrieli_2009_Dyslexia.pdf | citeseerx = 10.1.1.472.3997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dyscalculia]],&lt;ref name = Price2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Price | first1 = GR | last2 = Holloway | first2 = I | last3 = Räsänen | first3 = P | last4 = Vesterinen | first4 = M | last5 = Ansari | first5 = D | year = 2007 | title = Impaired parietal magnitude processing in developmental dyscalculia | journal = Current Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 24 | pages = R1042–43 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.013 | pmid = 18088583| bibcode = 1996CBio....6.1213A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ADHD]] as they relate to education. Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research.

===Philosophy===
[[File:LockeEducation1693.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Locke]]'s work ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' was written in 1693 and still reflects traditional education priorities in the Western world.]]
{{Main|Philosophy of education}}
As an academic field, philosophy of education is "the philosophical study of education and its problems&amp;nbsp;(...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of [[philosophy]]".&lt;ref name=NoddingsPOE&gt;{{Cite book | last = Noddings| first = Nel| title = Philosophy of Education| publisher = Westview Press| year = 1995| location = Boulder, CO| isbn = 978-0-8133-8429-0|page=1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline."&lt;ref name=POEE&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Frankena | first1 = William K. | last2 = Raybeck | first2 = Nathan | last3 = Burbules | first3 = Nicholas | contribution = Philosophy of Education | year = 2002 | title = Encyclopedia of Education, 2nd edition | editor-last = Guthrie | editor-first = James W. | place = New York, NY | publisher = Macmillan Reference | isbn= 978-0-02-865594-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of [[applied philosophy]], drawing from fields of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[axiology]] and the philosophical approaches ([[speculative philosophy|speculative]], prescriptive or [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]]) to address questions in and about [[pedagogy]], [[education policy]], and [[curriculum]], as well as the process of [[learning theory (education)|learning]], to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Noddings|1995|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between [[education theory]] and practice.

===Purpose of education===
There is no broad consensus as to what education's chief aim or aims are or should be. Some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students' personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. Other authors emphasize education's contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting society's general economic development, and preserving cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Winch and John Gingell, ''Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts'' (2nd edition). London:Routledge, 2008. pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===
{{Main|Curriculum|Curriculum theory|List of academic disciplines}}
In formal education, a [[curriculum]] is the set of courses and their content offered at a [[school]] or [[university]]. As an idea, '''curriculum''' stems from the [[Latin]] word for ''[[race course]]'', referring to the course of [[wikt:deed|deeds]] and experiences through which [[child]]ren grow to become mature [[adult]]s. A curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general [[syllabus]] which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.

An [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university – or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the [[natural science]]s, [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[social science]]s, [[humanities]] and [[applied science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/Default.htm |title=Examples of subjects |publisher=Curriculumonline.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821105825/http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/default.htm |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational institutions may incorporate [[fine arts]] as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at [[college]]s and universities as electives.  The various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/standards/national/arts/index.shtml |title=Fine Arts |publisher=Education World |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sudbury Valley School]] offers a model of education without a curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Scott |date=2011 |title=Sherlock Holmes was Wrong. |journal=The Sudbury Valley School Journal |volume=40 |issue=2 |url=https://sudburyvalley.org/essays/sherlock-holmes-was-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruction===
Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called [[teacher]]s, and they direct the education of [[student]]s and might draw on many [[course (education)|subjects]] like [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[history]]. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called [[teacher]]s, instructors, or [[professor]]s, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winters |first=Marcus |title=Teachers Matter: Rethinking How Public Schools Identify, Reward, and Retain Great Educators |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=160 |isbn=978-1-4422-1077-6|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |title=How the world's best-performing school systems come out on top |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927092821/http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2011 |website=mckinsey.com |date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 |title=Natural Learning in Higher Education |author=J. Scott Armstrong |journal=Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

College basketball coach [[John Wooden]] the Wizard of Westwood would teach through quick "This not That" technique. He would show (a) the correct way to perform an action, (b) the incorrect way the player performed it, and again (c) the correct way to perform an action. This helped him to be a responsive teacher and fix errors on the fly. Also, less communication from him meant more time that the player could practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coyle |first1=Daniel |title=The Talent Code |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0-553-80684-7 |page=159|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics of education==
{{Main|Economics of education}}
[[File:Students, Hakha, Chin State, Myanmar.jpg|thumb|right|Students on their way to school, [[Hakha]], [[Chin State]], [[Burma|Myanmar]]]]
It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eric A. Hanushek|title=Economic outcomes and school quality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=na7rAAAACAAJ|accessdate=21 October 2011|year=2005|publisher=International Institute for Educational Planning|isbn=978-92-803-1279-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. However, [[technology transfer]] requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of "[[human capital]]". Recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Daron Acemoglu |author2=Simon Johnson |author3=James A.

At the level of the individual, there is a large literature, generally related to the work of [[Jacob Mincer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jacob Mincer|title=The distribution of labor incomes: a survey with special reference to the human capital approach|jstor=2720384|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume= 8|issue=1|year=1970|pages=1–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital. This work has motivated a large number of studies, but is also controversial. The chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;David Card, "Causal effect of education on earnings," in ''Handbook of labor economics'', Orley Ashenfelter and David Card (Eds). Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1999: pp. 1801–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James J. Heckman, Lance J. Lochner, and Petra E. Todd., "Earnings functions, rates of return and treatment effects: The Mincer equation and beyond," in ''Handbook of the Economics of Education'', Eric A. Hanushek and Finis Welch (Eds). Amsterdam: North Holland, 2006: pp. 307–458.&lt;/ref&gt; Some students who have indicated a high potential for learning, by testing with a high [[intelligence quotient]], may not achieve their full academic potential, due to financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://som.yale.edu/news/2009/11/why-high-iq-doesnt-mean-youre-smart|title=Why a high IQ doesn't mean you're smart|date=2009-11-01|work=Yale School of Management|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and Herbert Gintis argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in American schooling between the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Samuel Bowles|author2=Herbert Gintis|title=Schooling In Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcpLPKOL6XYC|accessdate=21 October 2011|date=18 October 2011|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1-60846-131-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future of education==

Many countries are now drastically changing the way they educate their citizens. The world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible. Finnish schools have even begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like climate change instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oph.fi/english/curricula_and_qualifications/basic_education/curricula_2014|title=Finnish National Agency for Education - Curricula 2014|website=www.oph.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is also becoming a commodity no longer reserved for children. Adults need it too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/for-many-people-flexibility-at-work-can-be-a-liberation-matthew-taylor-chief-executive-royal-society-of-arts/|title=For many people, flexibility at work can be a liberation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have even proposed compulsory lifelong education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/compulsory-education-last-lifetime/|title=Could compulsory education last a lifetime? - Sitra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21759">'''Educational robotics''' is a broad term that refers to a collection of activities, instructional programs, physical platforms, educational resources and pedagogical philosophy. There are many schools which are using the robot teacher. 

== Definition ==
The primary of objective of educational robotics is to provide a set of experience to facilitate the student's development of knowledge, skills and attitudes for the design, analysis, application and operation of robots.  The term robot here is used quite broadly and may include articulated robots, mobile robots or autonomous vehicles of any scale.   The rigor of the approach can be scaled based on the background of the target audience and may be suitable for students across the entire educational spectrum—from elementary school or graduate programs.

An alternate, or secondary, objective is to use robotics as a tangible and exciting application to motivate and facilitate the instruction other, often foundational, topics such as computer programming, artificial intelligence or engineering design.

==Education and training==
[[File:ER4u.jpg|thumb|The [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]] – educational robot.]]
Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=139 | title = Career: Robotics Engineer | accessdate = 2012-01-27 | year = 2012 | work = Princeton Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence and robotics among students. First-year computer science courses at several universities now include programming of a robot in addition to traditional software engineering-based coursework.&lt;ref name=MKG12&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://romisatriawahono.net/lecture/rm/survey/software%20engineering/Software%20Construction/Major%20-%20teaching%20novices%20programming%20using%20robots%20-%202012.pdf |title=Systematic Literature Review: Teaching Novices Programming using Robots |first1=L |last1=Major |first2=T |last2=Kyriacou |first3=O.P. |last3=Brereton |format=pdf |journal=IET Software |publisher=IEEE |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=502-513 |doi=10.1049/iet-sen.2011.0125 |date=16 November 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SG13&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/9656489/Enhancing_Practice_and_Achievement_in_Introductory_Programming_with_a_Robot_Olympics |title=Enhancing Practice and Achievement in Introductory Programming with a Robot Olympics |first1=Michael |last1=Scott |first2=Steve |last2=Counsell |first3=Stasha |last3=Lauria |first4=Stephen |last4=Swift |first5=Allan |last5=Tucker |first6=Martin |last6=Shepperd |first7=Gheorghita |last7=Ghinea |format=pdf |journal=IEEE Transactions on Education |publisher=IEEE |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=249–254 |doi=10.1109/TE.2014.2382567 |date=29 October 2015 |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiatives in schools===
[[File:Rero-robots.jpg|thumb|rero reconfigurable robots, designed as easy to assemble and easy to program]]
Since 2014, companies like Cytron Technologies has been making inroads into schools and learning centers with their rero reconfigurable robot.  Designed to be easy and safe to assemble and easy to program, robotics became very accessible to young children with no programming skills and even up to advance users at tertiary level.  Robotics education was heavily promoted via roadshows, science fairs, exhibitions, workshops, camps and co-sponsored classes, bringing robotics education to the masses.

===Post-secondary degree programs===
From approximately 1960 though 2005, robotics education at post-secondary institutions took place through elective courses, thesis experiences and design projects offered as part of degree programs in traditional academic disciplines, such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, industrial engineering or computer science.

Since 2005, more universities have begun granting degrees in robotics as a discipline in its own right, often under the name "Robotic Engineering".  Based on a 2015 web-based survey of robotics educators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7970162/ |title=The State of Robotics Education: Proposed Goals for Positively Transforming Robotics Education at Postsecondary Institutions |first1=Joel M. |last1=Esposito |journal=IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine  |publisher=IEEE |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=157-164 |doi=10.1109/MRA.2016.2636375 |date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the degree programs and their estimates annual graduates are listed alphabetically below.  Note that only official degree programs where the word "robotics" appears on the transcript or diploma are listed here; whereas degree programs in traditional disciplines with course concentrations or thesis topics related to robotics are deliberately omitted.

===Certification===
The [[Robotics Certification Standards Alliance|Robotics Certification Standards Alliance (RCSA)]] is an international robotics certification authority that confers various industry- and educational-related robotics certifications.

===Summer robotics camp===
Several summer camp programs include robotics as part of their core curriculum. In addition, youth summer robotics programs are frequently offered by celebrated museums such as the [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/education/students/offering.php?id=534 Education at American Museum of Natural History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102072036/http://www.amnh.org/education/students/offering.php?id=534 |date=2011-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Tech Museum of Innovation]] in Silicon Valley, CA, just to name a few.

===Robotics afterschool programs===
Many schools across the country are beginning to add robotics programs to their after school curriculum. Two main programs for afterschool robotics are [http://www.botball.org Botball] and [http://www.usfirst.org FIRST Robotics].

'''Greenhouse Sports''' aims to develop social, thinking, emotional and physical skills for young people in London’s communities through sports programmes delivered by coaches.

Greenhouse Sports (originally Greenhouse Schools Project and then later Greenhouse Charity) was founded in 2002 when Chief Executive and founder, Michael de Giorgio, set up a multisports pilot to give young people on a local housing estate something positive to do in the school holidays. In 2004 the organisation then moved their programmes full-time into schools.

'''Hospitality management''' is the study of the [[hospitality industry]]. A degree in the subject may be awarded either by a university college dedicated to the studies of  hospitality management or a [[business school]] with a relevant department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=What is Hospitality management?|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-hospitality-management.htm|journal=http://www.wisegeek.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://srihm.edu.in/ Degrees in hospitality management] may also be referred to as [[Hotel manager|hotel management]], hotel and tourism management, or hotel administration. Degrees conferred in this academic field include [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], [[Bachelor of Business Administration]], [[Bachelor of Science|BS]], [[Bachelor of Applied Science|BASc]], [[Master of Science|MS]], [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]. Hospitality management covers [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[cruise ship]]s, [[amusement parks]], [[destination marketing organization]]s, [[convention center]]s, and [[country club]]s.

==Curriculum==
In the USA, hospitality and tourism management curricula follow similar core subject applications to that of a [[business degree]], but with a focus on tourism development and hospitality management. Core subject areas include [[accounting]], [[administration (business)|administration]], [[finance]], [[information systems]], [[marketing]], [[human resource management]], [[public relations]], [[business strategy|strategy]], [[quantitative methods]], and sectoral studies in the various areas of hospitality business.

===Vegetarian option===
In 2016, Ministry of Tourism, [[Government of India]] started giving hospitality management students the option to choose only vegetarian cooking. This was introduced at three of the institutes (IHMCTAN Ahmedabad, IHMCTAN Bhopal and IHMCTAN Jaipur) affiliated with the Ministry. This decision to offer a vegetarian option by IHMCTANs may be the first amongst any of the hospitality training institutes of the world. It is expected that all IHMCTANs in India will start offering a vegetarian cooking option from academic year 2018 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31808&amp;articlexml=IHMs-to-offer-3-yr-course-in-vegetarian-11072016013026|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofjaipur.com/news/2016/07/13/vegetarian-cooking-courses-to-be-introduced-in-hotel-management-institutes/|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nchmcounselling.nic.in/nchminfo/Public/View.aspx?page=79 |title=NCHM Counselling 2018 |publisher=Nchmcounselling.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial Technology programs typically include instruction in optimization theory, human factors, organizational behavior, industrial processes, industrial planning procedures, computer applications, and report and presentation preparation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences: Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP). Retrieved on October 26, 2009 from http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/occupationallookup6d.ASP?CIP=15.0612&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ATMAE Membership Venn Diagram. {{cite web |url=http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113190247/http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning and designing manufacturing processes and equipment is a main aspect of being an industrial technologist. An Industrial Technologist is often responsible for implementing certain designs and processes.
== Accreditation and certification ==

The USA based [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE), accredits selected collegiate programs in Industrial Technology in the USA. An instructor or graduate of an Industrial Technology program may choose to become a Certified Technology Manager (CTM) by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering [[Production Planning]] &amp; Control, Safety, Quality, and Management/Supervision.

ATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) for accrediting Industrial Technology programs. CHEA recognizes ATMAE in the U.S. for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in
the United States.(2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf ATMAE Scope of Recognition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231001220/http://chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge base ==

"A career in industrial technology typically entails formal education from an accredited college or university. Opportunities are available to professionals with all levels of education. Those who hold associate degrees typically qualify for entry-level technician and technologist positions, such as in the maintenance and operation of machinery. Bachelor's degree-holders could fill management and engineering positions, such as plant manager, production supervisor and quality systems engineering technologist. A graduate degree in industrial technology could qualify individuals for jobs in research, teaching and upper-level management".&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;

Industrial Technology includes wide-ranging subject matter and could be viewed as an amalgamation of [[industrial engineering]] and business topics with a focus on practicality and management of technical systems with less focus on actual engineering of those systems.

Typical curriculum at a four-year university might include courses on [[manufacturing|manufacturing process]], technology and impact on society, mechanical and electronic systems, [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control|control]], [[materials science]], [[packaging]], [[Operations management|production and operations management]], and manufacturing facility planning and design. In addition, the Industrial Technologist may have exposure to more [[Vocational education|vocational-style education]] in the form of courses on [[CNC]] manufacturing, [[welding]], and other tools-of-the-trade in manufacturing.

== Industrial technologist ==

Industrial technology program graduates obtain a majority of positions which are applied engineering and/or management oriented.  Since "industrial technologist" is not a common job title in the United States, the actual bachelor's degree or associate degree earned by the individual is obscured by the job title he/she receives. Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a bachelor's degree include quality systems engineering technologist, manufacturing engineering technologist, industrial engineering technologist, plant manager, production supervisor, etc.&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Common Industrial Technology Jobs "&gt;{{cite web|title= What Are Some Common Jobs in the Field of Industrial Technology? |url=http://learn.org/articles/What_are_Some_Common_Jobs_in_the_Field_of_Industrial_Technology.html|publisher=utr zfeqaLearn.org|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a two-year associate degree include project technologist, manufacturing technologist, process technologist, etc.&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;

A technologist curriculum may focus or specialize in a certain technical area of study. Examples of this includes [[electronics]], [[manufacturing]], [[construction]], [[graphics]], [[automation]]/[[robotics]], [[CADD]], [[nanotechnology]], [[aviation]], etc.

== Technological development in industry ==

A major subject of study is technological development in industry. This has been defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* the introduction of new tools and techniques for performing given tasks in production, distribution, data processing (etc.);
* the mechanization of the production process, or the achievement of a state of greater autonomy of technical production systems from human control, responsibility, or intervention;
* changes in the nature and level of integration of technical production systems, or enhanced interdependence;
* the development, utilization, and application of new scientific ideas, concepts, and information in production and other processes; and
* enhancement of technical performance capabilities, or increase in the efficiency of tools, equipment, and techniques in performing given tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Lewis F. ''Technological Development in Industry: A Business-Economic Survey and Analysis'', ISR Publications, Manchester UK, revised second edition 2003, page 1. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-29-4}}.  
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Studies in this area often employ a multi-disciplinary research methodology and shade off into the wider analysis of [[business]] and [[economic growth]] (development, performance). The studies are often based on a mixture of industrial field research and desk-based data analysis and aim to be of interest and use to practitioners in business management and investment (etc.) as well as academics. In [[engineering]], [[construction]], [[textiles]], [[food]] and [[drugs]], [[chemicals]] and [[petroleum]], and other industries, the focus has been on not only the nature and factors facilitating and hampering the introduction and utilization of new technologies but also the impact of new technologies on the production organization (etc.) of firms and various social and other wider aspects of the technological development process.&lt;ref&gt;''Technological Development In Industry: A Business-Economic Survey and Analysis'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

How and When Technological development in industry Performed :
#Technological Processes based always on (Material, Equipment, Human skills and operating circumstances.
#So, If any of these parameters changed, we have to re-calibrate this technology to match the designed product.
#This re-calibration can't be considered as a technology change because industrial technology is not more than an Engineering guide to achieve the required specification of the designed product.
#To calibrate any industrial technology, we should make a documented copy of manufacturing experiments until matching the final product specifications based on original technology, new changed parameters and scientific basics.
#Finally, documentation of the new change should be done to the original industrial technology for that new case as a new addition.
#Any application of industrial technology for 1st time or after a long time stop,Technology processes should be tested by a primary samples triers as a Re-calibration process.

'''International education''' refers to a dynamic concept that involves a journey or movement of people, minds, or ideas across political and cultural frontiers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moran Hansen|first=Holly|date=2002|title=Defining international education|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/he.41|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|language=en|volume=2002|issue=117|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/he.41|issn=0271-0560}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is facilitated by the [[globalization]] phenomenon, which increasingly erases the constraints of geography on economic, social and cultural arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook on Globalization and Higher Education|last=King|first=Roger|last2=Marginson|first2=Simon|last3=Naidoo|first3=Rajani|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781848445857|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept involves a broad range of learning, covering, for instance, [[Formal learning|formal education]] and [[informal learning]] (e.g. training, [[Student exchange program|exchange programs]], [[cross-cultural communication]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annual Review of Comparative and International Education 2017|last=Wiseman|first=Alexander|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781787437661|location=Bingley, WA|pages=211-212}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could also involve a reorientation of academic outlook such as the pursuit of “worldmindedness” as a goal so that a school or its academic focus is considered [[International school|international]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities|National Association of State Universities]] prescribes the adoption of "proper education" that reflects the full range of international, social, political, cultural, and economic dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management (ETEEEM 2014), Hong Kong, 15-16 November 201|last=Tan|first=Deyao|publisher=CRC Press|year=2015|isbn=9781138027800|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The emergence of international education as a discipline may be attributed to the international and intercontinental initiatives of the past, which aimed to achieve education, learning, and intellectual exchange. This is demonstrated in the formalized academic relations between countries in the form of bilateral and scientific agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of International Education and Development|last=McGrath|first=Simon|last2=Gu|first2=Qing|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780415747547|location=Oxon|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, international education is considered a mechanism of international cooperation and, in some cases, it stems from the recognition that different cultures offer different outlooks and styles of learning and teaching in addition to the transfer of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhancing Asia-Europe Co-operation Through Educational Exchange|last=Wessala|first=Georg|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9780415481946|location=Oxon|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are scholars who associate the development of international education with [[comparative education]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Education: The Dialectic of the Global and the Local|last=Arnove|first=Robert|last2=Torres|first2=Carlos Alberto|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2007|isbn=0742559858|location=Lanham, MD|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is concerned with the evaluation and scrutiny of different educational systems in various countries for the purpose of developing an education and educational structures that are global in scope and application. This concept is considered ancient, having been used in [[classical Greece]], while the actual term was first used by [[William Russell (educator)|William Russell]] in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Handbook of Comparative Education|last=Cowen|first=Robert|last2=Kazamias|first2=Andreas|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9781402064029|location=Dordrecht|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; International education diverged from it as it assumed the form of more organized programs that bring together learners and teachers from different countries to learn from each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Definitions ==
International education can be seen as developing ‘international-mindedness,’ or enhancing international attitude and awareness &lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cambridge *|first=James|last2=Thompson|first2=Jeff|date=2004|title=Internationalism and globalization as contexts for international education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0305792042000213994|journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=161–175|doi=10.1080/0305792042000213994|issn=0305-7925|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. From an ideological perspective, international education has a focus on moral development, by influencing the creation of “positive attitudes towards peace, international understanding and responsible world citizenship”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

From a pragmatic approach, international education can relate to economic and cultural globalization&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. For instance, there are increasing demands for education qualifications to be transferable between schools and education systems&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. Furthermore, there is a “spread of global quality standards through quality assurances procedures such as accreditation”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

Overall, international education can be viewed as the following:  

* Promoting international understanding/international-mindedness and/or global awareness/understanding&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Being active in global engagement/global or world citizenship&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tate|first=Nicholas|date=2013|title=International education in a post-Enlightenment world|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|journal=Educational Review|language=en|volume=65|issue=3|pages=253–266|doi=10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|issn=0013-1911|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increasing intercultural understanding and respect for difference&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Encouraging tolerance and commitment to peace &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Direct examples of international education include facilitating students’ entry into universities outside of their home countries&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayden|first=Mary|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shona|date=2018-02-06|title=International education: the transformative potential of experiential learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=403–413|doi=10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|issn=0305-4985|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, temporarily studying abroad is another illustration of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Program is seen as an influence in the development of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. The IB Diploma Program encourages students to learn and understand different cultures, languages, and points of view&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. This idea is incorporated into elements of the program e.g. Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. CAS requires students to participate in activities promoting each of these three components. Through such activities, the intention is that global issues will affect students’ understanding of the world in a meaningful way&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Specifically, these non-formal, non-academic experiences should enhance students’ comprehension of world issues in a manner that, for instance, reading books or participating in lessons may not &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Based on student engagement and involvement, two general meanings emerge. The first refers to education that transcends national borders through the exchange of people. A good example would be students traveling to study at an [[international branch campus]], as part of a [[study abroad]] program or as part of a [[student exchange program]].{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} The second is a comprehensive approach to education that intentionally prepares students to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}}

The [[International Baccalaureate]] however, defines the term according to a certain criteria. This criteria include the development of citizens of the world in accordance with culture, language, and social cohesion, building a sense of identity and cultural awareness, encrypting recognition and development of universal human values, encouraging discovery and enjoyment of learning, equipping students with collectivist or individualistic skills and knowledge that can be applied broadly, fostering global thinking when responding to local situations, encourage diversity and flexibility in teaching pedagogic methodologies, and supply appropriate forms of assessment and international benchmarking.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

While definitions vary, '''international education''' is generally taken{{By whom|date=June 2018}} to include:
* Knowledge of other world regions &amp; cultures;
* Familiarity with international and [[global studies|global issues]];
* Skills in working effectively within global or cross-cultural environments, and using information from different sources around the world;
* Ability to communicate in multiple languages; and
* Dispositions towards respect and concern for other cultures and peoples.

==Millennium Development Goals==
One of the eight [[Millennium Development Goals|millennium development goals]] ratified in the [[United Nations]] in the year 2000, focuses on achieving universal primary education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wysokińska|first=Zofia|date=March 2017|title=Millennium Development Goals/UN and Sustainable Development Goals/UN as Instruments for Realizing Sustainable Development Concept in the Global Economy|url=https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dbth%26AN%3d121741476%26site%3deds-live|journal=Comparative Economic Research|volume=20|pages=101-118|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;. {{non sequitur|date=June 2018}}
 International education is also a major part of international development. Professionals and students wishing to be a part of international education development are able to learn through organizations and university and college programs.{{how|date=June 2018}} Organizations around the world use education as a means to development.{{Relevance inline|date=June 2018}} Previous research demonstrates a positive correlation between the educational level and economic growth, especially in the poorest regions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00449|title=Economic and labour market outcomes of education [Social Impact].

* improve access to complete, free schooling of good quality for all primary school-age children
* greatly increase learning opportunities for youth and adults
* improve adult literacy rates by 50%
* eliminate gender disparities in schooling
* improve all aspects of education quality. 

== Sustainable Development Goals ==
At the end of 2015, the United Nations led another initiative to continue on the work of development goals. [[Sustainable Development Goals|The Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) contains 17 global goals, which are more extensive than the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millenium Development Goals]] (MDGs). Compared to the 2015 MDGs, the SDGs tries to ensure that no one is left behind. In this regard, not only state actors, but also major private “non-state” actors and multinational companies are involved and active in global education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ei-ie.org/en/detail_page/4918/sustainable-development-goals|title=Sustainable Development Goals : Education International|last=International|first=Education|work=Education International|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is stated under Goal 4 of the SDGs: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, SDGs promote international education through some of the following targets:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* “By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity, and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development” (Target 4.7)

* “By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrollment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering, and scientific programs, in developed countries and other developing countries” (Target 4.B)

''See also'' [[Comparative education]]; and [[Liberalism]], [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], [[Power Transition Theory]], [[International Development]], as focus areas that provide insight into international phenomena relevant to "International Education."

There are different lenses international education can be viewed as. For example, thinking of international education in terms of a study abroad program that can help prepare students when looking for international occupations. Another example can be that international development is a focal point that is taught in colleges and universities under the umbrella of international education.

== Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) ==
Although very successful programs such as [[Engineers Without Borders]]{{Example needed |s|date=June 2018}} enable students in one country to obtain an international education while working on [[open source appropriate technology]] projects abroad, the cost of this approach can be prohibitive for large scale replication. Recent, work has shown that using a virtual educational exchange, can have many of the positive benefits associated with international education and cross cultural experiences, without the prohibitive costs of overseas programs.&lt;ref&gt;Augusta Abrahamse, Mathew Johnson, Nanette Levinson, Larry Medsker, Joshua M.

==International Education Week==
International Education Week is held in the United States by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Education.  The choice of week for celebration is determined at each institution, but is generally the week before the week that includes [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. Thanksgiving]]: {{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}.&lt;ref name="DOS-week"&gt;[http://eca.state.gov/programs-initiatives/international-education-week United States Department of State: International Education Week]&lt;/ref&gt;  The aims of this event are to provide an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of international education and global exchange.This joint initiative promotes programs that prepare Americans for a global milieu and attract future leaders from abroad to study, learn and exchange experiences in the U.S. This shows how International education is not just about physically crossing borders, but is also about thinking globally in local situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iew.state.gov International Education Week 2010]. Iew.state.gov. Retrieved on 2011-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools throughout the US celebrate this week through on-campus and off-campus events.

==Challenges Facing International education==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=December 2017}}
International education has a somewhat unusual position in higher education.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} While recognized as an important sphere of activity, it tends to be handled by administrative offices at the top of departments of languages and literature and international affairs. The scholars involved in international education usually have their primary involvement in other teaching and research.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} This leads to four distinctive characteristics particular to the field of international education:&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, William.ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education Washington DC. Current Challenges of International Education. ERIC Digest.Publication Date: 2001-12-00&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is little consensus concerning the guiding theme of the field as well as its scope. Should the field stress internationalization, trans nationalization, or globalization?&lt;ref&gt;(Barrows, 2000; Committee for Transnational Competence, 2000; Hilary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
# International education is not a prominent feature of the contemporary higher education experience. Using enrollment in foreign languages as an indicator, 16 percent of all U.S. college students were enrolled in foreign languages in the peak period of the 1960s; the proportion is currently down to 8 percent (Hayward, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;6).
# There is imbalance in regional coverage. The regions and languages covered at a particular institution are a function of idiosyncratic patterns of faculty recruitment. Nationally, there is reasonable coverage of Western Europe and Latin America and most European languages compared to limited coverage of Africa and the Middle East. For students enrolled in foreign languages, Spanish is the most popular followed by the other major languages of Western Europe; 6 percent enroll in Asian languages. Languages of the Middle East make up only 2 percent (1.3 being Hebrew and .5 percent Arabic). The languages of Africa constitute only 0.15 percent of enrollments.
# Because international education is not a primary concern of most scholars in the field, research is somewhat sporadic, non-cumulative, and tends to be carried out by national organizations as part of advocacy projects (e.g. Lambert, 1989; Brecht and Rivers, 2000). The most recent example is the American Council of Education's (ACE's) Internationalization of Higher Education: A Status Report. (Hayward, 2000). However, programs through various institutions, such as the [[Fulbright Program]] offer research opportunities for those wishing to study abroad.

Additionally, one of the challenges of international students is that increasingly higher education institutions are treating them as cash cows {{buzzword inline|date=June 2018}} for meeting their budget challenges. Institutions must do more to support international students in their academic and career success by providing advising, training and coaching that is culturally attuned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/2016/03/05/higher-education-must-go-beyond-recruitment-and-immigration-compliance-of-international-students/|title=International Students are Paying More for Education; are Universities Doing Enough?|last=Hu|first=Di|date=2016-03-05|website=interEDGE.org}}&lt;/back&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to education:

'''[[Education]]''' – in the general sense is any act or [[experience]] that has a formative effect on the [[mind]], [[Moral character|character]], or physical ability of an individual. In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] from one generation to another. Education can also be defined as the process of becoming an educated person.&lt;ref&gt;Don, Berg. "Definition of Education." teach-kids-attitude-1st.com. N.p., n.d.

== Educational philosophies ==
* Traditions in education
** [[Idealism]] – This tradition emerged in Greece and the famous philosophers who introduced this concept were Socrates and his pupil Plato. The basic concept launched was that all the things we see in this world are actually the copy not original.  What ever we produce here becomes an idea in our mind. So whatever we work to create something is first takes shape in ideas and minds, so the true reality is Idealism.They both supported an education which provides the opportunity to develop mental faculties and make student think properly to find any reality.
** [[Philosophical realism|Realism]] – Aristotle, the pupil of Plato was the person who got the concept of Realism and argued that the Idealism is not the only reality, but there are many natural things which are the part of our atmosphere and we come across those things. Whatever we observe is very important to work on and find the realities using empirical evidences. So the education that is based on experience and observable realities will guide the students to find out the reality. The same has relevance to the philosophy of Positivism.
** [[Educational perennialism|Perennialism]] – This concept was introduced by Robert Hutchins who was of a view that the education should have ever-lasting impact on the students and therefore the only ever-last ideas should be taught. for that he supported the religious concepts to be incorporated in the curriculum.
** [[Existentialism]] – Kierkegaard argued that all the philosophers are of a view to inculcate into the students which is something outdoor with reference to the students. He told that realities are subjective and they are with the individuals themselves. The education should work on individuals to harness the inner realities.
** [[Theism]] – Thomas Aquinas introduced the church doctrine in education and emphasized that reason and faith are complimentary so the both ideas should be the base of education and the students should go by the reasons introduced by the faith, church or religion.
** [[Essentialism]] – The education philosophies were taking many turns in the twentieth century when William Bagley raised his voice to attract the attention of the theoreticians telling that the education should have a core basics of the culture and heritage. The students should be given choice of study the said core subject and they should go to the 1930s education where the same was used to teach.
** [[Pragmatism]] – John Dewey was the person who told that in education a democratic view is to be implemented. Students should be given a chance to explore themselves and they should go by their own instinctive drives.
** [[Critical thinking]] – There was a team of German theoreticians like Adorno, Horkheimer and Habermas who gave the concept of Critical Theory and argued that the education which provides the students and prepare them to analyze the things under discussion, is the basic requirement of education.
** [[Social education]] – In his book, Social Education, Applied Perspective, Muhammad Zahid Azeem Zahid has argued that the education which provides the opportunity to the students to find their space in society and the education should be in line with the societal need not only individually but holistically as well. The Social Education Model is to be implemented in the third world countries as there is a big need to join the individual and society. An educated person can become a good professional and can lead a good life individually, but the need of the day is that he or she should keep his profession and the lifestyle favorable to the society as well....

=== Schools ===

* [[School]] – an institution designed for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education (commonly compulsory), in which students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. Non-compulsory higher education follows, and is taught in institutions called a college or university.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4766">'''SESI Mathematics''' is a project developed by [[FIRJAN System]] with the aim of improving the teaching of math for high school students. The program consists of a series of initiatives, from the organization of training courses for teachers and distribution of educational kits, to the providing of physical spaces for students of [[SESI Rio]] and [[SENAI Rio]] network, as well as for those from selected state schools. Although the project has the pretension of being expanded to other Brazilian states, nowadays it only operates in the states of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Bahia]].

== History ==
SESI Mathematics was launched in 2012 by SESI Rio. The program counted on an initial investment of R$ 10&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The equivalent of US$ 4,525&amp;nbsp;mi in July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caxiasdigital.com.br/blog/firjan-lanca-programa-sesi-matematica-com-investimento-inicial-de-r-10-milhoes/|title=FIRJAN lança programa SESI Matemática com investimento inicial de R$ 10 milhões (in Portuguese)|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=30 September 2012|website=Caxias Digital}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was created based on the ''Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Nacional'' (read "Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education"), motivated by the poor performance of Brazil in national&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebc.com.br/infantil/para-educadores/2013/01/rio-de-janeiro-ira-sediar-museu-de-matematica|title=Rio de Janeiro irá sediar museu de matemática (in Portuguese)|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=14 January 201|website=Portal EBC – Empresa Brasil de Comunicação}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international reviews, as well as in researches&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Related research: [http://www.firjan.org.br/lumis/portal/file/fileDownload.jsp?fileId=2C908CEC30E85C9501311ECC86C85567 "O que falta ao trabalhador brasileiro" (PDF – 243KB)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519184700/http://www.firjan.org.br/lumis/portal/file/fileDownload.jsp?fileId=2C908CEC30E85C9501311ECC86C85567 |date=2014-05-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; that indicated a lack of skilled people to work in areas related to the exact sciences, which require mastery of [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aconteceempetropolis.com.br/2014/02/17/programa-para-facilitar-o-aprendizado-de-matematica-sera-implantado-na-rede-municipal-de-ensino/|title=Programa para facilitar o aprendizado de matemática será implantado na rede municipal de ensino (in Portuguese)|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=17 February 2014|website=Acontece em Petrópolis, Portal de notícias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an agreement was signed between SESI Bahia and the [[List of Governors of Bahia|Government of Bahia State]] to extend the project to the schools of the state of [[Bahia]].&lt;ref name="bahia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correio24horas.com.br/detalhe/noticia/escolas-baianas-vao-adotar-sesi-matematica/|title=Escolas baianas vão adotar SESI Matemática (in Portuguese)|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=10 July 2013|website=Correio}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the project won the Idea Brasil award in the "[[Visual design|Design]] Strategy" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anacouto.com.br/pensamentos/novos-premios-idea-brasil-2013-2 |title=Novos Prêmios – Idea Brasil 2013 (in Portuguese)|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=2013|website=Ana Couto Branding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
The project's initiatives make use of online interactive technologies such as educational games as a way to encourage the teaching of students.

The games are developed by the English company Mangahigh.&lt;ref name="bahia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rj.gov.br/web/seeduc/exibeconteudo?article-id=1240549|title=Alunos do C. E.
