{{Science|applied}}
'''Applied science''' is the application of existing scientific knowledge to practical applications, like [[technology]] or inventions.

Within [[natural science]], disciplines that are [[basic science]], also called '''pure science''', develop basic ''[[information]]'' to 
predict and perhaps explain and understand phenomena in the natural world. Applied science is the use of scientific processes and knowledge as the means to achieve a particular practical or useful result. This includes a broad range of applied science related fields from [[engineering]], [[business]], [[medicine]] to [[early childhood education]].

Applied science can also apply [[formal science]], such as [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], as in [[epidemiology]]. [[Genetic epidemiology]] is an applied science applying both biological and statistical methods.

==Applied research==
Applied research is the practical application of [[science]]. It accesses and uses accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, [[State (polity)|state-]], [[Commerce|business-]], or [[customer|client-]]driven purpose.  Applied research is contrasted with [[pure research]] (basic research) in discussion about research ideals, methodologies, programs, and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|last = Roll-Hansen|first = Nils|url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/62f0/dced123c24c7bc89b7d0d72bfcf885634a43.pdf|title = Why the distinction between basic (theoretical) and applied (practical) research is important in the politics of science|date=April 2009|accessdate = September 13, 2018|format = PDF|publisher = The London School of Economics and Political Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because applied research resides in the messy real world, strict research protocols may need to be relaxed. For example, it may be impossible to use a [[random sample]]. Thus, transparency in the [[methodology]] is crucial. Implications for interpretation of results brought about by relaxing an otherwise strict canon of methodology should also be considered.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Since applied research has a provisional close-to-the-problem and close-to-the-data orientation, it may also use a more provisional [[conceptual framework]] such as [[working hypotheses]] or pillar questions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M.

==Branches of applied science==
{{Outline|Outline of applied science#Branches of applied science}}

Engineering fields include [[thermodynamics]], [[heat transfer]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[statics]], [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[mechanics of materials]], [[kinematics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[materials science]], [[earth sciences]], [[engineering physics]].

[[Medical sciences]], for instance [[medical microbiology]] and [[clinical virology]], are applied sciences that apply [[biology]] toward medical knowledge and inventions, but not necessarily medical technology, whose development is more specifically [[biomedicine]] or [[biomedical engineering]].

==In education==
In Canada, the Netherlands and other places the [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (BASc) is equivalent to the [[Bachelor of Engineering]], and is classified as a professional degree.  The BASc tends to focus more on the application of the engineering sciences.  In Australia and New Zealand this degree is awarded in various fields of study and is considered a highly specialized professional degree.

In [[Education in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom's educational system]], Applied Science refers to a suite of "vocational" science qualifications that run alongside "traditional" [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] or [[A-Level]] Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/An%20invisible%20revolution_Applied%20Science%20in%20the%2014_19%20curriculum.pdf|format=pdf |title=Applied Science - an invisible revolution? |first=Jim |last=Donnelly |publisher=[[Nuffield Foundation]]|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Science courses generally contain more coursework (also known as portfolio or internally assessed work) compared to their traditional counterparts. These are an evolution of the GNVQ qualifications that were offered up to 2005.
These courses regularly come under scrutiny and are due for review following the Wolf Report 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DFE-00031-2011 |title=Review of Vocational Education - The Wolf Report|first=Alison|last=Wolf |date=March 2011 |docket=DFE-00031-2011|publisher=Department for Education and Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
however, their merits are argued elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first=Jacqueline|last=Bell|first2=Jim|last2=Donnelly|title=Positioning Applied Science In Schools: Uncertainty, Opportunity and Risk in Curriculum Reform |url=http://www.education.leeds.ac.uk/research/files/78.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003001238/http://www.education.leeds.ac.uk/research/files/78.pdf|format=pdf|archive-date=3 October 2011|agency=Centre for Studies in Science &amp; Mathematics Education |publisher=University of Leeds |date=2007 |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] offers an [[Minor (academic)|undergraduate minor]] as well as [[Master of Science]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degrees in "applied science." Courses and research cover varied fields including [[neuroscience]], [[optics]], [[materials science and engineering]], [[nondestructive testing]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/ |publisher=William &amp; Mary |title=Applied Science |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, the Bloomberg administration awarded the consortium of Cornell-Technion $100 million in City capital to construct the universities' proposed Applied Sciences campus on Roosevelt Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Mayor Bloomberg, Cornell President Skorton and Technion President Lavie announce historic partnership to build a new applied sciences campus on Roosevelt Island |url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2011b%2Fpr444-11.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 |location= |publisher=The City of New York |agency=Office of the Mayor |date=19 December 2011 |access-date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31567">An '''Atmospheric radiative transfer model, code, or simulator''' calculates [[radiative transfer]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] through a [[planetary atmosphere]], such as [[the Earth]]'s.

== Methods ==

At the core of a radiative transfer model lies the [[radiative transfer equation]] that is numerically solved using a [[Solver (computer science)|solver]] such as a [[discrete ordinate method]] or a [[Monte Carlo method]]. The radiative transfer equation is a [[monochromatic]] equation to calculate radiance in a single layer of the Earth's atmosphere. To calculate the radiance for a spectral region with a finite width (e.g., to estimate the Earth's energy budget or simulate an instrument response), one has to [[numerical integration|integrate]] this over a band of frequencies (or wavelengths). The most exact way to do this is to loop through the frequencies of interest, and for each frequency, calculate the radiance at this frequency. For this, one needs to calculate the contribution of each [[spectral line]] for all [[molecule]]s in the atmospheric layer; this is called a ''line-by-line'' calculation.
For an instrument response, this is then [[convolution|convolved]] with the spectral response of the instrument. A faster but more approximate method is a ''band transmission''. Here, the transmission in a region in a band is characterised by a set of pre-calculated coefficients (depending on [[temperature]] and other parameters). In addition, models may consider [[scattering]] from molecules or particles, as well as [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation]]; however, not all models do so.

== Applications ==

Radiative transfer codes are used in broad range of applications. They are commonly used as [[forward model]]s for the [[Inverse theory|retrieval]] of geophysical parameters (such as [[temperature]] or [[humidity]]). Radiative transfer models are also used to optimize [[solar photovoltaic]] systems for [[renewable energy]] generation.&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Andrews, J.M. Pearce, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance], ''Solar Energy'', '''91''',233–241 (2013). DOI:10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 [https://www.academia.edu/3081684/The_effect_of_spectral_albedo_on_amorphous_silicon_and_crystalline_silicon_solar_photovoltaic_device_performance open access]&lt;/ref&gt; Another common field of application is in a [[General Circulation Model|weather or climate model]], where the [[radiative forcing]] is calculated for [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[aerosols]], or [[clouds]]. In such applications, radiative transfer codes are often called [[parametrization (climate)|radiation parameterization]]. In these applications, the radiative transfer codes are used in forward sense, i.e. on the basis of known properties of the atmosphere, one calculates [[heating rates]], [[radiative fluxes]], and radiances.

There are efforts for intercomparison of radiation codes. One such project was ICRCCM (Intercomparison of Radiation Codes in Climate Models) effort that spanned the late 1980s - early 2000s.  The more current (2011) project, Continual Intercomparison of Radiation Codes, emphasises also using observations to define intercomparison cases.

| HITRAN is a compilation of molecular spectroscopic parameters that a variety of computer codes use to predict and simulate the transmission and emission of light in the atmosphere.  The original version was created at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories (1960's).  The database is maintained and developed at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge MA, USA.

| GEISA (Gestion et Etude des Informations Spectroscopiques Atmosphériques: Management and Study of Spectroscopic Information) is a computer-accessible spectroscopic database, designed to facilitate accurate forward radiative transfer calculations using a line-by-line and layer-by-layer approach. It was started in 1974 at Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD/IPSL) in France. GEISA is maintained by the ARA group at LMD (Ecole Polytechnique) for its scientific part and by the ETHER group (CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique-France) at IPSL (Institut Pierre Simon Laplace) for its technical part. Currently, GEISA is involved in activities related to the assessment of the capabilities of IASI ([[Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer]] on board of the METOP European satellite) through the GEISA/IASI database derived from GEISA.

This page contains tables of [[azeotrope]] data for various binary and ternary mixtures of solvents. The data include the composition of a mixture by weight (in binary azeotropes, when only one fraction is given, it is the fraction of the second component), the [[boiling point]] ('''b.p.''') of a component, the boiling point of a mixture, and the [[specific gravity]] of the mixture. Boiling points are reported at a pressure of 760&amp;nbsp;mm Hg unless otherwise stated. Where the mixture separates into layers, values are shown for upper ('''U''') and lower ('''L''') layers.

The data were obtained from Lange's 10th edition&lt;ref name="Langes"&gt;''Lange's Handbook of Chemistry'', 10th ed. pp1496-1505&lt;/ref&gt; and CRC 44th edition&lt;ref name="crc"&gt;''CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics'', 44th ed. pp 2143-2184&lt;/ref&gt; unless otherwise noted (see color code table).

A list of 15825 binary and ternary mixtures was collated and published by the ACS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Lee H. Horsley|title=Azeotropic Data—III|url=http://pubs.acs.org/isbn/9780841201668|series=Advances in Chemistry Series No. 166|date=1 June 1973|publisher=AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY|isbn=9780841201668}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An azeotrope databank is also available online through Edinburgh University&lt;ref&gt;http://ecosse.org/jack/newWork/Chemeng/azeotrope/hetero.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Scientific Universe.png|thumb|450px|The scale of the Universe mapped to branches of science and the [[hierarchy of the sciences|hierarchy of the sciences]].]]

The '''branches of science''', also referred to as [[Science|sciences]], "scientific fields", or "scientific disciplines," are commonly divided into three major groups:

*'''[[Formal science|Formal sciences]]''': the study of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], which use an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', as opposed to [[fact]]ual, [[methodology]].
*'''[[Natural science]]s''': the study of natural phenomena (including cosmological, geological, chemical, and biological factors of the universe)
*'''[[Social science]]s''': the study of [[human behavior]] and [[Society|societies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Social science|Social Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=March 2018}}

Natural and social sciences are [[empirical]] sciences, meaning that the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and must be capable of being verified by other researchers working under the same conditions.
{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=20}} This verifiability may well vary even ''within'' a scientific discipline &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Davide Castelvecchi, Nature Magazine | date=2015-12-23 | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-string-theory-science/ | title=Is String Theory science? | publisher=Scientific American | accessdate=2018-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=2016-03-03 | url=https://www.nature.com/news/psychology-s-reproducibility-problem-is-exaggerated-say-psychologists-1.19498 | title=Psychology's reproducibility problem | publisher=Nature | accessdate=2018-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural, social, and formal science make up the [[fundamental science]]s, which form the basis of [[interdisciplinary]] and applied sciences such as [[engineering]] and [[medicine]]. Specialized scientific disciplines that exist in multiple categories may include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own terminologies and expertises.&lt;ref&gt;see: {{Cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=March 7, 2008 | url=http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2007/03/scientific_method_relationship.php | title=Scientific Method: Relationships among Scientific Paradigms | publisher=Seed magazine | accessdate=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== Natural/Pure Science ==
{{Main article|Natural science|Outline of natural science}}

Natural science is a branch of [[science]] that seeks to [[wiktionary:elucidate|elucidate]] the rules that govern the [[nature|natural]] world by applying an [[Empirical method|empirical]] and [[scientific method]] to the study of the [[universe]]. The term natural sciences is used to distinguish it from the [[social sciences]], which apply the scientific method to study [[human behavior]] and [[social]] [[patterns]]; the [[humanities]], which use a [[critical theory|critical]], or [[Analytic philosophy|analytical approach]] to the study of the [[human condition]]; and the [[formal sciences]].

=== Physical science ===
{{Main article|Physical science|Outline of physical science}}

Physical science is an encompassing term for the branches of natural science and science that study non-living systems, in contrast to the life sciences. However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena. There is a difference between physical science and physics.

==== Physics ====
{{Main article|Physics|Outline of physics}}

''Physics''(from {{lang-grc|φύσις|[[physis]]|nature}}) is a [[natural science]] that involves the study of [[matter]]&lt;ref name = "feynman"&gt;
[[Richard Feynman]] begins [[The Feynman Lectures on Physics|his ''Lectures'']] with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that ''all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ...''" {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: The term 'universe' is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]] or the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Physics is one of the oldest [[academic discipline]]s, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000&amp;nbsp;BCE, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of [[natural philosophy]] along with [[chemistry]], certain branches of [[mathematics]], and [[biology]], but during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 16th century, the [[natural science]]s emerged as unique research programs in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon]]'s 1620 ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was critical in the [[History of scientific method|development of scientific method]].&lt;/ref&gt; Certain research areas are [[interdisciplinary]], such as [[biophysics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], which means that the boundaries of physics are not [[demarcation problem|rigidly defined]]. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries [[physicalism]] emerged as a major unifying feature of the [[philosophy of science]] as physics provides fundamental explanations for every [[observation|observed]] natural [[phenomenon]]. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening to new research areas in mathematics and philosophy.

==== Chemistry ====
{{Main article|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry}}

''Chemistry'' (the etymology of the word has been much disputed)&lt;ref&gt;'''See:''' [[Chemistry (etymology)]] for possible origins of this word.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[science]] of [[matter]] and the changes it undergoes. The science of matter is also addressed by [[physics]], but while physics takes a more general and fundamental approach, chemistry is more specialized, being concerned by the composition, behavior (or reaction), structure, and properties of [[matter]], as well as the changes it undergoes during [[chemical reaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chemistry Chemistry]. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[physical science]] which studies various [[chemical substance|substance]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, and matter (especially carbon based); [[biochemistry]], the study of [[chemical substance|substances]] found in [[organisms|biological organisms]]; [[physical chemistry]], the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as [[thermodynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]; and [[analytical chemistry]], the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[Chemical structure|structure]]. Many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years, e.g. [[neurochemistry]] the chemical study of the [[nervous system]] (see [[#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines]]).

==== Earth science ====
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of earth science}}

''Earth science'' (also known as ''geoscience'', ''the geosciences'' or ''the Earth sciences'') is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the [[planet]] [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Earth+science&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h=0 Wordnet Search: Earth science]&lt;/ref&gt; It is arguably a special case in [[planetary science]], the Earth being the only known [[life]]-bearing planet. There are both [[reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth sciences. The formal discipline of Earth sciences may include the study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceans and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geography]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth system works, and how it evolved to its current state.

===== Ecology=====
{{Main article|Ecology|Outline of ecology}}

Ecology (from Greek: οἶκος, "house"; -λογία, "study of") is the [[scientific]] study of the relationships that living [[organisms]] have with each other and with their abiotic [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Topics of interest to ecologists include the composition, distribution, amount ([[biomass]]), number, and changing states of organisms within and among [[ecosystems]].

===== Oceanography =====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}

Oceanography, or marine biology, is the branch of [[Earth science]] that study of the ocean . It covers a wide range of topics, including [[marine organisms]] and [[ecosystem]] dynamics; [[ocean currents]], [[water waves|waves]], and geophysical fluid dynamics; [[plate tectonics]] and the geology of the sea floor; and [[flux|fluxes]] of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within it: [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], and [[physics]] as well as [[geography]].

===== Geology =====
{{Main article|Geology|Outline of geology}}

Geology (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γῆ, gê, "earth" and λόγος, [[logos]], "study") is the science comprising the study of solid [[Earth]], the [[rocks]] of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change.

===== Meteorology=====
{{Main article|Meteorology|Outline of meteorology}}

Meteorology is the [[interdisciplinary]] scientific study of the [[atmosphere]]. Studies in the field stretch back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 17th century. The 19th century saw breakthroughs occur after observing networks developed across several countries. After the development of the computer in the latter half of the 20th century, breakthroughs in [[weather forecasting]] were achieved.

==== Space Science or Astronomy ====
{{Main article|Space Science|Outline of space science}}

Space science or Astronomy is the study of everything in outer space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/space+science space science – definition of space science by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This has sometimes been called [[astronomy]], but recently astronomy has come to be regarded as a division of broader space science, which has grown to include other related fields,&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/planetary-science-data/national-space-science-data-center-nssdc/ National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) – NASA Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; such as studying issues related to [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and [[space exploration]] (including [[space medicine]]), [[space archaeology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/space+science Space science | Define Space science at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and science performed in [[outer space]] (see [[space research]]).

=== Life science ===
{{Main article|Life science|Outline of life sciences}}

''Life science'' comprises the branches of science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemirror.com/branches-of-science-the-complete-list Branches of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; that involve the scientific study of living organisms, like plants, animals, and human beings. However, the study of behavior of organisms, such as practiced in ethology and psychology, is only included in as much as it involves a clearly biological aspect. While biology remains the centerpiece of life science, technological advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have led to a burgeoning of specializations and new, often interdisciplinary, fields.

==== Biology ====
{{Main article|Biology|Outline of biology}}

''Biology'' is the branch of [[natural science]] concerned with the study of [[life]] and living [[organism]]s, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Based on definition from [http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608000000/http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |date=June 8, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biology is a vast subject containing many subdivisions, topics, and disciplines.

===== Zoology =====
{{Main article|Zoology|Outline of zoology}} 

Zoology, occasionally spelled zoölogy, is the branch of science that relates to the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct. The term is derived from Ancient Greek ζῷον (zōon, "animal") + λόγος (logos, "knowledge"). Some branches of zoology include: [[anthrozoology]], [[arachnology]], [[archaeozoology]], [[cetology]], [[embryology]], [[entomology]], [[helminthology]], [[herpetology]], [[histology]], [[ichthyology]], [[malacology]], [[mammalogy]], [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[nematology]], [[ornithology]], [[palaeozoology]], [[pathology]], [[primatology]], [[protozoology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and [[zoogeography]].

=====Human biology=====
{{main article|Human biology}}
Human biology is an interdisciplinary academic field of biology, biological anthropology, nutrition and medicine which focuses on humans; it is closely related to primate biology, and a number of other fields.

Some branches of biology include: [[microbiology]], [[anatomy]], [[neurology]] and [[neuroscience]], [[immunology]], [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[biophysics]], [[biolinguistics]], and [[ophthalmology]].

===== Botany=====
{{Main article|Botany|Outline of botany}}

Botany, plant science, or plant biology is a branch of biology that involves the scientific study of plant life. Botany covers a wide range of scientific disciplines including structure, growth, reproduction, metabolism, development, diseases, chemical properties, and evolutionary relationships among taxonomic groups. Botany began with early human efforts to identify edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest sciences. Today botanists study over 550,000 species of living organisms.
The term "botany" comes from Greek βοτάνη, meaning "pasture, grass, fodder", perhaps via the idea of a livestock keeper needing to know which plants are safe for livestock to eat.

== Social sciences ==
{{Main article|Social sciences|Outline of social science}}

The ''social sciences'' are the [[field of study|fields]] of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]] that study society. "Social science" is commonly used as an [[umbrella term]] to refer to a plurality of fields outside of the [[natural sciences]]. These include: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[business administration]], [[communication]], [[criminology]], [[economics]], [[education]], [[government]], [[linguistics]], [[international relations]], [[political science]], some branches of [[psychology]] (results of which can not be replicated or validated easily - e.g. [[social psychology]]), [[public health]], [[ theology]], [[sociology]] and, in some contexts, [[geography]], [[history]] and [[law]].&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite book |last=Verheggen |year=1999 |chapter=From shared representations to consensually coordinated actions |title=Theoretical Issues in Psychology |editor-first=John |editor-last=Morrs |publisher=International Society for Theoretical Psychology |location= |isbn= |display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Vygotskyboom.htm |first=L. |last=Garai |first2=M. |last2=Kocski |title=Another crisis in the psychology: A possible motive for the Vygotsky-boom |journal=Journal of Russian and East-European Psychology |year=1995 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=82–94 |doi=10.2753/RPO1061-0405330182 |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal sciences ==
{{Main article|Formal sciences|Outline of formal science}}

The ''formal sciences'' are the branches of science that are concerned with [[formal system]]s, such as [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[information theory]], [[systems theory]], [[decision theory]], [[statistics]], and [[theoretical linguistics]].

Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of [[Scientific theory|theories]] based on [[observation]]s in the [[Reality|real world]] ([[empirical knowledge]]), but rather with the properties of [[formal system]]s based on [[definition]]s and [[Rule of inference|rule]]s. Methods of the formal sciences are, however, essential to the construction and testing of [[scientific model]]s dealing with observable reality,{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79&amp;ndash;82}} and major advances in formal sciences have often enabled major advances in the empirical sciences.

=== Decision theory ===
{{Main article|Decision theory}}

''Decision theory'' in economics, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and statistics is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision. It is very closely related to the field of game law.

=== Logic ===
{{Main article|Logic|Outline of logic}}

''Logic'' (from the Greek ''[[wiktionary:λογική|λογική]]'' logikē)&lt;ref&gt;"possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical, argumentative", also related to ''[[wiktionary:λόγος|λόγος]]'' (logos), "word, thought, idea, argument, account, reason, or principle" (Liddell &amp; Scott 1999; Online Etymology Dictionary 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; is the formal systematic study of the [[principle]]s of valid [[inference]] and correct [[reasoning]]. Logic is used in most intellectual activities, but is studied primarily in the disciplines of [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[computer science]].  Logic examines general forms which [[argument]]s may take, which forms are valid, and which are [[fallacies]]. In philosophy, the study of logic figures in most major areas: [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]]. In mathematics and computer science, it is the study of valid [[inference]]s within some [[formal language]].&lt;ref name=stanford-logic-onthology&gt;{{cite book | last = Hofweber | first = T. | year = 2004 | chapter = Logic and Ontology |  title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | editor-first = Edward N | editor-last = Zalta | editor-link = Edward N. Zalta | chapterurl = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Logic is also studied in [[argumentation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = J. Robert | editor1-last = Cox | editor2-first = Charles Arthur | editor2-last = Willard | editor2-link = Charles Arthur Willard | title = Advances in Argumentation Theory and Research | publisher = [[Southern Illinois University Press]] | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-8093-1050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{Main article|Mathematics|Outline of mathematics}}

''Mathematics'', first of all known as The Science of numbers which is classified in Arithmetic and Algebra, is classified as a formal science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173067/?site_locale=en_GB Marcus Tomalin (2006) ''Linguistics and the Formal Sciences'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedikt Löwe]] (2002) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20117289 "The Formal Sciences: Their Scope, Their Foundations, and Their Unity"]&lt;/ref&gt; has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] rather than empirical methods.{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}}

=== Statistics ===
{{Main article|Statistics|Outline of statistics}}

''Statistics'' is the study of the collection, organization, and interpretation of [[data]].&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=statistics The Free Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with all aspects of this, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [[Statistical survey|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]].&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;

A [[statistician]] is someone who is particularly well versed in the ways of thinking necessary for the successful application of statistical analysis. Such people have often gained this experience through working in any of a [[list of fields of application of statistics|wide number of fields]]. There is also a discipline called ''[[mathematical statistics]]'', which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.

The word ''statistics'', when referring to the scientific discipline, is singular, as in "Statistics is an art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistics | title = Statistics | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with the word ''statistic'', referring to a quantity (such as [[mean]] or [[median]]) calculated from a set of data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistic | title = Statistic | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose plural is ''statistics'' ("this statistic seems wrong" or "these statistics are misleading").

=== Systems theory ===
{{Main article|Systems theory}}

''Systems theory'' is the [[Interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary]] study of [[system]]s in general, with the goal of elucidating principles that can be applied to all types of systems in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-established, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of [[systems thinking]] and a generalization of [[systems science]]. The term originates from [[Ludwig con Albertan|Bernays]]'s [[#General systems research and systems inquiry|General System Theory]] (GS) and is used in later efforts in other fields, such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Alcott Parsons]] and the system-theory of [[Nickolas McLuhan]].

In this context the word ''systems'' is used to refer specifically to self-regulating systems, i.e. that are self-correcting through [[feedback]]. Self-regulating systems are found in nature, including the physiological systems of our body, in local and global ecosystems, and in climate.

=== Theoretical computer science ===
{{Main article|Theoretical computer science}}

''Theoretical computer science'' (TCS) is a division or subset of general [[computer science]] and focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing.

These divisions and subsets include [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[formal semantics of programming languages]]. Technically, there are hundreds of divisions and subsets besides these two. Each of the multiple parts have their own individual personal leaders (of popularity) and there are many associations and professional social groups and publications of distinction.

== Applied sciences==
{{Main article|Applied science|Outline of applied sciences}}

''Applied science'' is the application of scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. Examples include testing a theoretical model through the use of formal science or solving a practical problem through the use of natural science.

Applied science differs from [[fundamental science]], which seeks to describe the most basic objects and forces, having less emphasis on practical applications. Applied science can be like biological science and physical science.

Example fields of applied science include
* [[Engineering]]
* [[Applied mathematics]]
* [[Applied physics]]
* [[Medicine]]
* [[Computer science]]

Fields of [[engineering]] are closely related to applied sciences. Applied science is important for [[technology]] development. Its use in industrial settings is usually referred to as [[research and development]] (R&amp;D).

'''Formal sciences''' are [[formal language]] disciplines concerned with [[formal system]]s, such as [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[robotics]], [[information theory]], [[game theory]], [[systems theory]], [[decision theory]], and [[theoretical linguistics]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}   Strictly speaking, formal science is not science but a variety of fundamentally abstract logical systems that are applied to both the natural world and human constructs.  Whereas the [[natural science]]s and [[social science]]s seek to characterize [[physical systems]] and [[social system]]s, respectively, using empirical methods, the formal sciences are language [[tools]] concerned with characterizing abstract structures described by [[sign systems]]. The formal sciences aid the natural and social sciences by providing information about the structures the latter use to describe the world, and what inferences may be made about them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==History==
Formal sciences began before the formulation of the [[scientific method]], with the most ancient [[Mathematics|mathematical]] texts dating back to 1800&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Babylonian mathematics]]), 1600&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Egyptian mathematics]]) and 1000&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Indian mathematics]]). From then on different cultures such as the Indian, [[Greek mathematics|Greek]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab and Persian]] made major contributions to mathematics, while the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese]] and [[Japanese mathematics|Japanese]], independently of more distant cultures, developed their own mathematical tradition.

Besides mathematics, [[logic]] is another example of one of oldest subjects in the field of the formal sciences. As an explicit analysis of the methods of reasoning, logic received sustained development originally in three places: [[Indian logic|India]] from the {{nowrap|6th century BC}}, [[Logic in China|China]] in the {{nowrap|5th century BC}}, and Greece between the {{nowrap|4th century BC}} and the {{nowrap|1st century BC}}. The formally sophisticated treatment of modern logic descends from the Greek tradition, being informed from the transmission of [[Aristotelian logic]], which was then further developed by [[logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logicians]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The Indian tradition also continued into the [[early modern period]]. The native Chinese tradition did not survive beyond [[Ancient history|antiquity]], though Indian logic was later adopted in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] China.

As a number of other disciplines of formal science rely heavily on mathematics, they did not exist until mathematics had developed into a relatively advanced level. [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] (1654), and [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1657) started the earliest study of [[probability theory]]. In the early 1800s, [[Gauss]] and [[Laplace]] developed the mathematical theory of [[statistics]], which also explained the use of statistics in insurance and governmental accounting. Mathematical statistics was recognized as a mathematical discipline in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century.

In the mid-20th century, mathematics was broadened and enriched by the rise of new [[mathematical science]]s and engineering disciplines such as [[operations research]] and [[systems engineering]]. These sciences benefited from basic research in [[electrical engineering]] and then by the development of [[Computer|electrical computing]], which also stimulated [[information theory]], [[numerical analysis]] ([[scientific computing]]), and [[theoretical computer science]]. Theoretical computer science also benefits from the discipline of [[mathematical logic]], which included the [[theory of computation]].

==Differences from other forms of science==
{{quote|One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.|[[Albert Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Albert Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Sidelights on relativity |chapter=Geometry and Experience |page=27 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1923}} Reprinted by Dover (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-486-24511-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As opposed to empirical sciences (natural and social), the formal sciences do not involve empirical procedures. They also do not presuppose knowledge of contingent facts, or describe the real world. In this sense, formal sciences are both logically and methodologically [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]], for their content and validity are independent of any empirical procedures.  

Therefore, straightly speaking, formal science is not a science.  It is a formal logical system with its content targeted at the real things, information and thoughts that we experienced.  As [[Francis Bacon]] pointed out in the 17th century, experimental verification of the propositions must be carried out rigorously and cannot take logic itself as the way to draw conclusions in nature.  Formal science is a method that is helpful to science but cannot replace science.

Although formal sciences are conceptual systems, lacking empirical content, this does not mean that they have no relation to the real world. But this relation is such that their formal statements hold in all possible conceivable worlds – whereas, statements based on empirical theories, such as, say, [[general relativity]] or [[evolutionary biology]], do not hold in all possible worlds, and may eventually turn out not to hold in this world as well. That is why formal sciences are applicable in all domains and useful in all empirical sciences.

Because of their non-empirical nature, formal sciences are construed by outlining a set of [[axioms]] and [[definitions]] from which other statements ([[theorems]]) are deduced. In other words, theories in formal sciences contain no [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic statements]]; all their statements are [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

'''Science''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''scientia'', meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[knowledge]] in the form of testable [[Explanation|explanations]] and [[predictions]] about the universe.

[[Modern science]] is typically divided into three major [[Branches of science|branches]] that consist of the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] (e.g. [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]]), which study [[nature]] in the broadest sense; the [[social sciences]] (e.g. [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]]) which study people and societies; and the [[formal sciences]] (e.g. [[mathematics]], [[Formal logic|logic]], [[theoretical computer science]]), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement, however, on the formal sciences being a science as they do not rely on [[empirical evidence]]. Disciplines that use science, such as engineering and medicine, are described as [[applied sciences]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of an topical guide to academic disciplines:

An '''academic discipline''' or '''field of study''' is known as a branch of [[knowledge]]. It is [[education|taught]] as an accredited part of [[higher education]]. A scholar's discipline is commonly defined and recognized by a [[faculty (division)|university faculties.]] That person will be accredited by [[learned society|learned societies]] to which he or she belongs along with the [[academic journal]]s in which he or she publishes. However, no formal criteria exist for defining an academic discipline.

Disciplines varies between universities and programs. These discipline will have well-defined rosters of journals and conferences supported by a few universities and publications. A discipline may have branches, that are called sub-disciplines.

There is no consensus on how some academic disciplines should be classified (e.g., whether [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] are disciplines of [[social science]]s or fields within the [[humanities]]). More generally, the proper criteria for organizing knowledge into disciplines are also open to debate.

==Historical background==

'''Adiabatic''' (from ''Gr.'' ἀ ''negative'' + διάβασις ''passage; transference'') refers to any process that occurs without [[heat transfer]].  This concept is used in many areas of physics and engineering. Notable examples are listed below.

==Automobiles==
* [[Engine braking#Diesel engines|Engine braking]], a feature of some diesel engines, uses adiabatic expansion to diminish the vehicle's forward momentum.

==Meteorology==
* [[Adiabatic lapse rate]], the change in air temperature with changing height, resulting from pressure change.

==Quantum chemistry==
* Adiabatic invariant [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]]

==Thermodynamics==
* [[Adiabatic process]]
* [[Adiabatic ionization]]
* [[Adiabatic index]]
* [[Adiabatic accessibility]]

==Quantum mechanics==
* [[Adiabatic theorem]]
* [[Adiabatic quantum motor]]

==Electronics==
* [[Adiabatic circuit]]
* [[Adiabatic logic]]

==Carbohydrate chemistry==
* [[Adiabatic map]]

==Extraction==
* [[Adiabatic extraction]]

A [[mnemonic]] is a memory aid used to improve long term memory and make the process of consolidation easier. Many chemistry aspects, rules, names of compounds, sequences of elements, their reactivity, etc., can be easily and efficiently memorized with the help of mnemonics. This article contains the list of certain mnemonics in chemistry.

== Reactions and ions ==

===Redox reactions===
A [[redox reaction]] is a [[chemical reaction]] in which there is a change in [[oxidation state]] of [[atoms]] participating in the reaction.

===Ions===
An atom (or ion) whose oxidation number increases in a redox reaction is said to be oxidized (and is called a [[reducing agent]]). It is accomplished by loss of one or more [[electron]]s. The atom whose oxidation number decreases gains (receives) one or more electrons and is said to be reduced. This relation can be remembered by the following mnemonics.
* '''''Leo''' says '''Ger!''''' or '''''Leo''' the lion, '''Ger!''''' can be used to represent '''''L'''oss of '''e'''lectron is '''o'''xidation; '''G'''ain of '''e'''lectron is '''r'''eduction.''&lt;ref name="Lane2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Lane|title=Oxygen: The Molecule that Made the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ziVk6CI82WgC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=10 August 2012|date=26 March 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-860783-0|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhD2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rene Fester Kratz|title=Molecular and Cell Biology For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gux4J6ctaeIC&amp;pg=PT70|accessdate=10 August 2012|date=2 June 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-43066-8|pages=70–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cations and anions===
[[Cations]] are positively (+) charged [[ions]] while [[anions]] are negatively (−) charged. This can be remembered with the help of the following mnemonics.
*'''''Cat'''s have '''paws''' ⇔ '''Cat'''ions are '''paws'''itive.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=AP Chemistry For Dummies | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008 |author1=Peter J.

*''An '''anion''' is '''a n'''egative '''ion'''. ('''An'''&lt;s&gt;&lt;span style="color:gray;"&gt;egative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/s&gt;'''ion''' &amp;rArr; '''Anion''').''&lt;ref name="Jain2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Subhash Jain|title=Improve Your Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2YMat4HXI8C&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=28 December 2012|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|isbn=978-81-8430-035-2|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cation vs. anion: positive vs. negative===
The '''t''' in ca'''t'''ion looks like a plus sign: "ca+ion".

Cation is positive, anion is negative.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medicalmnemonics.com/pdf/2002_09_full_abr_a4.pdf | title=MedicalMnemonics Full Abridged | publisher=Medicalmnemonics.com | accessdate=16 February 2015 | pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxidation vs. reduction: electrochemical cell and electron gain/loss===
'''AN OIL RIG CAT''':

At the '''AN'''ode, '''O'''xidation '''I'''nvolves '''L'''oss of electrons.

'''R'''eduction '''I'''nvolves '''G'''aining electrons at the '''CAT'''hode.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;!-- OILRIG also found in Zumdahl p. 169, 5th. ed --&gt;

'''LOAN''' - '''L'''eft '''A'''node '''O'''xidation '''N'''egative. 
In written representation of galvanic cell, ''anode'' is written on the ''left''. It is the electrode where ''oxidation'' takes place. It is the ''negative'' electrode. Obviously, the opposite properties (Right/Cathode/Reduction/Positive) are found on the cathode. Hence, by remembering LOAN mnemonic, we can arrive at the corresponding properties for the cathode.

'''LEO says GER''':

"'''L'''oss of '''E'''lectrons, '''O'''xidation; '''G'''ain of '''E'''lectrons, '''R'''eduction".&lt;ref&gt;Zumdahl, Steven S. and Zumdahl, Susan A. (2000), ''Chemistry,'' Houghton Mifflin, 5th ed., p. 169 {{ISBN|0-395-98583-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrodes===
An [[electrode]] in which oxidation takes place is called an [[anode]] while in that which reduction takes place is called [[cathode]]. This applies for both [[electrolytic cell|electrolytic]] and [[electrochemical cell]]s, though the [[Electric charge|charge]] on them reverses. The ''red cat'' and ''an ox'' mnemonics are useful to remember the same.
*'''''Red cat: Red'''uction at '''cat'''hode''
:'''''An ox: An'''ode for '''ox'''idation''.&lt;ref name="Heyworth"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mrs Jacqueline Hilary Briggs |author2=Rex M Heyworth |title=Lcg Ol Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bey4gVjLeAC&amp;pg=PA142|accessdate=10 August 2012|publisher=Pearson Education South Asia|isbn=978-981-06-0008-2|pages=142–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The words '''''o'''xidation ''and'' '''a'''node'', both begin with [[vowels]].
:Also, both '''''r'''eduction ''and'' '''c'''athode'' begin with [[consonants]].&lt;ref name="Jain2009" /&gt;
*'''Fat Cat''': electrons flow '''F'''rom '''A'''node '''T'''o '''Cat'''hode
*'''LOAN''':'''  L'''eft side;'''O'''xidation;'''A'''node;'''N'''egative.

===Hydrogen bonds===
Hydrogen forms [[hydrogen bonds]] with three elements which are nitrogen ('''N'''), oxygen ('''O''') and fluorine ('''F'''). The names of these elements can be remembered by the following mnemonic.
* ''Hydrogen is '''FON'''! (fun).''&lt;ref name="Jain2009" /&gt;

===Polyatomic ions: &amp;minus;ate and -ite ions===
{| class="wikitable"

[[Citizen science]] projects are activities sponsored by a wide variety of organizations so non-scientists can meaningfully contribute to scientific research.  Activities vary widely from transcribing old ship logbooks to digitize the data as part of the [[Old Weather]] project to observing and counting birds at home or in the field for [[eBird]].&lt;ref name=seattle&gt;{{cite news|last=Mapes|first=Lynda V.|title=Citizen scientists can be climate sleuths too|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2020373355_citizensciencexml.html|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Robbins|first=Jim|title=Crowdsourcing, for the birds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/science/earth/crowdsourcing-for-the-birds.html?_r=0|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation can be as simple as playing a computer game for a project called [[Eyewire]] that may help scientists learn more about [[retina]]l [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name=eye&gt;{{cite web|title=Update: EyeWire|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/project.cfm?id=update-eyewire-mit|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be more in depth, such as when citizens collect water quality data over time to assess the health of local waters, or help discover and name new species of insect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schilthuizen|first=Menno|last2=Seip|first2=Lilian|last3=Otani|first3=Sean|last4=Suhaimi|first4=Jadda|last5=Njunjić|first5=Iva|date=2017-06-12|title=Three new minute leaf litter beetles discovered by citizen scientists in Maliau Basin, Malaysian Borneo (Coleoptera: Leiodidae, Chrysomelidae)|url=https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.5.e21947|journal=Biodiversity Data Journal|language=en|volume=5|doi=10.3897/bdj.5.e21947|issn=1314-2828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://acwi.gov/monitoring/vm/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; An emerging branch of Citizen Science are Community Mapping projects that utilize smartphone and tablet technology. For example, TurtleSAT&lt;ref&gt;http://turtlesat.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; is a community mapping project that is mapping freshwater turtle deaths throughout Australia.

Lists of citizen science projects may change. For example, the Old Weather project website indicates that {{As of|2015|01|10|alt=as of}} January 10, 2015, 51% of the logs were completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=old Weather|url=http://www.oldweather.org/|publisher=Zooniverse|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When that project reaches 100 percent, it will move to the completed list.

There are more than 1,100 active and searchable global citizen science projects listed on the [[SciStarter]] website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scistarter.com SciStarter]&lt;/ref&gt;

| footer = The [[natural sciences]] seek to understand how the world and [[universe]] around us works. There are five major branches (top left to bottom right): [[Chemistry]], [[astronomy]], [[earth science]], [[physics]], and [[biology]].
}}

'''Natural science''' is a [[Branches of science|branch of science]] concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]], based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. Mechanisms such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).

In Western society's [[analytic tradition]], the empirical sciences and especially natural sciences use tools from [[formal science]]s, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the "[[laws of science|laws of nature]]". The [[social science]]s also use such methods, but rely more on [[qualitative research]], so that they are sometimes called "[[soft science]]", whereas natural sciences, insofar as they emphasize [[quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data produced, tested, and confirmed through the [[scientific method]], are sometimes called "[[hard science]]".{{sfn|Lagemaat|2006|p=283}}

Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to [[natural philosophy]], usually traced to [[ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
{{main|Philosophy of science}}
Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including [[Karl Popper]]'s controversial [[falsifiability]] criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]], [[accuracy]], and [[quality control]], such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component [[biophysics]] up to complex [[ecology|ecologies]]. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, [[scientific classification|classification]] and [[behaviors]] of [[organism]]s, as well as how [[species]] were formed and their interactions with each other and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

The biological fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[medicine]] date back to early periods of civilization, while [[microbiology]] was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.

Some key developments in biology were the discovery of [[genetics]]; [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; the [[germ theory of disease]] and the application of the techniques of [[biochemistry|chemistry]] and [[biophysics|physics]] at the level of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organic molecule]].

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. [[Molecular biology]] is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while [[cellular biology]] is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while [[ecology]] looks at how various organisms interrelate.

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry#Branches of chemistry}}
[[File:Caffeine.svg|thumb|This [[structural formula]] for molecule [[caffeine]] shows a graphical representation of how the atoms are arranged.]]
Constituting the scientific study of matter at the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as [[gas]]es, molecules, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.

Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.

Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of [[Alchemy]], a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], the discoverer of gas, and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed the theory of the [[Conservation of mass]].

The [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] and [[atomic theory]] began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of [[State of matter|states of matter]], [[ion]]s, [[chemical bond]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s. The success of this science led to a complementary [[chemical industry]] that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

===Physics===
{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics#Branches of physics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|The [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are descriptions of the [[probability distribution]]s of an [[electron]] [[bound state|bound]] to a [[proton]]. Their mathematical descriptions are standard problems in [[quantum mechanics]], an important branch of physics.]]
Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the [[universe]], the [[forces]] and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on [[mathematics]] as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.

The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with [[philosophy]] gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] and [[classical mechanics]], an understanding of [[electricity]] and its relation to [[magnetism]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the development of [[thermodynamics]], and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of atomic and [[subatomic physics]].

The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theoretical physics]], [[applied physics]] and [[optics]]. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Lev Landau]], who worked in multiple areas.

===Astronomy===
{{Main|Astronomy|Outline of astronomy#Branches of astronomy}}
[[File:Moon Dedal crater.jpg|thumb|Unmanned and manned spacecraft missions have been used to image distant locations within the [[Solar System]], such as this ''[[Apollo 11]]'' view of [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]].]]
This discipline is the science of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is concerned with the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of celestial objects, as well as the [[physical cosmology|formation and development of the universe]].

Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the [[cosmos]]. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]]).

While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.

The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s development of [[celestial mechanics]] and the laws of [[gravitation]], although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]], along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.

===Earth science===
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of Earth sciences#Branches of Earth science}}
Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]], [[oceanography]], and [[soil science]].

Although [[mining]] and [[gemology|precious stones]] have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of [[economic geology]] and [[mineralogy]] did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly [[palaeontology]], blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as [[geophysics]], in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonic]]s in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to [[petroleum]] and [[mineral resource]]s, [[climate]] research and to [[environmental assessment]] and [[environmental remediation|remediation]].

====Atmospheric sciences====
{{Main article|Atmospheric sciences}}
Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the [[atmospheric sciences]] is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

====Oceanography====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}
The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by [[astrophysics]], [[geophysics]], [[chemical physics]] and [[biophysics]]. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as [[biochemistry]], [[chemical biology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[astrochemistry]].

A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is [[environmental science]]. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and [[biological components]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.

A comparable discipline is [[oceanography]], as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as [[physical oceanography]] and [[marine biology]]. As the [[marine ecosystem]] is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular [[species]].

There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include [[nanoscience]], [[astrobiology]], and [[complex system]] [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

===Materials science===
{{Main|Materials science}}
[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|The materials paradigm represented as a tetrahedron]]
Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of [[matter]] and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of [[metallurgy]], the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.

It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.

The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

==History==
{{See also|Natural philosophy|History of science}}

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of [[natural philosophy]], the precursor of natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=2}} While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was in all cases religious or mythological, not scientific.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=2–3}}

A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in [[Ancient China]], where [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] and philosophers experimented with elixirs to [[life extension|extend life]] and cure ailments.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=3}} They focused on the [[yin and yang]], or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|pp=3–4}} The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature. Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned. The ashes left by fire were earth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=4}} Using these principles, Chinese philosophers and doctors explored human anatomy, characterizing organs as predominantly yin or yang and understood the relationship between the pulse, the heart and the flow of blood in the body centuries before it became accepted in the West.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

Little evidence survives of how [[Ancient India]]n cultures around the [[Indus River]] understood nature, but some of their perspectives may be reflected in the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Surgeons in the [[Ayurvedic]] tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: [[wind]], [[bile]] and [[phlegm]].{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Ayurvedic surgeons performed complex surgeries and developed a detailed understanding of human anatomy.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

[[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] philosophers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture brought natural philosophy a step closer to direct inquiry about cause and effect in nature between 600 and 400 BC, although an element of magic and mythology remained.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=2}} In the 5th century BC, [[Leucippus]] was an early exponent of [[atomism]], the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}} [[Pythagoras]] applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was [[sphere|spherical]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}}

===Aristotelian natural philosophy (400 BC–1100 AD)===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Aristotle's view of inheritance, as a model of the transmission of patterns of movement of the body fluids from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|Aristotelian form]] from the father.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Later [[Socrates|Socratic]] and [[Plato]]nic thought focused on ethics, morals and art and did not attempt an investigation of the physical world; Plato criticized pre-Socratic thinkers as materialists and anti-religionists.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=21–22}} [[Aristotle]], however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=27–28}} In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the [[stingray]], [[catfish]] and [[bee]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=33–34}} He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=34}} Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the [[Aristotle's biology|father of biology for his pioneering work in that science]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=34–35}} He also presented philosophies about physics, nature and astronomy using [[inductive reasoning]] in his works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=37–39, 53}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle in [[The School of Athens|a 1509 painting]] by [[Raphael]]. Plato rejected inquiry into natural philosophy as against religion, while his student, Aristotle, created a body of work on the natural world that influenced generations of scholars.]]

While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=52}} Still, inspired by his work, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=95}} Many [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=54, 59}} Early [[medieval]] philosophers including [[Macrobius]], [[Calcidius]] and [[Martianus Capella]] also examined the physical world, largely from a cosmological and [[cosmography|cosmographical]] perspective, putting forth theories on the arrangement of celestial bodies and the heavens, which were posited as being composed of [[aether (classical element)|aether]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=103}}

Aristotle's works on natural philosophy continued to be translated and studied amid the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=61–66}} 

In the Byzantine Empire [[John Philoponus]], an Alexandrian Aristotelian commentator and Christian theologian, was the first who questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics. Unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus instead relied on observation, and argued for observation rather than resorting into verbal argument.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as inspiration for Galileo Galilei during the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/philoponus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christian|last=Wildberg|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival in mathematics and science took place during the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from the 9th century onward, when Muslim scholars expanded upon Greek and [[India]]n natural philosophy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=11}} The words ''[[alcohol]]'', ''[[algebra]]'' and ''[[zenith]]'' all have [[Arabic]] roots.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Medieval natural philosophy (1100–1600)===
{{also|Renaissance of the 12th century}}
Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from [[Greek people|Greek]] and Arabic into [[Latin]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=95, 130}} The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=106}} European inventions such as the [[horseshoe]], [[horse collar]] and [[crop rotation]] allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day [[France]] and [[England]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=106–107}} Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian [[theology]] developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as [[heresy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} These works were taught at new universities in [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]] by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}} A 1210 decree from the [[Synod]] of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}}

In the late Middle Ages, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] translated a treatise by the earlier Persian scholar [[Al-Farabi]] called ''On the Sciences'' into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature ''scientia naturalis'', or natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work ''On the Division of Philosophy''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus defined natural science as "the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion," as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}} Following Al-Farabi, he then separated the sciences into eight parts, including physics, cosmology, meteorology, minerals science and plant and animal science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}}

Later philosophers made their own classifications of the natural sciences. [[Robert Kilwardby]] wrote ''On the Order of the Sciences'' in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=156–157}} [[Roger Bacon]], an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with "a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} Later in the 13th century, Catholic priest and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined natural science as dealing with "mobile beings" and  "things which depend on matter not only for their existence, but also for their definition."{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=159–163}} There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=234}} Philosophers pondered questions including the existence of a vacuum, whether motion could produce heat, the colors of rainbows, the motion of the earth, whether elemental chemicals exist and where in the atmosphere rain is formed.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=236–237}}

In the centuries up through the end of the Middle Ages, natural science was often mingled with philosophies about magic and the occult.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=170–178}} Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=189–190}} The interaction between natural philosophy and [[Christianity]] was complex during this period; some early theologians, including [[Tatian]] and [[Eusebius]], considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=239–240}} Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=241–243}} The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnation of 1277]], which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=246–247}} Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=251}} "I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith," he wrote in 1271.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=252}}

===Newton and the scientific revolution (1600–1800)===
By the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophy underwent an evolution beyond commentary on Aristotle as more early Greek philosophy was uncovered and translated.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by [[Copernicus]], [[Tyco Brahe]] and [[Galileo]] brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as [[heliocentric]] and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274–275}} A number of 17th-century philosophers, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] made a break from the past by rejecting Aristotle and his medieval followers outright, calling their approach to natural philosophy as superficial.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=276–277}}

The titles of Galileo's work ''Two New Sciences'' and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''New Astronomy'' underscored the atmosphere of change that took hold in the 17th century as Aristotle was dismissed in favor of novel methods of inquiry into the natural world.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=278–279}} To achieve this, he wrote that "human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} He defined natural philosophy as "the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon proposed scientific inquiry supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–285}} Natural philosophers including [[Isaac Newton]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Francesco Redi]] conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring [[atmospheric pressure]] using a [[barometer]] and disproving [[spontaneous generation]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–290}} Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the [[scientific revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–295}} Newton in 1687 published his ''The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', or ''Principia Mathematica'', which set the groundwork for physical laws that remained current until the 19th century.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=304–306}}

Some modern scholars, including Andrew Cunningham, Perry Williams and [[Floris Cohen]], argue that natural philosophy is not properly called a science, and that genuine scientific inquiry began only with the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} According to Cohen, "the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Other historians of science, including [[Edward Grant]], contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=317–318}}

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time.]]
The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}} One of its principal advances was the use of the [[scientific method]] to investigate nature. Data was collected and [[repeatability|repeatable]] measurements made in [[experiment]]s.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=26–27}} Scientists then formed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the results of these experiments.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of [[falsifiability]] to prove or disprove its accuracy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}}

Newton, an English mathematician and physicist, was the seminal figure in the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=33}} Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe and Kepler, Newton derived the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal law of gravitation]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=33–35}} These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=35}} Newton, for example, showed that the [[tide]]s were caused by the gravitational pull of the [[moon]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=36}} Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}} While natural philosophers had long used mathematics as a means of measurement and analysis, its principles were not used as a means of understanding cause and effect in nature until Newton.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}}

In the 18th century and 19th century, scientists including [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Alessandro Volta]], and [[Michael Faraday]] built upon Newtonian mechanics by exploring [[electromagnetism]], or the interplay of forces with positive and negative charges on [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in "[[Field (physics)|fields]]" that filled space.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply "action at a distance", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent [[Maxwell's equations|theory of electrodynamics]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Using mathematical equations and experimentation, Maxwell discovered that space was filled with charged particles that could act upon themselves and each other, and that they were a medium for the transmission of charged waves.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}}

Significant advances in chemistry also took place during the scientific revolution. [[Antoine Lavoisier]], a French chemist, refuted the [[phlogiston theory]], which posited that things burned by releasing "phlogiston" into the air.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[Joseph Priestley]] had discovered [[oxygen]] in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that [[combustion]] was the result of [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the [[Scientific classification|classification and categorization]] of natural life. This growth in [[natural history]] was led by [[Carl Linnaeus]], whose 1735 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the natural world is still in use. Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pp=171–179}}

===19th-century developments (1800–1900)===
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment (en).svg|thumb|The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was used to disprove that light propagated through a [[luminiferous aether]]. This 19th-century concept was then superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]].]]

By the 19th century, the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions. In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of ''natural science.'' The term ''scientist'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] in an 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''On the Connexion of the Sciences''.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.

===Modern natural science (1900–present)===
According to a famous 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and the American physical chemist [[Merle Randall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances |first1=Gilbert N. |last1=Lewis |first2=Merle |last2=Randall |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |edition=First |others=later Printing edition |date=1923 |asin= B000GSLHZS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural sciences contain three great branches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of ''natural science'' which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates — they are [[mechanics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggins|first=Robert A.|title=Energy storage|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|edition=Online-Ausg. |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy and materials science.

{{main article|Discipline (academia)}}
[[File:Academic disciplines (collage).jpg|thumb|Collage of images representing different academic disciplines]]

An '''academic discipline''' or '''field of study''' is a branch of [[knowledge]], [[education|taught]] and [[research]]ed as part of [[higher education]]. A scholar's discipline is commonly defined by the [[faculty (division)|university faculties]] and [[learned society|learned societies]] to which he or she belongs and the [[academic journal]]s in which he or she publishes [[research]].

Disciplines vary between well-established ones that exist in almost all universities and have well-defined rosters of [[Academic journal|journal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and conferences and nascent ones supported by only a few universities and publications. A discipline may have branches, and these are often called sub-disciplines.

There is no [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] on how some academic disciplines should be classified, for example whether [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] are disciplines of the [[social science]]s or of the [[humanities]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to academic disciplines.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to biochemistry:

'''Biochemistry''' &amp;ndash; study of [[chemistry|chemical]] processes in living [[organism]]s, including living matter. [[Biochemistry]] governs all living organisms and living processes.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Applications of biochemistry==
* Testing
** [[Ames test]] &amp;ndash; salmonella bacteria is exposed to a chemical under question (a food additive, for example), and changes in the way the bacteria grows are measured. This test is useful for screening chemicals to see if they mutate the structure of DNA and by extension identifying their potential to cause cancer in humans.
** [[Pregnancy test]] &amp;ndash; one uses a urine sample and the other a blood sample. Both detect the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).This hormone is produced by the placenta shortly after implantation of the embryo into the uterine walls and accumulates.
** [[Breast cancer screening]] &amp;ndash; identification of risk by testing for mutations in two genes&amp;mdash;Breast Cancer-1 gene (BRCA1) and the Breast Cancer-2 gene (BRCA2)&amp;mdash;allow a woman to schedule increased screening tests at a more frequent rate than the general population.
** [[Prenatal genetic testing]] &amp;ndash; testing the fetus for potential genetic defects, to detect chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome or birth defects such as spina bifida.
** [[Phenylketonuria#Screening and presentation|PKU test]] &amp;ndash; Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder in which the individual is missing an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. Absence of this enzyme allows the buildup of phenylalanine, which can lead to mental retardation.
* [[Genetic engineering]] &amp;ndash; taking a gene from one organism and placing it into another. Biochemists inserted the gene for human insulin into bacteria.  The bacteria, travels through the process of translation, create human insulin.
* [[Cloning]] &amp;ndash; Dolly the sheep was the first mammal ever cloned from adult animal cells. The cloned sheep was, of course, genetically identical to the original adult sheep.  This clone was created by taking cells from the udder of a 6-year-old ewe and growing them in the lab.
* [[Gene therapy]] &amp;ndash; a modified or healthy gene is inserted into the organism to replace a disease-causing gene. Commonly a virus that has been altered to carry human DNA is used to deliver the healthy gene to the targeted cells of the patient. This process was first used successfully in 1990 on a 4-year-old patient who lacked an immune system due to a rare genetic disease called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).

{{Science|all}}
The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as a topical overview of science:

'''[[Science]]''' – the systematic effort of acquiring knowledge—through observation and experimentation coupled with logic and reasoning to find out what can be proved or not proved—and the knowledge thus acquired. The word "science" comes from the Latin word "scientia" meaning [[knowledge]]. A practitioner of science is called a "[[scientist]]". Modern science respects [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[logical reasoning]], and follows a set of core procedures or rules in order to determine the nature and underlying natural laws of the universe and everything in it. Some scientists do not know of the rules themselves, but follow them through research policies. These procedures are known as the [[#Scientific method|scientific method]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Essence of science ==
* [[Research]] – systematic investigation into existing or new knowledge.
* [[Scientific discovery]] – observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences.
* [[Laboratory]] – facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be performed.
* [[Objectivity (science)|Objectivity]] – the idea that scientists, in attempting to uncover truths about the natural world, must aspire to eliminate personal or cognitive biases, a priori commitments, emotional involvement, etc.
* [[Inquiry]] – any process that has the aim of augmenting knowledge, resolving doubt, or solving a problem.

== Scientific method ==

[[Scientific method]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of scientific method|outline]]) – body of techniques for investigating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge, as well as for correcting and integrating previous knowledge. It is based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning, both deductive and inductive.
* [[Empirical method]] –
* Experimental method – The steps involved in order to produce a reliable and logical conclusion include:
*# Asking a question about a natural [[phenomenon]]
*# Making observations of the phenomenon
*# Forming a [[hypothesis]] – proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. 
*# [[Predicting]] a logical consequence of the hypothesis
*# Testing the hypothesis through an experiment – methodical procedure carried out with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. The 3 types of scientific experiments are:
*#* [[Controlled experiment]] – experiment that compares the results obtained from an experimental sample against a control sample, which is practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect the effect of which is being tested (the independent variable).
*#* [[Natural experiment]] – empirical study in which the experimental conditions (i.e., which units receive which treatment) are determined by nature or by other factors out of the control of the experimenters and yet the treatment assignment process is arguably exogenous. Thus, natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment.
*#** [[Observational study]] – draws inferences about the possible effect of a treatment on subjects, where the assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group is outside the control of the investigator.
*#* [[Field experiment]] – applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world (or as many experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the laboratory.  See also [[field research]].
*# Gather and analyze data from experiments or observations, including indicators of [[uncertainty]].
*# Draw [[logical consequence|conclusion]]s by comparing data with predictions.  Possible outcomes:
*#* Conclusive:
*#** The hypothesis is falsified by the data.  
*#** Data are consistent with the hypothesis.
*#** Data are consistent with alternative hypotheses. 
*#* Inconclusive:
*#** Data are not relevant to the hypothesis, or data and predictions are [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurate]].
*#** There is too much uncertainty in the data to draw any conclusion.
* [[Deductive-nomological model]]
* [[Scientific modelling]] –
* Models of scientific method
** [[Hypothetico-deductive model]] – proposed description of scientific method. According to it, scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a hypothesis in a form that could conceivably be falsified by a test on observable data. A test that could and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis. A test that could but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory.

== Branches of science ==
{{See also|Index of branches of science}}

[[Branches of science]] – divisions within science with respect to the entity or system concerned, which typically embodies its own [[terminology]] and [[nomenclature]].

=== Natural science ===
{{See also|Outline of science#Social science}}

[[Natural science]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of natural science|outline]]) – major branch of science, that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena, based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory. Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into two main branches: biology, and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.
* [[Branches of natural science]] (also known as the natural sciences)

=== Formal science ===
[[Formal science]] – branches of knowledge that are concerned with formal systems, such as those under the branches of: logic, mathematics, computer science, statistics, and some aspects of linguistics. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the real world, but instead with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules.

In particular, it was the type of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, [[public works]] at national scale, such as those which harnessed the [[floodplain]] of the [[Yangtse]] with reservoirs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sima Qian]] (司馬遷, d. 86 BCE) in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (太史公書) covering some 2500 years of Chinese history, records [[Sunshu Ao]] (孫叔敖, fl. c. 630–595 BCE – [[Zhou dynasty]]), the first known [[hydraulic engineer]] of China, cited in ([[Joseph Needham]] et.al (1971) ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' '''4.3''' p. 271) as having built a reservoir which has lasted to this day.&lt;/ref&gt; dams, and dikes, and buildings such as the Pyramids. However, no consistent conscious distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems. [[Metallurgy]] was known in prehistory, and the [[Vinča culture]] was the earliest known producer of bronze-like alloys. It is thought that early experimentation with heating and mixing of substances over time developed into [[alchemy]].

A turning point in the history of early philosophical science was [[Socrates]]' example of applying philosophy to the study of human matters, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. The [[Socratic method]] as documented by [[Plato]]'s dialogues is a [[dialectic]] method of hypothesis elimination: better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. This was a reaction to the [[Sophist]] emphasis on [[rhetoric]]. The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.%3Apage%3D17 |title=Plato, Apology| page= 17 |accessdate=2017-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129145253/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.%3Apage%3D17 |archivedate=January 29, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism.

[[Aristotle]] later created a systematic programme of [[teleological]] philosophy: Motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. In his physics, the Sun goes around the Earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a [[formal cause]], a [[final cause]], and a role in a cosmic order with an [[unmoved mover]]. The Socratics also insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]]). Aristotle maintained that man knows a thing scientifically "when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aristotle|title=Nicomachean Ethics|edition=H.

Because of the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] due to the [[Migration Period]] an intellectual decline took place in the western part of Europe in the 400s. In contrast, the [[Byzantine Empire]] resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and preserved and improved upon the learning. [[John Philoponus]], a Byzantine scholar in the 500s, was the first scholar ever to question Aristotle's teaching of physics and to note its flaws. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as to Galileo Galilei who ten centuries later, during the [[Scientific Revolution]], extensively cited Philoponus in his works while making the case as to why Aristotelian physics was flawed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David.

During [[late antiquity]] and the [[early Middle Ages]], the Aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used. Aristotle's [[four causes]] prescribed that four "why" questions should be answered in order to explain things scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' II, 3, and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' V, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Western Roman Empire and periodic political struggles. However, the general fields of science (or "[[natural philosophy]]" as it was called) and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like [[Isidore of Seville]].&lt;ref name=Grant1996&gt;{{cite book | title=The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional and Intellectual Contexts | series=Cambridge Studies in the History of Science | first1=Edward | last1=Grant | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1996 | isbn=0521567629 | pages=7–17 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyvmEyX6rZgC }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle's original texts were eventually lost in Western Europe, and only one text by Plato was widely known, the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', which was the only Platonic dialogue, and one of the few original works of classical natural philosophy, available to Latin readers in the early Middle Ages.

In [[Classical antiquity]], Greek and Roman taboos had meant that dissection was usually banned in ancient times, but in Middle Ages it changed: medical teachers and students at Bologna began to open human bodies, and [[Mondino de Luzzi]] (c. 1275–1326) produced the ﬁrst known anatomy textbook based on human dissection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674057418|last=Numbers|first=Ronald|title= Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths about Science and Religion|page=45|publisher= Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn= 978-0-674-03327-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/04/debunking-a-myth/|title=Debunking a myth|date=7 April 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the eleventh century most of Europe had become Christian; stronger monarchies emerged; borders were restored; technological developments and agricultural innovations were made which increased the food supply and population. In addition, classical Greek texts started to be translated from Arabic and Greek into Latin, giving a higher level of scientific discussion in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, D. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''  Chicago. University of Chicago Press. p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1088, the first university in Europe (the [[University of Bologna]]) had emerged from its clerical beginnings. Demand for Latin translations grew (for example, from the [[Toledo School of Translators]]); western Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. Manuscript copies of Alhazen's ''[[Book of Optics]]'' also propagated across Europe before 1240,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Intro. p. xx}} as evidenced by its incorporation into Vitello's ''[[Perspectiva]]''.

The influx of ancient texts caused the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]] and the flourishing of a synthesis of [[Catholicism]] and [[Aristotelianism]] known as [[Scholasticism]] in [[western Europe]], which became a new geographic center of science. An ''experiment'' in this period would be understood as a careful process of observing, describing, and classifying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Albertus-Magnus |title=St. Albertus Magnus &amp;#124; German theologian, scientist, and philosopher |accessdate=2017-10-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028045424/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Albertus-Magnus |archivedate=October 28, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent scientist in this era was [[Roger Bacon]]. Scholasticism had a strong focus on revelation and [[dialectic|dialectic reasoning]], and gradually fell out of favour over the next centuries, as [[alchemy]]'s focus on experiments that include direct observation and meticulous documentation slowly increased in importance.

=== Renaissance and early modern science ===
{{Main|Scientific Revolution}}

[[Tycho's observational astronomy|Brahe's observations]] were the basis for [[Kepler's laws]].]]
Alhazen disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001}}{{rp|Book I, [6.54]. p. 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not make any corresponding changes to Aristotle's metaphysics. The scientific revolution ran concurrently to a process where elements of Aristotle's metaphysics such as ethics, teleology and formal causality slowly fell out of favour. Scholars slowly came to realize that the universe itself might well be devoid of both purpose and ethical imperatives. The development from a physics infused with goals, ethics, and spirit, toward a physics where these elements do not play an integral role, took centuries. This development was enhanced by the [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnations of 1277]], where Aristotle's books were banned by the [[Catholic church]]. This allowed the theoretical possibility of vacuum and motion in a vacuum. A direct result was the emergence of the science of [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]].

New developments in optics played a role in the inception of the [[Renaissance]], both by challenging long-held metaphysical ideas on perception, as well as by contributing to the improvement and development of technology such as the [[camera obscura]] and the [[telescope]]. Before what we now know as the Renaissance started, [[Roger Bacon]], [[Vitello]], and [[John Peckham]] each built up a scholastic ontology upon a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal [[theory of forms|forms]] of Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3657358|title = Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception: A Critical Edition, with English Translation and Commentary, of the First Three Books of Alhacen's "De aspectibus", the Medieval Latin Version of Ibn al-Haytham's "Kitāb al-Manāẓir": Volume One|journal = Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|volume = 91|issue = 4|pages = i–337|last1 = Smith|first1 = A.

In the sixteenth century, [[Copernicus]] formulated a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the solar system unlike the [[geocentric model]] of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''. This was based on a theorem that the [[orbital period]]s of the planets are longer as their orbs are farther from the centre of motion, which he found not to agree with Ptolemy's model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/002182860203300301|title = Copernicus and the Origin of his Heliocentric System|journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume = 33|issue = 3|pages = 219–35|year = 2016|last1 = Goldstein|first1 = Bernard R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and others challenged the notion that the only function of the eye is perception, and shifted the main focus in optics from the eye to the propagation of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1086/352843|title = Getting the Big Picture in Perspectivist Optics|journal = Isis|volume = 72|issue = 4|pages = 568–89|year = 1981|last1 = Smith|first1 = A.

Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the Sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the Sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the Sun were impossible, because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image&amp;nbsp;– this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p. 61, notes that Kepler's experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye, because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye.}} Kepler is best known, however, for improving Copernicus' heliocentric model through the discovery of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]. Kepler did not reject Aristotelian metaphysics, and described his work as a search for the [[Musica universalis|Harmony of the Spheres]].

[[Galileo]] made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However, he became persecuted after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems", which greatly offended Urban VIII.&lt;ref name="Pope Urban VIII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html|title=Pope Urban VIII|last=van Helden|first=Al|date=1995|website=The Galileo Project|publisher=|access-date=November 3, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111033150/http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html|archivedate=November 11, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Europe, the new technology of the [[printing press]] was widely used to publish many arguments, including some that disagreed widely with contemporary ideas of nature. [[René Descartes]] and [[Francis Bacon]] published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes emphasized individual thought and argued that mathematics rather than geometry should be used in order to study nature. Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon further questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of "simple" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or "[[formal cause]]", of each complex type of thing. This new science began to see itself as describing "[[Physical law|laws of nature]]". This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as [[mechanistic]]. Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.

=== Age of Enlightenment ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|[[Isaac Newton]], shown here in a 1689 portrait, made seminal contributions to [[classical mechanics]], [[gravity]], and [[optics]]. Newton shares credit with [[Gottfried Leibniz]] for the development of calculus.]]
As a precursor to the [[Age of Enlightenment]], [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as [[classical mechanics]], which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from [[Aristotelian physics]], but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example, "[[energy]]" and "[[potential]]" (modern versions of Aristotelian "[[actuality and potentiality|''energeia'' and ''potentia'']]"). This implied a shift in the view of objects: Where Aristotle had noted that objects have certain innate goals that can be actualized, objects were now regarded as devoid of innate goals. In the style of Francis Bacon, Leibniz assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing. It is during this period that the word "science" gradually became more commonly used to refer to a ''type of pursuit'' of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature&amp;nbsp;– coming close in meaning to the old term "[[natural philosophy]]."

During this time, the declared purpose and value of science became producing wealth and [[invention]]s that would improve human lives, in the [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] sense of having more food, clothing, and other things.  In [[Novum Organum|Bacon's words]], "the real and legitimate goal of sciences is the endowment of human life with new inventions and riches", and he discouraged scientists from pursuing intangible philosophical or spiritual ideas, which he believed contributed little to human happiness beyond "the fume of subtle, sublime, or pleasing speculation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgmbZIybuRoC&amp;pg=PA162|title=The Social and Economic Roots of the Scientific Revolution: Texts by Boris Hessen and Henryk Grossmann|last=Freudenthal|first=Gideon|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Peter|date=2009-05-20|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402096044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and [[Academy|academies]], which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the [[popular culture|popularization]] of science among an increasingly literate population. [[Philosophe]]s introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' and the popularization of [[Newtonianism]] by [[Voltaire]] as well as by Émilie du Châtelet, the French translator of Newton's ''Principia''.

Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the [[history of science]];&lt;ref&gt;see Hall (1954), iii; Mason (1956), 223.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], and [[physics]]; the development of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; a new understanding of [[magnetism]] and [[electricity]]; and the maturation of [[chemistry]] as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.

[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors&amp;nbsp;– Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally&amp;nbsp;– as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of [[nature]] and [[natural law]] to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.&lt;ref&gt;Cassels, Alan. Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century ===
[[File:Charles Darwin seated crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.80|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1854, by then working towards publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]].'']]
The nineteenth century is a particularly important period in the history of science since during this era many distinguishing characteristics of contemporary modern science began to take shape such as: transformation of the life and physical sciences, frequent use of precision instruments, emergence of terms like "biologist", "physicist", "scientist"; slowly moving away from antiquated labels like "natural philosophy" and "natural history", increased professionalization of those studying nature lead to reduction in amateur naturalists, scientists gained cultural authority over many dimensions of society, economic expansion and industrialization of numerous countries, thriving of popular science writings and emergence of science journals.&lt;ref name="Lightman 19th"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lightman|first1=Bernard|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature : From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=367|chapter=13.

Early in the 19th century, [[John Dalton]] suggested the modern [[atomic theory]], based on [[Democritus]]'s original idea of individible particles called ''atoms''.
[[File:Candle-light-animated.gif|thumb|left|upright=0.80|Combustion and chemical reactions were studied by [[Michael Faraday]] and reported in his lectures before the [[Royal Institution]]: ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]'', 1861.]]
Both [[John Herschel]] and [[William Whewell]] systematized methodology: the latter coined the term [[scientist]].&lt;ref name="Whewell scientist"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1962|title=Scientist: The story of a word|url=http://www.informaworld.com/index/739364907.pdf|format=PDF|journal=[[Annals of Science]]|volume=18|issue=2|pages=65–85|doi=10.1080/00033796200202722|ref=harv|author=Ross, Sydney|accessdate=2011-03-08}} To be exact, the person who coined the term ''scientist'' was referred to in Whewell 1834 only as "some ingenious gentleman." Ross added a comment that this "some ingenious gentleman" was Whewell himself, without giving the reason for the identification. Ross 1962, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' he established [[evolution]] as the prevailing explanation of biological complexity. His theory of [[natural selection]] provided a natural explanation of how [[species]] originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later.

The laws of [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of mass]] suggested a highly stable universe where there could be little loss of resources. With the advent of the steam engine and the [[industrial revolution]], there was, however, an increased understanding that all forms of energy as defined by Newton were not equally useful; they did not have the same [[energy quality]]. This realization led to the development of the laws of [[thermodynamics]], in which the cumulative energy quality of the universe is seen as constantly declining: the [[entropy]] of the universe increases over time.

The [[electromagnetic theory]] was also established in the 19th century, and raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the [[atom]] were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of [[X-ray]]s inspired the discovery of [[radioactivity]]. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the [[electron]].

=== 20th century ===
[[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|right|The [[DNA]] [[double helix]] is a [[molecule]] that encodes the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living [[organism]]s and many [[virus]]es.]]
[[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] and the development of [[quantum mechanics]] led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature.

In the first half of the century, the development of [[antibiotics]] and [[artificial fertilizer]] made global human [[population growth]] possible. At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of "[[atomic energy]]" ([[nuclear power]]). In addition, the extensive use of technological innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to revolutions in transportation ([[automobile]]s and [[aircraft]]), the development of [[ICBM]]s, a [[space race]], and a [[nuclear arms race]].

The molecular structure of [[DNA]] was discovered in 1953. The discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] in 1964 led to a rejection of the [[Steady State theory]] of the universe in favour of the [[Big Bang]] theory of [[Georges Lemaître]].

The development of [[spaceflight]] in the second half of the century allowed the first astronomical measurements done on or near other objects in space, including [[Apollo program|manned landings on the Moon]]. [[Space telescope]]s lead to numerous discoveries in astronomy and cosmology.

Widespread use of [[integrated circuit]]s in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with [[communications satellite]]s led to a revolution in [[information technology]] and the rise of the global [[internet]] and [[mobile computing]], including [[smartphone]]s. The need for mass systematization of long, intertwined causal chains and large amounts of data led to the rise of the fields of [[systems theory]] and computer-assisted [[scientific modelling]], which are partly based on the Aristotelian paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/255139|jstor=255139|title=The History and Status of General Systems Theory|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=15|issue=4|pages=407–26|last1=von Bertalanffy|first1=Ludwig|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmful [[environmental issue]]s such as [[ozone depletion]], [[Acidification (disambiguation)|acidification]], [[eutrophication]] and [[climate change]] came to the public's attention in the same period, and caused the onset of [[environmental science]] and [[environmental technology]]. In a 1967 article, [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.]] blamed the ecological crisis on the historical decline of the notion of spirit in nature.&lt;ref&gt;White, L., 1967, ''The historical roots of our ecologic crisis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these branches comprise various specialized yet overlapping scientific [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]] that often possess their own [[nomenclature]] and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/scientific_method_relationships_among_scientific_paradigms/|title=Scientific Method: Relationships Among Scientific Paradigms|last=|first=|date=March 7, 2007|website=|publisher=Seed Magazine|access-date=November 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101001155/http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/scientific_method_relationships_among_scientific_paradigms/|archivedate=November 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both natural and social sciences are [[empirical]] sciences&lt;ref name="Bunge1998"&gt;{{cite book| title = Philosophy of Science: From Problem to Theory | last = Bunge | first = Mario Augusto | year = 1998 | publisher = Transaction Publishers | isbn = 978-0-7658-0413-6 | page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as their knowledge are based on [[Empirical evidence|empirical observations]] and are capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=20}}

There are also closely related disciplines that use science, such as [[engineering]] and [[medicine]].

=== Natural science ===
{{Main|Natural science|Outline of natural science}}

[[Natural science]] is concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]] based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. It can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines. Modern natural science is the successor to the [[natural philosophy]] that began in [[Ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G. Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp. 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social science ===
{{Main|Social science|Outline of social science}}
[[File:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|right|In [[economics]], the [[supply and demand]] model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand.]]
[[Social science]] is concerned with [[society]] and the [[Social relation|relationships]] among [[individuals]] within a society. It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[human geography]], [[jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], and [[sociology]]. Social scientists may adopt various [[philosophical theories]] to study individuals and society. For example, [[Positivism|positivist]] social scientists use methods resembling those of the [[natural science]]s as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter [[Modern science|modern sense]]. [[Antipositivism|Interpretivist]] social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically [[falsifiable]] theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], using multiple [[Methodology|methodologies]] (for instance, by combining both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research]]). The term "[[social research]]" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.

=== Formal science ===
{{Main|Formal science|Outline of formal science}}
[[File:Shadow Hand Bulb large.jpg|thumb|right|A [[humanoid]] robotic hand (see [[Shadow Hand]] system).]]
[[Formal science]] is involved in the study of [[formal systems]]. It includes [[mathematics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomalin, Marcus |year=2006 |title=Linguistics and the Formal Sciences |doi=10.2277/0521854814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Formal Sciences: Their Scope, Their Foundations, and Their Unity|journal=Synthese|volume=133 |pages=5–11| doi=10.1023/a:1020887832028|year=2002|last1=Löwe|first1=Benedikt}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[systems theory]], [[robotics]], and [[theoretical computer science]]. The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for [[empirical evidence]], to verify their abstract concepts.&lt;ref name="Fetzer2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bill2007"&gt;{{Citation |first=Thompson | last = Bill |title=The Nature of Statistical Evidence |chapter=2.4 Formal Science and Applied Mathematics |publisher=Springer |series=Lecture Notes in Statistics |volume=189 |edition=1st |year=2007 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10–11}} The formal sciences are therefore [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.&lt;ref name="Bishop1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge 1998"/&gt; Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences. [[Calculus]], for example, was initially invented to understand [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in physics.&lt;ref name="MujumdarandTejinder2016"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Mujumdar | first1 = Anshu Gupta | last2 = Singh | first2 = Tejinder | year = 2016 | chapter = Cognitive science and the connection between physics and mathematics | title = Trick or Truth?: The Mysterious Connection Between Physics and Mathematics | editor1 = Anthony Aguirre | editor2 = Brendan Foster | edition = 1st | series = The Frontiers Collection | pages = 201–218 | location = Switzerland | publisher = SpringerNature | isbn = 978-3-319-27494-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include [[mathematical physics]], [[mathematical chemistry]], [[mathematical biology]], [[mathematical finance]], and [[mathematical economics]].

== Scientific research ==
{{See also|Research}}
Scientific research can be labeled as either basic or applied research. Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Although some scientific research is [[applied research]] into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of [[basic research]]. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question "what is the ''use'' of basic research?" he responded: "Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119113522/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91|archivedate=January 19, 2012 |title=To Live at All Is Miracle Enough|author= Richard Dawkins |publisher=RichardDawkins.net |date=May 10, 2006 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's [[rod cell]]s did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our [[night vision]] is not troubled by red light would lead [[search and rescue]] teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|106–10}} Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to [[Scientific method#Luck and science|harness luck]].

=== Scientific method ===
{{Main|Scientific method}}
[[File:IRAS 10082-5647.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The central star IRAS 10082-5647 was captured by the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]
Scientific research involves using the [[scientific method]], which seeks to [[objectivity (science)|objectively]] explain the events of [[nature]] in a [[reproducible]] way.{{efn|{{harvnb|di Francia|1976|p=13}}: "The amazing point is that for the first time since the discovery of mathematics, a method has been introduced, the results of which have an intersubjective value!" ''(Author's punctuation)''}} An explanatory [[thought experiment]] or [[hypothesis]] is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as "[[Occam's Razor]]") and are generally expected to seek [[consilience]]&amp;nbsp;– fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena.&lt;ref name=EOWilson&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilson | first = Edward | title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge | publisher = Vintage | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-679-76867-8| ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new explanation is used to make [[falsifiable]] predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.{{efn|{{harvnb|di Francia|1976|pp=4–5}}: "One learns in a laboratory; one learns how to make experiments only by experimenting, and one learns how to work with his hands only by using them. The first and fundamental form of experimentation in physics is to teach young people to work with their hands. Then they should be taken into a laboratory and taught to work with measuring instruments&amp;nbsp;– each student carrying out real experiments in physics. This form of teaching is indispensable and cannot be read in a book."}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Fara|2009|p=204}}: "Whatever their discipline, scientists claimed to share a common scientific method that&amp;nbsp;... distinguished them from non-scientists."}} This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish [[causality|causal relationships]] (to avoid the [[correlation does not imply causation|correlation fallacy]]).

When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.{{sfn|Nola|Irzik|2005|p=208}} If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a [[scientific theory]], a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a [[Scientific modelling|model]], an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena.{{sfn|Nola|Irzik|2005|pp=199–201}}

While performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=van Gelder | first=Tim | year=1999 | url=http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf | format=PDF | title="Heads I win, tails you lose": A Foray Into the Psychology of Philosophy | publisher=University of Melbourne | accessdate=March 28, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409054240/http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Pease | first=Craig | date=September 6, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619154617/http://law-and-science.net/Science4BLJ/Scientific_Method/Deliberate.bias/Text.htm | archivedate = June 19, 2010 | title=Chapter 23.

==== Role of mathematics ====
{{Main|Mathematics|Formal science}}
[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|thumb|right|Calculus, the mathematics of continuous change, underpins many of the sciences.]]

[[Mathematics]] is essential in the formation of [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Theory|theories]], and [[physical law|laws]]{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79–82}} in the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[Social science|social]] sciences. For example, it is used in quantitative [[Scientific modelling|scientific modeling]], which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested. It is also used extensively in observing and collecting [[measurements]]. [[Statistics]], a branch of mathematics, is used to summarize and analyze data, which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results.

[[Computational science]] applies computing power to [[Simulation#Computer simulation|simulate]] real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]], computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php|title=SIAM: Graduate Education for Computational Science and Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|access-date=November 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228083134/https://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php|archivedate=December 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Verifiability ====
[[John Ziman]] points out that [[intersubjective verifiability]] is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Ziman cites {{harvnb|Polanyi|1958}} chapter 12, as referenced in {{harvnb|Ziman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as "perceptual consensibility."&lt;ref name=Ziman1978&gt;{{harvnb|Ziman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.&lt;ref name=Ziman1978 /&gt;{{rp|104}}

=== Philosophy of science ===
{{See also|Philosophy of science}}
[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|English philosopher and physician [[John Locke]] (1632–1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism]]
Scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2003 p. vii" /&gt; Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.

The belief that scientific theories should and do represent [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] reality is known as [[Scientific realism|realism]]. It can be contrasted with [[Anti-realism#Anti-realism in science|anti-realism]], the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as [[electrons]]. One form of anti-realism is [[idealism]], the belief that the mind or [[consciousness]] is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.{{efn|This realization is the topic of [[intersubjective verifiability]], as recounted, for example, by [[Max Born]] (1949, 1965) [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp/naturalphilosoph032159mbp_djvu.txt ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance''], who points out that all knowledge, including natural or social science, is also subjective. p. 162: "Thus it dawned upon me that fundamentally everything is subjective, everything without exception. That was a shock."}} In an idealistic [[world view]], what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.

There are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is [[empiricism]],{{efn|name=Galileo1638|In his investigation of the [[law of falling bodies]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (1638) serves as example for scientific investigation: ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' "A piece of wooden moulding or scantling, about 12 cubits long, half a cubit wide, and three finger-breadths thick, was taken; on its edge was cut a channel a little more than one finger in breadth; having made this groove very straight, smooth, and polished, and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth, and very round bronze ball. Having placed this board in a sloping position, by lifting one end some one or two cubits above the other, we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We ... now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next we tried other distances, comparing the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated many, many, times." Galileo solved the problem of time measurement by weighing a jet of water collected during the descent of the bronze ball, as stated in his ''Two New Sciences''.}} which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;[T]he logical empiricists thought that the great aim of science was to discover and establish ''generalizations''."&amp;nbsp;—{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empiricism generally encompasses [[inductivism]], a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using [[deductive logic]] only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being [[Bayesianism]]{{Sfn|Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=203}} and the [[hypothetico-deductive method]].&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003"&gt;{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|236}}

[[File:Karl Popper2.jpg|left|thumb|The Austrian-British philosopher of science Karl Popper (1902–1994) in 1990. He is best known for his work on [[falsifiability|empirical falsification]].]]
Empiricism has stood in contrast to [[rationalism]], the position originally associated with [[Descartes]], which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" /&gt;{{rp|20}} [[Critical rationalism]] is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" /&gt;{{rp|63–67}} Popper proposed replacing verifiability with [[falsifiability]] as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with [[Falsificationism|falsification]] as the empirical method.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" /&gt;{{rp|68}} Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, [[trial and error]].&lt;ref&gt;Popper called this ''Conjecture and Refutation.'' {{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|pp=117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Objective Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach, [[instrumentalism]], colloquially termed "shut up and multiply,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Shut_up_and_multiply|title=Shut up and multiply|last=|first=|date=September 13, 2015|website=LessWrong Wiki|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019082101/https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Shut_up_and_multiply|archivedate=October 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Rationality of Science | author = Newton-Smith, W.H. | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 1994 | page = 30|isbn = 978-0-7100-0913-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]). Close to instrumentalism is [[constructive empiricism]], according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.

[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a [[logically consistent]] "portrait" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/thomas-kuhn/ |title = Thomas Kuhn |accessdate = 2015-10-26 |last = Bird |first = Alexander |year = 2013 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor1-last=Zalta |editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="KuhnP206"&gt;T.S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 2nd. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1970, p. 206. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, another approach often cited in debates of [[scientific skepticism]] against controversial movements like "[[creation science]]" is [[methodological naturalism]]. Its main point is that a difference between natural and [[supernatural]] explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.{{efn|{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=151}} credits [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1969) "Epistemology Naturalized" ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'' New York: Columbia University Press, as well as [[John Dewey]], with the basic ideas of naturalism&amp;nbsp;– [[Naturalized Epistemology]], but Godfrey-Smith diverges from Quine's position: according to Godfrey-Smith, "A naturalist can think that science can contribute to ''answers'' to philosophical questions, without thinking that philosophical questions can be replaced by science questions.".}} That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief [[Non-overlapping magisteria|outside the scope of science]]. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to [[empirical]] study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for [[observation|observable]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = The Review of Metaphysics|title = Casebeer, William D. Natural Ethical Facts: Evolution, Connectionism, and Moral Cognition|author = Brugger, E. Christian|volume = 58| issue = 2|year = 2004|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of these standards, [[Appeal to authority|arguments from authority]], biased [[observational studies]] and other common [[fallacy|fallacies]] are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.

==== Certainty and science ====
A scientific theory is [[empirical]]{{efn|name=Galileo1638}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structure-scientific-theories/|title=The Structure of Scientific Theories|last=Winther|first=Rasmus Grønfeldt|date=2015|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is always open to [[falsifiability|falsification]] if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly [[Certainty|certain]] as science accepts the concept of [[fallibilism]].{{efn|"No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."&amp;nbsp;—[[Albert Einstein]], noted by Alice Calaprice (ed. 2005) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton University Press and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, {{ISBN|0-691-12074-9}} p. 291. Calaprice denotes this not as an exact quotation, but as a paraphrase of a translation of A. Einstein's "Induction and Deduction". ''Collected Papers of Albert Einstein'' '''7''' Document 28. Volume 7 is ''The Berlin Years: Writings, 1918–1921''. A. Einstein; M. Janssen, R. Schulmann, et al., eds.}} The philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] sharply distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge "consists in the search for truth," but it "is not the search for certainty&amp;nbsp;... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain."{{sfn|Popper|1996}}{{rp|4}}

New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist [[Keith Stanovich]], it may be the media's overuse of words like "breakthrough" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|119–38}} While there are such famous cases as the [[theory of relativity]] that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various [[research]]ers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|123}} Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.{{efn|{{cite book|last=Fleck|first=Ludwik|authorlink=Ludwik Fleck|editor1-first=Thaddeus J. |editor1-last=Trenn|editor2-first=Robert K |editor2-last=Merton|title=Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-25325-1}} Claims that before a specific fact "existed", it had to be created as part of a social agreement within a community. [[Steven Shapin]] (1980) "A view of scientific thought" ''Science'' ccvii (Mar 7, 1980) 1065–66 states "[To Fleck,] facts are invented, not discovered. Moreover, the appearance of scientific facts as discovered things is itself a social construction: a ''made'' thing. "}} For example, [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]], [[evolution|the theory of evolution]], [[relativity theory]], and [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] still bear the name "theory" even though, in practice, they are considered [[fact]]ual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=One side can be wrong | first1=Richard | last1=Dawkins | first2=Jerry | last2=Coyne | date=September 2, 2005 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226232200/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research | archivedate=December 26, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Philosopher [[Barry Stroud]] adds that, although the best definition for "[[knowledge]]" is contested, being [[skeptical]] and entertaining the ''possibility'' that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Therefore, scientists adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html |title=Barry Stroud on Scepticism |publisher=philosophy bites |date=December 16, 2007 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123175047/http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fallibilist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.&amp;nbsp;S. Peirce]] argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or [[hyperbolic doubt]] is fruitless&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1877), "The Fixation of Belief", Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, pp. 1–15, see §IV on [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 pp. 6–7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415043128/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |date=April 15, 2016 }}.

Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a "magic bullet"; it avoids the [[Fallacy of the single cause|single-cause fallacy]]. This means a scientist would not ask merely "What is ''the'' cause of&amp;nbsp;...", but rather "What ''are'' the most significant ''causes'' of&amp;nbsp;...". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. [[psychology]], [[physical cosmology]]).&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Stanovich|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141–47}} [[Research]] often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|141–47}} For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.

==== Fringe science, pseudoscience, and junk science ====
An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].{{efn|"''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–76, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".
* For example, Hewitt et al. ''Conceptual Physical Science'' Addison Wesley; 3 edition (July 18, 2003) {{ISBN|0-321-05173-4}}, Bennett et al. ''The Cosmic Perspective'' 3e Addison Wesley; 3 edition (July 25, 2003) {{ISBN|0-8053-8738-2}}; ''See also'', e.g., Gauch HG Jr. ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (2003).
* A 2006 [[National Science Foundation]] report on Science and engineering indicators quoted [[Michael Shermer]]'s (1997) definition of pseudoscience: '"claims presented so that they appear [to be] scientific even though they lack supporting evidence and plausibility" (p. 33). In contrast, science is "a set of methods designed to describe and interpret observed and inferred phenomena, past or present, and aimed at building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation" (p. 17)'.{{cite book|author=Shermer M.|year=1997|title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time|location=New York|publisher=W.

* "A pretended or spurious science; a collection of related beliefs about the world mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method or as having the status that scientific truths now have," from the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition 1989.}} Physicist [[Richard Feynman]] coined the term "[[cargo cult science]]" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the "kind of utter honesty" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html |title=Cargo Cult Science |last=Feynman |first=Richard |date=1974 |website=Center for Theoretical Neuroscience |publisher=Columbia University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304032544/http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html |archive-date=March 4, 2005 |dead-url=yes |access-date=November 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.

There can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as "bad science," research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term "[[scientific misconduct]]" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.&lt;ref name=COPE1999PDF&gt;{{cite journal |title=Coping with fraud |journal=The COPE Report 1999 |pages=11–18 |url=http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/reports/1999/1999pdf3.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151119/http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/reports/1999/1999pdf3.pdf |quote=It is 10 years, to the month, since Stephen Lock&amp;nbsp;...

=== Scientific literature ===
{{Main|Scientific literature}}
[[File:Science Vol. 1 (1880).jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the first volume of the scientific journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1880.]]
Scientific research is published in an enormous range of [[scientific literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=John Ziman| last=Ziman | first=J.M. | journal=Science | title=The proliferation of scientific literature: a natural process | year=1980 | volume=208 | issue=4442 | pages=369–71 | doi= 10.1126/science.7367863 | pmid=7367863 | ref=harv | bibcode=1980Sci...208..369Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific journal]]s communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, ''[[Journal des Sçavans]]'' followed by the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]]'', began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Krishna | last=Subramanyam |author2=Subramanyam, Bhadriraju | year=1981 | title=Scientific and Technical Information Resources | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=978-0-8247-8297-9 | oclc=232950234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States National Library of Medicine]] currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | title=MEDLINE Fact Sheet | publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] | location=Washington DC | accessdate=October 15, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016122141/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | archivedate=October 16, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a [[scientific paper]]. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.

[[List of science magazines|Science magazines]] such as ''[[New Scientist]]'', ''[[Science &amp; Vie]]'', and ''[[Scientific American]]'' cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. [[Science book]]s engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the [[science fiction]] genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.

Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as [[literature]] or more specifically, [[poetry]], include the ''Creative Writing Science'' resource developed through the [[Royal Literary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Mario | last=Petrucci | url=http://writeideas.org.uk/creativescience/index.htm | title=Creative Writing&amp;nbsp;– Science | accessdate=April 27, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106015539/http://writeideas.org.uk/creativescience/index.htm | archivedate=January 6, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists include [[experiment]]alists who mainly who perform experiments to test hypotheses and [[Scientific theory|theoreticians]] who mainly develop new models to explain existing data and predict new results. Many have a desire to understand why the [[world]] is as we see it and how it came to be. They exhibit a strong curiosity about [[reality]].

Science has historically been a male-dominated field, with some notable exceptions.{{efn|Women in science have included:
* [[Hypatia]] (c. 350–415 CE), of the [[Library of Alexandria]].
* [[Trotula]] of Salerno, a physician c. 1060 CE.
* [[Caroline Herschel]], one of the first professional astronomers of the 18th and 19th centuries.
* [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]], a doctoral student of [[C.S. Peirce]], who published [[Wittgenstein]]'s proposition 5.101 in her dissertation, 40 years before Wittgenstein's publication of [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]].
* [[Henrietta Leavitt]], a professional human computer and astronomer, who first published the significant relationship between the luminosity of [[Cepheid variable]] stars and their distance from Earth. This allowed Hubble to make the discovery of the [[expanding universe]], which led to the [[Big Bang theory]].
* [[Emmy Noether]], who proved the [[conservation of energy]] and other [[constants of motion]] in 1915.
* [[Marie Curie]], who made discoveries relating to radioactivity along with her husband, and for whom [[Curium]] is named.
* [[Rosalind Franklin]], who worked with X-ray diffraction.
* [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], at first not allowed to study science in her preparatory school, persisted, and was the first to observe and precisely analyse the radio pulsars, for which her supervisor was recognized by the 1974 Nobel prize in Physics. (Later awarded a Special Breakthough prize in Physics in 2018, she donated the cash award in order that women, ethnic minority, and refugee students might become physics researchers.)
* In 2018 [[Donna Strickland]] became the third woman (the second being [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer]] in 1962) to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, for her work in chirped pulse amplification of lasers. [[Frances H. Arnold]] became the fifth woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the directed evolution of enzymes.

Her work preceded notable researchers like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. The achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Im/partial Science: Gender Identity in Molecular Biology|last=Spanier|first=Bonnie|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780253209689|location=|pages=|chapter=From Molecules to Brains, Normal Science Supports Sexist Beliefs about Difference|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Parents explain more often to boys than to girls during shared scientific thinking|journal=[[Psychol.

Most scientific societies are [[non-profit organization]]s, and many are [[professional association]]s. Their activities typically include holding regular [[academic conference|conferences]] for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring [[academic journal]]s in their discipline. Some also act as [[professional bodies]], regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership. Scholars in the [[sociology of science]]{{who|date=September 2014}} argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.

The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of distinguished [[academy of sciences]] in a number of countries such as the Italian {{lang|it|[[Accademia dei Lincei]]}} in 1603,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://positivamente.lincei.it/ | title=Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei | language=Italian | accessdate=September 11, 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228005402/http://positivamente.lincei.it/ | archivedate=February 28, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the British [[Royal Society]] in 1660, the French {{lang|fr|[[Académie des Sciences]]}} in 1666,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=G.G. | last=Meynell | url=http://www.haven.u-net.com/6text_7B2.htm#Appendix%202 | title=The French Academy of Sciences, 1666–91: A reassessment of the French Académie royale des sciences under Colbert (1666–83) and Louvois (1683–91) | publisher= | accessdate=October 13, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118174108/http://www.haven.u-net.com/6text_7B2.htm#Appendix%202 | archivedate=January 18, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the American  [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1863, the German [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in 1911, and the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] in 1928. International scientific organizations, such as the [[International Council for Science]], have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations.

=== Science policy ===
{{Main|Science policy|History of science policy|Economics of science}}
[[File:UN-Science-Policy-Business Forum on Environment.jpg|thumb|right|The United Nations ''Global Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment'' in Nairobi, Kenya (2017).]]
Science policy is an area of [[public policy]] concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including [[research funding]], often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with [[public policy]] being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.

[[State (polity)|State]] [[policy]] has influenced the funding of [[public works]] and science for thousands of years, particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as [[History of China|imperial China]] and the [[Roman Empire]]. Prominent historical examples include the [[Great Wall of China]], completed over the course of two millennia through the state support of [[Dynasties in Chinese history|several dynasties]], and the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]], an immense feat of [[hydraulic engineering]] begun by [[Sunshu Ao]] (孫叔敖 7th c. BCE), [[Ximen Bao]] (西門豹 5th c.BCE), and Shi Chi (4th c. BCE). This construction dates from the 6th century BCE  under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui Dynasty]] and is still in use today. In China, such state-supported infrastructure and scientific research projects date at least from the time of the [[Mohists]], who inspired the study of [[logic]] during the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] and the study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the [[Warring States period]].

Public policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]] and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] for the United States government, the forerunner of the [[National Science Foundation]], wrote in July 1945 that "Science is a proper concern of government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|title=Science the Endless Frontier|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|date=July 1945|website=|publisher=National Science Foundation|access-date=November 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107221306/https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|archivedate=November 7, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Funding of science ====
{{Main|Funding of science}}
[[File:CSIRO Main Entomology Building - Central Block.jpg|thumb|right|The [[CSIRO|Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) Main Entomology Building in Australia]]
Scientific research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most [[developed country|developed countries]] is between 1.5% and 3% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;ref name="OECD2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |format=PDF |title=Main Science and Technology Indicators&amp;nbsp;– 2008-1 |publisher=[[OECD]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tamBWVvW?url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |archivedate=October 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[OECD]], around two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by [[universities]] and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in [[social science]] and [[humanities]]. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. [[biotechnology]]) government provides the bulk of the funds for [[Basic science|basic scientific research]]. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the [[National Science Foundation]] in the [[United States]], the [[CONICET|National Scientific and Technical Research Council]] in Argentina, [[CSIRO|Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) in Australia, {{lang|fr|[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]]}} in France, the [[Max Planck Society]] and {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]}} in Germany, and [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] in Spain. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than "[[Blue skies research|blue-sky]]" ideas or technologies (such as [[nuclear fusion]]).

The [[public awareness of science]] relates to the attitudes, behaviors, opinions, and activities that make up the relations between science and the general public. it integrates various themes and activities such as [[science communication]], [[science museum]]s, [[science festival]]s, [[science fair]]s, [[citizen science]], and [[science in popular culture]]. Social scientists have devised various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual knowledge, self-reported knowledge, and structural knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Ladwig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladwig|first1=Peter|title=Perceived familiarity or factual knowledge?

=== Politicization of science ===
{{Main|Politicization of science}}
[[File:Cook et al.

[[Politicization of science]] occurs when [[government]], [[business]], or [[advocacy group]]s use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated, reported, or interpreted. Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science such as [[Populism|populist]] [[anti-intellectualism]], perceived threats to religious beliefs, [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] [[subjectivism]], and fear for business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Jeanne |title=The Politicization of Scientific Issues: Looking through Galileo's Lens or through the Imaginary Looking Glass |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=34–39 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816182350/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/politicization_of_scientific_issues |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politicization of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolsen|first1=Toby|last2=Druckman|first2=James N.|title=Counteracting the Politicization of Science|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2015|issue=65|page=746}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence.&lt;ref name = "Freudenberg 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freudenberg|first1=William F.|title=Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs): Science and the Politics of Doubt|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=78|pages=2–38|doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.2008.00219|doi-broken-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of issues that have involved the politicization of science include the [[global warming controversy]], [[health effects of pesticides]], and [[health effects of tobacco]].&lt;ref name = "Freudenberg 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "van Der Linden2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van der Linden|first1=Sander|last2=Leiserowitz|first2=Anthony|last3=Rosenthal|first3=Seth|last4=Maibach|first4=Edward|title=Inoculating the Public against Misinformation about Climate Change|journal=Global Challenges|volume=1|issue=2|page=1|doi=10.1002/gch2.201600008|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Science|social}}'''Social science''' is a category of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]], concerned with [[society]] and the [[Social relation|relationships]] among [[individuals]] within a society. Social science as a whole has many branches, each of which is considered a social science. The social sciences include, but are not limited to: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[human geography]], [[jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], and [[sociology]]. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original "science of society", established in the 19th century. For a more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences see: [[Outline of social science]].

[[Positivism|Positivist]] social scientists use methods resembling those of the [[natural science]]s as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter [[Modern science|modern sense]]. [[Antipositivism|Interpretivist]] social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically [[falsifiable]] theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], using multiple [[Methodology|methodologies]] (for instance, by combining both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research]]). The term "[[social research]]" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.

==History==
{{Main|History of the social sciences}}
The history of the social sciences begins in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] after 1650,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S3zZ18tt3gkC|title=The Social Science Encyclopedia|last=Kuper|first=Adam|date=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415108294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw a revolution within [[natural philosophy]], changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was "scientific". Social sciences came forth from the [[moral philosophy]] of the time and were influenced by the [[Age of Revolution]]s, such as the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; The ''social sciences'' developed from the [[science]]s ([[experimental science|experimental]] and [[applied science|applied]]), or the systematic knowledge-bases or prescriptive practices, relating to the [[social improvement]] of a [[community|group of interacting entities]].&lt;ref name="SocialColumbian1897"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peck1897"/&gt;

The beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the [[Encyclopédie|grand encyclopedia of Diderot]], with articles from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias. The modern period saw "''social science''" first used as a distinct conceptual field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness; applied to the Newly Proposed System of Voluntary Equality of Wealth |year=1824 |author=[[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]] (1775–1833)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social science was influenced by [[positivism]],&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation was avoided. [[Auguste Comte]] used the term "''science sociale''" to describe the field, taken from the ideas of [[Charles Fourier]]; Comte also referred to the field as ''social physics''.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Comte, the ''social physics'' field was similar to that of [[natural sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this period, there were five paths of development that sprang forth in the social sciences, influenced by Comte on other fields.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; One route that was taken was the rise of [[social research]]. Large [[statistical survey]]s were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe. Another route undertaken was initiated by [[Émile Durkheim]], studying "social facts", and [[Vilfredo Pareto]], opening metatheoretical ideas and individual theories. A third means developed, arising from the methodological dichotomy present, in which [[social phenomena]] were identified with and understood; this was championed by figures such as [[Max Weber]]. The fourth route taken, based in economics, was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a [[hard science]]. The last path was the [[correlation]] of knowledge and [[Value (ethics)|social values]]; the [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] sociology of [[Max Weber]] firmly demanded this distinction. In this route, theory (description) and prescription were non-overlapping formal discussions of a subject.

Around the start of the 20th century, [[Enlightenment philosophy]] was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in [[methodology]]. The [[interdisciplinary]] and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour, social and environmental factors affecting it, made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vessuri | first1 = H. | doi = 10.1177/0011392102050001010 | title = Ethical Challenges for the Social Sciences on the Threshold of the 21st Century | journal = Current Sociology | volume = 50 | pages = 135–150 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social research of [[medicine]], [[sociobiology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[bioeconomics (biophysical)|bioeconomics]] and the [[history of science|history]] and [[sociology of science]]. Increasingly, [[quantitative research]] and [[qualitative methods]] are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. Statistical methods were used confidently.

In the contemporary period, [[Karl Popper]] and [[Talcott Parsons]] influenced the furtherance of the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; Researchers continue to search for a unified consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed "grand theory" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks; for more, see [[consilience]]. The social sciences will for the foreseeable future be composed of different zones in the research of, and sometime distinct in approach toward, the field.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt;

The term "social science" may refer either to the specific ''sciences of society'' established by thinkers such as Comte, Durkheim, Marx, and Weber, or more generally to all disciplines outside of "noble science" and [[arts]]. By the late 19th century, the academic social sciences were constituted of five fields: [[jurisprudence]] and amendment of the [[law]], [[education]], [[health]], [[economy]] and [[trade]], and [[art]].&lt;ref name="SocialColumbian1897" /&gt;

Around the start of the 21st century, the expanding domain of [[economics]] in the social sciences has been described as [[economic imperialism (economics)|economic imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Imperialism"/&gt;

The social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college or university level. Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the [[academic journal]]s in which research is published, and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. Social science fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.

===Anthropology===
{{Main|Anthropology|Outline of anthropology}}

[[Anthropology]] is the holistic "science of man", a science of the totality of human existence. The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the social sciences, [[humanities]], and [[human biology]]. In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The ''natural sciences'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''humanities'' generally study local traditions, through their history, literature, music, and arts, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. The ''social sciences'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences.

The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = I. | title = Anthropology, Sociology, and Other Dubious Disciplines | doi = 10.1086/375868 | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 453–465 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: [[archaeology]], [[Physical Anthropology|physical]] or [[Physical Anthropology|biological anthropology]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word ''anthropos'' (ἄνθρωπος) in [[Ancient Greek]] means "human being" or "person". [[Eric Wolf]] described sociocultural anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences."

The goal of anthropology is to provide a [[Holism|holistic]] account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called "primitive" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of "inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowie |first=Robert |title=Primitive Religion |publisher=Routledge and Sons |year=1924}}; {{cite book |last=Tylor |first=Edward |year=1920 |title=Primitive Culture |location=New York: |publisher=J. P. Putnam's Sons}} Originally published 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropologists use terms such as "less complex" societies or refer to specific modes of [[subsistence]] or [[Modes of production|production]], such as "pastoralist" or "forager" or "horticulturalist" to refer to humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (''ethnos'') remaining of great interest within anthropology.

The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena and Richard Warms. ''Culture Counts''. Wadsworth. 2008. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato. ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication studies===
{{Main|Communication studies|History of communication studies}}
Communication studies deals with processes of human [[communication]], commonly defined as the sharing of [[symbols]] to create [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face [[conversation]] to mass media outlets such as [[television broadcasting]]. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts. Communication is institutionalized under many different names at different universities, including "communication", "communication studies", "speech communication", "rhetorical studies", "communication science", "[[media studies]]", "communication arts", "[[mass communication]]", "[[media ecology]]", and "communication and media science".

Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a social science, the discipline often overlaps with sociology, psychology, anthropology, biology, political science, economics, and public policy, among others. From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece). The field applies to outside disciplines as well, including engineering, architecture, mathematics, and information science.

===Economics===
{{Main|Economics|Outline of economics}}
[[Economics]] is a social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109547?query=Economics&amp;ct= economics – Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The word "economics" is from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἶκος}} ''oikos'', "family, household, estate", and νόμος ''nomos'', "custom, law", and hence means "household management" or "management of the state". An [[economist]] is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a [[academic degree|degree]] in the subject. The classic brief definition of economics, set out by [[Lionel Robbins]] in 1932, is "the science which studies human behavior as a relation between scarce means having alternative uses". Without scarcity and alternative uses, there is no [[economic problem]]. Briefer yet is "the study of how people seek to satisfy needs and wants" and "the study of the financial aspects of human behavior".
{|align=right

|}
Economics has two broad branches: [[microeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is the individual agent, such as a household or firm, and [[macroeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole. Another division of the subject distinguishes [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] economics, which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena, from [[normative economics]], which orders choices and actions by some criterion; such orderings necessarily involve [[Subjectivity|subjective]] value judgments. Since the early part of the 20th century, economics has focused largely on measurable quantities, employing both theoretical models and empirical analysis. Quantitative models, however, can be traced as far back as the [[physiocrats|physiocratic school]]. Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to other social situations such as [[public choice theory|politics]], [[law]], [[Experimental economics|psychology]], [[Economic history|history]], [[religion]], marriage and family life, and other social interactions.
This paradigm crucially assumes (1) that resources are scarce because they are not sufficient to satisfy all wants, and (2) that "economic value" is willingness to pay as revealed for instance by market (arms' length) transactions. Rival [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] schools of thought, such as [[institutional economics]], [[green economics]], [[Marxist economics]], and [[economic sociology]], make other grounding assumptions. For example, Marxist economics assumes that economics primarily deals with the investigation of [[exchange value]], of which human labour is the source.

The expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as [[economic imperialism (economics)|economic imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Imperialism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Becker|Becker, Gary S.]] (1976). ''The Economic Approach to Human Behavior''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iwEOFKSKbMgC&amp;dq=%22The+Economic+Approach+to+Human+Behavior%22+Introduction&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 Links] to arrow-page viewable chapter. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Education|Outline of education}}
[[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|right|A depiction of world's oldest university, the [[University of Bologna]], in Italy]]
Education [[List of education topics|encompasses]] teaching and learning specific skills, and also something less tangible but more profound: the imparting of knowledge, positive judgement and well-developed wisdom. Education has as one of its fundamental aspects the imparting of culture from generation to generation (see [[socialization]]). To educate means 'to draw out', from the [[Latin]] ''educare'', or to facilitate the realization of an individual's potential and talents. It is an application of [[pedagogy]], a body of theoretical and applied research relating to teaching and learning and draws on many disciplines such as [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachersmind.com/education.htm An overview of education]&lt;/ref&gt;

The education of an individual human begins at birth and continues throughout life. (Some believe that education begins even before birth, as evidenced by some parents' playing music or reading to the baby in the womb in the hope it will influence the child's development.) For some, the struggles and triumphs of daily [[personal life|life]] provide far more instruction than does formal schooling (thus [[Mark Twain]]'s admonition to "never let school interfere with your education"). Family members may have a profound educational effect&amp;nbsp;— often more profound than they realize&amp;nbsp;— though family teaching may function very informally.

===Geography===
{{Main|Geography|Outline of geography}}
[[File:Physical world.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Earth]]
Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main sub fields: [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]]. The former focuses largely on the built environment and how space is created, viewed and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy. This may involve [[cultural geography]], [[Transportation geography|transportation]], [[Health geography|health]], [[Military geography|military operations]], and [[Urban geography|cities]]. The latter examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation and life, soil, [[Oceanography|oceans]], water and [[landforms]] are produced and interact.&lt;ref name="What is geography?"/&gt; [[Physical geography]] examines phenomena related to the [[Geodesy|measurement of earth]]. As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged, which is [[environmental geography]]. Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"/&gt; Other [[Geography#Branches|branches of geography]] include [[social geography]], [[regional geography]], and [[geomatics]].

Geographers attempt to understand the Earth in terms of physical and spatial relationships. The first geographers focused on the science of [[mapmaking]] and finding ways to precisely [[Map projection|project]] the surface of the earth. In this sense, geography bridges some gaps between the natural sciences and social sciences. [[Historical geography]] is often taught in a college in a unified Department of Geography.

Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline, closely related to [[Geographic Information Science|GISc]], that seeks to understand humanity and its natural environment. The fields of [[urban planning]], [[regional science]], and [[planetology]] are closely related to geography. Practitioners of geography use many technologies and methods to collect data such as [[Geographic Information Systems|GIS]], [[remote sensing]], [[aerial photography]], [[statistics]], and [[global positioning systems]] (GPS).

===History===
{{Main|History|Outline of history}}

History is the continuous, systematic narrative and research into past human events as interpreted through historiographical paradigms or theories.

History has a base in both the social sciences and the humanities. In the United States the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] includes history in its definition of [[humanities]] (as it does for applied linguistics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About NEH |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |url=http://www.neh.gov/about}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] classifies history as a social science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/researchdoc/summary.html Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States: Continuity and Change]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]]. The [[Social Science History Association]], formed in 1976, brings together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in [[social history]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
{{Main|Law|Outline of law}}
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at a criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]] in London]]
The social science of law, [[jurisprudence]], in common parlance, means a rule that (unlike a rule of [[ethics]]) is capable of enforcement through institutions.&lt;ref name="Crimes Against Humanity"/&gt; However, many laws are based on [[norm (philosophy)|norms]] accepted by a community and thus have an ethical foundation. The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a "system of rules",&lt;ref name="hhc"/&gt; as an "interpretive concept"&lt;ref name="rdl"/&gt; to achieve justice, as an "authority"&lt;ref name="jra"/&gt; to mediate people's interests, and even as "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction".&lt;ref name="jap"/&gt; However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and the humanities. Laws are politics, because politicians create them. Law is philosophy, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of history's stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[labour law]], [[company law]] and many more can have long-lasting effects on the distribution of wealth. The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''lex''.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
{{Main|Linguistics|Outline of linguistics}}
[[File:Ferdinand de Saussure.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], recognized as the father of modern [[linguistics]]]]
Linguistics investigates the cognitive and social aspects of human language. The field is divided into areas that focus on aspects of the linguistic signal, such as [[syntax]] (the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences), [[semantics]] (the study of meaning), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the study of the structure of words), [[phonetics]] (the study of speech sounds) and [[phonology]] (the study of the abstract sound system of a particular language); however, work in areas like [[evolutionary linguistics]] (the study of the origins and evolution of language) and [[psycholinguistics]] (the study of psychological factors in human language) cut across these divisions.

The overwhelming majority of modern research in linguistics takes a predominantly [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] perspective (focusing on language at a particular point in time), and a great deal of it—partly owing to the influence of [[Noam Chomsky]]—aims at formulating theories of the cognitive processing of language. However, language does not exist in a vacuum, or only in the brain, and approaches like contact linguistics, [[Creole language|creole]] studies, [[discourse analysis]], social interactional linguistics, and [[sociolinguistics]] explore language in its social context. Sociolinguistics often makes use of traditional quantitative analysis and [[statistics]] in investigating the frequency of features, while some disciplines, like contact linguistics, focus on qualitative analysis. While certain areas of linguistics can thus be understood as clearly falling within the social sciences, other areas, like [[acoustic phonetics]] and [[neurolinguistics]], draw on the natural sciences. Linguistics draws only secondarily on the humanities, which played a rather greater role in linguistic inquiry in the 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Ferdinand Saussure]] is considered the father of modern linguistics.

===Political science===
{{Main|Political science|Outline of political science|Politics}}

[[Political science]] is an academic and research discipline that deals with the theory and practice of politics and the description and analysis of [[political system]]s and political behaviour. Fields and subfields of political science include [[political economy]], [[political philosophy|political theory and philosophy]], [[civics]] and [[comparative politics]], theory of [[direct democracy]], apolitical governance, participatory direct democracy, national systems, cross-national political analysis, political development, [[international relations]], [[foreign policy]], [[international law]], politics, [[public administration]], administrative behaviour, public law, judicial behaviour, and [[Policy|public policy]]. Political science also studies [[power in international relations]] and the theory of [[great powers]] and [[superpower]]s.

Political science is methodologically diverse, although recent years have witnessed an upsurge in the use of the scientific method,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn = 978-1403934222|title = Rational Choice|last1 = Hindmoor|first1 = Andrew|date = 2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2014}} that is, the proliferation of formal-deductive model building and quantitative hypothesis testing. Approaches to the discipline include [[rational choice]], classical political philosophy, [[Interpretivism (social science)|interpretivism]], [[structuralism]], and [[behavioralism|behaviouralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], pluralism, and [[Institutionalism in political parties|institutionalism]]. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents, interviews, and official records, as well as secondary sources such as [[scholarly article]]s are used in building and testing theories. Empirical methods include [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]] [[econometrics|or econometrics]], [[case studies]], experiments, and model building. [[Herbert Baxter Adams]] is credited with coining the phrase "political science" while teaching history at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

===Psychology===
{{Main|Psychology|Outline of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt]] was the founder of [[experimental psychology]].]]
[[Psychology]] is an academic and applied field involving the study of behaviour and mental processes. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental illness]]. The word ''psychology'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ψυχή ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' ("soul", "mind") and ''[[-logy|logy]]'' ("study").

Psychology differs from [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]] in seeking to capture explanatory generalizations about the [[mental function]] and overt behaviour of individuals, while the other disciplines focus on creating descriptive generalizations about the functioning of social groups or situation-specific human behaviour. In practice, however, there is quite a lot of cross-fertilization that takes place among the various fields. Psychology differs from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behaviour, and of the overall processes of a system, and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves, though the subfield of [[neuropsychology]] combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they have subjectively produced.
Many people associate psychology with clinical psychology, which focuses on assessment and treatment of problems in living and psychopathology. In reality, psychology has myriad specialties including social psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, [[educational psychology]], industrial-organizational psychology, [[mathematical psychology]], neuropsychology, and quantitative analysis of behaviour.

Psychology is a very broad science that is rarely tackled as a whole, major block. Although some subfields encompass a natural science base and a social science application, others can be clearly distinguished as having little to do with the social sciences or having a lot to do with the social sciences. For example, biological psychology is considered a natural science with a social scientific application (as is clinical [[medicine]]), social and occupational psychology are, generally speaking, purely social sciences, whereas neuropsychology is a natural science that lacks application out of the scientific tradition entirely. In British universities, emphasis on what tenet of psychology a student has studied and/or concentrated is communicated through the degree conferred: B.Psy. indicates a balance between natural and social sciences, B.Sc. indicates a strong (or entire) scientific concentration, whereas a B.A. underlines a majority of social science credits. This is not always necessarily the case however, and in many UK institutions students studying the B.Psy, B.Sc, and B.A. follow the same curriculum as outlined by The British Psychological Society and have the same options of specialism open to them regardless of whether they choose a balance, a heavy science basis, or heavy social science basis to their degree. If they applied to read the B.A. for example, but specialized in heavily science-based modules, then they will still generally be awarded the B.A.

===Sociology===
{{Main|Sociology|Outline of sociology}}
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|[[Émile Durkheim]] is considered one of the founding fathers of sociology.]]
[[Sociology]] is the systematic study of society, individuals' relationship to their societies, the consequences of difference, and other aspects of human [[social action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 218|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259702723|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the word comes from the suffix "-logy", which means "study of", derived from [[Ancient Greek]], and the stem "soci-", which is from the [[Latin]] word ''socius'', meaning "companion", or society in general.

[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) coined the term, Sociology, as a way to apply natural science principles and techniques to the social world in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259702723|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the descriptive understanding of the social realm. He proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological [[positivism]], an epistemological approach outlined in ''The Course in Positive Philosophy'' [1830–1842] and ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (1844). Though Comte is generally regarded as the "Father of Sociology", the discipline was formally established by another French thinker, [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical [[social research]]. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]''. In 1896, he established the journal ''[[Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] rejected Comte's positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a ''science of society'' based on [[historical materialism]], becoming recognized as a founding figure of sociology posthumously as the term gained broader meaning. Around the start of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], developed sociological [[antipositivism]]. The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social thought in particular: Durkheimian [[positivism]] and [[structural functionalism]]; Marxist [[historical materialism]] and [[conflict theory]]; and Weberian [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] analysis. American sociology broadly arose on a separate trajectory, with little Marxist influence, an emphasis on rigorous experimental methodology, and a closer association with [[pragmatism]] and [[social psychology]]. In the 1920s, the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] developed [[symbolic interactionism]]. Meanwhile, in the 1930s, the [[Frankfurt School]] pioneered the idea of [[critical theory]], an interdisciplinary form of [[Marxist sociology]] drawing upon thinkers as diverse as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after World War II, influencing [[literary criticism]] and the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School]] establishment of [[cultural studies]].

Sociology evolved as an academic response to the challenges of [[modernity]], such as [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], [[secularization]], and a perceived process of enveloping [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]: Modernity's Consciousness of Time'', Polity Press (1990), paperback, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}&amp;nbsp;[[Special:BookSources/0-7456-0830-2|0-7456-0830-2]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The field generally concerns the [[social rule]]s and processes that bind and separate people not only as [[individual]]s, but as members of [[Voluntary association|associations]], [[Group (sociology)|groups]], [[Community|communities]] and [[social institution|institutions]], and includes the examination of the organization and development of human social life. The sociological field of interest ranges from the analysis of short [[Social relation|contacts]] between anonymous individuals on the street to the study of [[globalization|global social processes]]. In the terms of [[Sociology|sociologists]] [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], social scientists seek an understanding of the ''[[Social Construction of Reality]]''. Most sociologists work in one or more [[Subfields of sociology|subfields]]. One useful way to describe the discipline is as a cluster of sub-fields that examine different dimensions of society. For example, [[social stratification]] studies inequality and class structure; [[demography]] studies changes in a population size or type; [[criminology]] examines criminal behaviour and deviance; and [[political sociology]] studies the interaction between society and state.

Since its inception, sociological epistemologies, methods, and frames of enquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged.&lt;ref name="Giddens Intro"/&gt; Sociologists use a diversity of research methods, collect both quantitative and qualitative data, draw upon empirical techniques, and engage [[critical theory]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Common modern methods include [[case studies]], [[historiography|historical research]], [[interviewing]], [[participant observation]], [[social network analysis]], [[statistical survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]], and model building, among other approaches. Since the late 1970s, many sociologists have tried to make the discipline useful for purposes beyond the academy. The results of sociological research aid educators, lawmakers, administrators, developers, and others interested in resolving social problems and formulating public policy, through subdisciplinary areas such as [[evaluation research]], methodological assessment, and [[public sociology]].

In the early 1970s, women sociologists began to question sociological paradigms and the invisibility of women in sociological studies, analysis, and courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradoxes of Gender|last=Lorber|first=Judith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780300064971|location=New Haven, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, feminist sociologists challenged the discipline's [[androcentrism]] at the American Sociological Association's annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socwomen.org/sws-activism/|title=The Founding of SWS|last=Laube|first=Heather|last2=Hess|first2=Bess B.|date=2001|website=Sociologists for Women in Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the founding of the organization Sociologists for Women in Society, and, eventually, a new sociology journal, [[Gender &amp; Society]]. Today, the [[sociology of gender]] is considered to be one of the most prominent sub-fields in the discipline.

New sociological sub-fields continue to appear&amp;nbsp;— such as [[community studies]], [[computational sociology]], [[environmental sociology]], [[Social network analysis|network analysis]], [[actor-network theory]], gender studies, and a growing list, many of which are [[List of academic disciplines|cross-disciplinary]] in nature.

==Additional fields of study==

==Methodology==

===Social research===
{{Main|Social research}}
The origin of the [[Statistical survey|survey]] can be traced back at least early as the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Halsey (2004), ''A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell (1970), ''A new dictionary of sociology'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; while some scholars pinpoint the origin of [[demography]] to 1663 with the publication of [[John Graunt]]'s ''Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality''.&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Walter (1938) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400906 ''The Founder of Statistics''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Social research began most intentionally, however, with the [[positivist]] [[philosophy of science]] in the 19th century.

In contemporary usage, "social research" is a relatively autonomous term, encompassing the work of practitioners from various disciplines that share in its aims and methods. Social scientists employ a range of methods in order to analyse a vast breadth of social phenomena; from [[census]] survey data derived from millions of individuals, to the in-depth analysis of a single agent's social experiences; from monitoring what is happening on contemporary streets, to the investigation of ancient historical documents. The methods originally rooted in classical sociology and statistical mathematics have formed the basis for research in other disciplines, such as [[political science]], [[media studies]], and [[marketing]] and [[market research]].

Social research methods may be divided into two broad schools:
* [[Quantitative method|Quantitative designs]] approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims.
* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative designs]] emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality.

Social scientists will commonly combine quantitative and qualitative approaches as part of a multi-strategy design. Questionnaires, field-based data collection, archival database information and laboratory-based data collections are some of the measurement techniques used. It is noted the importance of measurement and analysis, focusing on the (difficult to achieve) goal of objective research or [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. A [[mathematical model]] uses mathematical language to describe a system. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed 'mathematical modelling' (also modeling). Eykhoff (1974) defined a ''mathematical model'' as 'a representation of the essential aspects of an existing [[system]] (or a system to be constructed) that presents knowledge of that system in usable form'.&lt;ref&gt;Eykhoff, Pieter ''System Identification: Parameter and State Estimation'', Wiley &amp; Sons, (1974). {{ISBN|0-471-24980-7}}&amp;nbsp;[[Special:BookSources/0-471-24980-7|0-471-24980-7]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].

These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. The [[system]] is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. The concept of an ''integrated whole'' can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships that are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime. A [[dynamical system]] modeled as a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[formal system|formalization]] has a fixed "rule" that describes the time dependence of a point's position in its [[ambient space]]. Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers. The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a [[function (mathematics)|fixed rule]] that describes what future states follow from the current state. The rule is [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]]: for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.

Social sciences are criticized for neglecting the moral element of human behavior. Economists tend to focus on self-interest. Clinical psychologists—on the effects of early socialization. Anthropologists tend to assume moral relativism. Sociologists often blame the System for immoral behavior. Socio-biologists tend to assume limited choice behavior. All this, critics hold, contrasts with the fact that life is a constant wrestle between people's moral commitments and urges that pull them to violate these commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Amitai Etzioni. 2017. "The Moral Wrestler: Ignored by Maslow." Society, Volume 54, Issue 6, pp 512–519&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===
{{Main|Social theory}}
Other social scientists emphasize the subjective nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:
* [[Critical theory]] is the examination and critique of society and culture, drawing from knowledge across social sciences and humanities disciplines.
* [[Dialectical materialism]] is the philosophy of Karl Marx, which he formulated by taking the dialectic of Hegel and joining it to the materialism of Feuerbach.
* [[Feminist theory]] is the extension of feminism into theoretical, or philosophical discourse; it aims to understand the nature of gender inequality.
* [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theories]], such as [[Proletarian revolution|revolutionary theory]] and [[Class conflict|class theory]], cover work in philosophy that is strongly influenced by Karl Marx's materialist approach to theory or is written by Marxists.
* [[Phronetic social science]] is a theory and methodology for doing social science focusing on ethics and political power, based on a contemporary interpretation of Aristotelian phronesis.
* [[Post-colonialism|Post-colonial theory]] is a reaction to the cultural legacy of colonialism.
* [[Postmodernism]] refers to a point of departure for works of literature, drama, architecture, cinema, and design, as well as in marketing and business and in the interpretation of history, law, culture and religion in the late 20th century.
* [[Rational choice theory]] is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behaviour.
* [[Social constructionism]] considers how social phenomena develop in social contexts.
* [[Structuralism]] is an approach to the human sciences that attempts to analyze a specific field (for instance, mythology) as a complex system of interrelated parts.
* [[Structural functionalism]] is a sociological paradigm that addresses what social functions various elements of the social system perform in regard to the entire system.

Other fringe social scientists delve in alternative nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:
* [[Anti-intellectualism|Intellectual critical-ism]] describes a sentiment of critique towards, or evaluation of, intellectuals and intellectual pursuits.
* [[Antiscience|Scientific criticalism]] is a position critical of science and the scientific method.

== Education and degrees ==
Most universities offer degrees in social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson's (Firm&amp;nbsp;: 2006– ). (2007). Peterson's graduate programs in the humanities, arts, &amp; social sciences, 2007. Lawrenceville, New Jersey: Peterson's.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bachelor of Social Science]] is a degree targeted at the social sciences in particular. It is often more flexible and in-depth than other degrees that include social science subjects.{{efn|A [[Bachelor of Social Science]] degree can be earned at the [[University of Adelaide]], [[University of Waikato]] ([[Hamilton, New Zealand]]), [[University of Sydney]], [[University of New South Wales]], [[University of Hong Kong]], [[University of Manchester]], [[Lincoln University, New Zealand]], [[National University of Malaysia]] and [[University of Queensland]].}}

In the United States, a university may offer a student who studies a social sciences field a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, particularly if the field is within one of the traditional [[liberal arts]] such as history, or a BSc: Bachelor of Science degree such as those given by the London School of Economics, as the social sciences constitute one of the two main branches of [[science]] (the other being the [[natural sciences]]). In addition, some institutions have degrees for a particular social science, such as the [[Bachelor of Economics]] degree, though such specialized degrees are relatively rare in the United States.
