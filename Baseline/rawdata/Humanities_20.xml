{{Anthropology}}

'''Anthropology''' is the study of [[human]]s and [[human behavior]] and [[society|societies]] in the past and present.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web | title=anthropology | url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology |work=Oxford Dictionaries | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology | title=anthropology | work=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite web | title=What is Anthropology? | url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm | publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]] | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; study the norms and values of societies. [[Linguistic anthropology]] studies how language affects social life. [[Biological anthropology|Biological or physical anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; studies the biological development of humans.

[[Archaeology]], which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States and Canada, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.

==Origin and development of the term==
[[File:Sahagun.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Bernardino de Sahagún]] is considered to be the founder of modern anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43462&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|History of anthropology}}
The abstract noun ''[[wikt:anthropology|anthropology]]'' is first attested in reference to [[history]].&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey]]'s 1593 ''Philadelphus'', a defense of the legend of [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] in [[History of Britain|British history]], includes the passage "Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology."}} Its present use first appeared in [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]] [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] in the works of [[Magnus Hundt]] and [[Otto Casmann]].&lt;ref name="Medicine"&gt;{{cite book|author=Israel Institute of the History of Medicine|title=Koroth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lev_H1Ie0zcC&amp;pg=PA19|publisher=BRILL|page=19|id=GGKEY:34XGYHLZ7XY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[New Latin]] ''{{lang|la|anthropologia}}'' derived from the [[combining form]]s of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''ánthrōpos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἄνθρωπος}}}}, "[[human]]") and ''lógos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|λόγος}}}}, "[[science|study]]").&lt;ref name=oed2&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st&amp;nbsp;ed. "anthropology, ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; (Its adjectival form appeared in the works of [[Aristotle]].)&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt; It began to be used in English, possibly via [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|Anthropologie}}'', by the early 18th century.&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[John Kersey]]'s 1706 edition of ''[[The New World of English Words]]'' includes the definition "''Anthropology'', a Discourse or Description of Man, or of a Man's Body."}}

===Through the 19th century===
In 1647, the Bartholins, founders of the [[University of Copenhagen]], defined ''{{lang|fr|l'anthropologie}}'' as follows:&lt;ref name=frenchy&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bartholin | first1=Caspar | last2=Bartholin | first2=Thomas | author-link1=Caspar Bartholin the Younger | author-link2=Thomas Bartholin | others=Translated from the Latin by Abr. Du Prat | year=1647 | title=Institutions anatomiques de Gaspar Bartholin, augmentées et enrichies pour la seconde fois tant des opinions et observations nouvelles des modernes | location=Paris | publisher=M. Hénault et J. Hénault | chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.{{refn|group=n|In French: ''L'Anthropologie, c'est à dire la science qui traite de l'homme, est divisée ordinairment &amp; avec raison en l'Anatomie, qui considere le corps &amp; les parties, et en la Psychologie, qui parle de l'Ame''.&lt;ref name=frenchy/&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by [[Étienne Serres]] in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)]] by [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau]]. Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The [[Société Ethnologique de Paris]], the first to use [[Ethnology]], was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848 the Société was abandoned.

Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the [[American Ethnological Society]], was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the [[Ethnological Society of London]] in 1843, a break-away group of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]].&lt;ref name=Schiller131&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|pp=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-[[Human rights|human-rights activists.]] They maintained international connections.

Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as [[comparative anatomy|anatomy]], [[Comparative method (linguistics)|linguistics]], and [[Ethnology]], making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in [[agronomy]] and in the wild.

Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. [[Paul Broca]] in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the [[Société de biologie]] to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|Société d'Anthropologie de Paris]], meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859.&lt;ref name=Fletcher&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Fletcher | chapter=Paul Broca and the French School of Anthropology | title=The Saturday Lectures, Delivered in the Lecture-room of the U. S. National Museum under the Auspices of the Anthropological and Biological Societies of Washington in March and April 1882 | year=1882 | location=Boston; Washington, D.C. | publisher=D. Lothrop &amp; Co.; Judd &amp; Detweiler | url={{Google books|9dEJAQAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|As [[Robert Fletcher (anthropologist)|Fletcher]] points out, the French society was by no means the first to include anthropology or parts of it as its topic. Previous organizations used other names. The German Anthropological Association of St. Petersburg, however, in fact met first in 1861, but due to the death of its founder never met again.&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt;}} When he read Darwin, he became an immediate convert to ''Transformisme'', as the French called [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; His definition now became "the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broca, being what today would be called a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called [[Broca's area]] after him. His interest was mainly in [[Biological anthropology]], but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, [[Theodor Waitz]], took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled ''Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker'', 1859–1864. The title was soon translated as "The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples". The last two volumes were published posthumously.

Waitz defined anthropology as "the science of the nature of man". By nature he meant matter animated by "the Divine breath";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., he was an [[Animism|animist]]. Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from "the animals nearest to him". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that "the same laws of thought are applicable to all men".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists. In 1863 the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] and the speech therapist [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] to form the [[Anthropological Society of London]], which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French ''Société'' were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, ''The Anthropological Review'', Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|loc=Introductory Address}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Hunt's choice of theorists does not exclude the numerous other theorists that were beginning to publish a large volume of anthropological studies.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;}} Among the first associates were the young [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], inventor of [[cultural anthropology]], and his brother [[Alfred Tylor]], a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.

Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the [[Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte|Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory]] (1869) founded by [[Rudolph Virchow]], known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation.

During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898 the American Association for the Advancement of Science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  title=Extent of Instruction in Anthropology in Europe and the United States | first=George Grant | last=Maccurdy | journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science | year=1899 | pages=382–390 | url={{Google books|PA385&amp;dq|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===
This meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world's higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical Anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. The organization has reached global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), "a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology", currently contains members from about three dozen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Home | publisher=World Council of Anthropological Associations | accessdate=29 March 2015 | url= http://www.wcaanet.org/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the work of [[Franz Boas]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ''social'' anthropology in Great Britain and [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'' anthropology]] in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]], long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on [[Participant observation|participant-observation]] or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized [[cultural relativism]], [[holism]], and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"&gt;Hylland Eriksen, Thomas. (2004) "What is Anthropology" Pluto. London. p. 79. {{ISBN|0745323200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from [[Boasian anthropology|Boas' arguments]] against 19th-century racial [[ideology]], through [[Margaret Mead]]'s advocacy for [[gender equality]] and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] oppression and promotion of [[multiculturalism]]. [[Ethnography]] is one of its primary [[research design]]s as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiro1987"&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) "Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason," in ''Culture and Human Nature: Theoretical Papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyck1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyck|first1=Thomas William|last2=Stocking|first2=George W.|last3=Goody|first3=Jack|title=After Tylor: British Social Anthropology 1888–1951.|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=102|issue=5|year=1997|pages=1486–1488|issn=0002-8762|doi=10.2307/2171126|jstor=2171126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of [[social anthropology]] tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the [[four field approach]] developed by [[Franz Boas]] in the early 20th century: [[Biological anthropology|''biological'' or ''physical'' anthropology]]; [[social anthropology|''social'']], [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'']], or [[sociocultural anthropology|''sociocultural'' anthropology]]; and [[archaeology]]; plus [[linguistic anthropology|anthropological linguistics]]. These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.

European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam František Kollár|Adam F. Kollár]] in 1783). It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) ''An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from [[natural science]]s, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', human physical traits, [[human behavior]], the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of ''Homo sapiens'' has influenced its social organization and culture, and from [[social science]]s, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm What is Anthropology – American Anthropological Association].

Living Anthropologically. Retrieved on 2017-17-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Early anthropology originated in Classical Greece and Persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin.

According to [[Clifford Geertz]],
{{quotation|"anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|pages=Back Cover|editor1=Daniel A. Segal |editor2=Sylvia J. Yanagisako |isbn=0822386844}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sociocultural anthropology]] has been heavily influenced by [[structuralism|structuralist]] and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an [[epistemological]] shift away from the [[positivist]] traditions that had largely informed the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Behar, Clifford &amp; James&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.

===Sociocultural===
{{main|Cultural anthropology|Social anthropology|Sociocultural anthropology}}
Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]]. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people ''make sense'' of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the ''relationships'' among individuals and groups.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=GENERAL INTRODUCTION | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold| year=1994 | pages=xv |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropology is more related to [[philosophy]], literature and [[the arts]] (how one's culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to [[sociology]] and history.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"/&gt; In that, it helps develop an understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.

Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by [[cultural relativism]], the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Introduction to culture | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold | year=1994 | page=331 |isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison.&lt;ref name="Ingold1996p18"&gt;{{cite book | title=Key Debates In Anthropology | author=[[Tim Ingold]] | year=1996|  page=18|quote=the traditional anthropological project of cross-cultural or cross-societal comparison}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is often accommodated in the field of [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic [[monograph]]. As a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. [[Participant observation]] is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernard |first=H. Russell |year=2002 |url=http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |title=Research Methods in Anthropology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002847/http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2016 |publisher=[[Altamira Press]] |page=322 |isbn=0759108684 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an [[emic]] (conceptual, vs. [[etic]], or technical) point of view.

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Sociocultural anthropology also covers [[Economic anthropology|economic]] and [[Political anthropology|political organization]], law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).

Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West.

===Biological===
{{main|Biological anthropology}}
[[File:Human remains.jpg|thumb|left|Forensic anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains, such as these found lying in scrub in Western Australia, c. 1900–1910.]]

Biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[University of Toronto]] |title=Research Subfields: Physical or Biological |access-date=14 March 2012 |url=http://anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422203737/http://www.anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Archaeological===
{{main|Archaeology}}

[[Archaeology]] is the study of the human past through its material remains. Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists examine this material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remain of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, R. H. &amp; Larkin, S. N. (2007). Cultural Anthropology: A problem based approach. Toronto, ON: Nelson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rosetta Stone.svg|thumb|The Rosetta Stone was an example of ancient communication.]]

===Linguistic===
{{main|Linguistic anthropology}}
[[Linguistic anthropology]] (not to be confused with [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2150|title=What is Anthropology? - Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdeněk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key topics by field: sociocultural ==

===Art, media, music, dance and film===
{{Anthropology of art}}

==== Art ====
{{main|Anthropology of art}}

One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', Claude Lévi-Strauss' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.

==== Media ====
{{main|Media anthropology}}
[[File:Punu mask Gabon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Punu tribe mask, Gabon, Central Africa]]
Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movement]]s, or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]], and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitulnik, Deborah |title=Anthropology and Mass Media|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=22|page=293|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.22.100193.001453|url=http://www.philbu.net/media-anthropology/Spitulnik_MediaAnthro.pdf|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abu-Lughod, Lila |year=1997|title=The Interpretation of Cultures after Television|journal=Representations|volume= 59|pages= 109–133|url=https://direitosehumanos.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/a-interpretac3a7c3a3o-das-culturas-depois-da-televisc3a3o.pdf|jstor=2928817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Music ====
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.

==== Visual ====
{{main|Visual anthropology}}
Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, [[new media]]. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with [[ethnographic film]], visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and [[reception theory|reception]] of [[anthropology of media|mass media]]. Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings, and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.

=== Economic, political economic, applied and development ===
{{Economic anthropology}}

==== Economic ====
{{main|Economic anthropology}}
Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology, [[Bronisław Malinowski]], and his French compatriot, [[Marcel Mauss]], on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=Chris|title=Economic Anthropology|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=55–71|author2=Hart, Keith |isbn=9780745644820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.

====Political economy====
{{main|Political economy in anthropology}}
Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlin's work on hunter-gatherers as the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist [[world-system]].&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==== Applied ====
{{main|Applied anthropology}}
Applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|isbn=0275978419|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to [[development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[anthropology of development]]).

====Development====
{{main|anthropology of development}}
Anthropology of development tends to view development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short, why does so much planned development fail?

===Kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality===
{{Anthropology of kinship}}

==== Kinship ====
{{main|Kinship}}
''Kinship'' can refer both to ''the study of'' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to ''the patterns of social relationships'' themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as "[[kinship|descent]]", "[[descent group]]s", "[[lineage (anthropology)|lineages]]", "[[affinity (law)|affines]]", "[[cognatic kinship|cognates]]", and even "[[fictive kinship]]". Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.

==== Feminist ====
{{main|Feminist anthropology}}
Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]]. Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies. Feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as a specialization. 

The first [[African-American]] female [[anthropologist]] and [[Caribbeanist]] is said to be [[Vera Mae Green]] who studied ethnic and family relations in the [[Caribbean]] as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1525/aa.1982.84.3.02a00080|title = Vera Mae Green, 1928-1982| journal=American Anthropologist| volume=84| issue=3| pages=633–635|date = September 1982|last1 = Cole|first1 = Johnnetta B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal===
{{Medical anthropology}}

==== Medical ====
{{main|Medical anthropology}}

Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies "human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation".&lt;ref name=McElroy1996&gt;{{Cite book |year=1996 |author=McElroy, A |chapter=Medical Anthropology |editor1=D. Levinson |editor2=M. Ember |title=Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ethnomedicine/PDF/Medical%20Anthropologie.pdf |isbn= |ref=harv |access-date=2 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001162708/http://www.univie.ac.at/ethnomedicine/PDF/Medical%20Anthropologie.pdf |archive-date=1 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that William Caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology. Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Dave|date=2016-10-24|title=Anthropology's Contribution to Public Health Policy Development|journal=McGill Journal of Medicine : MJM|volume=13|issue=1|page=76|issn=1201-026X|pmc=3277334|pmid=22363184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
* the patient-physician relationship
* the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments
* the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole
* the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations ("critical ethnopsychiatry": Beneduce 2004, 2007)
* the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''.

==== Nutritional ====
{{main|Nutritional anthropology}}

Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

==== Psychological ====
{{main|Psychological anthropology}}
Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group—with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories—shape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]]. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"&gt;{{cite book | last=D'Andrade | first=R. | chapter=The Sad Story of Anthropology: 1950–1999 | editor-first=E. L. | editor-last=Cerroni-Long | title=Anthropological Theory in North America |isbn=0897896858| location=Westport | publisher=Berin &amp; Garvey | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor = Schwartz, T. |editor2=G. M. White |display-editors=etal | date = 1992 | title = New Directions in Psychological Anthropology | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive ====
{{main|Cognitive anthropology}}
Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"/&gt;

==== Transpersonal ====
{{main|Transpersonal anthropology}}
Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and culture. As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Young | first1=David E. | first2=J.G. | last2=Goulet | date=1994 | title=Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences | publisher=Peterborough: Broadview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and legal===
{{Political anthropology}}

==== Political ====
{{main|Political anthropology}}
Political anthropology concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more "complex" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. Firstly, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Secondly, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on "Negara", the Balinese state, is an early, famous example.

====Legal====
{{main|Legal anthropology}}
Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Greenhouse, Carol J. | title = Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |isbn=0801419719| location = Ithaca | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More recent applications include issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world|year=2006|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|editor1=Hent de Vries |editor2=Lawrence E. Sullivan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

====Public====
{{main|Public anthropology}}
Public anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to "demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicanthropology.org Borofsky 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature, science and technology ===
{{Cyber anthropology}}

====Cyborg====
{{main|Cyborg anthropology}}
Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie (2001). "Cyborg Anthropology". in ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0415920922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Haraway]]'s 1985 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto]]'' could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.

==== Digital ====
{{main|Digital anthropology}}
Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and [[technology]] intersect. It is sometimes grouped with [[cultural anthropology|sociocultural anthropology]], and sometimes considered part of [[material culture]].  The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases. These include techno-anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studyguide.aau.dk/programmes/postgraduate/53203/ | title=Techno-Anthropology course guide | publisher=Aalborg University | accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital ethnography, cyberanthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://xirdalium.net/category/anthropology/cyberanthropology/ | title=Cyberanthropology | publisher=Peter Hammer Verlag Gmbh | date=August 2011 | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Knorr, Alexander | isbn=978-3-7795-0359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virtual anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Virtual Anthropology: A guide to a new interdisciplinary field | publisher=Springer |author1=Weber, Gerhard |author2=Bookstein, Fred | year=2011 | isbn=978-3-211-48647-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecological ====
{{main|Ecological anthropology}}

Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies).

===Historical===
{{main|Ethnohistory}} {{see also|Historical anthropology}}
Ethnohistory is the study of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] cultures and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] customs by examining [[History|historical records]]. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint |  journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi = 10.2307/481465 | jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Anthropology of religion}}
{{main|Anthropology of religion}}
The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between [[magical thinking]] and religion,&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.&amp;nbsp;122–3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|"It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.]&amp;nbsp;... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion."&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"/&gt;}} and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human [[community]] that worships it.&lt;ref name="Guthrie2000p225"&gt;Guthrie (2000) ''Guide to the Study of Religion''.

=== Urban ===
{{main|Urban anthropology}}
Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of [[urbanization]], poverty, and [[neoliberalism]]. [[Ulf Hannerz]] quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were "a notoriously [[agoraphobic]] lot, anti-urban by definition". Various social processes in the [[Western World]] as well as in the "[[Third World]]" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of "[[Anthropology#Focus on the "other cultures"|specialists in 'other cultures']]" closer to their homes.&lt;ref name=Hannerz/&gt; There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1466138110370412 |jstor=24047982|title=Chinese consumers: The Romantic reappraisal|journal=Ethnography|volume=11|issue=3|page=331|year=2010|last1=Griffiths|first1=M.

== Key topics by field: archaeological and biological ==
{{main|Archaeological|Biological anthropology}}

=== Anthrozoology ===
{{main|Anthrozoology}}
[[Anthrozoology]] (also known as "human–animal studies") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, [[ethology]], medicine, [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]].  A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 "Anthrozoology"], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI, pp. 28–30. {{ISBN|0851997244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo (2010).

=== Biocultural ===
{{main|Biocultural anthropology}}
Biocultural anthropology is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and culture. [[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn&gt;{{cite book |last= Goodman |first=Alan H. |author2= Thomas L. Leatherman (eds.) |title=Building A New Biocultural Synthesis |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year= 1998 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T8ZhpG_B_6MC |isbn= 978-0-472-06606-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.

=== Evolutionary ===
{{main|Evolutionary anthropology}}
Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominins]] and non-hominin [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]], combining the [[Human development (biology)|human development]] with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as [[archaeology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], [[primatology]], and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

=== Forensic ===
{{main|Forensic anthropology}}
Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of [[physical anthropology]] and human [[osteology]] in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim's remains are in the advanced stages of [[decomposition]]. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective "forensic" refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.

=== Palaeoanthropology ===
{{main|Palaeoanthropology}}
Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of [[paleontology]] and [[physical anthropology]]. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in [[fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evidence such as [[Petrifaction|petrifacted]] bones and footprints.

== Organizations ==
Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org]. AAAnet.org. Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members are anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100613021448/http://aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.

Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Wong, Kate (2007).

==Ethics==
As the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves, and professional societies have generated codes of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report of the Commission to Review the AAA Statements on Ethics - Participate &amp; Advocate|url=http://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1911&amp;RDtoken=3371&amp;userID=6944|publisher=American Anthropological Association|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = "pbuteh"&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) ''Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter.'' Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended:
* That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derives some of its key notions from it, consciously or not. (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) [http://okhovvat.com/files/en/content/2011/6/4/351_379.pdf ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion'']. London/New York: Routledge. pp. 26–29. {{ISBN|041508024X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That ethnographic work is often [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]], writing about people as if they were "out of time" in an "ethnographic present" (Johannes Fabian, ''Time and Its Other'').

=== Cultural relativism ===
As part of their quest for [[scientific objectivity]], present-day anthropologists typically urge [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt; This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another's values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Strauss, Claude (1962). ''The Savage Mind''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Womack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human.''.{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[mutilation]] (including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]]), and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin. ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 Is there a gene for racism? | Times Higher Education (THE)]. Times Higher Education (2016-10-27). Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of [[Man's inhumanity to man]]. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as "racism" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on "Race"|url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm|publisher=American Anthropological Association|date=May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.282.5389.654 |pmid=9841421 |title=CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY:DNA Studies Challenge the Meaning of Race |journal=Science |volume=282 |issue=5389 |pages=654–5 |year=1998 |last1=Marshall |first1=E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Allan (1995).

Ortiz|url=https://www.academia.edu/199944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military involvement===
Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the [[Axis Powers]] (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David Price (anthropologist)|David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little. Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement.  Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that "in relation with their own government and with host governments&amp;nbsp;... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology]. CSMonitor.com (2007-09-07). Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reports that "Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs" [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]], under the ''[[Human Terrain System]]'' (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the [[US military in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century |url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121225645/http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archivedate=21 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the American Anthropological Association's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of "anthropology" within DoD."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aaanet.org/2009/12/08/aaa-commission-releases-final-report-on-army-human-terrain-system/ "AAA Commission Releases Final Report on Army Human Terrain System"]. American Anthropological Association (2009-12-08)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post–World War II developments==
Before WWII British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

===Basic trends===
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"/&gt; The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.

In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato (1993).  ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. Inda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier, John and Rosaldo, Renato (2007).  ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Jurmain, Robert; Kilgore, Lynn; Trevathan, Wenda and Ciochon, Russell L. (2007).  ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology''. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. chapters I, III and IV. {{ISBN|0495187798}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wompack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–20. {{ISBN|0136440711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald (1991).  ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughley, Neil (2000).  ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists "into the field," which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called "fieldwork."  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

===Commonalities between fields===
Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], history, [[philosophy]], and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy (2003). ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12. {{ISBN|1442601108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George (1992) "Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology", pp. 342–361 in George Stocking, ''The Ethnographer's Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0299134148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray (1979). ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.'' Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of "other cultures", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).&lt;ref&gt;See the many essays relating to this in Prem Poddar and David Johnson, Historical Companion to Postcolonial Thought in English, Edinburgh University Press, 2004. See also Prem Poddar et al., Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures—Continental Europe and its Empires, Edinburgh University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the "[[Third World]]" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in "other cultures" looked for them far away and started to look "across the tracks" only in late 1960s.&lt;ref name=Hannerz&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz|Hannerz, Ulf]] (1980) ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'', {{ISBN|0-231-08376-9}}, p. 1. ISBN Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's "home".&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/682051 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' "100:" 716–731&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody|Goody, Jack]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-87069-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Abélès | first1 = Marc | year = | title = How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field |journal = [[Cultural Anthropology (journal)|Cultural Anthropology]] | volume = 1999 | issue = | page = 407 | jstor = 08867356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' ("fieldwork"), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Augé]] (''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).

Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Michael M. J. (2003) ''Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16056">'''Area studies''' (also '''regional studies''') are [[interdisciplinary]] fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular [[geography|geographical]], [[nation]]al/[[Federal government|federal]], or [[culture|cultural]] regions.  The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]]. Typical area study programs involve [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[languages]], [[geography]], [[literature]], and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include [[diaspora]] and [[emigration]] from the area.

==History==
[[Interdisciplinary]] area studies became increasingly common in the [[United States of America]] and in Western scholarship after World War II. Before that war American universities had just a few faculty who taught or conducted research on the non-Western world. Foreign-area studies were virtually nonexistent. After the war, liberals and conservatives alike were concerned about the U.S. ability to respond effectively to perceived external threats from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] in the context of the emerging [[Cold War]], as well as to the fall-out from the [[Decolonisation of Africa|Decolonization of Africa]] and [[decolonisation of Asia|Asia]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

{{Double image|right|Diploma_de_Especialista_Universitario_de_la_Universidad_Complutense_de_Madrid.jpg|200px|Diploma-licenciatura-estudos-europeus-universidade.jpg|200px|[[Latin American studies]] and [[European studies]] are examples of Area studies, offered both in [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] degrees, the images show examples from [[Complutense University of Madrid]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucm.es/amelat/interes&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Universidade Aberta|Aberta University]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uab.pt/guiainformativo/eng_detailcursos.php?curso=14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this context, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] convened a series of meetings producing a broad consensus that to address this knowledge deficit, the U.S. must invest in international studies. Therefore, the foundations of the field are strongly rooted in America.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  Participants argued that a large brain trust of internationally oriented [[political scientist]]s and [[economist]]s was an urgent national priority. There was a central tension, however, between those who felt strongly that, instead of applying Western models, social scientists should develop culturally and historically contextualized knowledge of various parts of the world by working closely with humanists, and those who thought social scientists should seek to develop overarching [[macrohistory | macrohistorial]] theories that could draw connections between patterns of change and development across different geographies. The former became area-studies advocates, the latter proponents of [[modernization theory]].

The [[Ford Foundation]] would eventually become the dominant player in shaping the area-studies program in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, ''The Politics of Knowledge: The Carnegie Corporation, Philanthropy, and Public Policy'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the foundation established the prestigious Foreign Area Fellowship Program (FAFP), the first large-scale national competition in support of area-studies training in the United States. From 1953 to 1966 it contributed $270 million to 34 universities for area and language studies. Also during this period, it poured millions of dollars into the committees run jointly by the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] for field-development workshops, conferences, and publication programs.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Szanton, "The Origin, Nature and Challenges of Area Studies in the United States," in ''The Politics of Knowledge: Area Studies and the Disciplines'', ed. David L. Szanton (University of California Press, 2004), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the SSRC-ACLS joint committees would take over the administration of FAFP.

Other large and important programs followed Ford's. Most notably, the [[National Defense Education Act]] of 1957, renamed the Higher Education Act in 1965, allocated funding for some 125 university-based area-studies units known as [[National Resource Center]] programs at U.S. universities, as well as for [[Foreign Language and Area Studies]] fellowships for graduate students.

Meanwhile, area studies were also developed in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;

Others moved from area studies into international journalism. [...] All state and Party organs that dealt with cultural diplomacy drew on the staff of area studies and their network of contacts.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy within the field==
Since their inception, area studies have been subject to criticism—including by area specialists themselves. Many of them alleged that because area studies were connected to the Cold War agendas of the [[CIA]], the [[FBI]], and other intelligence and military agencies, participating in such programs was tantamount to serving as an agent of the state.&lt;ref&gt;See Bruce Cumings, "Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies during and after the Cold War," in ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'' 29 (1997). http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/cumings2.htm. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that there is the notion that U.S concerns and research priorities will define the intellectual terrain of area studies.&lt;ref&gt;See Patrick O'Meara, "Changing perspectives on international education", (Indiana University Press 2010), pp. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Others insisted, however, that once they were established on university campuses, area studies began to encompass a much broader and deeper intellectual agenda than the one foreseen by government agencies, thus not American centric.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, W.G. 2009. “Area Studies in a Global Context.” Chronicle of Higher Education. Nov 29. http://chronicle.com/article/Area-Studies-in-a-Global-Co/49284/&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, one of the greatest threats to the area studies project was the rise of [[rational choice theory]] in political science and economics.&lt;ref&gt;See "Rational Choice Theory," by John Scott, in ''Understanding Contemporary Society: Theories of The Present'', edited by G. Browning, A. Halcli, and F. Webster (Sage Publications, 2000). {{cite web|url=http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227085005/http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; To mock one of the most outspoken rational choice theory critics, Japan scholar [[Chalmers Johnson]] asked: Why do you need to know Japanese or anything about Japan's history and culture if the methods of rational choice will explain why Japanese politicians and bureaucrats do the things they do?&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers Johnson and E. B. Keehn, "A Disaster in the Making: Rational Choice and Asian Studies," ''The National Interest'' 36 (summer 1994), pp. 14–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of the [[Soviet Union]], philanthropic foundations and scientific bureaucracies moved to attenuate their support for area studies, emphasizing instead interregional themes like "development and democracy". When the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], which had long served as the national [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for raising and administering funds for area studies, underwent their first major restructuring in thirty years, closing down their area committees, scholars interpreted this as a massive signal about the changing research environment.&lt;ref&gt;See Cumings article, cited above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to an increasing interest in studying translocal, transregional, transnational and transcontinental phenomena, a Potsdam-based research network has recently coined the term "TransArea Studies" [http://www.uni-potsdam.de/tapoints/ (POINTS – Potsdam International Network for TransArea Studies)].

Other interdisciplinary research fields such as [[women's studies]] (also known as [[gender studies]]), [[disability studies]], and [[ethnic studies]] (including [[African American studies]], [[Asian American studies]], [[Latino/a studies]], and [[Native American studies]]) are not part of '''area studies''' but are sometimes included in discussion along with it.

==Institutions==

Some entire institutions of higher education (tertiary education) are devoted solely to area studies such as [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], part of the [[University of London]], or the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]] in Japan. At the [[University of Oxford]], the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS)[http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/][http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/ School of Interdiscplinary Area Studies, Oxford] and [[St Antony's College]] specialise in area studies, and hosts a number of post-graduate teaching programmes and research centres covering various regions of the world.
[[Jawaharlal Nehru University]], New Delhi, is the only institution with immense contribution towards popularising area studies in India.
An institution which exclusively deals with Area Studies is the [[German Institute of Global and Area Studies|GIGA]] (German Institute of Global Area Studies) in Germany.  Additionally, [[Lund University]] in Sweden offers the largest [http://www.ace.lu.se/ Asian Studies] masters program in Northern Europe and is dedicated to promoting studies related to South Asia through its [http://www.sasnet.lu.se/ SASNet].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ace.lu.se/masters-programme/study-asia-in-lund|title=Study Asia in Lund!|author=|date=27 June 2017|website=lu.se|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-potts/what-history-art|title=What is the History of Art? {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art history is the history of different groups of people and their culture represented throughout their artwork. Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;www.arthistory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
Art history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Art historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Art historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

==Timeline of prominent methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main article|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.&lt;ref&gt; Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). "Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.
Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Feminist art history===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.

While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical "re-reading" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum studies and collecting===
Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New materialism===
Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

Concurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actor–network theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.

===Nationalist art history===
The making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of one’s country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that country’s identity.

Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s [[Lives of the Artists]] is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht Dürer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.

Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government—regardless of what cultures created the art—and an often implicit mission to bolster that country’s own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

"Contemporary art history" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chorography''' (from [[wikt:χῶρος|χῶρος]] ''khōros'', "place" and [[wikt:γράφω|γράφειν]] ''graphein'', "to write") is the art of describing or mapping a region or district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chorography|volume=6|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension such a description or map.&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chorography Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] and  [[Ptolemy]], where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that "chorography defines itself by opposition to [[chronicle]]. It is the genre devoted to place, and chronicle is the genre devoted to time".&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson 1992, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Darrell Rohl prefers a broad definition of "the representation of space or place".&lt;ref&gt;Rohl 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy 16century.jpg|thumb|Ptolemy as imagined by a 16th-century artist]]

==Ptolemy's definition==
In his text of the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (2nd century CE), Ptolemy defined [[geography]] as the study of the entire world, but chorography as the study of its smaller parts—provinces, regions, cities, or ports. Its goal was "an impression of a part, as when one makes an image of just an ear or an eye"; and it dealt with "the qualities rather than the quantities of the things that it sets down". Ptolemy implied that it was a ''graphic'' technique, comprising the making of views (not simply maps), since he claimed that it required the skills of a draftsman or landscape artist, rather than the more technical skills of recording "proportional placements". Ptolemy's most recent English translators, however, render the term as "regional cartography".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Berggren and Alexander Jones (eds), ''Ptolemy's Geography'' (Princeton, 2000), pp. 57-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance revival==
Ptolemy's text was rediscovered in the west at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the term "chorography" was revived by [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Lucia Nuti, 'Mapping Places: Chorography and Vision in the Renaissance', in Denis Cosgrove (ed.), ''Mappings'' (London, 1999), pp. 90-108.&lt;/ref&gt; An early instance is a small-scale map of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in an early fifteenth-century manuscript, which is labelled a ''tabula chorographica''.&lt;ref&gt;British Library Harleian MS 1808, fol. 9v; reproduced in Catherine Delano-Smith and R.J.P Kain, ''English Maps: a History'' (London, 1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dee]] in 1570 regarded the practice as "an underling, and a twig of ''Geographie''", by which the "plat" [plan or drawing] of a particular place would be exhibited to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;John Dee, 'Mathematicall Praeface', in Euclid, ''The Elements of Geometrie'', trans. H. Billingsley (London, 1570), sig. A4r.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Camden]]
The term also came to be used, however, for ''written'' descriptions of regions.  These regions were extensively visited by the writer, who then combined local topographical description, summaries of the historical sources, and local knowledge and stories, into a text. The most influential example (at least in Britain) was probably [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (first edition 1586), which described itself on its title page as a ''Chorographica descriptio''. [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]] in 1587 similarly described his own "Description of Britaine" as an exercise in chorography, distinguishing it from the historical/chronological text of Holinshed's [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] (to which the "Description" formed an introductory section).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Harrison |authorlink=William Harrison (priest) |chapter=An Historicall Description of the Iland of Britaine |editor-first=Raphael |editor-last=Holinshed |editor-link=Raphael Holinshed |title=The First and Second Volumes of Chronicles |edition=2nd |place=London |year=1587 |page=sig. [A2]v |url=http://english.nsms.ox.ac.uk/holinshed/texts.php?text1=1587_0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Heylin]] in 1652 defined chorography as "the exact description of some Kingdom, Countrey, or particular Province of the same", and gave as examples [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]'s ''Description of Greece'' (2nd century AD); Camden's ''Britannia'' (1586); [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s ''Descrittione di  tutti i Paesi Bassi'' (1567) (on the [[Low Countries]]); and [[Leandro Alberti]]'s ''Descrizione d'Italia'' (1550).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Heylyn |authorlink=Peter Heylin |title=Cosmographie |location=London |year=1652 |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camden's ''Britannia'' was predominantly concerned with the history and antiquities of Britain, and, probably as a result, the term chorography in English came to be particularly associated with [[antiquarian]] texts. [[William Lambarde]], [[John Stow]], [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Tristram Risdon]], [[John Aubrey]] and many others used it in this way, arising from a gentlemanly [[topophilia]] and a sense of service to one's county or city, until it was eventually often applied to the genre of [[English county histories|county history]]. A late example was William Grey's ''Chorographia'' (1649), a survey of the antiquities of the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Even before Camden's work appeared, [[Andrew Melville]] in 1574 had referred to chorography and [[chronology]] as the "twa lights" [two lights] of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=G. R. |editor-last=Kinloch |editor-link=George Ritchie Kinloch |title=The Diary of Mr James Melvill, 1556–1601 |publisher=Bannatyne Club |location=Edinburgh |year=1829 |pages=38–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxton pamberforest.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Example of [[Christopher Saxton]]'s cartography]]
However, the term also continued to be used for maps and map-making, particularly of sub-national or [[Counties of England|county]] areas. William Camden praised the county mapmakers [[Christopher Saxton]] and [[John Norden]] as "most skilfull Chorographers";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Camden |translator-first=Philemon |translator-last=Holland |translator-link=Philemon Holland |title=Britain, or a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Ilands adjoyning, out of the depth of Antiquitie |chapter=The Author to the Reader |place=London |year=1610 |page=sig. [*5]v |url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/fronteng.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Plot]] in 1677&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Plot |authorlink=Robert Plot |title=The Natural History of Oxford-shire |location=Oxford |year=1677 |page=299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer)|Christopher Packe]] in 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Packe |authorlink=Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer) |title=A New Philosophico-Chorographical Chart of East-Kent |location=[Canterbury] |year=1743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both referred to their county maps as chorographies.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century the term had largely fallen out of use in all these contexts, being superseded for most purposes by either "[[topography]]" or "[[cartography]]". [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'' (1755) made a distinction between geography, chorography and topography, arguing that geography dealt with large areas, topography with small areas, but chorography with intermediary areas, being "less in its object than geography, and greater than topography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Johnson |authorlink=Samuel Johnson |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |location=London |year=1755 |chapter=chorography |page=373 |url=https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/page-view/?i=373 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the term is only rarely found in English by this date.

[[File:Ferdinand von Richthofen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand von Richthofen]]

==Modern usages==
In more technical geographical literature, the term had been abandoned as city views and [[city map]]s became more and more sophisticated and demanded a set of skills that required not only skilled draftsmanship but also some knowledge of scientific [[surveying]]. However, its use was revived for a second time in the late nineteenth century by the geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]]. He regarded chorography as a specialization within geography, comprising the description through field observation of the particular traits of a given area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html GEO 466/566: The Profession of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211150811/http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html |date=2012-02-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also now widely used by historians and literary scholars to refer to the [[Early modern period|early modern]] genre of topographical and antiquarian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Particularly influential in reviving the term has been Helgerson 1992, esp. pp. 105-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Homeros Caetani Louvre Ma440 n2.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of [[Homer]], the ancient Greek epic poet]]
'''Classics''' or '''classical studies''' is the study of [[classical antiquity]]. It encompasses the study of the [[Greco-Roman world]], particularly of its languages and literature (Ancient Greek and Classical Latin) but also of Greco-Roman philosophy, history, and archaeology. Traditionally in the [[Western world|West]], the study of the [[Greek classics|Greek]] and [[Latin Classics|Roman classics]] was considered one of the cornerstones of the [[humanities]] and a fundamental element of a rounded education. The study of Classics has therefore traditionally been a cornerstone of a typical elite education.

Study encompasses specifically a time-period of history from the mid-2nd millennium BC to the 6th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[The British Library]] - [https://www.bl.uk/subjects/classics# Classics] Accessed December 13th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''Classics'' is derived from the [[Latin]] [[adjective]] ''[[wikt:classicus|classicus]]'', meaning "belonging to the highest class of citizens". The word was originally used to describe the members of the highest class in ancient Rome. By the 2nd century AD the word was used in literary criticism to describe writers of the highest quality.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-17"&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Aulus Gellius]], in his ''Attic Nights'', contrasts "classicus" and "[[wikt:proletarius|proletarius]]" writers.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', 19.8.15.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century AD, the word had acquired a second meaning, referring to pupils at a school.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-17"/&gt; Thus the two modern meanings of the word, referring both to literature considered to be of the highest quality, and to the standard texts used as part of a curriculum, both derive from Roman use.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-17"/&gt;

==History==

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Catullus, Itally.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of a bronze bust of a man. It rests on a stone plinth, on which the words "Gaius Valerius Catullus 87 AC–54 AC" are written.|The Roman poet Catullus was virtually unknown during the medieval period, in contrast to his modern popularity.]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], classics and education were tightly intertwined; according to Jan Ziolkowski, there is no era in history in which the link was tighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval education taught students to imitate earlier classical models,&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-21"&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin continued to be the language of scholarship and culture, despite the increasing difference between literary Latin and the vernacular languages of Europe during the period.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-21"/&gt;

While Latin was hugely influential, however, Greek was barely studied, and Greek literature survived almost solely in Latin translation.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of even major Greek authors such as [[Hesiod]], whose names continued to be known by educated Europeans, were unavailable in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"/&gt; In the thirteenth century, the English philosopher [[Roger Bacon]] wrote that "there are not four men in Latin Christendom who are acquainted with the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic grammars."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sandys|1921|p=591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the unavailability of Greek authors, there were other differences between the classical canon known today and the works valued in the Middle Ages. [[Catullus]], for instance, was almost entirely unknown in the medieval period.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"/&gt; The popularity of different authors also waxed and waned throughout the period: [[Lucretius]], popular during the [[Carolingian renaissance|Carolingian]] period, was barely read in the twelfth century, while for [[Quintilian]] the reverse is true.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"/&gt;

===Renaissance===
The [[Renaissance]] led to the increasing study of both ancient literature and ancient history,&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-586"/&gt; as well as a revival of classical styles of Latin.&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-587"/&gt; From the [[14th century]], first in Italy and then increasingly across Europe, [[Renaissance Humanism]], an intellectual movement that "advocated the study and imitation of classical antiquity",&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-586"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed. Humanism saw a reform in education in Europe, introducing a wider range of Latin authors as well as bringing back the study of Greek language and literature to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-587"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=587}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reintroduction was initiated by [[Petrarch]] (1304–1374) and [[Boccaccio]] (1313–1375) who commissioned a Calabrian scholar to translate the [[Homeric poems]].&lt;ref&gt;Pade, M. (2007). The Reception of Plutarch's Lives in Fifteenth-Century Italy. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum&lt;/ref&gt; This humanist educational reform spread from Italy, in Catholic countries as it was adopted by the Jesuits, and in countries that became Protestant such as England, Germany, and the Low Countries, in order to ensure that future clerics were able to study the New Testament in the original language.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 590"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassicism===
The late 17th and 18th centuries are the period in Western European literary history which is most associated with the classical tradition, as writers consciously adapted classical models.&lt;ref name="Kaminski 2007 57"&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical models were so highly prized that the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] were rewritten along neoclassical lines, and these "improved" versions were performed throughout the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 18th century, the study of Greek became increasingly important relative to that of Latin.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 591"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=591}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this period [[Johann Winckelmann]]'s claims for the superiority of the Greek visual arts influenced a shift in aesthetic judgements, while in the literary sphere, [[G.E. Lessing]] "returned Homer to the centre of artistic achievement".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom, the study of Greek in schools began in the late 18th century. The poet [[Walter Savage Landor]] claimed to have been one of the first English schoolboys to write in Greek during his time at [[Rugby School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
The 19th century saw the influence of the classical world, and the value of a classical education, decline,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|2001|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the US, where the subject was often criticised for its elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|2001|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, little new literature was still being written in Latin – a practice which had continued as late as the 18th century – and a command of Latin declined in importance.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 590"/&gt; Correspondingly, classical education from the 19th century onwards began to increasingly de-emphasise the importance of the ability to write and speak Latin.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 591"/&gt; In the United Kingdom this process took longer than elsewhere. Composition continued to be the dominant classical skill in England until the 1870s, when new areas within the discipline began to increase in popularity.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 81"&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same decade came the first challenges to the requirement of Greek at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, though it would not be finally abolished for another 50 years.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 83"&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the influence of classics as the dominant mode of education in Europe and North America was in decline in the 19th century, the discipline was rapidly evolving in the same period.  Classical scholarship was becoming more systematic and scientific, especially with the "new philology" created at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Rommel 2001 169"&gt;{{harvnb|Rommel|2001|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its scope was also broadening: it was during the 19th century that ancient history and classical archaeology began to be seen as part of Classics, rather than separate disciplines.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 81"/&gt;

===20th century to present===
During the 20th century, the study of classics became less common. In England, for instance, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities stopped requiring students to have qualifications in Greek in 1920,&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 83"/&gt; and in Latin at the end of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 85"&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] was introduced in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland in 1988, it did not mention the classics.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 85"/&gt; By 2003, only about 10% of state schools in Britain offered any classical subjects to their students at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[AQA]], the largest exam board for [[A-Levels]] and [[GCSE]]'s in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, announced that it would be scrapping A-Level subjects in Classical Civilization, Archaeology, and Art History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/17/scrapping-archeology-classics-a-levels-barbaric-tony-robinson/| title=Scrapping of archaeology and classics A-levels criticized as 'barbaric act'| author=Sally Weale| publisher=The Guardian| date=2016-10-17| access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left just one out of five exam boards in England which still offered Classical Civilization as a subject. The decision was immediately denounced by archaeologists and historians, with Natalie Haynes of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stating that the loss of the A-Level would deprive state school students, 93% of all students, the opportunity to study Classics, while making it once again the exclusive purview of wealthy private-school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/aqa-classics-classical-civilisation-a-level-exam-archaeology| title=Ditching classics at A-level is little short of a tragedy| author=Natalie Haynes| publisher=The Guardian| date=2016-10-19| access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the study of classics has not declined as fast elsewhere in Europe. In 2009, a review of ''Meeting the Challenge'', a collection of conference papers about the teaching of Latin in Europe, noted that though there is opposition to the teaching of Latin in Italy, it is nonetheless still compulsory in most secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balbo|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same can be said in the case of France or Greece, too. Indeed, Ancient Greek is one of the compulsory subjects in Greek secondary education, whereas in France, Latin is one of the optional subjects that can be chosen in a majority of middle schools and high schools. Ancient Greek is also still being taught, but not as much as Latin.

==Sub-disciplines==
One of the most notable characteristics of the modern study of Classics is the diversity of the field. Although traditionally focused on ancient Greece and Rome, the study now encompasses the entire ancient Mediterranean world, thus expanding the studies to Northern [[Africa]] as well as parts of the [[Middle East]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Philology&lt;!--'Classical philology' redirects here--&gt;===
{{further information|Philology}}
{{for|the journal|Classical Philology (journal)}}
[[File:Friedrich August Wolf - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white image of Friedrich August Wolf in profile|The eighteenth-century classicist [[Friedrich August Wolf]] was the author of ''Prolegomena to Homer'', one of the first great works of classical philology.]]
Philology is the study of language preserved in written sources; '''classical philology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is thus concerned with understanding any texts from the classical period written in the classical languages of Latin and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackay|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The roots of classical philology lie in [[the Renaissance]], as humanist intellectuals attempted to return to the Latin of the classical period, especially of [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shorey|1906|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as scholars attempted to produce more accurate editions of ancient texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the principles of philology still used today developed during this period. For instance, the observation that if a manuscript could be shown to be a copy of an earlier extant manuscript, then it provides no further evidence of the original text, was made as early as 1489 by [[Angelo Poliziano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=173–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other philological tools took longer to be developed: the first statement, for instance, of the principle that a more difficult reading should be preferred over a simpler one, was in 1697 by [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean Le Clerc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern discipline of classical philology began in Germany at the turn of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Rommel 2001 169"/&gt; It was during this period that scientific principles of philology began to be put together into a coherent whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=174–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to provide a set of rules by which scholars could determine which manuscripts were most accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "new philology", as it was known, centred around the construction of a genealogy of manuscripts, with which a hypothetical common ancestor, closer to the original text than any existing manuscript, could be reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
{{Main article|Classical archaeology}}
[[File:Lion Gate Mykene with Wilhelm Dörpfeld and Heinrich Schliemann.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black and white photograph of the Lion Gate at Mycenae.|Schliemann and Dörpfeld's excavation at Mycenae was one of the earliest excavations in the field of classical archaeology.]]
Classical archaeology is the oldest branch of archaeology,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its roots going back to [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|J.J. Winckelmann's]] work on [[Herculaneum]] in the 1760s.&lt;ref name="Renfrew80-288"&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|1980|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the last decades of the 19th century, however, that classical archaeology became part of the tradition of Western classical scholarship.&lt;ref name="Renfrew80-288"/&gt; It was included as part of Cambridge University's [[Classical Tripos]] for the first time after the reforms of the 1880s, though it did not become part of Oxford's [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] until much later.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 83"/&gt;

The second half of the 19th century saw [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann's]] excavations of [[Troy]] and [[Mycenae]]; the first excavations at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and [[Delos]]; and [[Arthur Evans]]' work in Crete, particularly on [[Knossos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|1980|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the foundation of important archaeological associations (e.g. the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] in 1879),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; including many foreign archaeological institutes in Athens and Rome (the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]] in 1881, [[British School at Athens]] in 1886, [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1895, and [[British School at Rome]] in 1900).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|2010|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, classical archaeology has taken little part in the theoretical changes in the rest of the discipline,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely ignoring the popularity of "[[New Archaeology]]", which emphasised the development of general laws derived from studying material culture, in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Archaeology is still criticized by traditional minded scholars of classical archaeology despite a wide acceptance of its basic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darvil|first1=Timothy|title=New Archaeology|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/view/10.1093/acref/9780199534043.001.0001/acref-9780199534043-e-2752|website=Oxford Reference|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art history===
{{Main article|Art history}}
Some art historians focus their study on the development of art in the classical world. Indeed, the art and architecture of Ancient Rome and Greece is very well regarded and remains at the heart of much of our art today. For example, Ancient Greek architecture gave us the Classical Orders: [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]. The [[Parthenon]] is still the architectural symbol of the classical world.

Greek sculpture is well known and we know the names of several Ancient Greek artists: for example, [[Phidias]].

===Ancient history===
With philology, archaeology, and art history, scholars seek understanding of the history and culture of a civilisation, through critical study of the extant literary and physical artefacts, in order to compose and establish a continual historic narrative of the Ancient World and its peoples. The task is difficult due to a dearth of physical evidence: for example, [[Sparta]] was a leading Greek [[city-state]], yet little evidence of it survives to study, and what is available comes from [[Athens]], Sparta's principal rival; likewise, the [[Roman Empire]] destroyed most evidence (cultural artefacts) of earlier, conquered civilizations, such as that of the [[Etruscans]].

===Philosophy===
{{Main article|Ancient philosophy}}
The English word "philosophy" comes from the Greek word φιλοσοφία, meaning "love of wisdom", probably coined by Pythagoras. Along with the word itself, the discipline of philosophy as we know it today has its roots in ancient Greek thought, and according to Martin West "philosophy as we understand it is a Greek creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2001|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient philosophy was traditionally divided into three branches: logic, physics, and ethics.&lt;ref name="Mann 1996 178"&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all of the works of ancient philosophers fit neatly into one of these three branches. For instance, Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' and ''Poetics'' have been traditionally classified in the West as "ethics", but in the Arabic world were grouped with logic; in reality, they do not fit neatly into either category.&lt;ref name="Mann 1996 178"/&gt;

From the last decade of the eighteenth century, scholars of ancient philosophy began to study the discipline historically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, works on ancient philosophy had been unconcerned with chronological sequence and with reconstructing the reasoning of ancient thinkers; with what Wolfgang-Ranier Mann calls "New Philosophy", this changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=180–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception studies===
{{main article|Classical reception studies}}
A relatively recent new discipline within the classics is "reception studies",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bulwer|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which developed in the 1960s at the [[University of Konstanz]].&lt;ref name="Kallendorf07-02"&gt;{{harvnb|Kallendorf|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reception studies is concerned with how students of classical texts have understood and interpreted them.&lt;ref name="Kallendorf07-02"/&gt;
As such, reception studies is interested in a two-way interaction between reader and text,&lt;ref name="Martindale07-298"/&gt; taking place within a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the idea of an "aesthetics of reception" was first put forward by [[Hans Robert Jauss]] in 1967, the principles of reception theory go back much earlier than this.&lt;ref name="Martindale07-298"&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As early as 1920, [[T.S. Eliot]] wrote that "the past [is] altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|1920|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Martindale describes this as a "cardinal principle" for many versions of modern reception theory.&lt;ref name="Martindale07-298"/&gt;

==Classical Greece==
{{Main article|Ancient Greece|Outline of ancient Greece|Timeline of ancient Greece}}

Ancient Greece was the civilization belonging to the period of Greek history lasting from the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]], beginning in the eighth century BC, to the [[Roman conquest of Greece]] after the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Battle of Corinth]] in 146 BC. The [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], during the fifth and fourth centuries BC, has traditionally been considered the height of Greek civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical period of Greek history is generally considered to have begun with the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first]] and [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second Persian invasions of Greece]] at the start of the Greco-Persian wars,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to have ended with the death of [[Alexander the Great]].

Classical Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe; thus Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of Western civilization.

===Language===
[[File:AncientGreekDialects (Woodard) en.svg|right|thumb|alt=|Map showing the regional dialects of Greek during the Classical period]]
{{Main article|Ancient Greek|Mycenaean Greek language|Koine Greek}}

Ancient Greek is the historical stage in the development of the Greek language spanning the Archaic (c. 8th to 6th centuries BC), Classical (c. 5th to 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic (c. 3rd century BC to 6th century AD) periods of ancient Greece and the ancient world. It is predated in the 2nd millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. Its Hellenistic phase is known as Koine ("common") or Biblical Greek, and its late period mutates imperceptibly into Medieval Greek. Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own, although in its earlier form it closely resembles Classical Greek. Prior to the Koine period, Greek of the classical and earlier periods included several regional dialects.

Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of classical Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to the vocabulary of English and many other European languages, and has been a standard subject of study in Western educational institutions since the Renaissance. Latinized forms of Ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in other scientific terminology.

===Literature===
{{Main article|Ancient Greek literature}}
The earliest surviving works of Greek literature are [[epic poetry]]. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' are the earliest to survive to us today, probably composed in the eighth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early epics were oral compositions, created without the use of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Around the same time that the Homeric epics were composed, the [[Greek alphabet]] was introduced; the earliest surviving inscriptions date from around 750 BC.&lt;ref name="Kirk-45"&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Need to put something about archaic poetry here...
Some of the earliest Greek poetry to be composed in written form was that of [[Archilochus]], around a century after the introduction of the Greek alphabet.&lt;ref name="Kirk-45"/&gt; --&gt;
European [[drama]] was invented in ancient Greece. Traditionally this was attributed to [[Thespis]], around the middle of the sixth century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the earliest surviving work of Greek drama is [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'', which dates to 472 BC.&lt;ref name="WIGEK-258"&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek tragedy was performed by a chorus and two actors, but by the end of Aeschylus' life, a third actor had been introduced, either by him or by [[Sophocles]].&lt;ref name="WIGEK-258"/&gt; The last surviving Greek tragedies are the ''[[Bacchae]]'' of [[Euripides]] and Sophocles' [[Oedipus at Colonus]], both from the end of the fifth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|pp=339–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving Greek comedy begins later than tragedy; the earliest surviving work, [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Acharnians]]'', comes from 425 BC.&lt;ref name="Handley-355"&gt;{{harvnb|Handley|1985|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, comedy dates back as early as 486 BC, when the [[Dionysia]] added a competition for comedy to the much earlier competition for tragedy.&lt;ref name="Handley-355"/&gt; The comedy of the fifth century is known as [[Old Comedy]], and it comes down to us solely in the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, along with a few fragments.&lt;ref name="Handley-355"/&gt; Sixty years after the end of Aristophanes' career, the next author of comedies to have any substantial body of work survive is [[Menander]], whose style is known as [[New Comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Handley|1985|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two historians flourished during Greece's classical age: Herodotus and Thucydides. Herodotus is commonly called the father of history, and his "History" contains the first truly literary use of prose in Western literature. Of the two, Thucydides was the more careful historian. His critical use of sources, inclusion of documents, and laborious research made his History of the Peloponnesian War a significant influence on later generations of historians.&lt;!-- Should talk about post-Thucydidean history: Xenophon, Polybius, Diodorus, Arrian, Plutarch etc. --&gt; The greatest achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy. There were many Greek philosophers, but three names tower above the rest: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. These have had a profound influence on Western society.&lt;!-- Socrates wrote nothing! What is he doing in this section?! --&gt;

===Mythology and religion===
{{Main article|Greek mythology|Religion in Ancient Greece}}

Greek mythology is the body of myths and legends belonging to the ancient Greeks concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. They were a part of religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to the myths and study them in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.

Greek religion encompassed the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These different groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or "cults" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. Also, the Greek religion extended out of Greece and out to neighbouring islands.

Many Greek people recognized the major gods and goddesses: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Ares, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Athena, Hermes, Demeter, Hestia and Hera; though philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to posit a transcendent single deity. Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with epithets that distinguished them and specified their local nature.

===Philosophy===
{{Main article|Ancient Greek philosophy}}
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A bust of Socrates|So influential was Socrates to classical philosophy that earlier philosophers are today known as [[pre-Socratics]].]]

The earliest surviving philosophy from ancient Greece dates back to the 6th century BC, when according to Aristotle [[Thales of Miletus]] was considered to have been the first Greek philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential pre-Socratic philosophers include [[Pythagoras]] and [[Heraclitus]]. The most famous and significant figures in classical Athenian philosophy, from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BC, are [[Socrates]], his student [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], who studied at [[Plato's Academy]] before founding his own school, known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Later Greek schools of philosophy, including the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], [[Stoics]], and [[Epicureans]], continued to be influential after the Roman annexation of Greece, and into the post-Classical world.

Greek philosophy dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including political philosophy, [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[logic]], as well as disciplines which are not today thought of as part of philosophy, such as biology and rhetoric.

[[File:Praeneste fibula.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of a gold brooch|The [[Praeneste fibula]] is believed to bear the oldest known Latin inscription. The inscription means "Manius made me for Numerius".]]

The earliest surviving inscription in Latin comes from the 7th century BC, on a [[Praeneste fibula|brooch from Palestrina]]. Latin from between this point and the early 1st century BC is known as [[Old Latin]]. Most surviving Latin literature is [[Classical Latin]], from the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD. Latin then evolved into [[Late Latin]], in use during the [[Late antiquity|late antique period]]. Late Latin survived long after the end of classical antiquity, and was finally replaced by written Romance languages around the 9th century AD. Along with literary forms of Latin, there existed various vernacular dialects, generally known as [[Vulgar Latin]], in use throughout antiquity. These are mainly preserved in sources such as graffiti and the [[Vindolanda tablets]].

===Literature===
{{main article|Latin literature}}
The earliest surviving Latin authors, writing in Old Latin, include the playwrights [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. Much of the best known and most highly thought of Latin literature comes from the classical period, with poets such as [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], and [[Ovid]]; historians such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Tacitus]]; orators such as [[Cicero]]; and philosophers such as [[Seneca the Younger]] and [[Lucretius]]. Late Latin authors include many Christian writers such as [[Lactantius]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Ambrose]]; non-Christian authors, such as the historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], are also preserved.

===History===
{{main article|Timeline of ancient Rome}}
According to legend, the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reality, there had been a settlement on the site since around 1000 BC, when the [[Palatine Hill]] was settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was originally ruled by kings, first Roman, and then Etruscan – according to Roman tradition, the first Etruscan king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus, ruled from 616 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the 6th century BC, the city expanded its influence over the entirety of [[Latium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the end of the 6th century – traditionally in 510 BC – the kings of Rome were driven out, and the city became a republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 387 BC, Rome was sacked by the Gauls following the [[Battle of the Allia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon recovered from this humiliating defeat, however, and in 381 the inhabitants of [[Tusculum]] in Latium were made Roman citizens. This was the first time Roman citizenship was extended in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome went on to expand its area of influence, until by 269 the entirety of the Italian peninsula was under Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, in 264, the [[First Punic War]] began; it lasted until 241.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Punic War]] began in 218, and by the end of that year, the Carthaginian general [[Hannibal]] had invaded Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war saw Rome's worst defeat to that point at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]; the largest army Rome had yet put into the field was wiped out, and one of the two consuls leading it was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rome continued to fight, annexing much of Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually defeating Carthage, ending her position as a major power and securing Roman preeminence in the Western Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Three more paragraphs probably needed: one on the late Republic and civil war, one on the early empire, and one on the later empire to the fall of the Western empire --&gt;

==Legacy of the classical world==
The classical languages of the Ancient Mediterranean world influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of international application. Thus, Latin grew from a highly developed cultural product of the Golden and Silver eras of Latin literature to become the ''international lingua franca'' in matters diplomatic, scientific, philosophic and religious, until the 17th century. Long before this, Latin had evolved into [[Romance languages|the Romance languages]] and Ancient Greek into [[Modern Greek]] and its [[Modern Greek dialects|dialects]]. In the specialised science and technology vocabularies, the influence of [[Latin influence in English|Latin]] and [[English words of Greek origin|Greek]] is notable. [[Ecclesiastical Latin]], the Roman Catholic Church's official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world in the contemporary world.

Latin had an impact far beyond the classical world. It continued to be the pre-eminent language for serious writings in Europe long after the fall of the Roman empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|pp=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Romance languages]] – such as French, Spanish, and Italian – all derive from Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin is still seen as a foundational aspect of European culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of the classical world is not confined to the influence of classical languages. The Roman empire was taken as a model by later European empires, such as the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[British Empire|British]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical art has been taken as a model in later periods – medieval Romanesque architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Enlightenment-era neoclassical literature&lt;ref name="Kaminski 2007 57"/&gt; were both influenced by classical models, to take but two examples, while [[James Joyce|Joyce's]] ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is one of the most influential works of twentieth century literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Disclosing New Worlds: Entrepreneurship, Democratic Action, and the Cultivation of Solidarity''''' (1997)&lt;ref name=dnw&gt;{{cite book |title=Disclosing New Worlds: Entrepreneurship, Democratic Action, and the Cultivation of Solidarity|author1=Charles Spinosa|author2=Fernando Flores|author3=Hubert L. Dreyfus|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press USA|isbn=0-262-19381-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a philosophical proposal intended to restore or energize [[democracy]] by [[social constructionism]] via an [[argument]] style of [[world disclosure]] but which philosophy is distinct from:
*[[Relativism]] - a concept in which points of view have no absolute truth or validity.
*[[Formalism (philosophy)|Formalism]] - an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the arts, literature, or philosophy
*[[Essentialism]] - the view that, for any specific entity (such as an animal, a group of people, a physical object, a concept), there is a set of attributes which are necessary to its identity and function.

Nevertheless, the authors build on these ideas and seek to reformulate the relationship between democratic rights and economic progress when persistent  technological advance obscures an uncertain future for humanity threatened by multiple issues such as  [[peak oil]],  [[global warming]] and [[environmental degradation]]. The book is co-authored by [[Fernando Flores]],  [[Hubert Dreyfus]]  and Charles Spinosa (a consultant philosopher specializing in commercial innovation). They concentrate on three practical activities:

* [[social entrepreneurship]],
* [[active citizenship]] and
* [[solidarity|social solidarity]]

The authors reason that human beings are at their best when engaged in imaginative and practical innovation rather than in abstract reflection, and thus  challenging accepted wisdom and conventional practices within their particular environment, or as the authors claim, when they are making history. History-making, in this account, refers not to political power changes, wars or violent revolution, but to changes in the way people  understand their  personal qualities and deal with their particular situations.

==Structure of the work==
'''[[World disclosure]]''' (German: Erschlossenheit, literally development or comprehension) is a phenomenon first described by the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] in his landmark book [[Being and Time]]. As well as the authors of this work, the idea of disclosing has also been discussed by philosophers such as [[John Dewey]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. It refers to how things become intelligible and meaningfully relevant to ordinary people.

==Conclusion==
The authors reiterate the importance of history making and identify thee types of actors:
* The entrepreneur
* The virtuous citizen 
* The culture figure

Each has to overcome [[resistance to change]], but do so in different ways. Solving puzzles request of each a clear [[strategy|strategic]] objective, but use different [[tactic (method)|tactic]]s to overcome obstructions. By understanding and disclosing our objectives, and discovering the sort of role we may have to play according to particular situations to reach those goals, all of us can be "history makers" and make changes to our society by changing the shared narrative that binds our particular culture. The authors quote already changed collective attitudes which have recently become much less tolerant  of road accidents, various forms of discrimination and repressive public education of young people.

They promote a change to the overarching [[consumerism]] as the western world's social and economic order and ideology that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts, in favor of [[sustainable development]]  within individual communities as a precursor to disclosing a new world order that supports [[human equality]]

[[File:Igualtat de sexes.svg|thumb|upright|A generic symbol for gender equality]]
'''Gender equality''', also known as '''sexual equality''', is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and decision-making; and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations and needs equally, regardless of gender.

{{Quote|text=Gender equality, equality between men and women, entails the concept that all human beings, both men and women, are free to develop their personal abilities and make choices without the limitations set by stereotypes, rigid gender roles and prejudices. Gender equality means that the different behaviour, aspirations and needs of women and men are considered, valued and favoured equally. It does not mean that women and men have to become the same, but that their rights, responsibilities and opportunities will not depend on whether they are born male or female. Gender equity means fairness of treatment for women and men, according to their respective needs. This may include equal treatment or treatment that is different but which is considered equivalent in terms of rights, benefits, obligations and opportunities.|sign=ABC Of Women Worker's Rights And Gender Equality|source=ILO, 2000. p. 48.}}

Gender equality is the goal, while gender neutrality and gender equity are practices and ways of thinking that help in achieving the goal. Gender parity, which is used to measure gender balance in a given situation, can aid in achieving gender equality but is not the goal in and of itself. Gender equality is more than equal representation, it is strongly tied to [[women's rights]], and often requires policy changes. As of 2017, the global movement for gender equality has not incorporated the proposition of [[Third gender|genders besides women and men]], or [[Gender identity|gender identities]] outside of the [[gender binary]].

[[UNICEF]] says gender equality "means that women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources, opportunities and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike."&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Overarching_2Pager_Web.pdf|title=Promoting Gender Equality: An Equity-based Approach to Programming|first=Roger|date=2011|website=Operational Guidance Overview in Brief|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=2011-01-28|author=LeMoyne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a global scale, achieving gender equality also requires eliminating harmful practices against women and girls, including [[sex trafficking]], [[femicide]], [[wartime sexual violence]], and other [[Violence against women|oppression tactics]]. [[UNFPA]] stated that, "despite many international agreements affirming their human rights, women are still much more likely than men to be poor and illiterate. They have less access to property ownership, credit, training and employment. They are far less likely than men to be politically active and far more likely to be victims of domestic violence."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality|title=Gender equality|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Population Fund|publisher=UNFPA|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, gender equality is the fifth of seventeen [[Sustainable Development Goals|sustainable development goals]] of the [[United Nations]]. [[Gender inequality]] is measured annually by the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s [[Human Development Report]]s.

The [[Shakers]], an evangelical group, which practiced segregation of the sexes and strict [[celibacy]], were early practitioners of gender equality. They branched off from a [[Quaker]] community in the north-west of England before emigrating to America in 1774. In America, the head of the Shakers' central ministry in 1788, Joseph Meacham, had a revelation that the sexes should be equal. He then brought [[Lucy Wright]] into the ministry as his female counterpart, and together they restructured the society to balance the rights of the sexes. Meacham and Wright established leadership teams where each elder, who dealt with the men's spiritual welfare, was partnered with an eldress, who did the same for women. Each deacon was partnered with a deaconess. Men had oversight of men; women had oversight of women. Women lived with women; men lived with men. In Shaker society, a woman did not have to be controlled or owned by any man. After Meacham's death in 1796, Wright became the head of the Shaker ministry until her death in 1821.

Shakers maintained the same pattern of gender-balanced leadership for more than 200 years. They also promoted equality by working together with other women's rights advocates. In 1859, Shaker Elder Frederick Evans stated their beliefs forcefully, writing that Shakers were "the first to disenthrall woman from the condition of vassalage to which all other religious systems (more or less) consign her, and to secure to her those just and equal rights with man that, by her similarity to him in organization and faculties, both God and nature would seem to demand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick William |last=Evans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fg2bS2pDUVMC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Shakers: Compendium of the Origin, History, Principles, Rules and Regulations, Government, and Doctrines of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing |place=New York |publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Co. |year=1859 |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans and his counterpart, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, joined women's rights advocates on speakers' platforms throughout the northeastern U.S. in the 1870s. A visitor to the Shakers wrote in 1875:
{{Quote|Each sex works in its own appropriate sphere of action, there being a proper subordination, deference and respect of the female to the male in his order, {{em|and of the male to the female in her order}} [emphasis added], so that in any of these communities the zealous advocates of "women’s rights" may here find a practical realization of their ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Glendyne R. Wergland, ''Sisters in the Faith: Shaker Women and Equality of the Sexes'' (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Shakers were more than a radical religious sect on the fringes of American society; they put equality of the sexes into practice. It has been argued that they demonstrated that gender equality was achievable and how to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy R. Benningfield, Appeal of the Sisterhood: The Shakers and the Woman's Rights Movement (University of Kentucky Lexington doctoral dissertation, 2004), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In wider society, the movement towards gender equality began with the [[suffragette|suffrage movement]] in Western cultures in the late-19th century, which sought to allow women to vote and hold elected office. This period also witnessed significant changes to [[women's property rights]], particularly in relation to their marital status. (See for example, [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]].)

{{Further|Anti-discrimination laws}}
{{Further|Timeline of women's legal rights (other than voting)}}
Since [[World War II]], the [[women's liberation]] movement and [[feminism]] have created a general movement towards recognition of [[women's rights]]. The [[United Nations]] and other international agencies have adopted several conventions which promote gender equality. These conventions have not been uniformly adopted by all countries, and include:
* The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] was adopted in 1960, and came into force in 1962 and 1968.
* The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) was adopted in 1979 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. It has been described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, which came into force on 3 September 1981.
* The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], a [[human rights]] declaration adopted by consensus at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] on 25 June 1993 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. Women's rights are addressed at para 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | author-link = United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | title = Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action | url = http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=459d17822&amp;toid=459b17a82&amp;docid=3ae6b39ec&amp;skip=O | publisher = [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] | accessdate = 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1993.
* In 1994, the twenty-year ''Cairo Programme of Action'' was adopted at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]]. This [[Non-binding resolution|non binding]] programme-of-action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals' reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. As such, it called for [[family planning]], [[reproductive rights]] services, and strategies to promote gender equality and stop violence against women.
* Also in 1994, in the Americas, the [http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women], known as the ''Convention of Belém do Pará'', called for the end of violence and discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Organization of American States | author-link = Organization of American States | title = Follow-up Mechanism to the Belém do Pará Convention (MESECVI): About the Belém do Pará Convention | publisher = [[Organization of American States]] | url = http://www.oas.org/en/mesecvi/convention.asp | accessdate = 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the end of the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]], the UN adopted the [[Beijing Declaration]] on 15 September 1995 - a [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]] adopted to promulgate a set of principles concerning gender equality.
* The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]] (UNSRC 1325), which was adopted on 31 October 2000, deals with the rights and protection of women and girls during and after [[armed conflict]]s.
* The [[Maputo Protocol]] guarantees comprehensive rights to women, including the right to take part in the political process, to social and political equality with men, to control their [[reproductive health]], and an end to [[female genital cutting|female genital mutilation]]. It was adopted by the [[African Union]] in the form of a protocol to the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] and came into force in 2005.
* The EU [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] ''Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions'' states that: "Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of European Communities|last=|first=|date=9 February 1976|publisher=EUR-Lex Access to European Union law|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Convention of Belém do Pará and the Istanbul Convention: a response to violence against women worldwide | url = https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = [[Organization of American States]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Permanent Mission of France to the United Nations]] and Permanent Mission of Argentina to the United Nations | date = March 2014 }} CSW58 side event flyer 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; came into force in 2014.
* The [[Council of Europe]]'s ''Gender Equality Strategy 2014-2017'', which has five strategic objectives:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=2105977&amp;Site=COE&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383|title=Committee of Ministers - Gender Equality Commission (GEC) - Gender Equality Strategy 2014-2017 [1183 meeting]|author=Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, CM document (CM)|website=Wcd.coe.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Combating [[gender stereotypes]] and sexism
:*Preventing and combating [[violence against women]]
:*Guaranteeing Equal Access of Women to Justice
:*Achieving balanced participation of women and men in political and public decision-making
:*Achieving [[Gender mainstreaming|Gender Mainstreaming]] in all policies and measures

Such [[legislation]] and [[affirmative action]] policies have been critical to bringing changes in societal attitudes. A 2015 Pew Research Center survey of citizens in 38 countries found that majorities in 37 of those 38 countries said that gender equality is at least "somewhat important," and a global median of 65% believe it is "very important" that women have the same rights as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/08/strong-global-support-for-gender-equality-especially-among-women/|title=Strong global support for gender equality, especially among women|last=Zainulbhai|first=Hani|date=2016-03-08|website=Pew Research|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most occupations are now equally available to men and women, in many countries.{{Refn|For example, many countries now permit women to serve in the [[armed forces]], the [[police|police forces]] and to be [[fire fighter]]s – occupations traditionally reserved for men. Although these continue to have a male majority, an increasing number of women are now active, especially in directive fields such as politics, and occupy high positions in business.|group=lower-roman}}

Similarly, men are increasingly working in occupations which in previous generations had been considered [[women's work]], such as [[nursing]], [[Maid|cleaning]] and [[child care]]. In domestic situations, the role of [[Parenting]] or child rearing is more commonly shared or not as widely considered to be an exclusively female role, so that women may be free to pursue a [[career]] after [[childbirth]]. For further information, see [[Shared earning/shared parenting marriage]].

Another manifestation of the change in social attitudes is the [[Married and maiden names#Feminism and preserving one's personal name|non-automatic taking by a woman of her husband's surname on marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29804450|title=Why should women change their names on getting married?|last=Coulombeau|first=Sophie|date=1 November 2014|publisher=BBC|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly contentious issue relating to gender equality is the role of women in [[religious law|religiously orientated societies]].{{Refn|For example, [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam#Contents|the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] declared that women have equal dignity but not equal rights, and this was accepted by many predominantly Muslim countries.|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In some [[Christianity|Christian churches]], the practice of [[churching of women]] may still have elements of [[ritual purification]] and the [[Ordination of women]] to the priesthood may be restricted or forbidden.|group=lower-roman}} Some Christians or Muslims believe in [[Complementarianism]], a view that holds that men and women have different but complementing roles. This view may be in opposition to the views and goals of gender equality.

In addition, there are also non-Western countries of low religiosity where the contention surrounding gender equality remains. In China, a [[Sex-selective abortion and female infanticide#Cultural preference|cultural preference for a male child]] has resulted in a [[Missing women of Asia|shortfall of women]] in the population. [[Feminism in Japan|The feminist movement in Japan]] has made many strides which resulted in Rethe [[Gender Equality Bureau]], but Japan still remains low in gender equality compared to other industrialized nations.

The notion of gender equality, and of its degree of achievement in a certain country, is very complex because there are countries that have a history of a high level of gender equality in certain areas of life but not in other areas.{{Refn|An example is [[Finland]], which has offered very high opportunities to women in public/professional life but has had a weak legal approach to the issue of [[violence against women]], with the situation in this country having been called a [[paradox]].&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clarke | first = Kris | title = The paradoxical approach to intimate partner violence in Finland | journal = [[Tokiwa University#Publications|International Perspectives in Victimology]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–19 | doi = 10.5364/ipiv.6.1.19 | date = August 2011 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/83438809/paradoxical-approach-intimate-partner-violence-finland | ref = harv | postscript = .| doi-broken-date = 2018-08-27 }} [https://www.academia.edu/992154/The_Paradoxical_Approach_to_Intimate_Partner_Violence_in_Finland Available through academia.edu.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McKie |first1=Linda |last2=Hearn |first2=Jeff |title=Gender-neutrality and gender equality: comparing and contrasting policy responses to 'domestic violence' in Finland and Scotland |journal=[[Scottish Affairs]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=85–107 |doi=10.3366/scot.2004.0043 |date=August 2004 |ref=harv |postscript=. }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20131021023708/http://www.scottishaffairs.org/backiss/pdfs/sa48/sa48_McKie_and_Hearn.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;"Finland is repeatedly reminded of its widespread problem of violence against women and recommended to take more efficient measures to deal with the situation. International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937 but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 — making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995.

Not all beliefs relating to gender equality have been popularly adopted.

==Gender biases==
There has been criticism from some feminists towards the political discourse and policies employed in order to achieve the above items of "progress" in gender equality, with critics arguing that these gender equality strategies are superficial, in that they do not seek to challenge social structures of male domination, and only aim at improving the situation of women within the societal framework of subordination of women to men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/966913723|title=Man's dominion : religion and the eclipse of women's rights in world politics|last=Sheila|first=Jeffreys,|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9780415596732|location=|pages=94|oclc=966913723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that official public policies (such as state policies or international bodies policies) are questionable, as they are applied in a patriarchal context, and are directly or indirectly controlled by agents of a system which is for the most part male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=EU Gender Policy: Trapped in the 'Wollstonecraft Dilemma'?|first=Emanuela|last=Lombardo|date=1 May 2003|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=10|issue=2|pages=159–180|doi=10.1177/1350506803010002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the criticisms of the gender equality policies, in particular, those of the [[European Union]], is that they disproportionately focus on policies integrating women in public life, but do not seek to genuinely address the deep private sphere oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/647686058|title=Multiple meanings of gender equality : a critical frame analysis of gender policies in Europe|last=Lombardo|first=Emanuela|last2=Jalušiè|first2=Vlasta|last3=Maloutas|first3=Maro Pantelidou|last4=Sauer|first4=Birgit|date=|publisher=Central European University Press Budapest|year=2007|isbn=9786155211393|editor-last=Verloo|editor-first=Mike|location=New York|pages=79–108|chapter=III.

A further criticism is that a focus on the situation of women in non-Western countries, while often ignoring the issues that exist in the West, is a form of [[imperialism]] and of reinforcing Western moral superiority; and a way of "othering" of domestic violence, by presenting it as something specific to outsiders - the "violent others" - and not to the allegedly progressive Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/sp/article-abstract/20/4/534/1714604/The-Othering-of-Domestic-Violence-The-EU-and|title=The Othering of Domestic Violence: The EU and Cultural Framings of Violence against Women|first1=Celeste|last1=Montoya|first2=Lise|last2=Rolandsen Agustín|date=1 December 2013|journal=Soc Polit|volume=20|issue=4|pages=534–557|via=sp.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/sp/jxt020}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics point out that women in Western countries often face similar problems, such as domestic violence and rape, as in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316143234|title=An introduction to feminist philosophy|last=Alison|first=Stone|date=|publisher=Polity Press|year=2008|isbn=9780745638836|location=|pages=209–211|oclc=316143234}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also cite the fact that women faced de jure legal discrimination until just a few decades ago; for instance, in some Western countries such as Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and France, women obtained equal rights in [[family law]] in the 1980s.{{Refn|In Switzerland in 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450|title=Switzerland profile - Timeline|date=28 December 2016|website=Bbc.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html|title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology|first=Markus G.

==Efforts to fight inequality==
{{see also|Gender inequality}}
In 2010, the [[European Union]] opened the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]] to promote gender equality and to fight [[sex discrimination]]. In 2015 the EU published the Gender Action Plan 2016–2020.&lt;ref name="GAP2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=The European Union's new Gender Action Plan 2016–2020: gender equality and women's empowerment in external relations|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/10021-gender-equality-empowerment-eu-external-relations-gap-2016_2020|website=odi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender equality is part of the national curriculum in Great Britain and many other European countries. By presidential decree, the Republic of Kazakhstan created a Strategy for Gender Equality 2006–2016 to chart the subsequent decade of gender equality efforts.&lt;ref name="sgeinkz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy for Gender Equality in Kazakhstan 2006–2016|url=https://www.ndi.org/files/Kazakhstan-Gender-Strategy-2006-2016.pdf|website=NDI.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal, Social and Health Education]], [[Religious education|religious studies]] and [[Language acquisition]] curricula tend to address gender equality issues as a very serious topic for discussion and analysis of its effect in society.

A large and growing body of research has shown how gender inequality undermines health and development. To overcome gender inequality the [[United Nations Population Fund]] states that, "Women's empowerment and gender equality requires strategic interventions at all levels of programming and policy-making. These levels include reproductive health, economic empowerment, educational empowerment and political empowerment."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/engaging-men-and-boys-brief-summary-unfpa-experience-and-lessons-learned|title=Engaging Men and Boys: A Brief Summary of UNFPA Experience and Lessons Learned|last=|first=|date=2013|website=UNFPA: United Nations Population Fund|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Gender disparities in health}}
Social constructs of [[gender]] (that is, cultural ideals of socially acceptable [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]]) often have a negative effect on health. The World Health Organization cites the example of women not being allowed to travel alone outside the home (to go to the hospital), and women being prevented by cultural norms to ask their husbands to use a condom, in cultures which simultaneously encourage male promiscuity, as social norms that harm [[women's health]]. Teenage boys suffering accidents due to social expectations of impressing their peers through [[risk|risk taking]], and men dying at much higher rate from [[lung cancer]] due to [[smoking]], in cultures which link smoking to masculinity, are cited by the WHO as examples of gender norms negatively affecting [[men's health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/genderandhealth/en/|title=WHO: World Health Organization|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization has also stated that there is a strong connection between gender socialization and transmission and lack of adequate management of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Violence against women====
[[File:FGM road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Anti-[[FGM]] road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005]]
{{Main article|Violence against women}}
[[Violence against women]] is a technical term used to collectively refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women.{{Refn|Forms of violence against women include [[Sexual violence]] (including [[War Rape]], [[Marital rape]], [[Date rape]] by drugs or alcohol, and [[Child sexual abuse]], the latter often in the context of [[Child marriage]]), [[Domestic violence]], [[Forced marriage]], [[Female genital mutilation]], [[Forced prostitution]], [[Sex trafficking]], [[Honor killing]], [[Dowry killing]], [[Acid attacks]], [[Stoning]], [[Flogging]], [[Forced sterilisation]], [[Forced abortion]], violence related to accusations of witchcraft, mistreatment of widows (e.g. widow inheritance). Fighting against violence against women is considered a key issue for achieving gender equality. The Council of Europe adopted the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention).|group=lower-roman}} This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women expressly ''because'' they are women, or as a result of patriarchal gender constructs.{{Refn|The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] defines violence against women as "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life" and states that:"violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women|author=|publisher=United Nations General Assembly|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Violence and mistreatment of women in marriage has come to international attention during the past decades. This includes both violence committed inside marriage ([[domestic violence]]) as well as violence related to marriage customs and traditions (such as [[dowry]], [[bride price]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]]).

According to some theories, violence against women is often caused by the acceptance of violence by various cultural groups as a means of conflict resolution within intimate relationships. Studies on [[Intimate partner violence]] victimization among ethnic minorities in the United Studies have consistently revealed that immigrants are a high-risk group for intimate violence.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, Ronet (January 1994).&amp;nbsp;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/digitization/145325ncjrs.pdf Violence Against Women: A National Crime Victimization Survey Report]&amp;nbsp;(PDF)(Report).

In countries where gang murders, armed kidnappings, civil unrest, and other similar acts are rare, the vast majority of murdered women are killed by partners/ex-partners.{{Refn|As of 2004–2009, former and current partners were responsible for more than 80% of all cases of [[femicide|murders of women]] in [[Cyprus]], [[France]], and [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-14.pdf|title=Femicide: A Global Problem|last=|first=|date=February 2012|website=Small Arms Survey|publisher=Research Notes: Armed Violence|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} By contrast, in countries with a high level of organized criminal activity and gang violence, murders of women are more likely to occur in a public sphere, often in a general climate of indifference and impunity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, many countries do not have adequate comprehensive data collection on such murders, aggravating the problem.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In some parts of the world, various forms of violence against women are tolerated and accepted as parts of everyday life.{{Refn|According to UNFPA:&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm|title=Gender equality|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, it is only in more recent decades that domestic violence against women has received significant legal attention. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring this form of violence.{{Refn|In its [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm explanatory report] at para 219, it states:

In some cultures, acts of violence against women are seen as crimes against the male 'owners' of the woman, such as husband, father or male relatives, rather the woman herself. This leads to practices where men inflict violence upon women in order to get revenge on male members of the women's family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf|title=Supplement to the Handbook for Legislation on Violence Against Women: Harmful Practices Against Women|last=|first=|date=2012|website=UN Women|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices include [[Types of rape#Payback rape|payback rape]], a form of rape specific to certain cultures, particularly the [[Pacific Islands]], which consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers, with the rape being meant to humiliate the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behavior towards the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://waaiabulletin.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/png_activist_toolkit_16_days_2009_-_iwd_2010.pdf|title=Many Voices One Message: Stop Violence Against Women in PNG|last=|first=|date=2009–2010|website=Activist Toolkit, Amnesty International|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard A.

Posner, page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, rape was seen in many cultures (and is still seen today in some societies) as a crime against the [[Family honor|honor of the family]], rather than against the self-determination of the woman. As a result, victims of rape may face violence, in extreme cases even honor killings, at the hands of their family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml|title=Ethics: Honour crimes |website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895|title=Libya rape victims 'face honour killings'|website=BBC News|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that in male dominated societies, sexual intercourse is imposed on women in a coercive and unequal way, creating a continuum of victimization, where women have few positive sexual experiences.{{Refn|She writes "To know what is wrong with rape, know what is right about sex. If this, in turn, is difficult, the difficulty is as instructive as the difficulty men have in telling the difference when women see one. Perhaps the wrong of rape has proved so difficult to define because the unquestionable starting point has been that rape is defined as distinct from intercourse, while for women it is difficult to distinguish the two under conditions of male dominance."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'', by Catharine A.

The importance of women having the right and possibility to have control over their body, reproduction decisions, and sexuality, and the need for gender equality in order to achieve these goals are recognized as crucial by the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing and the UN [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action.

But in spite of these gains, almost 800 women still die every day from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. This is about one woman every two minutes."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/maternal-health|title=Maternal health: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNFPA:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

:"Preventable maternal mortality occurs where there is a failure to give effect to the rights of women to health, equality, and non-discrimination. Preventable maternal mortality also often represents a violation of a woman’s right to life."|group=lower-roman}}

The right to reproductive and sexual autonomy is denied to women in many parts of the world, through practices such as [[forced sterilization]], forced/coerced sexual partnering (e.g. [[forced marriage]], [[child marriage]]), criminalization of consensual sexual acts (such as [[sex outside marriage]]), lack of criminalization of [[marital rape]], violence in regard to the choice of partner ([[honor killings]] as punishment for 'inappropriate' relations).{{Refn|Amnesty International’s Secretary General has stated that: "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity – even punishable by death."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06|title=Sexual and reproductive rights under threat worldwide|publisher=Amnesty International|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} The sexual health of women is often poor in societies where a woman's right to control her sexuality is not recognized.{{Refn|High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]] has called for full respect and recognition of women's autonomy and sexual and reproductive health rights, stating:

:"Violations of women's human rights are often linked to their sexuality and reproductive role. Women are frequently treated as property, they are sold into marriage, into trafficking, into sexual slavery. Violence against women frequently takes the form of sexual violence. Victims of such violence are often accused of promiscuity and held responsible for their fate, while infertile women are rejected by husbands, families, and communities. In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf|title=Valuing Women as Autonomous Beings: Women's sexual and reproductive rights|last=Pillay|first=Navi|date=May 15, 2012|website=University of Pretoria, Centre for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These practices infringe on the right of achieving reproductive and sexual health.|group=lower-roman}}

[[Adolescent]] girls have the highest risk of sexual coercion, sexual ill health, and negative reproductive outcomes. The risks they face are higher than those of boys and men; this increased risk is partly due to gender inequity (different socialization of boys and girls, gender based violence, child marriage) and partly due to biological factors.{{Refn|Females' risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of males'.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents|title=Giving Special Attention to Girls and Adolescents|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

=====Family planning and abortion=====
[[File:Familiy Planning Ethiopia (bad effects).jpg|thumb|Placard showing negative effects of lack of family planning and having too many [[child]]ren and [[infant]]s ([[Ethiopia]])]]
[[File:Familyplanningmalaysia.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A family planning facility in Kuala Terengganu, [[Malaysia]]]]
[[Family planning]] is the practice of freely deciding the number of children one has and the intervals between their births, particularly by means of contraception or voluntary sterilization. Abortion is the induced termination of pregnancy. [[Abortion law]]s vary significantly by country. The availability of contraception, sterilization and abortion is dependent on laws, as well as social, cultural and religious norms. Some countries have liberal laws regarding these issues, but in practice it is very difficult to access such services due to doctors, pharmacists and other social and medical workers being [[conscientious objector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages|title=Seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out abortions|first1=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Pamela|last1=Duncan|first2=Alberto|last2=Nardelli|first3=Delphine|last3=Robineau|date=11 March 2016|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017|title=Doctors' Refusal to Perform Abortions Divides Croatia |website=Balkan Insight |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family planning is particularly important from a women's rights perspective, as having very many pregnancies, especially in areas where malnutrition is present, can seriously endanger women's health. UNFA writes that "Family planning is central to gender equality and women’s empowerment, and it is a key factor in reducing poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/family-planning|title=Family planning: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family planning is often opposed by governments who have strong [[natalist]] policies. During the 20th century, such examples have included the aggressive natalist policies from [[communist Romania]] and [[communist Albania]]. State mandated [[forced marriage]] was also practiced by some authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf |format=PDF|author=Natalae Anderson|title=Documentation Center of Cambodia, ''Memorandum: Charging Forced Marriage as a Crime Against Humanity,''|date=September 22, 2010|website=D.dccam.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the [[one child policy]] of China (1979–2015) included punishments for families with more than one child and [[forced abortion]]s. Some governments have sought to prevent certain ethnic or social groups from reproduction. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2148793.stm|title=Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru|date=24 July 2002|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investigation and prosecution of crimes against women and girls====
Human rights organizations have expressed concern about the legal [[impunity]] of perpetrators of crimes against women, with such crimes being often ignored by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/ImpunityForVAWGlobalConcern.aspx|title=Impunity for violence against women is a global concern|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case with murders of women in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/ngos/CDDandCMDPDH_forthesession_Mexico_CEDAW52.pdf|format=PDF|title=Femicide and Impunity in Mexico: A context of structural and genearlized violence|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2013/4/femicide-in-latin-america|title=Femicide in Latin America|website=Unwomen.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgrs.uchastings.edu/our-work/central-america-femicides-and-gender-based-violence|title=Central America: Femicides and Gender-Based Violence|website=Cgrs.uchastings.edu|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there is impunity in regard to [[domestic violence]].{{Refn|High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Navi Pillay]], has stated on domestic violence against women: "The reality for most victims, including victims of honor killings, is that state institutions fail them and that most perpetrators of domestic violence can rely on a culture of impunity for the acts they commit – acts which would often be considered as crimes, and be punished as such, if they were committed against strangers."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9869&amp;LangID=E|title=High Commissioner speaks out against domestic violence and "honour killing" on occasion of International Women's Day"|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

Women are often, in law or in practice, unable to access legal institutions. UN Women has said that: "Too often, justice institutions, including the police and the courts, deny women justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progress.unwomen.org/|title=Progress of the World's Women 2015–2016|website=My Favorite News|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, women are denied legal recourse because the state institutions themselves are structured and operate in ways incompatible with genuine justice for women who experience violence.{{Refn|According to Amnesty International, "Women who are victims of gender-related violence often have little recourse because many state agencies are themselves guilty of gender bias and discriminatory practices."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|title=Violence Against Women Information|website=Amnesty International USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

====Harmful traditional practices====
[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]
[[File:FGM prevalence UNICEF 2013.svg|right|thumb|Prevalence of FGM by country, according to a 2013 UNICEF report&lt;ref name="childinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.unicef.org/child-protection/fgmc|title=Prevalence of FGM/C|last=|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=18 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715233215/http://data.unicef.org/child-protection/fgmc|archivedate=15 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
"Harmful traditional practices" refer to forms of violence which are committed in certain communities often enough to become cultural practice, and accepted for that reason. Young women are the main victims of such acts, although men can be affected.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbv.scot.nhs.uk/gbv/harmful-traditional-practices|title=National Gender Based Violence &amp; Health Programme|website=Gbv.scot.nhs.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occur in an environment where women and girls have unequal rights and opportunities.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet23en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fact Sheet No.23, Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These practices include, according to the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]:&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

{{Quote|[[female genital mutilation]] (FGM); forced feeding of women; early marriage; the various taboos or practices which prevent women from controlling their own fertility; nutritional taboos and traditional birth practices; son preference and its implications for the status of the girl child; female infanticide; early pregnancy; and dowry price}}

Son preference refers to a cultural preference for sons over daughters, and manifests itself through practices such as sex selective abortion; female infanticide; or abandonment, neglect or abuse of girl-children.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

Abuses regarding nutrition are taboos in regard to certain foods, which result in poor nutrition of women, and may endanger their health, especially if pregnant.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

The [[caste system in India]] which leads to [[untouchability]] (the practice of ostracizing a group by segregating them from the mainstream society) often interacts with gender discrimination, leading to a double discrimination faced by [[Dalit]] women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/chrgj-hrw.pdf|format=PDF|title=CASTE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST DALITS OR SO-CALLED UNTOUCHABLES IN INDIA|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 survey, 27% of Indians admitted to practicing untouchability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/one-in-four-indians-admit-to-practising-untouchability-biggest-caste-survey/|title=Biggest caste survey: One in four Indians admit to practising untouchability|date=29 November 2014|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional customs regarding birth sometimes endanger the mothers. Births in parts of Africa are often attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who sometimes perform rituals that are dangerous to the health of the mother. In many societies, a difficult labour is believed to be a divine punishment for marital infidelity, and such women face abuse and are pressured to "confess" to the infidelity.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

Tribal traditions can be harmful to males; for instance, the [[Satere-Mawe]] tribe use [[bullet ant]]s as an [[initiation rite]]. Men must wear gloves with hundreds of bullet ants woven in for ten minutes: the ants' stings cause severe pain and paralysis. This experience must be completed twenty times for boys to be considered "warriors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/travel/Holidays/Wildlife/article77936.ece|title=Bitten by the Amazon|last=Backshall|first=Steve|date=6 January 2008|publisher=The Sunday Times|location=London|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other harmful traditional practices include [[marriage by abduction]], ritualized [[sexual slavery]] ([[Devadasi]], [[Trokosi]]), [[breast ironing]] and [[widow inheritance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T-Anth/Anth-13-0-000-11-Web/Anth-13-2-000-11-Abst-Pdf/Anth-13-2-121-11-720-Wadesango-N/Anth-13-2-121-11-720-Wadesango-N-Tt.pdf|format=PDF|title=Violation of Women's Rights by Harmful Traditional Practices|author1=Newman Wadesango|author2= Symphorosa Rembe|author3=Owence Chabaya|website=Krepublishers.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/elim-disc-viol-girlchild/ExpertPapers/EP.4%20%20%20Raswork.pdf|format=PDF|title=The impact of harmful traditional practices on the girl child|website=Un.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CEDAW/HarmfulPractices/GenderEmpowermentandDevelopment.pdf|format=PDF|title=Breast Ironing...

=====Female genital mutilation=====
[[File:Campaign_road_sign_against_female_genital_mutilation_(cropped)_2.jpg|thumb|left|Road sign near [[Kapchorwa]], [[Uganda]], 2004]]
[[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]] regard the practice of [[female genital mutilation]] as "a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality. It persists for many reasons. In some societies, for example, it is considered a rite of passage. In others, it is seen as a prerequisite for marriage. In some communities – whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim – the practice may even be attributed to religious beliefs." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/female-genital-mutilation|title=Female genital mutilation: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 125 million women and girls living today have undergone FGM in the 29 countries where data exist. Of these, about half live in Egypt and Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/unfpa-unicef-joint-programme-female-genital-mutilationcutting-accelerating-change|title=UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Accelerating Change|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly carried out on girls between infancy and 15 years old.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional" /&gt;

=====Forced marriage=====
[[File:Girl Summit - 22nd July in London (14498368279).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Poster against child and forced marriage]]
{{Main|Forced marriage}}
Early marriage, child marriage or [[forced marriage]] is prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa. The majority of victims seeking advice are female and aged between 18 and 23.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional" /&gt; Such marriages can have harmful effects on a girl's education and development, and may expose girls to social isolation or abuse.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58008.html|title=Child marriage|date=22 October 2014|website=UNICEF|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/topic/womens-rights/child-marriage|title=Child Marriage|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 UN Resolution on Child, Early and Forced Marriage calls for an end to the practice, and states that "Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates abuses, or impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other harmful practices and human rights violations, that these violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/events/2014/child_marriage.pdf?ua=1|format=PDF|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly : 69/XX. Child, Early and Forced Marriage|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a near-universal commitment by governments to end child marriage, "one in three girls in developing countries (excluding China) will probably be married before they are 18."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/end-child-marriage|title=End Child Marriage|website = UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNFPA]] states that, "over 67 million women 20–24 year old in 2010 had been married as girls. Half were in Asia, one-fifth in Africa. In the next decade 14.2 million girls under 18 will be married every year; this translates into 39,000 girls married each day. This will rise to an average of 15.1 million girls a year, starting in 2021 until 2030, if present trends continue."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org2" /&gt;

=====Bride price=====
{{Main|Bride price}}
[[Bride price]] (also called bridewealth or bride token) is money, property, or other form of wealth paid by a groom or his family to the parents of the bride. This custom often leads to women having reduced ability to control their fertility. For instance, in northern Ghana, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face threats, violence and reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women's Fears and Men's Anxieties : The Impact of Family Planning on Gender Relations in Northern Ghana|website=Popcouncil.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of bride price has been criticized as contributing to the mistreatment of women in marriage, and preventing them from leaving abusive marriages. [[UN Women]] recommended its abolition, and stated that: "Legislation should [...] State that divorce shall not be contingent upon the return of bride price but such provisions shall not be interpreted to limit women’s right to divorce; State that a perpetrator of [[domestic violence]], including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The custom of bride price can also curtail the free movement of women: if a wife wants to leave her husband, he may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the woman's family; and the woman's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back, making it difficult for women to move out of violent husbands' homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality Now (2007) Protecting the girl child: Using the law to end child, early and forced marriage and related human rights violations|url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf|format=PDF|website=Equalitynow.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lelieveld, M.|date=2011|title=Child protection in the Somali region of Ethiopia.

====Gendered arrangements of work and care====

Since the 1950s, social scientists as well as feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work and care and the male breadwinner role. Policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers as a tool of changing gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=|first2=|year=2014|title=Changing men, changing times; fathers and sons from an experimental gender equality study|url=http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Changing-men-changing-times-fathers-and-sons-from-an-experimental-gender-equality-study.pdf|format=PDF|journal=[[The Sociological Review]]|volume=62|issue=2|pages=295–315|doi=10.1111/1467-954X.12156|last1=Bjørnholt|first1=M.|authorlink1=Margunn Bjørnholt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western countries with a strong emphasis on women fulfilling the role of homemakers, rather than a professional role, include parts of German speaking Europe (i.e. parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland); as well as the Netherlands and Ireland.{{Refn|In 2011, [[Jose Manuel Barroso]], then president of the [[European Commission]], stated "Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries [...] that means removing obstacles for women, older workers, foreigners and low-skilled job-seekers to get into the workforce".&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-persistently-low-birthrate-gets-marginal-boost/a-15325123-0|title=Germany's persistently low birthrate gets marginal boost |date=18 August 2011 |website=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|The Netherlands and Ireland are among the last Western countries to accept women as professionals; despite the Netherlands having an image as progressive on gender issues, women in the Netherlands work less in paid employment than women in other comparable Western countries.

A key issue towards insuring gender equality in the workplace is the respecting of [[maternity rights]] and [[reproductive rights]] of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=a40b96ed-8bf4-4db1-9ceb-71ca2d6fada4 |title=Modern workplaces, maternity rights, and gender equality  |accessdate=2016-04-26 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509134200/http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Modern-Workplaces-Policy-Position-November-2012.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-09 |publisher = Fawcett Society |date = November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different countries have different rules regarding [[maternity leave]], paternity leave and [[parental leave]].{{Refn|In the [[European Union]] (EU) the policies vary significantly by country, but the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the [[Pregnant Workers Directive]] and [[Parental Leave Directive]].&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/rights/work-life-balance/index_en.htm|title=Professional, private and family life – European Commission|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Another important issue is ensuring that employed women are not ''[[de jure]]'' or ''[[de facto]]'' prevented from having a child.{{Refn|For example, some countries have enacted legislation explicitly outlawing or restricting what they view as abusive clauses in [[employment contract]]s regarding reproductive rights (such as clauses which stipulate that a woman cannot get pregnant during a specified time) rendering such contracts [[void (law)|void]] or [[voidable]].&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160509070119/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/file?uuid=d01c336a-95bd-4b7d-b291-59623c7918be&amp;owner=8318a38b-02db-4343-8ee4-c81474278688]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In some countries, employers ask women to sign formal or informal documents stipulating that they will not get pregnant or face legal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite web|title=Law n. 202/2002, Art. 10 (4) and Art. 37|url=http://www.dreptonline.ro/legislatie/legea_egalitatii_sanse_femei.php|website=Romanian Law Online|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often face severe violations of their reproductive rights at the hands of their employers; and the [[International Labour Organization]] classifies [[forced abortion]] coerced by the employer as [[Exploitation of labour|labour exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@ed_norm/@declaration/documents/publication/wcms_105035.pdf|title=Details of indicators for labour exploitation|website=Ilo.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|Being the victim of a forced abortion compelled by the employer was ruled a ground of obtaining [[political asylum]] in the US.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6729339.stm|title=US asylum rule on forced abortion|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Other abuses include routine [[virginity test]]s of unmarried employed women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/hrw-calls-on-indonesia-to-scrap-virginity-tests-for-female-police/a-18082547|title=HRW calls on Indonesia to scrap 'virginity tests' for female police|website=Dw.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igfm-muenchen.de/tibet/Phayul/2006/TWA-CEDAWReport_Aug2006_form.pdf|format=PDF|title=THE CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW)|website=Igfm-muenchen.de|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freedom of movement====
[[File:Group of Women Wearing Burkas.jpg|thumb|Women in [[Afghanistan]] wearing [[burqa]]s. Some clothes that women are required to wear, by law or custom, can restrict their movements]]
{{Further|Freedom of movement}}
The degree to which women can participate (in law and in practice) in public life varies by culture and socioeconomic characteristics. [[Seclusion]] of women within the home was a common practice among the [[upper classes]] of many societies, and this still remains the case today in some societies. Before the 20th century it was also common in parts of Southern Europe, such as much of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberating Women's History:Theoretical and Critical Essays'', edited by Berenice A. Carroll, pp. 161–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's [[freedom of movement]] continues to be legally restricted in some parts of the world. This restriction is often due to [[marriage laws]].{{Refn|For instance, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations stipulate that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref name="www2.ohchr.org" group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf|title=Yemen's Dark Side: Discrimination and violence against women and girls.|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In some countries, women must legally be accompanied by their male guardians (such as the husband or male relative) when they leave home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24691034|title=Why can't women drive in Saudi Arabia?|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 June 2015|date = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) states at Article 15 (4) that:
{{Quote|4. States Parties shall accord to men and women the same rights with regard to the law relating to the movement of persons and the freedom to choose their residence and domicile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |title=CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003 |publisher= |accessdate=14 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to laws, women's freedom of movement is also restricted by social and religious norms.{{Refn|For example, [[purdah]], a religious and social practice of female seclusion prevalent among some Muslim communities in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] as well as upper-caste Hindus in [[North India|Northern India]], such as the [[Rajputs]], which often leads to the minimizing of the movement of women in public spaces and restrictions on their social and professional interactions;&lt;ref name=Papanek group=upper-roman&gt;Papanek, Hanna.

====Girls' access to education====
[[File:Girls lining up for class - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|School girls in [[Gaza Strip]]]]
{{Main article|Female education|Gender and education}}
In many parts of the world, girls' access to education is very restricted. In developing parts of the world women are often denied opportunities for education as girls and women face many obstacles. These include: early and forced marriages; early pregnancy; prejudice based on gender stereotypes at home, at school and in the community; violence on the way to school, or in and around schools; long distances to schools; vulnerability to the HIV epidemic; school fees, which often lead to parents sending only their sons to school; lack of gender sensitive approaches and materials in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/12978|title=Global issues affecting women and girls |website=National Union of Teachers|accessdate=14 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429020903/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/12978|archivedate=29 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignforeducationusa.org/obstacles-to-education-for-girls-and-women|title=Global Campaign For Education United States Chapter|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plan-international.org/files/Africa/progress-and-obstacles-to-girls-education-in-africa|title=Progress and Obstacles to Girls' Education in Africa|website=Plan International|date = 16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[OHCHR]], there have been multiple attacks on schools worldwide during the period 2009–2014 with "a number of these attacks being specifically directed at girls, parents and teachers advocating for gender equality in education".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15555&amp;LangID=E|title=Attacks against girls' education occurring with "increasing regularity" – UN human rights report|last=|first=|date=9 February 2015|website=Ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality|title=Gender equality|website=[[United Nations Population Fund]]|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|About two thirds of the world's [[Literacy#Gender disparities|illiterate]] adults are women. Lack of an education severely restricts a woman's access to information and opportunities. Conversely, increasing women's and girls' educational attainment benefits both individuals and future generations. Higher levels of women's education are strongly associated with lower infant mortality and lower fertility, as well as better outcomes for their children.}}

The legal and social treatment of married women has been often discussed as a political issue from the 19th century onwards.{{Refn|[[John Stuart Mill]], in ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869) compared marriage to [[slavery]] and wrote that: "The law of servitude in marriage is a monstrous contradiction to all the principles of the modern world, and to all the experience through which those principles have been slowly and painfully worked out."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/1869/subjection-women/ch04.htm|title=The Subjection of Women by John Stuart Mill|website=Marxists.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In 1957, James Everett, then Minister for Justice in Ireland, stated: "The progress of organised society is judged by the status occupied by married women".&lt;ref name=Oireachtas group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad1957011600008?opendocument |title= Married Women's Status Bill, 1956—Second Stage: Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) |website= [[Houses of the Oireachtas|Oireachtas]] |date= 16 January 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Until the 1970s, legal subordination of married women was common across European countries, through [[marriage laws]] giving legal authority to the husband, as well as through [[marriage bar]]s.{{Refn|In France, married women obtained the right to work without their husband's consent in 1965;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092212/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children); and a new reform in 1985 abolished the stipulation that the father had the sole power to administer the children's property.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/France-Parental-Responsibilities.pdf|title=National Report: France|website=Ceflonline.net|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In [[Austria]], the marriage law was overhauled between 1975 and 1983, abolishing the restrictions on married women's right to work outside the home, providing for equality between spouses, and for joint ownership of property and assets.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;''Women and Politics in Contemporary Ireland: From the Margins to the Mainstream'', by Yvonne Galligan, pp.90&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In 1978, the [[Council of Europe]] passed the ''Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RESOLUTION   (78)  37 ON   EQUALITY   OF   SPOUSES  IN   CIVIL   LAW|url=https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=596422&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=662346&amp;Usage=2|publisher=Council of Europe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121025014/https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=596422&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=662346&amp;Usage=2|archivedate=21 January 2016|date=27  September  1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]] was one of the last countries in Europe to establish gender equality in marriage, in this country married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing for gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a [[Voting in Switzerland|referendum]], who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/23/world/swiss-grant-women-equal-marriage-rights.html|title=SWISS GRANT WOMEN EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS|date=23 September 1985|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450|title=Switzerland Profile: Timeline|website=BBC News|date = 21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html|title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology|author=Markus G.

==== Political Gender Equality ====
Two recent movements in countries with large Kurdish populations have implemented political gender equality. One has been the Kurdish movement in southeastern Turkey led by the [[Democratic Regions Party]] (DBP) and the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP),&lt;!-- The apostrophe is correctly placed. The party is pro-minority, and the name is also translated as Democratic Party of the People{{uu|s}} --&gt; from 2006 or before.
The mayorships of 2 metropolitan areas and 97 towns{{citation needed|date=January 2018|reason= The citation was to [[Turkish local elections, 2014]]. See [[WP:CIRC]] and [[Talk:Gender equality#new section Political Gender Equality|Political Gender Equality]].}} are led jointly by a man and a woman, both called co-mayors. Party offices are also led by a man and a woman. Local councils were formed, which also had to be co-presided over by a man and a woman together. However, in November 2016 the Turkish government cracked down on the HDP, jailing ten of its members of Parliament, including the party's male and female co-leaders.&lt;ref name=Nordland&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/world/middleeast/turkey-kurds-womens-rights.html |title=Crackdown in Turkey Threatens a Haven of Gender Equality Built by Kurds |last=Nordland |first=Rod| date=2016-12-07|work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See|Gender role}}
Gender [[stereotype]]s arise from the socially approved roles of women and men in the private or public sphere, at home or in the workplace. In the household, women are typically seen as mother figures, which usually places them into a typical classification of being "supportive" or "nurturing". Women are expected to want to take on the role of a mother and take on primary responsibility for household needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Voices and Feminist Visions|last=Shaw and Lee|first=Susan and Janet|year=|isbn=|location=|page=450|quote="Women are expected to want to be mothers"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their male counterparts are seen as being "assertive" or "ambitious" as men are usually seen in the workplace or as the primary breadwinner for his family.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geteverwise.com/human-resources/how-does-gender-bias-really-affect-women-in-the-workplace/|title=How Does Gender Bias Really Affect Women in the Workplace?|date=2016-03-24|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these views and expectations, women often face discrimination in the public sphere, such as the workplace.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A [[gender role]] is a set of societal [[norm (social)|norms]] dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their sex. Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]], although there are [[Third gender|exceptions]] and [[genderqueer|variations]].

====Portrayal of women in the media====
{{Main article|Exploitation of women in mass media}}
The way women are represented in the media has been criticized as perpetuating negative gender stereotypes. The [[exploitation of women in mass media]] refers to the criticisms that are levied against the use or objectification of women in the [[mass media]], when such use or portrayal aims at increasing the appeal of media or a product, to the detriment of, or without regard to, the interests of the women portrayed, or women in general. Concerns include the fact that all forms of media have the power to shape the population's perceptions and portray images of unrealistic stereotypical perceptions by portraying women either as submissive housewives or as sex objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/474442/IPOL-FEMM_ET%282013%29474442_EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women and Girls as Subjects of Media's Attention and Advertisement Campaigns : The Situation in Europe, Best Practices and Legislations|website=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media emphasizes traditional domestic or sexual roles that normalize violence against women. The vast array of studies that have been conducted on the issue of the portrayal of women in the media have shown that women are often portrayed as irrational, fragile, not intelligent, submissive and
subservient to men.&lt;ref name="Acevedo 2010"&gt;Acevedo et all. 2010. 'A Content Analysis of the Roles Portrayed by Women in Commercials: 1973 – 2008', Revista Brasileira de Marketing Vol. 9. Universidade Nove de Julho, Sao Paulo.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that stereotyped images such as these have been shown to negatively impact on the mental health of many female viewers who feel bound by these roles, causing amongst other problems, self-esteem issues, depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Acevedo 2010"/&gt;

According to a study, the way women are often portrayed by the media can lead to:  "Women of average or normal appearance feeling inadequate or less beautiful in comparison to the overwhelming use of extraordinarily attractive women"; "Increase in the likelihood and acceptance of sexual violence"; "Unrealistic expectations by men of how women should look or behave"; "Psychological disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia, bulimia and so on"; "The importance of physical appearance is emphasized and reinforced early in most girls' development." Studies have found that nearly half of females ages 6–8 have stated they want to be slimmer. (Striegel-Moore &amp; Franko, 2002)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|title=The Myriad: Westminster's Interactive Academic Journal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172944/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|archivedate=2016-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gretchen-kelly/the-thing-all-women-do-you-dont-know-about_b_8630416.html|title=The Thing All Women Do That You Don't Know About|author=Gretchen Kelly|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Informing women of their rights====
While in many countries, the problem lies in the lack of adequate legislation, in others the principal problem is not as much the lack of a legal framework, but the fact is that most women do not know their legal rights. This is especially the case as many of the laws dealing with women's rights are of recent date.

====Gender mainstreaming====
{{Main article|Gender mainstreaming}}
Gender mainstreaming is described as the [[public policy]] of assessing the different implications for women and men of any planned [[policy]] action, including [[legislation]] and [[Program (management)|programmes]], in all areas and levels, with the aim of achieving gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, C. and Bennett, (2002) "Gender Mainstreaming in the European Union", ''European Journal of Women's Studies'' 9 (4): 430–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/gender/newsite2002/about/defin.htm|title=Definition of Gender Mainstreaming|website=International Labor Organization|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The idea has been developed in the [[United Nations]] development community.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20010708124202/http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/papers/00/000201-03.html II. The Origins of Gender Mainstreaming in the EU]", ''[http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/ Academy of European Law online]''&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming "involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/gendermainstreaming.htm|title=Gender Mainstreaming|website=UN Women|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Council of Europe definition: "Gender mainstreaming is the (re)organization, improvement, development and evaluation of policy processes, so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all policies at all levels and at all stages, by the actors normally involved in policy-making."&lt;ref name="coe.int"/&gt;

An integrated gender mainstreaming approach is "the attempt to form alliances and common platforms that bring together the power of faith and gender-equality aspirations to advance human rights."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/gender-heart-icpd|title=Gender at the Heart of ICPD: The UNFPA Strategic Framework on Gender Mainstreaming and Women's Empowerment |website=United Nations Population Fund|date = 2011|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "in Azerbaijan, [[UNFPA]] conducted a study on gender equality by comparing the text of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women with some widely recognized Islamic references and resources. The results reflect the parallels between the Convention and many tenets of Islamic scripture and practice. The study showcased specific issues, including VAW, child marriage, respect for the dignity of women, and equality in the economic and political participation of women. The study was later used to produce training materials geared towards sensitizing religious leaders."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org3"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21686">'''German studies''' is the field of [[humanities]] that researches, documents, and disseminates [[German language]] and [[German literature|literature]] in both its historic and present forms. Academic departments of German studies often include classes on [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], [[German history]], and [[German politics]] in addition to the language and literature component. Common German names for the field are {{lang|de|Germanistik}}, {{lang|de|Deutsche Philologie}}, and {{lang|de|Deutsche Sprachwissenschaft und Literaturwissenschaft}}. In English the terms '''Germanistics''' or '''Germanics''' are sometimes used (mostly by Germans), but the subject is more often referred to as ''German studies'', ''German language and literature'', or ''German philology''.

Modern German studies is usually seen as a combination of two sub-disciplines:  German linguistics and Germanophone literature studies.

==German linguistics==

German linguistics is traditionally called [[philology]] in Germany, as there is something of a difference between philologists and linguists{{vague|date=September 2012}}. It is roughly divided as follows:
* [[Old High German]] (''Althochdeutsch'') 8th – 11th centuries
* [[Middle High German]] (''Mittelhochdeutsch'') 11th – 14th centuries
* [[Early New High German]] (''Frühneuhochdeutsch'') 14th – 17th centuries
* [[Modern German]] ([[Standard German]], [[German dialectology]]) 18th – 21st centuries

In addition, the discipline examines German under various aspects: the way it is spoken and written, i.e., spelling; declination; vocabulary; sentence structure; texts; etc. It compares the various manifestations such as social groupings (slang, written texts, etc.) and geographical groupings (dialects, etc.).

==German literature studies==

The study [[German literature]] is divided into two parts: {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ''Ältere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft'' deals with the period from the beginnings of German in the early Middle Ages up to post-Medieval times around AD 1750, while the modern era is covered by ''Neuere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft''. The field systematically examines German literature in terms of [[genre]], [[wikt:form|form]], [[Content (media and publishing)|content]], and [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s as well as looking at it historically by author and epoch.  Important areas include [[edition philology]], [[history of literature]], and [[textual interpretation]].  The relationships of German literature to the literatures of other languages (e.g. reception and mutual influences) and historical contexts are also important areas of concentration. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory: Fourth Edition'' ({{ISBN|0-14-051363-9}}) is printed in English but contains many [[German-language]] literary terms that apply cross-culturally in the field of [[literary criticism]]; quite a few of the in terms in the book originated in German but have since been adopted by [[English-language]] critics and scholars.

== German teacher education ==
At least in Germany and Austria, German studies in academia play a central role in the education of German school teachers. Their courses usually cover four fields:&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the left navigation at the web page of one of the [[Cologne University]] German studies institutes at http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Linguistics]] of [[German language|German]] (''{{lang|de|Sprachwissenschaft}}'')
* German language and literature of up to about 1750 (''{{lang|de|Ältere Sprache und Literatur}}'')
* German language and literature since approximately 1750 (''{{lang|de|Neuere Literaturwissenschaft}}'')
* Specifics of the [[didactics]] of teaching German (''{{lang|de|Fachdidaktik}}'')
Several universities offer specialized curriculae for school teachers, usually called "''{{lang|de|Deutsch (Lehramt)}}''". In Germany, they are leading to a two step exam and certificate by the [[federal states of Germany]] cultural authorities, called the ''{{lang|de|[[Staatsexamen]]}}'' ("state exam").

==German media studies==
In recent years{{when|date=September 2012}}, German{{who|date=September 2012}} has looked for links with the fields of [[communication]]s, [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]].  In addition, the sub-branch of [[film studies]] has established itself.

==History==

As an unsystematic field of interest for individual scholars, German studies can be traced back to [[Tacitus]]' ''Germania''. The publication and study of legal and historical source material, such as Medieval [[Bible]] translations, were all undertaken during the [[German Renaissance]] of the sixteenth century, truly initiating the field of German studies.  As an independent university subject, German studies was introduced at the beginning of the nineteenth century by  [[Georg Friedrich Benecke]], the [[Brothers Grimm]], and [[Karl Lachmann]].

'''Global intellectual history''' is the history of thought in the world across the span of human history, from the [[invention of writing]] to the present. For information about the methodology of [[intellectual history]], please see the [[intellectual history|relevant article]].

In recent years, historians such as [[Christopher Bayly|C. A. Bayly]] have been calling for a ''global intellectual history'' to be written. They stress that to understand the history of ideas across time and space, it is necessary to study from a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] or global point of view the connections and the parallels in intellectual development across the world. Yet these separate histories and their convergence in the modern period have yet to be brought together into a single historical narrative. Nonetheless, some global histories, like Bayly's own ''Birth of the Modern World'' or [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]]'s ''The Declaration of Independence: A Global History'' offer contributions to the huge and necessarily collaborative project of writing the history of thought in a comparative and especially connective way. Other examples of transnational intellectual histories include [[Albert Hourani]]'s ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age''.

The origins of human intellectual history arguably began before the [[invention of writing]], but historians are by definition only concerned with the eras in which writing was present. In the spirit of a historiographic project that is relevant to all human beings and that has yet to be completed, the sections that follow briefly review currents of thought in pre-modern and modern history of the world, and are organized by geographic area (and within each section, chronologically).

==Europe and the Americas==
The modern intellectual history of Europe cannot be separated from various bodies of ancient thought, from the works of classical Greek and Latin authors to the writings of the fathers of the Christian Church. Such a broad survey of topics is not attempted here, however. A debatable but defensible starting point for modern European thought might instead be identified with the birth of [[scholasticism]] and [[humanism]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. Both of these intellectual currents were associated with classical revivals (in the case of scholasticism, the rediscovery of [[Aristotle]]; in the case of humanism, of Latin antiquity, especially [[Cicero]]) and with prominent founders, [[Aquinas]] and [[Petrarch]] respectively. But they were both significantly original intellectual experiences, as well as self-consciously modern, so that they make an appropriate starting point for this survey.

What follows below is a selective and far from complete listing of significant trends and individuals in the history of European thought. While movements such as the Enlightenment or Romanticism are relatively imprecise approximations, rarely taken too seriously by scholars, they are good starting points for approaching the enormous complexity of the history of Europe's intellectual heritage. It is hoped that interested readers will pursue the listed topics in greater depth by consulting the respective articles and the suggestions for further reading.

The intellectual history of western [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] includes:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
*[[Scholasticism]]: Associated especially with [[Aquinas]] and the [[recovery of Aristotle]], a movement that was popular in universities and provided a new way of reasoning especially in law, philosophy, theology.
*[[Humanism]]: Humanists were associated with the discipline of [[rhetoric]] but they were not just orators, they also learned ancient languages, especially [[classical Greek]] and created new knowledge about the secular past. The revival of ancient literature and philosophy was of immense importance for the further development of European thought. The first humanist is considered to be [[Petrarch]]. Later exponents of note were [[Leonardo Bruni]], [[Lorenzo Valla]], and [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]].
*[[The Renaissance]]: A movement in the arts and letters, it is associated particularly with humanism, but also with new trends in painting and with the efflorescence of a new courtly culture that from [[Italy]] (c.1350) spread across Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries.
*[[Scientific Revolution|The New Philosophy]]: The 20th century dubbed this the [[Scientific Revolution]], but in the 17th century, the new science was more often considered to be a new way of doing philosophy. It is associated mainly with the thought of [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Descartes]]. Other important philosophers were: [[Hobbes]], [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Advances in [[astronomy]] were made by [[Copernicus]], [[Tycho Brahe|Brahe]], [[Kepler]] and [[Galileo]].
*[[The Royal Society]]: A secular creation of an intellectual world led by figures such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Christopher Wren]], [[Joseph Addison]], and [[Bishop Sprat]].
*[[The Enlightenment]]: Key developments in thought included [[Human rights|The rights of man]], [[representative democracy|political representation]], [[political economy]], [[deism]]. Notable participants counted [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], [[David|Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], the [[Comte de Buffon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Voltaire]], [[Rousseau]], [[Diderot]], [[Moses Mendelssohn]], [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].
*[[The Encyclopaedists]]: The creation of central repositories of knowledge available to all outside of academies, including mass-market encyclopaedias and dictionaries: [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Ephraim Chambers]].
*[[Romanticism]] : Individual, subjective, imaginative, personal, visionary (scholarly sources [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Sidney Hook|Hook]], and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]).
*[[Post-romanticism]]: Reaction to [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], opposes external-only observations by adding internal observations (scholarly sources [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], [[Leopold von Ranke|von Ranke]]).
*[[Modernism]] : Rejects Christian academic scholarly tradition (scholarly sources [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jacob Burckhardt]], [[Charles A. Beard|Charles Beard]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]]).
*[[Pragmatism]] : Links the meaning of beliefs to the actions of a believer, and the truth of beliefs to success of those actions in securing a believer's goals. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], [[F.C.S. Schiller]], [[Richard Rorty]]. Originated in late nineteenth century America.
*[[Existentialism]]: Pre- and post-WW2 rejection of Western norms and cultural values.  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Hans Jonas]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Edmund Husserl]]. Engaged with the intellectual prominence of fascism and socialism in Europe during in the 1930s and 1940s, which they saw needed both repudiation and study, as a way to re-establish the individual against the values of a hostile and destructive series of communities creating alienation, isolation, and individual meaninglessness.
*[[Postmodernism]] : Rejects Modernism, [[meta-narrative]] - multiple perspective, role of individual (scholarly sources [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]]).
*[[Structuralism]] : Many phenomena do not occur in isolation but in relation to each other (scholarly sources [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]).
*[[Poststructuralism]] :[[Deconstruction]], destabilizes the relationship between language and objects the language refers to (scholarly sources [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]).

==South and East Asia==
''Pre-Modern East Asia''

The intellectual history of China is connected to the birth of scholarship in ancient China, the creation of [[Confucianism]] with its extensive exegesis of the texts of [[Confucius]], and the active part of scholars in governments. In Korea, the [[yangban]] scholar movement drove the development of [[Traditional Korean thought|Korean intellectual history]] from the late [[Goryeo]] to the golden age of intellectual achievement in the [[Joseon Dynasty]].

In [[China]], ''literati'' referred to the government officials who formed the ruling class in China for over two thousand years. These ''[[scholar-bureaucrats]]'' were a [[status group]] of educated [[laymen]], not ordained [[priest]]s. They were not a [[hereditary]] group as their position depended on their knowledge of writing and literature. After 200 B.C. the system of selection of candidates was influenced by [[Confucianism]] and established its ethic among the literati.

Confucianism (儒家, literally "scholarly tradition") is a Chinese ethical and philosophical system originally developed from the teachings of the early Chinese sage Confucius. Confucius is seen as the founder of the teachings of Confucianism, although he claimed to follow the ways of people before him. Confucianism is a complex system of moral, social, political, philosophical, and religious thought which has had tremendous influence on the culture and history of East Asia. Some people in Europe have considered it to have been the "state religion" in East Asian countries because of governmental promotion of Confucianist values and needs.

Other ancient intellectual currents in East Asia include [[Buddhism]] and [[Daoism]].

''Modern East Asia''

The modern intellectual history of [[China]] is considered to begin with the arrival of the [[Jesuits]] in the sixteenth century. The Jesuits brought with them new astronomical and cartographic knowledge, and were responsible for new developments in [[Chinese science]]. Science in modern China has been the subject of the work of the historian [[Benjamin Elman]].

''Pre-Modern South Asia''

Indian thought is a broad topic that includes the ancient epics of South Asia, the development of what is now called [[Hinduism]] and [[Hindu philosophy]] and the rise of [[Buddhism]], as well as many other topics relating to the political and artistic lives of pre-modern South Asia.

[[Ram Sharan Sharma]]'s work ''Aspects of Political Ideas and Institutions in India'' ([[Motilal Banarsidass]] is the most authoritative account of ancient Indian political ideas and institutions. It deals with the intellectual standards in ancient India in terms of political institutions.

==Africa and the Middle East==
''Pre-Modern History''

The culture of the ancient [[Near East]] and eventually of much of Africa as well was modified significantly by the arrival of [[Islam]] beginning in the seventh century CE. The history of [[Islam]] has been the work of many scholars, both Muslim and non-Muslim, and including such luminaries as [[Ignác Goldziher]], [[Marshall Hodgson]] and in more recent times [[Patricia Crone]]. Islamic culture is not a simple and unified entity. The history of Islam, like that of other religions, is a history of different interpretations and approaches to Islam. There is no a-historical Islam outside the process of historical development.

[[Islamic thought]] includes a variety of different intellectual disciplines, including theology, the study of the [[Qur'an]], the study of [[Hadith]], [[history]], [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]]. For more information see the [[Islamic Golden Age]].

Classical Islamic scholars and authors include:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*[[Ali al-Masudi]]
*[[Ibn Khaldūn]]
*[[Al-Ma'arri]]
*[[Taftazani]]
*[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]
*[[Ibn Sina]]
*[[Ibn Rushd]]
*[[Ibn Arabi]]
*[[Ibn Hisham]]
*[[al-Tabari]]
{{div col end}}

[[Persian philosophy]] can be traced back as far as to Old Iranian philosophical traditions and  thoughts which originated in ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] roots and were considerably influenced by  [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. Throughout Iranian history and due to remarkable political and social changes such as the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian]], [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab]] and [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol]] invasions of Persia a wide spectrum of schools of thoughts showed a variety of views on philosophical questions extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-related traditions to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]] as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after Arab invasion of [[Persia]], is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illumination School]] and the [[Transcendent Philosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.

''Modern Near and Middle East''

[[Islam and modernity]] encompass the relation and compatibility between the phenomenon of modernity, its related concepts and ideas, and the religion of Islam. In order to understand the relation between Islam and modernity, one point should be made in the beginning. Similarly, modernity is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon rather than a unified and coherent phenomenon. It has historically had different schools of thoughts moving in many directions.

[[Intellectual movements in Iran]] involve the Iranian experience of [[modernism]], through which Iranian modernity and its associated art, science, literature, poetry, and political structures have been evolving since the 19th century. [[Religious intellectualism in Iran]] develops gradually and subtly. It reached its apogee during the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1906–11). The process involved numerous philosophers, sociologists, political scientists and cultural theorists. However the associated art, cinema and poetry remained to be developed.

''Modern Africa''

Recent concepts about African culture include the [[African Renaissance]] and [[Afrocentrism]]. The [[African Renaissance]] is a concept popularized by [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Thabo Mbeki]] who called upon the African people and nations to solve the many problems troubling the [[Africa]]n continent.  It reached its height in the late 1990s but continues to be a key part of the post-[[apartheid]] intellectual agenda in South Africa. The concept however extends well beyond intellectual life to politics and economic development.

With the rise of [[Afrocentrism]], the push away from [[Eurocentrism]] has led to the focus on the contributions of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]] and their model of world civilization and [[history]]. Afrocentrism aims to shift the focus from a perceived European-centered history to an [[Africa]]n-centered history. More broadly, Afrocentrism is concerned with distinguishing the influence of [[Demography of Europe|European]] and [[Oriental]] peoples from African achievements.

Notable modern African intellectual include:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*[[Taban Lo Liyong]]
*[[Wole Soyinka]]
*[[Frantz Fanon]]
*[[Chinua Achebe]]
*[[Yusuf Bala Usman]]
*[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] spent his final years in Ghana

'''Health humanities''' refers to the application of the creative or [[The arts|fine arts]] (including [[visual arts]], [[music]], [[performing arts]]) and [[humanities]] disciplines (including [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], [[languages]], [[law]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[religion]], etc.) to discourse about, express, and/or promote dimensions of [[human]] [[health]] and well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/scope/about/|title="What is Health Humanities?"|last=|first=|date=2016|website=SCOPE: The Health Humanities Learning Lab|publisher=|access-date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applied capacity of the humanities is not itself a novel idea; however, the construct of the health humanities has only recently begun to emerge over the first decade of the 21st Century. Historically, the roots informing the health humanities can be traced back to, and can now be considered to include, such multidisciplinary areas as the [[medical humanities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mh.bmj.com/ |title=Medical Humanities - BMJ Journals |publisher=Mh.bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Expressive therapy|expressive therapies/creative arts therapies]].

In the health humanities, health (and the promotion of health) is understood according to the [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] (and other [[non-positivist]]) principles indigenous to the humanities, as opposed to the [[positivism]] of [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;Squier, S. M. (2007). Beyond nescience: The intersectional insights of health humanities. ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 50'' (3), 334-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emua.ac.uk/downloads/BBsept09/healthhumanities.pptx&lt;/ref&gt; The health humanities are rooted in dialogical (negotiated, intersubjective voices of multiple truths), versus monological (a singular, authoritative voice of "the" truth) perspectives on health. As such, evidence upon which health practices are based is generally considered [[Axiology|axiological]] (based in meanings, values, and aesthetics), versus [[Epistemology|epistemological]] (based in factual knowledge), in orientation. The health humanities are not an alternative to the health sciences, but rather offer a contrasting paradigm and pragmatic approach with respect to health and its promotion, and can function in a manner that is complementary and simultaneous relative to the health sciences.  

The health humanities are a growing movement internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhumanities.org&lt;/ref&gt;  A conference on the health humanities was held October 13–15, 2006, at [[Green College, University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhum.arts.ubc.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was co-organized by Judy Segal (UBC English) and Alan Richardson (UBC Philosophy) and featured presentations by Jacalyn Duffin, Carl Elliott, Nicholas King, Lorelei Lingard, Robert Proctor, Susan Squier, Andrea Tone, and Kathleen Woodward.  In January 2009, [[Paul Crawford (academic)|Paul Crawford]] became the world's first Professor of Health Humanities at [[The University of Nottingham]], and with Dr Victoria Tischler, Charley Baker, Dr Brian Brown, Dr Lisa Mooney-Smith and Professor Ronald Carter created an international health humanities initiative that included the AHRC-funded International Health Humanities Conference (IHHC). The first field description for Health Humanities was presented in the key article "Health Humanities: The future of Medical Humanities" (Crawford, Brown, Tischler, &amp; Baker, 2010), published in the Mental Health Review Journal.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, P., Brown, B., Tischler, V. &amp; Baker, C. (2010) Health Humanities: The future of medical humanities? ''Mental Health Review Journal, 15'' (3): 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st International Health Humanities Conference was held 6–8 August 2010, at [[The University of Nottingham]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madnessandliterature.org/Resources/IHHC-flyer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madnessandliterature.org/Resources/First-International-Health-Humanities-Conference-Programme.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference opened with Professor Crawford's address entitled ‘Health humanities: Literature and Madness’ and included keynote lectures by Professor Kay Redfield Jamison and Professor Elaine Showalter. Mark A. Radcliffe, who also spoke at the conference, reported on 'health humanities' in his weekly column for the Nursing Times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nursingtimes.net/forums-blogs-ideas-debate/nursing-blogs/health-humanities-feared-by-the-bad-loved-by-the-good/5018154.article?referrer=RSS&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was also reported in the Bethlem Blog.&lt;ref&gt;'Madness and Literature: Report from International Health Humanities Conference’, 16 August 2010. http://bethlemheritage.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd International Health Humanities Conference was hosted in the USA, 9–11 August 2012, at [[Montclair State University]] in New Jersey, with the theme of "Music, Health, and Humanity." The 3rd International Health Humanities Conference was held 5-7 September 2014, once again at the University of Nottingham, and featured the theme of "Traumatextualities: Trauma in the Clinical, Arts and Humanities Contexts."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhumanities.org/blog/view/0/50&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th International Health Humanities Conference was held 30 April and 1-2 May 2015, at the Center for Bioethics and Humanities, [[Anschutz Medical Campus]], [[University of Colorado]], Denver, featuring the theme of "Health Humanities: The Next Decade (Pedagogies, Practices, Politics)." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/centers/BioethicsHumanities/ArtsHumanities/Pages/Health%20Humanities%20Conference.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th International Health Humanities Conference will be held 15-17 September 2016, at the [[University of Seville]], Seville, Spain, featuring the theme of "Arts and Humanities for Improving Social Inclusion, Education, and Health: Creative Practice and Mutuality." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ihhcsevilla2016.es/index?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state [[chronicle]], the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts survived.

Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a [[Outline of academic disciplines#History|major discipline]] in university studies.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
The word ''history'' comes ultimately from [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ἱστορία|ἱστορία]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(stori/a|ἱστορία}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''historía''), meaning "inquiry", "knowledge from inquiry", or "judge". It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his {{lang|grc|[[History of Animals|Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι]]}}&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora"&gt;Ferrater-Mora, José. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai'' "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word {{lang|grc|ἵστωρ}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebes]]' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).

The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as ''historia'', meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative". ''History'' was borrowed from Latin (possibly via [[Old Irish]] or [[Old Welsh]]) into [[Old English]] as ''stær'' ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"&gt;"history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, as Latin became [[Old French]] (and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]), ''historia'' developed into forms such as ''istorie'', ''estoire'', and ''historie'', with new developments in the meaning: "account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462)".&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

It was from Anglo-Norman that ''history'' was borrowed into [[Middle English]], and this time the loan stuck. It appears in the thirteenth-century ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'', but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing in [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' of the 1390s (VI.1383): "I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire". In [[Middle English]], the meaning of ''history'' was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs" arose in the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

With the [[Renaissance]], older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote about "[[Natural history|Natural History]]". For him, ''historia'' was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an expression of the linguistic [[Synthetic language|synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy]], English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and [[storytelling]] in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".

The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;Whitney, W. D. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historian'' in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, "History", or the word ''[[historiography]]''.&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Historians' History of the World - Title Page.jpg|thumb|The title page to ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'']]
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a "true discourse of past" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Whitney, (1889). [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=17 September 2005 }}, "History".&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the "true past").

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and at other times as part of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. {{ISBN|0-415-05682-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an [[oral tradition]], and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995). The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. {{ISBN|0-415-12346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical [[Annapolis, Maryland]], USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|250}}
{{Further|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, {{ISBN|0-14-020652-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
[[File:Guicciardini M Francesco La Historia dItalia.jpg|thumb|left|The title page to ''La Historia d'Italia'']]
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, [[world view]], use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Historiography: Ancient, medieval, and modern'' (University of Chicago Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the twentieth century: From scientific objectivity to the postmodern challenge'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Philosophy of history}}
{{unreferenced section| date= January 2016}}
Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Historical method basics &lt;/div&gt;

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[author]]ship)?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[historical criticism]]; the fifth, [[textual criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC – ca.425 BC)&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=5|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history". However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at [[Causality|cause and effect]], rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=6|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145–90 BC), author of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji''). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[Secularity|secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"/&gt;

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data."

In the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany.

In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[Great Man theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[History of mentalities|histoire des mentalités]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[François Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]] defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history}}
The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist historiography]] was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail M. Krom, "From the Center to the Margin: the Fate of Marxism in Contemporary Russian Historiography," ''Storia della Storiografia'' (2012) Issue 62, pp 121-130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.&lt;ref name="Marwick-p169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillan Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period. [[Century|Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name="Tosh-p168-169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prehistoric periodisation====
The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual method for periodisation of the distant [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] past, in [[archaeology]] is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Here prehistory is divided into a series of "chapters" so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Time|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0415311977|location=Oxon|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation. There are periodisation, however, that do not have this narrative aspect, relying largely on relative chronology and, thus, devoid of any specific meaning.

Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through [[radiocarbon dating]] and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used. Periodisation, however, is not viewed as a perfect framework with one account explaining that "cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop (combinedly) at periodisation boundaries" and that different trajectories of change are also needed to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Living Landscape: Bronze Age Settlement Sites in the Dutch River Area (C. 2000-800 BC)|last=Arnoldussen|first=Stijn|publisher=Sidestone Press|year=2007|isbn=9789088900105|location=Leiden|pages=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[Geography|geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[Country|countries]], and [[City|cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. According to [[Jules Michelet]] in his book ''Histoire de France'' (1833), "without geographical basis, the people, the makers of history, seem to be walking on air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Relations of History and Geography: Studies in England, France and the United States|last=Darby|first=Henry Clifford|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=2002|isbn=0859896994|location=Exeter|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization. There is also the case of climate, which historians like [[Ellsworth Huntington]] and Allen Semple, cited as a crucial influence on the course of history and racial temperament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history from early times to A D 2000|last=Rao|first=B.V.|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

====Regions====
* [[History of Africa]] begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.
* [[History of the Americas]] is the collective history of North and South America, including Central America and the Caribbean.
** [[History of North America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's northern and western hemisphere.
** [[History of Central America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's western hemisphere.
** [[History of the Caribbean]] begins with the oldest evidence where 7,000-year-old remains have been found.
** [[History of South America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's southern and western hemisphere.
* [[History of Antarctica]] emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe.
* [[History of Australia]] starts with the documentation of the Makassar trading with Indigenous Australians on Australia's north coast.
* [[History of New Zealand]] dates back at least 700 years to when it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori culture centred on kinship links and land.
* [[History of the Pacific Islands]] covers the history of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.
* [[History of Eurasia]] is the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions: the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe, linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.
** [[History of Europe]] describes the passage of time from humans inhabiting the European continent to the present day.
** [[History of Asia]] can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe.
*** [[History of East Asia]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in East Asia.
*** [[History of the Middle East]] begins with the earliest civilizations in the region now known as the Middle East that were established around 3000 BC, in Mesopotamia (Iraq).
*** [[History of India]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in the Sub-Himalayan region.
*** [[History of Southeast Asia]] has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat. The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.&lt;ref name=Pavkovic&gt;{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic

===History of religion===
{{Main|History of religions}}

The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include ''[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]'', ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]'', and ''[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]]''. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Cochrane |title=What Is Catholic Historiography? |journal=Catholic Historical Review |volume=61 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=169–190 |jstor=25019673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.&lt;ref&gt;For example see {{cite journal |first=Sofia Boesch |last=Gajano |first2=Tommaso |last2=Caliò |title=Italian Religious Historiography in the 1990s |journal=Journal of Modern Italian Studies |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=293–306 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
''Social history'', sometimes called the ''new social history'', is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stearns, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Social History'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security'', Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with social history while [[political history]] came next with 1425 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007 - listed by research interest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530073940/http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html |date=30 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great Man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=978-0-582-48488-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Demographic history]]
* [[History of education]]
* [[Ethnic history]]
* [[History of the family]]
* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labour history]]
* [[Rural history]]
* [[Urban history]]
** [[American urban history]]
* [[Women's history]]
Smaller specialties include:
* [[History of childhood]]
* [[Gender history]]

===Cultural history===
{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
Cultural history includes the study of [[History of art|art in society]] as well is the study of images and human visual production ([[iconography]]).&lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}.

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]]  focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War, "diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies."&lt;ref&gt;Muriel E Chamberlain, ''Pax Britannica'? British Foreign Policy 1789–1914'' (1988) p 1&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.

===Economic history===
{{main|Economic history|Business history}}
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, "Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?," Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp 17-20, with responses pp 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business history]]  deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Amatori, and Geoffrey Jones, eds. ''Business History Around the World'' (2003) [https://www.questia.com/read/114846992 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental history===
{{main|Environmental history}}
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World history===
{{main|World history}}
{{See also|History of the world|Universal history}}
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ainslie Embree]] and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, "World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,"''Chinese Studies in History'', Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 84-96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.

It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others.

The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501050602/http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~world/|title=H-World - H-Net|website=www.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[nonconformist]]s, and the otherwise forgotten people. The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the [[History Workshop Journal|History Workshop]] movement in Britain in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade Matthews|title=The New Left, National Identity, and the Break-up of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfmZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|pages=20–21|isbn=9789004253070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual history===
{{Main|Intellectual history|History of ideas}}
Intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Grafton |title=The History of Ideas: Precept and Practice, 1950–2000 and beyond |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=67 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=1–32 |url=http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Maryanne Cline |editor-last=Horowitz |title=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;David Glassberg, "Public history and the study of memory." ''The Public Historian'' (1996): 7-23. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377910 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events.They discover this information through archaeological evidence, written primary sources from the past and other various means such as place names. In [[list of historians|lists of historians]], historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. [[Chronicle]]rs and [[annals|annalists]], though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.

==The judgement of history==
{{see also|Ash heap of history}}

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

[[Pseudohistory]] is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Closely related to deceptive [[Historical negationism|historical revisionism]], works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

==Teaching history==

===Scholarship vs teaching===
A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor [[Charles Harding Firth]], Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University, where [[Thomas Frederick Tout]] was professionalizing the History undergraduate programme by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Roots, "Firth, Sir Charles Harding (1857–1936)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33137, Online; accessed 10 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reba Soffer, "Nation, duty, character and confidence: history at Oxford, 1850–1914." ''Historical Journal'' (1987) 30#01 pp: 77-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Donoghue, ''The Last Professors: The Corporate University and the Fate of the Humanities'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980, attention increasingly moved toward teaching [[world history]] or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, "Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York," ''History Teacher'', (November 2009), 43#1 pp 87-96&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.

The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the ''[[Nouvelle histoire]]'' as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, " The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s," ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199-221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias in school teaching===
[[File:Historybooks.JPG|thumb|History books in a bookstore]]
In several countries history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, "The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', May 2008, Vol. 617, pp 107-122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;"Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History," ''Russian Studies in History'', Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |journal=International Affairs |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=365–370 |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x|year = 2008|last1 = Wedgwood Benn|first1 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], especially the [[Southern United States|southern part]] history about [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[American Civil War]] are controversial topics. [[McGraw-Hill Education]] for example, was criticised for describing Africans brought to American plantations as "workers" instead of slaves in a textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|last2=Hauser|first2=Christine|date=5 October 2015|title=Texas Mother Teaches Textbook Company a Lesson on Accuracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/publisher-promises-revisions-after-textbook-refers-to-african-slaves-as-workers.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India," ''History Workshop Journal'', April 2009, Issue 67, pp 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, "Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR," ''History Teacher'', February 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp 179-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace."  The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."&lt;ref&gt;Simone Lässig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, "History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany," ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp 128-9 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''history by period''' summarizes significant eras in the [[history of the world]], from the ancient world to the present day.

== Ancient history (60,000 BC – 650 AD) ==
{{main article|Ancient history}}
Ancient history refers to the time period in which scientists have found the earliest remains of human activity, approximately 60,000 BC. It ends with the fall of several significant empires, such as the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the Mediterranean, the [[Han Dynasty]] in China, and the [[Gupta Empire]] in India, collectively around 650 AD.

The [[Bronze Age]] is the time period in which humans around the world began to use [[bronze]] as a major metal in tools. It is generally accepted as starting around 3600 BC and ending with the advent of iron in 1000 BC.

The [[Iron Age]] is often called Antiquity or the Classical Era, but these periods more commonly refer to only one region. It begins around 1000 BC with the widespread use of [[iron]] in tools. It is often accepted to end at approximately 650 AD, with the fall of the aforementioned major civilizations.

Note that BC and BCE refer to the same time period. BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era, and BC for Before Christ. AD is Anno Domini, and CE is Common Era. This is done in order to standardize time periods across the world ([[ISO 8601]]).
*[[Stone Age]] Ended between 6,000 and 2,000 BC (depending on the area; until 1600s European contact in Australia)
*[[History of Mesopotamia]] 6000 BC - 1100 BC
*[[Indus Valley Civilization]] 3300 BC - 1300 BC
*[[Old Kingdom]] ([[Egypt]], 3000 BC - 2000 BC)
*[[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (Egypt, 2000 BC - 1300 BC)
*[[Vedic period]] [[History of India|India]], (1750 - 500 BC)
*[[New Kingdom]] (Egypt, 1300 BC - 700 BC)
*[[Shang Dynasty]] (China 1800 BC - 1200 BC)
*[[Classical antiquity|Mediterranean Antiquity]]
*[[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] Dynasty (China, 1200 BC–500 BC)
*[[Ancient Greece]], (circa 1000 BC–323 BC) (see [[Timeline of Ancient Greece]])
*[[Mahajanapadas]], (India 600 - 300 BC)
*[[Timeline of Roman history|Ancient Rome]] 753 BC - 476 AD)
*[[Classical India]] (230 BC - 500 AD)
*[[Six Dynasties]] (China, 220 AD–581 AD)
**[[Three Kingdoms]] (China, 220–280)
*[[Late Antiquity]] (Europe, circa 300 AD - circa 476 AD)

== Postclassical Era (500 – 1500) ==
{{main article|Postclassical Era}}
The Postclassical Era, also referred to as the Medieval period or, for [[Europe]], the [[Middle Ages]], begins around 500 CE after the fall of major civilizations, covering the advent of [[Islam]]. The period ends around 1450–1500, with events like the rise of [[printing press|moveable-type printing]] in Europe, the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]], and the Ottoman Empire's [[fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]].

*[[Middle Ages]] (Europe, 5th century - 15th century)
**[[Early Middle Ages]] (Europe, 5th century - 11th century)
**[[High Middle Ages]] (Europe, 11th century - 14th century)
**[[Late Middle Ages]] (Europe, 14th century  - 15th century)
*[[Islamic Golden Age]] (Middle East, 750 – 1300)
*[[Viking Age]] ([[Scandinavia]], Europe, 793 - 1066)
*[[Nara period]] (Japan, 709 - 795)
*[[Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] (China, 907 - 960)
*[[Sengoku period]] (Japan, 1478–1605)
*[[Middle kingdoms of India]], (500 - 1206)

== Modern history (1500 – present) ==
{{main article|Modern history}}
{{see also|Great Divergence}}
The Modern Period covers human history from the creation of a more global network (i.e. the discovery of the Americas by Europeans) to present day.

=== Early Modern Period (1500 – 1750) ===
{{main article|Early modern period}}
The Early Modern Period is the first third of the Modern Period and is often used with the parent categorization. It starts with the invention of the printing press, covering the voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 and, more generally, the establishment of a more global network. It ends in 1750 with the beginning of British industrialization.

*The [[Renaissance]] (Europe, 14th century - 17th century)
*[[Age of Discovery]] (or Exploration) (Europe, 16th century - 18th century)
*[[Age of Sail]] - referring to commercial and military impact of sailing technology, usually dated as 1571—1862.
*[[Elizabethan period]] (England, 1558–1603)
*The [[Protestant Reformation]] (Europe, 16th century)
*[[The Age of Enlightenment]] (Europe, 18th century)
=== Mid Modern Period (1750 – 1914) ===
{{main article|Long nineteenth century|Age of Revolution|Industrial Revolution}}
The Age of Revolution is a less commonly used period, but appropriately covers the time between the early modern and contemporary. It begins around 1750 with European industrialization and is marked by several political revolutions. It ends around 1914, with the relative advancement of industrialization in Europe, the United States, Japan, and Russia, and the beginning of [[World War I]].

*[[Industrial Revolution]] (Europe, United States, elsewhere 18th and 19th centuries)
*[[Napoleonic Era]], 1799–1815
*[[Victorian era]] (United Kingdom, 1837–1901)
*[[Gilded Age]] (United States, 1870-1900)
*[[Machine Age]] (Europe, United States, elsewhere 19th and 20th centuries)
*[[Edwardian period]] (United Kingdom, 1901–1910)
*[[Meiji era]] (Japan, 1868–1912)

=== Contemporary Period (1914 – present) ===
{{main article|Contemporary history}}
The Contemporary Period generally covers history still in living memory, approximately 100 years behind the current year. However, for all intents and purposes, the period will be used here as spanning from the first world war in 1914 to present day, as it is considered separate from the past eras and the newest stage of world history.

*[[World War I]] (Much of Earth, 1914–1918)
*[[Interwar period]] (Earth, 1918 - 1939)

*[[World War II]] (Earth, 1939–1945)
*[[Cold War]] ([[Soviet Union]] and United States, as well their allied states, 1945–1991)
*[[Space Age]] (after 1957)
*[[Information Age]] (1971–present)

The '''history of art criticism''', as part of art history, is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts, i.e. [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]], which include aesthetic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the "major" arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture as well as the "minor" arts of ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.

As a term, the history of art history (also [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying and assessing the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the history of art criticism is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement from the standpoint of its history and of its major scholars. It is also distinguished from [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and How did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of art criticism is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. The history of art criticism often roots its studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. It attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
The history of art criticism as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians, in performing their assessment within the history of art criticism,  employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Practitioners of art criticism often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Practitioners of art criticism also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many practitioners of art criticism use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

==Timeline of Prominent Methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history or art criticism are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/xenocrates.htm Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''. Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were "Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (Fuseli published an English translation in 1765 under the title Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks), and Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (History of Art in Antiquity), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyone Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Nochlin and feminism===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "Why have there been no great women artists?" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. In it she applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training. Nochlin argues that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success.[[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above. While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women.

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the [[Mona Lisa]]. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum Studies and Collecting===

Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New Materialism===

Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

[[Contemporary Art History]] refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''hprints''' ([[pronunciation|pronounced]] in [[English language|English]] as '''aitch prints''') is an [[archive]] for electronic [[preprint]]s of academic papers in the fields of [[humanities|arts and humanities]]. It can be accessed freely via the [[Internet]] since it is an [[open access]] [[repository (publishing)|repository]] aiming at making scholarly documents publicly available to the widest possible audience.

==The hprints project==
The aim of hprints is to make [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] research available through an open access online electronic full text archive, but the limitation to Nordic countries is claimed to be mainly an initial restriction for funding reasons. The archive will primarily contain electronic research documents in the form of preprints, reprints, working papers, book chapters, conference reports, invited lecture manuscripts etc. The archive is set up, maintained and promoted by [[Copenhagen University]] Library and consortium members. The consortium original members were:
* [[Copenhagen University]] Library, part of the [[Danish Royal Library]])
* The Faculty of Humanities, at [[Copenhagen University]]
* [[Lund University]] Library
* [[Museum Tusculanum Press]], an academic publisher
* [[University of Oslo]] Library
Submissions of electronic text material to the archive is decentral and take place at the local individual researcher, or research group level.

==Using hprints==
Hence hprints is a tool for scientific communication between academic scholars, who can upload full-text research material such as articles, papers, conference papers, book chapters etc. The content of the deposited material should be comparable to that of a scientific paper that a scholar would consider suitable for publication in for example a peer reviewed scientific journal.

It is possible to search and find the paper by defined topics through an Internet search. Secondly, all submitted papers are stored permanently and receive a stable web address, as for example the paper in this example:

 Pietism and the politics of catechisms
 Horstbøll H.
 Scandinavian Journal of History 29, 2 (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;143-160
 http://www.hprints.org/hprints-00254947/en/

==History==
May 2007 the Nordic funding agency for libraries, [[Nordbib]], granted the hprints project 287,000 DKK as part of its financing programme ''Work Package 2: Focus area on Content and Accessibility''. The plan was to launch an archive one year from this date i.e. approximately June 2008: The hprints project wishes to provide a policy and a technical infrastructure that permits [[open access]] to research within the arts and humanities. The assumption was that this will result in a number of advantages with respect to the electronic accessibility and visibility of the arts and humanities research area.

October 2007, the Advisory Board of the [[Nordbib]] "hprints project" chose the system to be used for the Nordic arts and humanities e-print archive. Three possible alternatives existed: [[EPrints]] from the [[University of Southampton]], LUR from [[Lund University]] Libraries, and [[Hyper Articles en Ligne|HAL]] from the French national research council (CNRS). Both EPrints and LUR are free [[Open-source software|open source]] software that can be set up locally  or hosted commercially, while HAL is a functioning archive, to which portals can be set up.

At the hprints Advisory Board meeting in October, it was decided to collaborate with the French research council, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). Hence, the hprints e-print archive for Nordic arts and humanities is set up as a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] HAL portal with its own layout and adapted to the requirements of hprints.

March 2008 hprints opened for public access. Since the archive is a part of HAL and  papers will be shared with the French national archive.

[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|The philosopher [[Plato]] – Roman copy of a work by [[Silanion]] for the Academia in Athens ({{circa|lk=no}} 370 BC)]]
'''Humanities''' are [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] that study aspects of [[human]] [[society]] and [[culture]]. In the [[Renaissance]], the term contrasted with [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] and referred to what is now called [[classics]], the main area of [[secular]] study in universities at the time. Today, the humanities are more frequently contrasted with natural, and sometimes social, sciences as well as professional training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary 3rd Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The humanities use methods that are primarily [[Critical theory|critical]], or [[Continental philosophy|speculative]], and have a significant historical element&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;—as distinguished from the mainly [[Empirical method|empirical]] approaches of the [[natural science]]s,&lt;ref name=oed&gt;"Humanity" 2.b, ''Oxford English Dictionary'' 3rd Ed. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; yet, unlike the sciences, it has no central discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199665211.001.0001| isbn=9780199665211| title=A New History of the Humanities: The Search for Principles and Patterns from Antiquity to the Present| publisher=Oxford University Press| date=2013-11-14| last1=Bod| first1=Rens}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The humanities include [[Languages|ancient and modern languages]], [[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[human geography]], [[law]], [[politics]], [[religion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanford University|first1=Stanford University|title=What are the Humanities|url=http://shc.stanford.edu/what-are-the-humanities|website=Stanford Humanities Center|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[art]].

Scholars in the humanities are "humanity scholars" or ''humanists''.&lt;ref&gt;"Humanist" Oxford English Dictionary. [http://oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/89273 Oed.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "humanist" also describes the philosophical position of [[humanism]], which some "[[antihumanism|antihumanist]]" scholars in the humanities refuse. The Renaissance scholars and artists were also called [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]]. Some [[secondary school]]s offer humanities classes usually consisting of [[literature]], global studies and [[art]].

Human disciplines like history and [[cultural anthropology]] study subject matters that the manipulative [[experimental method]] does not apply to—and instead mainly use the [[comparative method]]&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA28 p.28]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[comparative research]].

==Fields==

===Anthropology===
{{Main|Anthropology}}

[[Anthropology]] is the holistic "science of humans", a science of the totality of human existence. The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the [[social sciences]], humanities and [[human biology]]. In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The natural ''sciences'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''humanities'' generally study local traditions, through their [[history]], [[literature]], [[music]], and [[art]]s, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. The ''social sciences'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences.

The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = I. | title = Anthropology, Sociology, and Other Dubious Disciplines | doi = 10.1086/375868 | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 453–465 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: [[archaeology]], physical or [[biological anthropology]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word ''anthropos'' (άνθρωπος) is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "human being" or "person". [[Eric Wolf]] described sociocultural anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences".

The goal of anthropology is to provide a [[Holism|holistic]] account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called "primitive" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of "inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowie |first=Robert |title=Primitive Religion |publisher=Routledge and Sons |year=1924}}; {{cite book |last=Tylor |first=Edward |year=1920 |title=Primitive Culture |location=New York: |publisher=J. P. Putnam's Sons}} Originally published 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropologists use terms such as "less complex" societies, or refer to specific modes of [[subsistence]] or [[Modes of production|production]], such as "pastoralist" or "forager" or "horticulturalist", to discuss humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (''ethnos'') remaining of great interest within anthropology.

The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena and Richard Warms. ''Culture Counts''. Wadsworth. 2008. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato. ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
{{Main|Archaeology}}

Archaeology is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of [[material culture]]. The [[archaeological record]] consists of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[architecture]], [[biofact (archaeology)|biofacts]] or ecofacts, and [[cultural landscapes]]. Archaeology can be considered both a [[social science]] and a branch of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.11141/ia.42.8 | issue=42 | title=The Intellectual Base of Archaeological Research 2004-2013: a visualisation and analysis of its disciplinary links, networks of authors and conceptual language | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Sinclair | first1 = Anthony }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has various goals, which range from understanding [[culture history]] to reconstructing past [[lifeway]]s to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time.

Archaeology is thought of as a branch of [[anthropology]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |first1=William A. |last= Haviland |first2= Harald E. L. |last2= Prins |first3=Bunny |last3=McBride |first4=Dana |last4=Walrath |publisher=Cengage Learning |year= 2010 |edition=13th |isbn=0-495-81082-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right, or grouped under other related disciplines such as [[history]].

===Classics===
[[File:Homeros Caetani Louvre Ma440 n2.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Homer]], the most famous Greek poet]]
[[Classics]], in the [[Western culture|Western]] academic tradition, refers to the studies of the cultures of [[classical antiquity]], namely Ancient Greek and Latin and the Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cultures. Classical studies is considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities; however, its popularity declined during the 20th century. Nevertheless, the influence of classical ideas on many humanities disciplines, such as philosophy and literature, remains strong.

===History===
[[History]] is systematically collected [[information]] about the [[past]]. When used as the name of a [[field of study]], ''history'' refers to the study and interpretation of the record of [[human]]s, [[society|societies]], institutions, and any topic that has changed over time.

Traditionally, the study of history has been considered a part of the humanities. In modern [[academia]], history is occasionally classified as a [[social science]].

===Linguistics and languages===
{{Main|Linguistics|Language}}
{{see also2|{{in title|language}}}}
While the scientific study of language is known as [[linguistics]] and is generally considered a [[social science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://artsandscience.usask.ca/arts-science/socialsciences.php |title=Social Science Majors, University of Saskatchewan |access-date=2016-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906113657/http://artsandscience.usask.ca/arts-science/socialsciences.php |archive-date=2015-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[natural science]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|title=Language as a Natural Object; Linguistics as a Natural Science|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723173105/http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|archive-date=2010-07-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; the study of languages is still central to the humanities. A good deal of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as [[Wittgenstein]] claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including [[prose]] forms (such as the [[novel]]), [[poetry]] and [[drama]], also lies at the heart of the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs in a [[foreign language]] usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself.

===Law and politics===
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at a criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]]]]{{Main|Law}} In common parlance, [[law]] means a rule that (unlike a rule of ethics) is enforceable through institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crimes Against Humanity|first=Geoffrey| last=Robertson| authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|year=2006| publisher=Penguin|page=90| isbn=978-0-14-102463-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a "system of rules",&lt;ref name="hhc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=H. L. A. |authorlink=H. L. A. Hart |title=The Concept of Law |year=1961 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-876122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an "interpretive concept"&lt;ref name="rdl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dworkin |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Dworkin |title=Law's Empire |year=1986 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-51836-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve justice, as an "authority"&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raz |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Raz |title=The Authority of Law |year=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-956268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mediate people's interests, and even as "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;{{cite book |last=Austin |first=John |authorlink=John Austin (legal philosopher) |title=The Providence of Jurisprudence Determined |year=1831 |publisher= |location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every [[social science]] and discipline of the humanities. Laws are [[politic]]s, because politicians create them. Law is [[philosophy]], because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of [[history]]'s stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[labour law]], [[company law]] and many more can have long-lasting effects on how productivity is organised and the distribution of wealth. The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the Latin word ''LEX''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{main|Literature}}
[[File:First Folio.jpg|thumb|[[Shakespeare]] wrote some of the most acclaimed works in [[English literature]].]] '''Literature''' is a term that does not have a universally accepted definition, but which has variably included all written work; writing that possesses literary merit; and language that foregrounds literariness, as opposed to [[ordinary language]]. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] the term derives from [[Latin]] ''literatura/litteratura'' "writing formed with letters", although some definitions include [[Oral literature|spoken or sung texts]]. Literature can be classified according to whether it is [[fiction]] or [[non-fiction]], and whether it is [[poetry]] or [[prose]]; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the [[novel]], [[short story]] or [[drama]]; and works are often categorised according to historical periods, or according to their adherence to certain [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] features or expectations ([[genre]]).

===Philosophy===
[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|The works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] overlap into many fields of the humanities, such as philosophy, literature, theology, music, and classical studies.]]
Philosophy—etymologically, the "love of wisdom"—is generally the study of problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, justification, truth, justice, right and wrong, beauty, validity, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these issues by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument, rather than experiments ([[experimental philosophy]] being an exception).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Nagel (1987). ''What Does It All Mean? A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy''. Oxford University Press, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy used to be a very comprehensive term, including what have subsequently become separate disciplines, such as [[physics]]. (As [[Immanuel Kant]] noted, "Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three sciences: physics, ethics, and logic.")&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1785). ''Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals'', the first line.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the main fields of philosophy are [[logic]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and [[epistemology]]. Still, it continues to overlap with other disciplines. The field of [[semantics]], for example, brings philosophy into contact with [[linguistics]].

Since the early twentieth century, philosophy in English-speaking [[universities]] has moved away from the humanities and closer to the formal sciences, becoming much more ''analytic.'' [[Analytic philosophy]] is marked by emphasis on the use of logic and formal methods of reasoning, conceptual analysis, and the use of [[symbolic logic|symbolic]] and/or [[mathematical logic]], as contrasted with the [[Continental philosophy|Continental style of philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Brian Leiter [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115002425/http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp] "'Analytic' philosophy today names a style of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics than with the humanities."&lt;/ref&gt; This method of inquiry is largely indebted to the work of philosophers such as [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G.E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

===Religion===
[[File:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|The [[compass]] in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation myth|creation]].]]
New [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religions]] arose in both east and west, particularly around the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]] in [[India]], [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] being some of the earliest major faiths. In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate Chinese thinking until the modern day. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would attain predominance, looked not to the force of law, but to the power and example of tradition for political morality. In the west, the Greek philosophical tradition, represented by the works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], was diffused throughout Europe and the Middle East by the conquests of [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander of Macedon]] in the 4th century BC.

[[Abrahamic religions]] are those [[religion]]s deriving from a common ancient tradition and traced by their adherents to [[Abraham]] (circa 1900 BCE), a [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarch]] whose life is narrated in the [[Hebrew Bible]]/[[Old Testament]], where he is described as a [[prophet]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:7), and in the [[Quran]], where he also appears as a [[prophets of Islam|prophet]]. This forms a large group of related largely monotheistic religions, generally held to include [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], and comprises over half of the world's religious adherents.

===Performing arts===
The [[performing art]]s differ from the [[visual arts]] in so far as the former uses the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium, and the latter uses materials such as clay, metal, or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create some [[work of art|art object]]. Performing arts include [[acrobatics]], [[busking]], [[comedy]], [[dance]], [[film]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[music]], [[opera]], [[juggling]], [[marching arts]], such as [[brass band]]s, and [[theatre]].

Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers, including [[actor]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as [[songwriting]] and [[stagecraft]]. Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]], such as with [[costume]]s and [[cosmetics|stage makeup]], etc. There is also a specialized form of [[fine art]] in which the artists ''perform'' their work live to an audience. This is called [[Performance art]]. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of [[Theatrical property|props]]. Dance was often referred to as a ''plastic art'' during the [[Modern dance]] era.

====Musicology====
[[File:Mozarteum grosser saal buehne mit orchester.jpg|thumb|Concert in the Mozarteum, Salzburg]]
[[Musicology]] as an academic discipline can take a number of different paths, including [[historical musicology]], [[ethnomusicology]] and [[music theory]]. Undergraduate music majors generally take courses in all of these areas, while graduate students focus on a particular path. In the liberal arts tradition, musicology is also used to broaden skills of non-musicians by teaching skills such as concentration and listening.

====Theatre====
[[Theatre]] (or theater) (Greek "theatron", ''θέατρον'') is the branch of the [[performing arts]] concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle — indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[kabuki]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[Chinese opera]], [[mummers' play]]s, and [[pantomime]].

====Dance====
Dance (from [[Old French]] ''dancier'', perhaps from [[Old Frankish language|Frankish]]) generally refers to [[human]] [[Motion (physics)|movement]] either used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]] or presented in a [[Social environment|social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of [[non-verbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s ([[Waggle dance|bee dance]], mating dance), and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects (''the [[leaves]] danced in the [[wind]]''). [[Choreography]] is the art of creating dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer.

Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]], and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]].
===Visual arts===

====History of visual arts====
[[File:Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain.jpg|thumbnail|''Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain'' by [[Emperor Gaozong of Song China|Emperor Gaozong]] (1107–1187) of [[Song Dynasty]]; fan mounted as album leaf on silk, four columns in cursive script.]]
The great traditions in [[art]] have a foundation in the art of one of the ancient civilizations, such as [[Ancient Japan]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[China]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|India]], [[Greater Nepal]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Mesoamerica]].

Ancient Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g., [[Zeus]]' thunderbolt).

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Gothic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. The [[Renaissance]] saw the return to valuation of the material world, and this shift is reflected in art forms, which show the corporeality of the human body, and the three-dimensional reality of landscape.

Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan.

Religious [[Islam]]ic art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead. The physical and rational certainties depicted by the 19th-century Enlightenment were shattered not only by new discoveries of relativity by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but also by unprecedented technological development. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art.

====Media types====

=====Drawing=====
[[Drawing]] is a means of making a [[image|picture]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. A computer aided designer who excels in [[technical drawing]] is referred to as a ''draftsman'' or ''draughtsman''.

=====Painting=====
[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Mona Lisa]]'', by Leonardo da Vinci, is one of the most recognizable artistic paintings in the [[Western world]].]]
[[Painting]] taken literally is the practice of applying [[pigment]] suspended in a carrier (or [[Paint#Components|medium]]) and a binding agent (a [[adhesive|glue]]) to a surface (support) such as [[paper]], [[canvas]] or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with [[drawing]], [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] and other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to [[Sistine Chapel|The Sistine Chapel]] to the human body itself.

Colour is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but elsewhere white may be. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including [[Goethe]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Isaac Newton]], have written their own [[colour theory|colour theories]]. Moreover, the use of language is only a generalization for a colour equivalent. The word "[[red]]", for example, can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum. There is not a formalized register of different colours in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as [[musical notation|C]] or [[musical notation|C#]] in music, although the [[Pantone]] system is widely used in the printing and design industry for this purpose.

Modern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, for example, [[collage]]. This began with [[cubism]] and is not painting in strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]] or [[wood]] for their [[Texture (painting)|texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Jean Dubuffet]] or [[Anselm Kiefer]]. Modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft in favour of [[concept]]; this has led some {{Who|date=June 2011}} to say that painting, as a serious art form, is dead, although this has not deterred the majority of artists from continuing to practise it either as whole or part of their work.

==Origin of the term==
The word "humanities" is derived from the [[Renaissance Latin]] expression ''studia humanitatis'', or "study of ''[[humanitas]]''" (a classical Latin word meaning—in addition to "humanity"—"culture, refinement, education" and, specifically, an "education befitting a cultivated man"). In its usage in the early 15th century, the ''studia humanitatis'' was a course of studies that consisted of grammar, poetry, rhetoric, history, and moral philosophy, primarily derived from the study of Latin and Greek classics. The word ''humanitas'' also gave rise to the Renaissance Italian neologism ''umanisti'', whence "humanist", "[[Renaissance humanism]]".&lt;ref&gt;"humanism." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 11 Apr. 2012. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/275932/humanism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the West, the study of the humanities can be traced to ancient Greece, as the basis of a broad education for citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Bod, Rens; ''A New History of the Humanities'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; During Roman times, the concept of the seven [[liberal arts]] evolved, involving [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]] (the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]), along with [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[astrology and astronomy|astronomy]] and [[music]] (the [[quadrivium]]).&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Albert W.; ''The Humanities Today'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; These subjects formed the bulk of [[medieval]] education, with the emphasis being on the humanities as skills or "ways of doing".

A major shift occurred with the [[Renaissance humanism]] of the fifteenth century, when the humanities began to be regarded as subjects to study rather than practice, with a corresponding shift away from traditional fields into areas such as literature and history. In the 20th century, this view was in turn challenged by the [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] movement, which sought to redefine the humanities in more [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] terms suitable for a [[democracy|democratic]] society since the Greek and Roman societies in which the humanities originated were not at all democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Walling, Donovan R.; ''Under Construction: The Role of the Arts and Humanities in Postmodern Schooling'' Phi Delta Kappa Educational Foundation, Bloomington, Indiana, 1997. Humanities comes from human&lt;/ref&gt; This was in keeping with the postmodernists' nuanced view of themselves as the culmination of history.

==Today==

=== Education and employment ===
For many decades, there has been a growing public perception that a humanities education inadequately prepares graduates for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hersh|first=Richard H.|date=1997-03-01|title=Intention and Perceptions A National Survey of Public Attitudes Toward Liberal Arts Education|journal=Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning|volume=29|issue=2|pages=16–23|doi=10.1080/00091389709603100|issn=0009-1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common belief is that graduates from such programs face underemployment and incomes too low for a humanities education to be worth the investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/03/27/hooray_for_worthless_education/|title=Hooray for "worthless" education!|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|website=Salon|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, humanities graduates find employment in a wide variety of management and professional occupations. In Britain, for example, over 11,000 humanities majors found employment in the following occupations:
* Education (25.8%)
* Management (19.8%)
* Media/Literature/Arts (11.4%)
* Law (11.3%)
* Finance (10.4%)
* Civil service (5.8%)
* Not-for-profit (5.2%)
* Marketing (2.3%)
* Medicine (1.7%)
* Other (6.4%)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://torch.ox.ac.uk/sites/torch/files/publications/Humanities%20Graduates%20and%20the%20British%20Economy%20-%20University%20of%20Oxford.pdf|title=Humanities graduates and the British economy: The hidden impact|last=Kreager|first=Philip|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many humanities graduates finish university with no career goals in mind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamuti-Trache et al|first=Maria|year=2006|title=The Labour Market Value of Liberal Arts and Applied Education Programs: Evidence from British Columbia|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/cjhe/index.php/cjhe/article/view/183539/183484|journal=Canadian Journal of Higher Education|volume=36|pages=49–74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thought Vlogger|title=What can you do with a humanities degree?|date=2018-08-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnJbi2Fiiz8|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many spend the first few years after graduation deciding what to do next, resulting in lower incomes at the start of their career; meanwhile, graduates from career-oriented programs experience more rapid entry into the labour market. However, usually within five years of graduation, humanities graduates find an occupation or career path that appeals to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koc|first=Edwin W|year=2010|title=The Liberal Arts Graduate College Hiring Market|url=https://canvas.wisc.edu/files/77515/download?download_frd=1&amp;verifier=yadEsAdLKIQpRNLKXPwePhZh1jVmeqF7AInh8qDc|journal=National Association of Colleges and Employers|volume=|pages=14–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2008/2008155.pdf|title=Ten Years After College: Comparing the Employment Experiences of 1992–93 Bachelor's Degree Recipients With Academic and Career Oriented Majors|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is empirical evidence that graduates from humanities programs earn less than graduates from other university programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-626-x/11-626-x2014040-eng.htm|title=The Cumulative Earnings of Postsecondary Graduates Over 20 Years: Results by Field of Study|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=64|title=Earnings of Humanities Majors with a Terminal Bachelor's Degree|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/career_earnings_by_college_major/|title=Career earnings by college major|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the empirical evidence also shows that humanities graduates still earn notably higher incomes than workers with no postsecondary education, and have job satisfaction levels comparable to their peers from other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=5–6, 12, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanities graduates also earn more as their careers progress; ten years after graduation, the income difference between humanities graduates and graduates from other university programs is no longer statistically significant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Humanities graduates can earn even higher incomes if they obtain advanced or professional degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=10777|title=Boost in Median Annual Earnings Associated with Obtaining an Advanced Degree, by Gender and Field of Undergraduate Degree|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=10780|title=Earnings of Humanities Majors with an Advanced Degree|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
{{Main|Humanities in the United States}}

====The Humanities Indicators====
The [[Humanities Indicators]], unveiled in 2009 by the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], are the first comprehensive compilation of data about the humanities in the United States, providing scholars, policymakers and the public with detailed information on humanities education from primary to higher education, the humanities workforce, humanities funding and research, and public humanities activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amacad.org/ |title=American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences |publisher=Amacad.org |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/ |title=Humanities Indicators |publisher=Humanities Indicators |date= |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeled after the National Science Board's Science and Engineering Indicators, the Humanities Indicators are a source of reliable benchmarks to guide analysis of the state of the humanities in the United States.

If "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charette |first=Robert N. |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth – IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date=2013-08-30 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; statements about a "crisis" in the humanities are also misleading and ignore data of the sort collected by the Humanities Indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Humanities-Scholars-See/140311/ Humanities Scholars See Declining Prestige, Not a Lack of Interest]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/A-Collection-of-Articles-and/140205/ Debating the State of the Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Humanities in American Life''====
The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, ''The Humanities in American Life'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world where irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====As a major====

In 1950, a little over 1 percent of 22-year-olds in the United States had earned a humanities degrees (defined as a degree in English, language, history, philosophy); in 2010, this had doubled to about 2 and a half percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Ben|title=A Crisis in the Humanities? (10 June 2013)|url=http://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2013/06/10/the-humanities-crisis/|website=The Chronicle|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this is because there was an overall rise in the number of Americans who have any kind of college degree. (In 1940, 4.6 percent had a four-year degree; in 2016, 33.4 percent had one.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Reid|title=Census: More Americans have college degrees than ever before|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/326995-census-more-americans-have-college-degrees-than-ever-before|accessdate=4 February 2018|publisher=The Hill|date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a percentage of the type of degrees awarded, however, the humanities seem to be declining. Harvard University provides one example. In 1954, 36 percent of Harvard undergraduates majored in the humanities, but in 2012, only 20 percent took that course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuessler|first1=Jennifer|title=Humanities Committee Sounds an Alarm|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/arts/humanities-committee-sounds-an-alarm.html|accessdate=4 February 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Benjamin Schmidt of Northeastern University has documented that between 1990 to 2008, degrees in English, history, foreign languages, and philosophy have decreased from 8 percent to just under 5 percent of all U.S. college degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-14/the-great-recession-never-ended-for-college-humanities|title=The Great Recession Never Ended for College Humanities|last=Smith|first=Noah|date=14 August 2018|website=Bloomberg|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In liberal arts education====
[[The Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences]] 2013 report ''The Heart of the Matter'' supports the notion of a broad "[[Liberal arts colleges|liberal arts education]]", which includes study in disciplines from the natural sciences to the arts as well as the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/06/18/humanities-social-sciences-column/2436093/ Humanities, social sciences critical to our future]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/428644/august-15-2013/richard-brodhead Colbert Report: The humanities do pay]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[colleges]] provide such an education; some require it. The [[University of Chicago]] and [[Columbia University]] were among the first schools to require an extensive [[core curriculum]] in philosophy, literature, and the arts for all students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Menand]], "The Problem of General Education," in ''The Marketplace of Ideas'' (W. W. Norton, 2010), especially pp. 32–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Other colleges with nationally recognized, mandatory programs in the liberal arts are [[Fordham University]], [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]], [[Saint Anselm College]] and [[Providence College]]. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included [[Mortimer J. Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.; "A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E. D. Hirsch, Jr.]].

====In the digital age====
Researchers in the humanities have developed numerous large- and small-scale digital corpora, such as digitized collections of historical texts, along with the digital tools and methods to analyze them. Their aim is both to uncover new knowledge about corpora and to visualize research data in new and revealing ways. Much of this activity occurs in a field called the [[digital humanities]].

====STEM====
Politicians in the United States currently espouse a need for increased funding of the [[STEM fields]], science, technology, engineering, mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/reform |title=Whitehouse.gov |access-date=2014-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021222654/http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/reform |archive-date=2014-10-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal funding represents a much smaller fraction of funding for humanities than other fields such as STEM or medicine.&lt;ref name="bi_26Jun2013"&gt;''America Is Raising A Generation Of Kids Who Can't Think Or Write Clearly'', [http://www.businessinsider.com/the-war-against-humanities-2013-6 Business Insider]&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a decline of quality in both college and pre-college education in the humanities field.&lt;ref name="bi_26Jun2013"/&gt;

Former four-term Louisiana Governor, [[Edwin Edwards]] (D), has recently acknowledged the importance of the humanities. In a video address&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUY5c9IrAHE YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; to the academic conference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scedhs2014.uqam.ca/en/program.html Scedhs2014.uqam.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revolutions in Eighteenth-Century Sociability'', Edwards said
:Without the humanities to teach us how history has succeeded or failed in directing the fruits of technology and science to the betterment of our tribe of ''homo sapiens'', without the humanities to teach us how to frame the discussion and to properly debate the uses-and the costs-of technology, without the humanities to teach us how to safely debate how to create a more just society with our fellow man and woman, technology and science would eventually default to the  ownership of—and misuse by—the most influential, the most powerful, the most feared among us.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/8919778/Introductory_remarks_by_former_four-term_Louisiana_Governor_Edwin_W._Edwards_Honorary_Chair_Montreal_Enlightenment_Conference_October_18_2014 Academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Asia===

====The value of the humanities debate====

The contemporary debate in the field of critical university studies centers around the declining value of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Collini]], "What Are Universities For?"(Penguin 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Small]], "The Value of the Humanities"(Oxford University Press 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; As in America, there is a perceived decline in interest within higher education policy in research that is qualitative and does not produce marketable products. This threat can be seen in a variety of forms across Europe, but much critical attention has been given to the field of research assessment in particular. For example, the UK [Research Excellence Framework] has been subject to criticism due to its assessment criteria from across the humanities, and indeed, the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Palgrave Communications 3, Article number: 17020 (2017)
doi:10.1057/palcomms.2017.20&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the notion of "impact" has generated significant debate.&lt;ref&gt;The Social Impact of the Arts http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9780230572553&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bulaitis|first=Zoe|year=2017|title=Measuring impact in the humanities: Learning from accountability and economics in a contemporary history of cultural value|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-017-0002-7|journal=Palgrave Communications|via=|doi=10.1057/s41599-017-0002-7|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical history==

===Citizenship and self-reflection===

Since the late 19th century, a central justification for the humanities has been that it aids and encourages self-reflection—a self-reflection that, in turn, helps develop personal consciousness or an active sense of civic duty.

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Gadamer|Hans-Georg Gadamer]] centered the humanities' attempt to distinguish itself from the natural sciences in [[humankind]]'s urge to understand its own experiences. This understanding, they claimed, ties like-minded people from similar cultural backgrounds together and provides a sense of cultural continuity with the philosophical past.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dilthey|Dilthey, Wilhelm]]. ''The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in the late 20th and early 21st centuries extended that "narrative imagination"&lt;ref&gt;von Wright, Moira. "Narrative imagination and taking the perspective of others," ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'' 21, 4–5 (July, 2002), 407–416.&lt;/ref&gt; to the ability to understand the records of lived experiences outside of one's own individual social and cultural context. Through that narrative [[imagination]], it is claimed, humanities scholars and students develop a [[conscience]] more suited to the multicultural world we live in.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum|Nussbaum, Martha]]. ''[[Martha Nussbaum#Cultivating Humanity|Cultivating Humanity]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That conscience might take the form of a passive one that allows more effective [[self-reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harpham | first1 = Geoffrey | year = 2005 | title = Beneath and Beyond the Crisis of the Humanities | url = | journal = [[New Literary History]] | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 21–36 | doi=10.1353/nlh.2005.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt; or extend into active empathy that facilitates the dispensation of civic duties a responsible world citizen must engage in.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; There is disagreement, however, on the level of influence humanities study can have on an individual and whether or not the understanding produced in humanistic enterprise can guarantee an "identifiable positive effect on people."&lt;ref&gt;Harpham, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanistic theories and practices===
There are three major branches of knowledge: [[natural sciences]], [[social sciences]], and the humanities. [[Technology]] is the practical extension  of the natural sciences, as [[politics]] is the extension of the social sciences. Similarly, the humanities have their own practical extension, sometimes called "transformative humanities" (transhumanities) or "culturonics" ([[Mikhail Epstein]]'s term):
* Nature – natural sciences – technology –&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;transformation of nature
* 
* Society – social sciences –&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;politics&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;transformation of society
* 
* Culture – human sciences –&amp;nbsp;culturonics&amp;nbsp;– transformation of culture&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Epstein. ''The Transformative Humanities: A Manifesto''. New York and London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2012, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
Technology, politics and culturonics are designed to transform what their respective disciplines study: nature, society, and culture. The field of transformative humanities includes various   practicies and technologies, for example, [[language planning]], the construction of new languages, like [[Esperanto]], and invention of new artistic and literary genres and movements in the genre of [[manifesto]], like [[Romanticism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], or [[Surrealism]].  Humanistic [[invention]] in the sphere of culture, as a practice complementary to scholarship, is an important aspect of the humanities.

===Truth and meaning===

The divide between humanistic study and natural sciences informs arguments of meaning in humanities as well. What distinguishes the humanities from the [[natural science]]s is not a certain subject matter, but rather the mode of approach to any question. Humanities focuses on understanding meaning, purpose, and goals and furthers the appreciation of singular historical and social phenomena—an interpretive method of finding "truth"—rather than explaining the causality of events or uncovering the truth of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey, Wilhelm]]. ''The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its societal application, narrative imagination is an important tool in the (re)production of understood meaning in history, culture and literature.

Imagination, as part of the tool kit of artists or scholars, helps create meaning that invokes a response from an audience. Since a humanities scholar is always within the [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] of lived experiences, no "absolute" knowledge is theoretically possible; knowledge is instead a ceaseless procedure of inventing and reinventing the context a text is read in. [[Poststructuralism]] has problematized an approach to the humanistic study based on questions of meaning, intentionality, and authorship.{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} In the wake of [[Death of the author|the death of the author]] proclaimed by [[Barthes|Roland Barthes]], various theoretical currents such as [[deconstruction]] and [[discourse]] analysis seek to expose the ideologies and rhetoric operative in producing both the purportedly meaningful objects and the [[hermeneutic]] subjects of humanistic study. This exposure has opened up the interpretive structures of the humanities to criticism humanities scholarship is "unscientific" and therefore unfit for inclusion in modern university curricula because of the very nature of its changing contextual meaning.{{Dubious|date=February 2010}}

===Pleasure, the pursuit of knowledge and scholarship===

Some, like [[Stanley Fish]], have claimed that the humanities can defend themselves best by refusing to make any claims of utility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Fish|Fish, Stanley]], [http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#more-81 The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; (Fish may well be thinking primarily of literary study, rather than history and philosophy.) Any attempt to justify the humanities in terms of outside benefits such as social usefulness (say increased productivity) or in terms of ennobling effects on the individual (such as greater wisdom or diminished prejudice) is ungrounded, according to Fish, and simply places impossible demands on the relevant academic departments. Furthermore, [[critical thinking]], while arguably a result of humanistic training, can be acquired in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/the-laws-of-cool-knowledge-work-and-the-culture-of-information-catalogue-copy-and-table-of-contents/ Alan Liu, ''Laws of Cool,'' 2004,]&lt;/ref&gt; And the humanities do not even provide any more the kind of social cachet (what sociologists sometimes call "[[cultural capital]]") that was helpful to succeed in Western society before the age of mass education following World War II.

Instead, scholars like Fish suggest that the humanities offer a unique kind of pleasure, a pleasure based on the common pursuit of knowledge (even if it is only disciplinary knowledge). Such pleasure contrasts with the increasing privatization of leisure and instant gratification characteristic of Western culture; it thus meets [[Jürgen Habermas]]' requirements for the disregard of social status and rational problematization of previously unquestioned areas necessary for an endeavor which takes place in the bourgeois [[public sphere]]. In this argument, then, only the academic pursuit of pleasure can provide a link between the private and the public realm in modern Western consumer society and strengthen that public sphere that, according to many theorists,{{who|date=May 2012}} is the foundation for modern democracy.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Others, like [[Mark Bauerlein]], argue that professors in the humanities have increasingly abandoned proven methods of [[epistemology]] (''I care only about the quality of your arguments, not your conclusions.'') in favor of [[indoctrination]] (''I care only about your conclusions, not the quality of your arguments.''). The result is that professors and their students adhere rigidly to a limited set of viewpoints, and have little interest in, or understanding of, opposing viewpoints. Once they obtain this intellectual self-satisfaction, persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Romanticization and rejection===

Implicit in many of these arguments supporting the humanities are the makings of arguments against public support of the humanities. [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]] asserts that we live in a changing world, a world where "cultural capital" is replaced with ''[[scientific literacy]]'', and in which the romantic notion of a Renaissance humanities scholar is obsolete. Such arguments appeal to judgments and anxieties about the essential uselessness of the humanities, especially in an age when it is seemingly vitally important for scholars of literature, history and the arts to engage in "collaborative work with experimental scientists or even simply to make "intelligent use of the findings from empirical science."&lt;ref&gt;""Theory," Anti-Theory, and Empirical Criticism," ''Biopoetics: Evolutionary Explorations in the Arts'', Brett Cooke and Frederick Turner, eds., Lexington, Kentucky: ICUS Books, 1999, pp. 144–145. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Humanities Indicators''' is a project of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] that equips researchers and policymakers, universities, foundations, museums, libraries, humanities councils and other public institutions with statistical tools for answering basic questions about primary and secondary humanities education, undergraduate and graduate education in the [[humanities]], the humanities workforce, levels and sources of program funding, public understanding and impact of the humanities, and other areas of concern in the humanities community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/First-National-Picture-of/1437 ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', "First National Picture of Trends in the Humanities Is Unveiled"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/system/inTheNews.aspx Indicators in the News].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Data from the Humanities Indicators has been widely discussed in recent conversations about a "crisis in the humanities", in light of a national decline in the number of college majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/06/05/analysis-finds-significant-drop-humanities-majors-gains-liberal-arts-degrees|title=Humanities Majors Drop|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|date=June 5, 2017|work=Inside Higher Ed|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/liberal-arts-majors-are-a-dying-breed-2017-06-05|title=Liberal arts majors are a dying breed|last=Berman|first=Jillian|date=July 30, 2017|work=MarketWatch|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address questions about the workforce outcomes of humanities graduates (which are often cited as playing a role in the falling number of majors as of 2015), the Indicators issued [https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/publications/researchpapersmonographs/HI_Workforce-2018.pdf ''The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond''], which examined not only their employment and earnings relative to other fields, but also graduates’ satisfaction with their work after graduation and their lives more generally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Humanities in the United States''' refers to the study of [[humanities]] disciplines, such as literature, history, language, performing and visual arts or philosophy, in the [[United States|United States of America]].

Many American colleges and universities seek to provide a broad "[[liberal arts education]]", in which all [[college]] students to study the humanities in addition to their specific area of study. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included [[Mortimer J. Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.; "A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E.D. Hirsch]].  A liberal arts focus is often coupled with curricular requirements; colleges including [[Saint Anselm College]] and [[Providence College]] have mandatory two-year [[core curricula]] in the humanities for their students.

The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, ''The Humanities in American Life'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world in which irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conceptual validity==
The very concept of the ‘humanities’ as a  class or kind, distinct from the ’sciences’, has come under repeated attack in the twentieth century. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|T.S. Kuhn]]’s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas]], ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1962&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the forces driving scientific progress often have less to do with objective inference from unbiased observation than with much more value-laden sociological and cultural factors. More recently, [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that the distinction between the sciences and the humanities is harmful to both pursuits, placing the former on an undeserved pedestal and condemning the latter to irrationality. Rorty’s position requires a wholesale rejection of such traditional philosophical distinctions as those between appearance and reality, subjective and objective, replacing them with what he endorses as a new ‘fuzziness’. This leads to a kind of pragmatism where "the oppositions between the humanities, the arts, and the sciences, might gradually fade away... In this situation, ‘the humanities’ would no longer think of themselves as such...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty|Rorty, Richard]], ''Science as Solidarity'', in ''Objectivity, Relativism and Truth: Philosophical Papers Volume I'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism and postmodernism==
In the United States, the late 20th century saw a challenge to the "elitism" of the humanities, which [[Edward Said]] has characterized as a "conservative philosophy of gentlemanly refinement, or sensibility." Such [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] argued that the humanities should go beyond the study of "[[dead white males]]" to include work by women and people of color, and without religious bias. The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] has been a very influential part of this movement, stating in ''The Order of Things'' that "we can study only individuals, not human nature."  However some in the humanities believed that such changes could be detrimental; the result is said to be what [[E. D. Hirsch Jr.]] refers to as declining [[cultural literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kernan, Alvin, editor; ''What's Happened to the Humanities?'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, New Jersey, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==National institutions==
President [[Lyndon Johnson]] signed the [[National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/overview.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; creating the National Council on the Humanities, and funded the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) in 1969. NEH is an independent grant-making agency of the United States government dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities (see [[Public humanities]]).

NEH facilitated the creation of State Humanities Councils&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/statecouncils.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 56 [[U.S. state]]s and [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Each council operates independently, defining the "humanities" in relationship to the disciplines, subjects, and values valued in the regions they serve. Councils give grant funds to individuals, scholars, and nonprofit organizations dedicated to the humanities in their region. Councils also offer diverse programs and services that respond to the needs of their communities and according to their own definitions of the humanities.

==Career prospects==
Criticism of the traditional humanities/liberal arts degree program has been leveled by critics who see them as both expensive and relatively "useless" in the modern American job market, where several years of specialized study is required in most job fields. According to a 2018 report by the [[Humanities Indicators]], unemployment rates for humanities majors were slightly higher and their earnings were slightly lower than the averages for college degree recipients with similar degree levels (though both were still substantially better than for those without a college degree). Their overall levels of satisfaction with their jobs and their lives, however, were essentially the same as graduates from other fields, with more than 85% of humanities graduates reporting they were satisfied with their jobs. As of 2015, approximately five million people employed in management and professional jobs had bachelor’s degrees in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=5-6, 12, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixing and matching is the unavoidable process in the making of inner connections and the presentations of interculturalities. The majority of the works in intercultural theatre deal basically with thinking and doing around the themes, stories, pre-performative or performative concepts of Asian classical theatre or traditional performing arts forms and practices, mixing and matching the concepts or the ideas of the foreign.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415092167 "Theatre world performance politics culture"]&lt;/ref&gt; After the well-known success of Peter Brook's production of the Mahabharata,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smith.edu/metamorphoses/issues/links/hellwegpeter.html "Metamorphoses"]&lt;/ref&gt; the trend has been evolving tremendously around the globe and many the cultural institutions of many governments have become directly interested in pushing the boundaries of intercultural senses and sensitivities by financially investing on new theatrical productions, university research, conferences and fellowships&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/news-and-events/news-archive "SUSI Grants"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The three major groups of intercultural theatre ==

===Imitational theatre===
The intended audience is from the same culture, or a foreign audience from a different culture and the theater group, or the actors or performers, come from the same cultural background or from very diverse foreign cultural backgrounds. The production may imitate foreign styles, the production procedures may introduce new techniques, a new style of acting or a new style of presentation for a group of actors from various cultures or the same culture, the production may include foreign languages, costumes, scenic themes and other aspects. There are many examples of intercultural theatre groups, people, and institutions who are experimenting with various levels of mixing and matching of traditional or contemporary aspects of theatre training and presentations in this type of Imitational Theatre. 

After the global acceptance of renowned theatre director Peter Brook, many theatre directors went after Asian traditional theatre art forms and other Asian representational systems, in order to develop and portray their own theatre presentations using, or somehow capitalizing on the actor training systems and scenic representations belonging to those particular Asian theatres, such as the Noh theatre, Kathakali, Chinese opera etcetera. While Peter Brook was successful in his approach to a universally accepted vision of theatre-making through the Asian theatre systems --beyond the parameters of imitating different theatrical topics-- many other younger institutions or directorial approaches are kept within the parameters of imitations or comparisons, or only exchanges of physical exercises.

===Adaptive theatre===
There are two types of intercultural theatre within adapted theatre. One can consider "the norm" to represent what the audience of a certain culture expects/has typically been exposed to:

* '''Adapts to the norm''' - traditional style productions that have been consciously adapted to fit with the cultural expectations of the intended audience of another culture.
* '''Adapts away from the norm''' - the original culture dominates but it borrows foreign elements to enlarge the range of expression (e.g. [[TheatreWorks (Singapore)]] and [[Ong Keng Sen]]; [[International Centre for Theatre Research]] and [[Peter Brook]]; and [[The Bridge - Stage of the Arts#Betty Comden's article about the festival|The Bridge - Stage of the Arts]])

===Universal theatre===
The aim of universal theatre is to be recognized and accepted by audience members from a wide range of cultural backgrounds (e.g. [[Peter Brook#The Mahabharata|The Mahabharata, Peter Brook]], [http://www.performingarts.jp/e/data_art/other/p-10481.html Hiroshi Koike] [http://kikh.com/ Bridge Project- The Mahabharata],&lt;ref&gt;[http://pappa-tara.com "Performing Arts Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://barihochwald.com/ Bari Hochwald] [http://theglobaltheatreproject.org/ The Global Theatre Project],&lt;ref&gt;[http://theglobaltheatreproject.org "The Global Theatre Project"]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tfana.org/education/programs/world-theatre The World Theatre Project], [http://www.peoplestheatreproject.org/ People's Theatre Project] etc.)

==The sub-divisions of intercultural theatre==
Globalization supported in the developments of intercultural theatre in various directions and evolutions of point of views by the theatre practitioners, scholars, funders and producers(British Council, Fulbright, Ford foundation, [http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Rockefeller-Foundation-Awards-1128 The Rockefeller foundation]) particularly using English language as the main medium of communication for knowing, acknowledging, debating, reasoning, considering, teaching, learning, writing, speaking, adapting, translating or transforming the one culture to the other culture in large contexts and in detailed micro contexts. Primarily the discourses of intercultural theatre practice developed out of the re-source influences of western theatre arts, western theoreticians and western theatre practitioners. (e.g. [http://www.odinteatret.dk/about-us/eugenio-barba.aspx%20 Eugenio Barba], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [http://www.theworkcenter.org/ Thomas Richards], [[Peter Brook]], [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]],[http://www.phillipzarrilli.com/ Phillip Zarilli])

===American intercultural theatre===
*For many theatre cultures, American intercultural theatre has given the possibilities of new exchanges, experiments, researches and pioneer introductions of model attempts in theatre making. There are many directors, teachers or theatre artists began working with the sources of American point of views in the intercultural attempts and some of them are [http://rasaboxes.org/about/eca-biographies/ Richard Schechner], [http://www.phillipzarrilli.com/ Phillip Zarilli], Robert Wilson,Christian DuComb Phd, Prof.Esther Kim Lee, Ellen Stewart-La MaMa, Lee Breuer-Mabou Mines, Hugh Gittens, Anne Bogart, Phillip Glass etc.

===Australian intercultural theatre===

===British intercultural theatre===

===Canadian intercultural theatre===

==Non-Native English language speaking countries intercultural theatre==
*English is the primary medium of communication in the intercultural theatre scene worldwide and American English or British English used as the mother source language to make all transactions related with theatre training, teaching and performing. Many non English countries have welcomed the English language as the official medium for the citizens and thus opened possibilities of any business. The culture is also part of business in the sense of in-coming and out-going, travelling or transforming stories, experiences, music, histories and philosophies. The dramatic theories and the acting coaching is mainly developed by the American or European masters of contemporary theatre. The non native English language speaking cultures supported the new experiences, exchanges, experiments to present the new shows.

*Intercultural theatre director
Intercultural theatre director is a stage director/instructor specialized in the intercultural theatre field who oversees every creative aspects of occupation towards a theatre production (text based play, non-text based play, myths &amp; stories,  adaptation of a play or a devised piece of artistic work) through the medium of exchange or borrowing diverse elements from less known culture, practice mixing or collaborating with one or plural different well-known cultural elements or practices and vice versa to have quality and completeness in the realization. The intercultural director will lead the creative members of the team to achieve his/her artistic vision for the production and objectively collaborate with the various mixing elements of performance,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0415281881 "John Martin Intercultural Performance"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[classical drama]], Forms of drama, [[Twentieth-century theatre]], literature, languages, translations, music, stage craft, [[costume design]], [[acting]], [[List of acting techniques|acting techniques]], props, [[stage combat]], [[set design]] and light design for the intercultural production.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the humanities:

'''[[Humanities]]''' &amp;ndash; [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] that study the [[human condition]], using methods that are primarily [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[Critical theory|critical]], or [[speculative philosophy|speculative]], as distinguished from the mainly [[empirical]] approaches of the [[Science|natural sciences]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What types of thing are the humanities? ==

The humanities can be described as all of the following:
* a branch of [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is a field of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
* study of the [[human condition]] &amp;ndash; unique and inescapable features of being human in a social, cultural, and personal context. The study of the humanities (history, philosophy, literature, the arts, etc.) all help understand the nature of the human condition and the broader cultural and social arrangements that make up human lives.

== The various humanities ==

* [[Classics]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of classical studies|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the languages, literature, philosophy, history, art, archaeology and all other cultural elements of the ancient Mediterranean world (Bronze Age ca. BC 3000 to Late Antiquity ca. AD 300–600); especially Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.
** [[Digital classics]] &amp;ndash; application of the tools of digital humanities to the field of classics, or more broadly to the study of the ancient world.
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
** [[Digital history]] &amp;ndash;  use of digital media and tools for historical practice, presentation, analysis, and research. It is a branch of the Digital Humanities and an outgrowth of Quantitative history, Cliometrics, and History and Computing.
* [[Language]]s &amp;ndash; study of individual languages ([[Italian language]], [[Japanese language]]) or groups of related languages ([[Romance languages]], [[Slavic languages]]). Not to be confused with [[Linguistics]], the study of the structure and function of language.
* [[Literature]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of literature|outline]]) &amp;ndash; the art of written work, and is not confined to published sources (although, under some circumstances, unpublished sources can also be exempt).
** [[Comparative literature]] &amp;nbsp; comparative research into literature from more than one language, working with the original languages in which the texts were written
* [[Philosophy]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of philosophy|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with [[Ontology|existence]], [[Epistemology|knowledge]], [[Axiology|values]], reason, [[Philosophy of mind|mind]], and language.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Teichmann and Katherine C. Evans, ''Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide'' (Blackwell Publishing, 1999), p. 1: "Philosophy is a study of problems which are ultimate, abstract and very general. These problems are concerned with the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, reason and human purpose."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A.C. Grayling]], ''Philosophy 1: A Guide through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 1: "The aim of philosophical inquiry is to gain insight into questions about knowledge, truth, reason, reality, meaning, mind, and value."&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on [[reason|rational argument]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: "Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less [[:wikt:systematic|systematic]] kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Religion]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of religion|outline]]) &amp;ndash; a religion is a collection of [[cultural systems]], [[belief systems]], and [[worldviews]] that establishes symbols that relate humanity to [[spirituality]] and, sometimes,&lt;!--not all religions concern themselves with morality--&gt; to moral values.&lt;ref&gt;While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system" (Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973). A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category." (Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and sacred histories that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[origin of life]] or the [[universe]]. They tend to derive [[Moral code|morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]].
* [[Visual arts]] ([[Outline of the visual arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art forms that create works which are primarily visual in nature. Examples of visual arts include:
** [[Architecture]] ([[Outline of architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; The art and science of designing and erecting buildings and other physical structures.
*** [[Classical architecture]] ([[Outline of classical architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; architecture of classical antiquity and later architectural styles influenced by it.
** [[Handicraft|Arts and crafts]] ([[Outline of crafts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; recreational activities and hobbies that involve making things with one's hands and skill.
** [[Drawing]] ([[Outline of drawing and drawings|outline]]) &amp;ndash; visual art that makes use of any number of drawing instruments to mark a two-dimensional medium.
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures.
** [[Painting]] ([[Outline of painting|outline]]) &amp;ndash; practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a surface with a brush or other object.
** [[Art history]]
** [[Photography]] ([[Outline of photography|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art, science, and practice of creating pictures by recording radiation on a radiation-sensitive medium, such as a photographic film, or electronic image sensors.
** [[Sculpture]] ([[Outline of sculpture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; three-dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard materials - typically stone such as marble - or metal, glass, or wood.
* [[Performing arts]] ([[Outline of performing arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; those forms of art that use the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium.  Examples of performing arts include:
** [[Dance]] ([[Outline of dance|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form of movement of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of expression, social interaction, or presented in a spiritual or performance setting.
** [[Drama]] &amp;nbsp; study of regional, global, or historical theatre, as well as techniques for acting, directing and choreographing plays
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures, the art form that records performances visually.
** [[Installation art]] &amp;ndash; the merging of multiple genres into a coherent three-dimensional, multi-sensory work.
** [[Theatre]] ([[Outline of theatre|outline]]) &amp;ndash; collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place.
** [[Music]] ([[Outline of music|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form the medium of which is sound and silence.
** [[Opera]] ([[List of opera topics|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (called a libretto) and musical score.&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions of opera: "dramatic performance or composition of which music is an essential part, branch of art concerned with this" (''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]''); "any dramatic work that can be sung (or at times declaimed or spoken) in a place for performance, set to original music for singers (usually in costume) and instrumentalists" (Amanda Holden, ''Viking Opera Guide''); "musical work for the stage with singing characters, originated in early years of 17th century" (''[[Pears Cyclopaedia]]'', 1983 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Stagecraft]] ([[Outline of stagecraft|outline]]) &amp;ndash; technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound.

=== Humanities that are also social sciences ===
* [[Anthropology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of anthropology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of how humans developed biologically and culturally.
* [[Archaeology]] &amp;nbsp; research into human history by locating and studying artifacts, structural remains, and other surviving evidence
* [[Area studies]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular geographical, national/federal, or cultural regions. The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the social sciences and the humanities. Typical area studies programs involve history, political science, sociology, cultural studies, languages, geography, literature, and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include diaspora and emigration from the area studied.
* [[Communication studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of communication|outline]]) &amp;ndash; deals with processes of human communication, commonly defined as the sharing of symbols to create meaning. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts.
* [[Cultural studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of culture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary academic field grounded in [[critical theory]] and [[literary criticism]] that attempts to understand the political dynamics of contemporary culture, as well as its historical foundations, conflicts, and defining traits. Researchers concentrate on how a particular [[medium (communication)|medium]] or [[message]] relates to [[ideology]], [[social class]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] and [[gender]] rather than investigating a particular culture or area of the world.&lt;ref&gt;In a loosely related but separate usage, the phrase '''cultural studies''' sometimes serves as a rough [[synonym]] for '''[[area studies]]''', as a general term referring to the academic study of particular cultures in departments and programs such as [[Islamic studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[African American studies]], ''et al.''. However, strictly speaking, cultural studies programs  are not concerned with specific areas of the world so much as specific cultural practices.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
* [[Law]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of law|outline]]) &amp;ndash; set of rules and principles by which a society is governed. (For branches, see ''Law'' under ''Society'' below).

* [[Psychology]] &amp;nbsp; research of psychological pathology and therapeutic treatments separate from, but complementary to, [[Psychiatry|psychiatric medicine]]

* [[Technology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of technology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; making, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, and procedures.
