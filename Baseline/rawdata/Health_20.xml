'''Age-related mobility disability''' is a self-reported inability to walk due to impairments, limited mobility, [[dexterity]] or [[Endurance|stamina]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ward, Rachel E. et al. “Sensory and Motor Peripheral Nerve Function and Incident Mobility Disability.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 62.12 (2014): 2273–2279. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found mostly in older adults with decreased strength in lower extremities.&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"&gt;Guralnik, Jack M., et al. "Lower extremity function and subsequent disability consistency across studies, predictive models, and value of gait speed alone compared with the Short Physical Performance Battery." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 55.4 (2000): M221-M231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]], the population of older adults is expected to increase in the United States by 2030 due to the aging population of the [[baby boomer]] generation; this will increase the population of mobility [[disabled]] individuals in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Feasley, Jill C., ed. Health outcomes for older people: Questions for the coming decade. National Academies, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the importance of being able to predict disability due to inability to walk at an early stage, which will eventually decrease health care costs. Aging cause a decrease in physical strength and in lower extremities which ultimately leads to decrease in functional mobility,&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"/&gt;  in turn leading to disability which is shown to be common in women due to differences in distribution of resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Zunzunegui, M. V., et al. "The mobility gap between older men and women: the embodiment of gender." Archives of gerontology and geriatrics 61.2 (2015): 140-148.&lt;/ref&gt; The early detection of mobility disabilities will help clinicians and patients in determining the early management of the conditions which could be associated with the future disability. Mobility disabilites are not restricted to older and [[hospitalized]] individuals; such disabilities have been reported in young and non-hospitalized individuals as well due to decreased functional mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Iezzoni, Lisa I et al. “Mobility Difficulties Are Not Only a Problem of Old Age.” Journal of General Internal Medicine 16.4 (2001): 235–243. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in the rate of disability causes loss of functional independence &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Hirvensalo, Mirja, Taina Rantanen, and Eino Heikkinen. "Mobility difficulties and physical activity as predictors of mortality and loss of independence in the community‐living older population." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 48.5 (2000): 493-498.&lt;/ref&gt; and increases the risk of future [[chronic diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuben, David B., et al. "Value of functional status as a predictor of mortality: results of a prospective study." The American journal of medicine 93.6 (1992): 663-669., Manton, Kenneth G. "A longitudinal study of functional change and mortality in the United States." Journal of Gerontology 43.5 (1988): S153-S161., Khokhar, Shafiq R., et al. "Persistent mobility deficit in the absence of deficits in activities of daily living: a risk factor for mortality." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 49.11 (2001): 1539-1543.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- As we have come across the importance of early detection of disability due to inability to walk, the question arises, in which conditions a person has decreased functional mobility or is disabled.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} --&gt;

==Definition==

There are many definitions that contribute in providing the meaning of mobility disability, it is stated as the “self-reports of a lot of difficulties or inability to walk a quarter section|quarter of a mile” &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; without sitting and within time limit of fifteen minutes &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254., Vestergaard, Sonja et al. “Stopping to Rest during a 400-Meter Walk and Incident Mobility Disability in Older Persons with Functional Limitations.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 57.2 (2009): 260–265. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Marsh, Anthony P. et al. “Muscle Strength and BMI as Predictors of Major Mobility Disability in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot (LIFE-P).” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 66A.12 (2011): 1376–1383. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to walk within this time frame results in the use of [[mobility aid]] devices such as [[mobility scooter]], [[wheelchair]], [[crutches]] or a [[walker (mobility)|walker]] which will eventually help in the community [[ambulation]]. Another term that is coined to define mobility disabilities based on performance is “performance based mobility disability”.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Noreen et al. “Performance-Based Measures of Physical Function as Mortality Predictors: Incremental Value beyond Self-Reports.” Demographic research 30.7 (2014): 227–252. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the inability to increase your walking speed more than 0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;Tinetti, Mary E., et al. "Shared risk factors for falls, incontinence, and functional dependence: unifying the approach to geriatric syndromes." Jama 273.17 (1995): 1348-1353., Rantanen, Taina, et al. "Coimpairments: strength and balance as predictors of severe walking disability." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 54.4 (1999): M172-M176., Melzer, David et al. “The Apolipoprotein E e4 Polymorphism Is Strongly Associated With Poor Mobility Performance Test Results But Not Self-Reported Limitation in Older People.” The Journals of Gerontology. Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 60.10 (2005): 1319–1323. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; If an individual is unable to walk at &gt;0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s, he or she is considered severely disabled and would require a [[mobility device]] to walk in community.

==Risk factors==

There are number of factors that could be associated with [[mobility disability]], but according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], “[[stroke]] is found to be the leading cause of [[mobility disability]], in turn reducing functional mobility in more than half of the [[stroke]] survivors above 65 years of age”.&lt;ref&gt;Mozaffarian, Dariush, et al. "Executive summary: Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2016 update: A report from the American Heart Association." Circulation 133.4 (2016): 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==

There are several measurement scales designed to detect mobility disabilities. The measures that can detect mobility disabilities are classified into two categories, [[self-reported]] measures and performance measures. There is a need to differentiate between these measures based on their ability to detect mobility disabilities, such as differences in their reliability and [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Self-reported measures are commonly used to detect mobility disabilities,&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Walter H., et al. "Self‐Reported Causes of Physical Disability in Older People: The Cardiovascular Health Study." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 42.10 (1994): 1035-1044., Odding, E et al. “Association of Locomotor Complaints and Disability in the Rotterdam Study.” Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 54.9 (1995): 721–725. Print., Leveille, Suzanne G, Linda Fried, and Jack M Guralnik. “Disabling Symptoms: What Do Older Women Report?” Journal of General Internal Medicine 17.10 (2002): 766–773. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Keenan, Anne‐maree, et al. "Impact of multiple joint problems on daily living tasks in people in the community over age fifty‐five." Arthritis Care &amp; Research 55.5 (2006): 757-764., Mottram, Sara, et al. "Patterns of pain and mobility limitation in older people: cross-sectional findings from a population survey of 18,497 adults aged 50 years and over." Quality of Life Research 17.4 (2008): 529-539.&lt;/ref&gt; but recently developed performance measures have been shown to be effective in predicting future mobility disabilities in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-reported measures===

Several [[qualitative research]] studies use [[survey (human research)]], [[questionnaires]] and [[self-reported]] scales to detect a decrease in functional mobility or to predict future [[mobility disability]] in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Pruitt, Leslie A. et al. “Use of Accelerometry to Measure Physical Activity in Older Adults at Risk for Mobility Disability.” Journal of aging and physical activity 16.4 (2008): 416–434. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of these [[qualitative research]] scales are easier [[data acquisition]] and can be performed on the larger population. Although there is difference in [[perception]] of condition between subjects (gender difference), type of [[chronic conditions]] and age-related changes such as memory and reasoning, all of which can affect the information and scores of the individual, still [[self-reported]] measures have been used extensively in behavioral and [[correlation]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;Baranowski, Tom. "Validity and reliability of self-report measures of physical activity: an information-processing perspective." Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport 59.4 (1988): 314-327.&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly used [[self-reported]] measures to detect [[mobility disability]] are [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale], [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel index]], [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale]. 
Based on reliability and validity of these scales, [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale] has proven to have excellent [[test-retest reliability]] and [[construct validity]], however, if it can predict future mobility disability in older adults is yet to be found. In contrast, [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel Index]] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale] proved important to predict future [[mobility disability]] based on the activities involved in these [[questionnaire]] scales.

===Performance-based measures===

Mobility disabilities due to age-related [[musculoskeletal]] pain or increase in [[chronic condition|chronic]] conditions are easier to detect by performance measures.  Some commonly used performance measures to detect mobility disabilities are the 400-meter walking test, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.1790010108/pdf 5-minute walk test ], [[walking speed]],  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test]. 
Among these measures, [http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400-meter walk test] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] has been proven to be strong predictors of [[mobility disability]] in older adults. In addition to prediction, there is moderate to excellent [[correlation]] between these two tests.&lt;ref&gt;Vasunilashorn, Sarinnapha et al. “Use of the Short Physical Performance Battery Score to Predict Loss of Ability to Walk 400 Meters: Analysis From the InCHIANTI Study.” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 64A.2 (2009): 223–229. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Based on reliability and validity of measurement scales to predict [[mobility disability]], [[self-reported]] measures such as [[Barthel index]], and [[performance]] measures such as [http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400 m walk test] and  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] are strongly associated with prediction of mobility disability in older adults.

==Caregivers Internationally==

===Australia===
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2001 paper on the health and well being of Carers, Carers save the Australian Federal Government over $30 billion a year, according to the same statistics there are over 300 000 Young Carers (Carers Australia states that a [[Young carer]] is any carer under the age of 25&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youngcarers.net.au/about-young-carers/|title=About Young Carers|last=|first=|date=|website=Carers Australia|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with 1.5 million potential young carers, where potential is defined as a young person who lives in a household where there is at least one person who requires full-time care (Is disabled etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au abs.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, carers provided around 1.9 billion hours of unpaid care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carergateway.gov.au/about-carers|title=About carers|last=|first=|date=|website=Carer Gateway|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a new study by the [[University of Queensland]], Australian carers are providing $13.2 billion worth of free mental health support to their friends and family members. This "hidden workforce" is an equivalent of 173,000 full-time mental health support workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/aussie-carers-worth-132-billion-study/news-story/cb22c5ade5842b2be365a865f6f953fc?csp=17eda110f2942da2d2e081f7cb5c6596|title=Aussie carers worth $13.2 billion: study|last=McDonald|first=Shae|date=2017-03-23|website=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia they also have The Australian National Young Carers Action Team (ANYCAT) whose goal is to advocate on behalf of young carers (Being young carers themselves) each board member is the sole representative of their state or territory and represent as few as 75 000 Young Carers.
In Most states and Territories they have an ANYCAT equivalent team or Board. In Queensland this is called Young Carers Action Board Queensland (YCABQ).

===China===
According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China 2011 report regarding China’s total population and structural changes, people belong to the age group of 60 years and above accounted for 184.99 million, which occupied 13.7 percent of the total national population at the end of 2011. The number has risen 0.47 percentage point comparing to the year of 2010. Of these, people age 65 years and above figured up 122.88 million that occupied 9.1 percent of the total and has increased 0.25 percentage points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a steadily increasing older population with a growing demand for long-term care, an issue of lacking of elderly care facilities as well as inadequate training for skilled caregivers has generated a social concern pertaining to elder care. According to the official Chinese media Xinhua, professionally qualified caregivers are in great request with approximately 10 million people needed to provide care for the Chinese aging population. However, the report also stated that only 300,000 people currently working as caregivers with less than 1/3 of them are trained properly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-08/24/content_13184532.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no organized caregiver association in China. As a result, family members still construct the major source of caregiving in China especially in rural area where the quality of health services is a problem. A recent study aims to examine the effect of depression on family members of whom sons and daughters-in-law carry out main responsibilities in caring for elderly parents have indicated several findings, including:

* The majority of caregivers choose to rely on medical resources (physicians and traditional healers) during the caregiving for older people.
* The depression score varied significantly between caregivers of healthy and non-healthy older adults.
* The severity of depressive expression associated with background of caregiving, like caregiver’s income, age, and the time spent on caregiving.
* Social support plays an important role in impacting the status of depression among family caregivers.

More recently, another Caregiver Reaction Assessment was conducted in China with a purpose to analyze the reliability and validity among family caregivers of cancer patients. The study recruited 400 participants from the Second Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang with 312 family caregivers completed the survey. This study tried to measure caregiving experience from five aspects: disrupted schedule, financial problems, lack of family support, health problems, and self-esteem. The results indicated that the Chinese version of caregiving is profoundly influenced by the conception of Confucianism that emphasizes filial piety and guides the traditional caregiving ideology. Furthermore, the average age of adult children provide care is 46 years old of whom the majorities still work to support the family. As such, adult children sometimes bear significant physical and mental strain when their personal schedule and life activities are negatively impacted.

===Italy===
When compared to all other countries Italy has the highest percentage of residents who are age 65 and older.&lt;ref name= Maroni&gt;Maroni, R. (2002, April). Italy. Statement delivered at Second world assembly on ageing, Spain. Retrieved from http://www.un.org/swaa2002/coverage/italyE.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The life expectancy for males is 76.7 and 82.9 for females, and it is predicted that by 2050 these numbers will reach 81 and 86 years, for men and women respectively.&lt;ref name=Maroni/&gt; In addition, the country is faced with a rapidly growing older population and a shortage of younger individuals. Furthermore, the Minister of Labor and Social Policies of Italy stated that the family plays the most important role in the quality of life of elders, and it is the primary care provider for the older populations; however, the government also provides assistance to the family care giver by the following services:&lt;ref name=Maroni/&gt;
*"Qualified assistance at home"
* "Support services"
* "Service vouchers"
* "Daytime centres to provide support for families by offering old people rehabilitation and recreation"
* "Stays in holiday resorts for non self-sufficient old people - including those staying in hospitals or homes" &lt;ref name=Maroni/&gt;
The family plays an important role in providing care to its older parents but many children still have to work so that they can survive financially and as a result many caregivers are immigrant workers. These immigrant workers come in search of work from many parts of the world such as Moldavia, the Philippines, and Peru; however, the largest population of immigrant workers come from the Ukraine. Many of the caregivers work long hours and weeks, and also leave their own families behind and send them the money they make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://imow.org/economica/stories/viewStory?storyId=5052# |title=imow.org Retrieved from |access-date=2014-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822074919/http://www.imow.org/economica/stories/viewStory?storyId=5052# |archive-date=2014-08-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
Taiwan Today&lt;ref&gt;Tsai, J. (2011, March 25). Taiwan's aging society raises questions on long-term care. ''Taiwan Today''. Retrieved from http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=157626&amp;CtNode=427&lt;/ref&gt; reports that currently in Taiwan only 72,000 seniors, about one third of those receiving long-term care, live in nursing institutes. The rest are taken care of by family members. Chen&lt;ref&gt;Chen, G. (2008). Family caregiving in Taiwan. Taiwan Association of Family Caregivers. Retrieved from http://www.aarpinternational.org/ usr_attach/CHEN-Family_Caregiving_In_Taiwan.pdf on 25 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that there were 600,000 family caregivers in Taiwan and they spent an average of 13.55 hours a day caregiving. 80 percent of these 600,000 family caregivers encountered limitations on social activities. 70 percent of them needed to take care of patients even when they did not feel well. He also mentions that 80 percent of family caregivers are women, and 50 percent of them are over 50 years old. Women are more likely to be regarded as natural caregivers because of gender expectations. Taiwanese females take care of children and spouses with chronicle illnesses to meet social norms and maintain filial piety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chao S. Y., Roth P. | year = 2000 | title = The experiences of Taiwanese women caring for parents-in-law | url = | journal = Journal of Advanced Nursing | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 631–638 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2000.01319.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yeh P.

Thus, it is a very essential task to promote the capabilities of family caregivers and improve their life quality.

According to Carers UK, and based on the 2001 [[census]] around six million people in the UK provide care on an unpaid basis for a relative, friend or neighbour in need of support due to old age, disability, frailty or illness. The population of carers is dynamic: at least a third of all people will fulfil a caring role at some point in their lives.

Research has shown that becoming a carer can have many impacts on a person's life. These include financial costs, exclusion and discrimination at work, social isolation and poor health through stress and physical injury.

At least half of all carers are in full or part-time employment and some care for more than one person. Carers save the UK economy an estimated £87bn a year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carersuk.org/Home CarersUK.org carersuk.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and economic considerations form a key element in government policy to support carers.

The [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] indicated that there are 175,000 young carers aged under 18 in the UK today. A poll commissioned by [[The Princess Royal Trust for Carers]] in 2004 indicates that the number of young carers could be much higher.

====Scotland====
Policy and legislation in relation to caregivers living in Scotland is somewhat different from that in England, Wales and Ireland. Carers are defined by the Scottish Census as being "individuals who look after, or give any help or support to family members, friends, neighbours and others because of long-term physical or mental ill health or disability or problems related to old age" (Scotland’s Census Results Online [SCROL]). Estimates from the 2001 census put the numbers of carers in Scotland at 481,579. Of these, 175,969 are reported to provide more than 20 hours of care a week, and 24% provide more than 50 hours of care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrol.gov.uk scrol.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carers who provide care for 20 hours a week or more are regarded as being at the ‘heavy end’ of caring (Parker 1990). This assumes that they are the most involved carers, providing both personal and physical care, resulting in high levels of stress and most in need of support services. Many of these carers continue to provide care without support from social work or health services and because of this they remain hidden or invisible (Scottish Executive 2006, Cavaye 2006).

Carers are viewed by the government as an important resource and in recent years have been given increasing recognition in health and social care policy. Since devolution in 1999 legislation and policy for caregivers has been developed by the former Scottish Executive (now Scottish Government).

Carers in Scotland are regarded as ‘partners’ in the provision of care. As a result, support services provided to carers are regarded as part of the overall package of care to the person being looked after. This means that carers are not seen as service users and are therefore not responsible for the cost of any service provided. The exception to this is when a carer is looking after their partner; in that situation their income may be taken into account during a financial assessment.

This situation is different from that which exists in England where carers are viewed as services users in their own right and as such are liable for the cost of services provided. Yet, in many cases, it is not the carer who actually needs the service; it is the person being cared for who needs it because of their illness or disability.

===Ukraine===
The average life expectancy in the Ukraine is 61 for men and 72 for women, and as of 2005 Ukraine’s population is about 48 million of whom 15% are 65 and older.&lt;ref name=Lipsitz&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lipsitz L. A. | year = 2005 | title = The Elderly People of Post-Soviet Ukraine: Medical, Social, and Economic Challenges | url = | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 53 | issue = 12| pages = 2216–2220 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.00488.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older adults who cannot take care of themselves rely on family members, humanitarian organizations, government programs, or a combination of the three sources.&lt;ref name=Lipsitz /&gt; According to the United Nations the Ukrainian Institute of Gerontology completed a study in 1998 which included 8,574 adults of retirement age, and the results demonstrated that older adults rely on older spouses, relatives or others, and departments of community social centers for care.&lt;ref name=Bezrukov&gt;Bezrukov, V., &amp; Foigt, N. (2002). Political, social and economic crises and living arrangements of older persons: the case of   Ukraine. New York: UN Population Division.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 10 percent of the participants had an agreement with their caregiver(s) to trade inheritance of their property for the care that they were receiving.&lt;ref name=Bezrukov /&gt; The United Nations also describes the very underfunded and understaffed situation of the country, which has effected the quality of services available to elders. For example, they mention that some 38,000 social workers provide care to about 500,000 older adults in need, and a total of 631 community centers and 131 social welfare units are available to provide support for the older population throughout the country.&lt;ref name=Bezrukov /&gt; In addition to limited government and local resources many of those who could be caregivers to family members or others in the community choose to migrate to Italy.&lt;ref name=Fedyuk&gt;Fedyuk, O. (2009), Death in the Life of Ukrainian labor migrants in Italy. http://aa.ecn.cz/img_upload/6334c0c7298d6b396d213ccd19be5999/OFedyuk_DeathinthelifeofUkrainianlabormigrantsinItaly_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The declining standards of living, economy, and production in the country of Ukraine could be contributing to the migration of Ukrainians to Italy and other countries abroad. It is estimated that there are close to 700,000 undocumented and approximately 195,000 legal working Ukrainian immigrants in Italy and a majority of them work as caregivers.&lt;ref name=Fedyuk /&gt; Fedyuk mentions that many of those who move to Italy do not speak the language, work unregulated hours, may be underpaid, and usually are not prepared for all the physical and psychological requirements of being a caregiver.&lt;ref name=Fedyuk /&gt; For instance, Fedyuk describes the working requirements of a 51-year-old caregiver who only had a 2-hour break during a single day and one day off a week.&lt;ref name=Fedyuk /&gt; Also, there is mention of a 49-year-old woman who arrived to her new job and was not told the "granny" she would be caring for had an amputated arm and leg, was blind and could not speak.&lt;ref name=Fedyuk /&gt; Those who migrate to Italy usually leave behind families and parents who require care themselves, and this puts further stress and pressure on the individual.&lt;ref name=Fedyuk /&gt; Further research should be done in order to examine the extent of the consequences that may result to the caregiver, receiver of care, and those who are left behind in the cases of migrant Ukrainian workers.

===United States===

According to a November, 2007 survey on family caregiving,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724093906/http://www.caringtoday.com/press-releases/national-survey-of-caregivers caringtoday.com]&lt;/ref&gt; most [[family caregivers]] feel more positive about their experiences than they did just before they took on the responsibility, with significant differences in expectation prior to becoming a caregiver and the actual experience.

The survey also found that caregivers are often burdened by high out-of-pocket costs in caring for a spouse or parent, but:
* Sixty percent of the caregivers called the experience "very or extremely rewarding," a 50% jump over the number of caregivers who thought in advance they would find the experience "very or extremely rewarding." Nearly 80% (78.8%) percent of the caregivers found the experience to be at least "rewarding," an increase of more than one-third from initial expectation.
* A majority of the caregivers-nearly 54%-formed a stronger bond with the patient during the time they were together.
* Almost 60% of the respondents reported an improvement in the quality of their relationship with the person for whom they cared. By contrast, fewer than 10% said that their relationship got worse during the time they were caregivers.
* Social activities of the caregiver tend to diminish. The diminished social activities are replaced with an increased quality of relationship with the care recipient.
* More than 2/3 of all caregivers (68.7%) said they enjoy the tasks associated with caregiving. Prior to assuming the role, fewer than half (45.5%) thought they would enjoy caregiving.
* The amount of satisfaction with caregiving is directly related to the type of disease from which the care recipient suffers. Caregivers of depression sufferers, cancer and cardiac disease have more difficulty than those caring for patients who suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure and arthritis.

According to the Caregiver statistics fact sheet (2012) 43.5 million of adult family caregivers care for someone 50+ years of age and 14.9 million care for someone who has Alzheimer's disease or other dementia [Alzheimer's Association, 2011 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures, Alzheimer's and Dementia, Vol. 7, Issue 2]. The number of male caregivers may be increasing and will continue to do so due to a variety of social demographic factors [Kramer, B. J. &amp; E. H. Thompson, (eds.), "Men as Caregivers," (New York:Prometheus Books, 2002]. Retrieved from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caregiver.org/caregiver/jsp/content_node.jsp?nodeid=439 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214142926/http://www.caregiver.org/caregiver/jsp/content_node.jsp?nodeid=439 |archivedate=2014-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dellman-Jenkins, Blankemeyer and Pinkard found that young adults are increasingly becoming caregivers to their elderly relatives because of economic factors. A new population of caregivers to elderly are children and grandchildren, aged 40 years and younger, serving as the major source of support to an older relative(s).

Licensing and certification for caregiving can vary by state. In some states, the only licensing needed is by the company that employs the caregivers (unless it is from the state). In other states, an online certification course is recommended. Some states require in-classroom certification, and others require personal care licensing, which can be applied for online. Along with that, in some states, further certifications are required such as CPR training and first aid training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caregiver List|url=http://www.caregiverlist.com/TrainingTestModules.aspx|website=Caregiver List|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
{{See also|Carers rights movement|Caregiving and dementia}}

On February 27, 2004, the International Alliance of Carers Organizations (IACO) was launched by family caregiving organizations from Australia, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the U.S. The mission of the organization is threefold: 
*to increase visibility of family caregiving across the lifespan as an international issue;
*to promote the sharing of best practices in caregiving programs between countries; and
*to encourage and provide assistance to countries interested in developing family carer organizations.

IACO is headquartered in London. Initial IACO projects included promotion of a United Nations Day for Carers and a presentation on the IACO as part of a half-day workshop at the International Federation on Aging conference in Singapore on August 4, 2004. National family carer organizations in all countries are encouraged to join the alliance.

===Europe===
EUROFAMCARE aims to provide a European review of the situation of family carers of elderly people in relation to the existence, familiarity, availability, use and acceptability of supporting services. 
In 2003 six countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom) formed a trans-European group, systematically representing the different types of welfare-states in Europe and started a comparative study. The Pan-European Group consists of 23 countries (including the six countries, which are represented by the members of the Consortium).

The last step is a feedback research action phase based both on the study results and on the pan-European expertise. A European Carers’ Charter in progress will be further developed by the new European network organization EUROCARERS in order to stimulate further activities both on national and European policy levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uke.uni-hamburg.de/extern/eurofamcare/ uke.uni-hamburg.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

EUROCARERS&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurocarers.org eurocarers.org]&lt;/ref&gt; was formally launched in June 2007 to provide a united voice at European level and influence policy both nationally and within the [[European Union]]. Eurocarers currently comprises representatives of 18 organisations and research bodies from nine countries. Members have come together to influence policy within the European Institutions to ensure that the invaluable contribution of carers is recognised across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carersuk.org/Aboutus/MoreaboutCarersUK/StrategyAnnualReportAccounts/FINANCIALSTATEMENTS13.9.07.pdf |title=CARERS UK - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2007 |accessdate=September 16, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227161324/http://www.carersuk.org/Aboutus/MoreaboutCarersUK/StrategyAnnualReportAccounts/FINANCIALSTATEMENTS13.9.07.pdf |archivedate=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The Carers Association was founded in 1987 to represent family carers and advocate for carers rights. The national census of 2006 shows that there are 160,917 people who stated that they are carers and almost 41,000 of these carers are providing 43 or more hours of care each week. They estimate that carers provide 194 million hours of care a year to the value of about 2.5 billion Euros to the economy. Approximately 33,000 full-time carers qualify for the Carers Allowance from the government.

===Taiwan===
The Taiwan Association of Family Caregivers (TAFC)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peopo.org/familycare&lt;/ref&gt; was built in 1996. It is the first non-profit organization to voice the rights for family caregivers in Taiwan. The association encourages each city to set up a chapter in order to provide family caregivers with services. The main association is in Taipei and there are ten chapters around Taiwan. The TAFC claims that (1) The government should share the burden of family carers; (2) The government should provide well-qualified respite services; (3) The government should provide family carers with training and support; (4) Labor policy should help employees fulfill their responsibilities as family caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;chen, G. (2008). Family caregiving in Taiwan. Taiwan Association of Family Caregivers. Retrieved from http://www.aarpinternational. org/usr_attach/CHEN-Family_Caregiving_In_Taiwan.pdf on 25 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TAFC provides family caregivers with a consulting hotline, newsletters of the association, in-service courses for professional personnel, support groups, and counseling services for caregivers. The association has allied with the Welfare Organization of the Elderly, Taiwan Long-term Care Professional Association, and Taiwan Alzheimer's Disease Association to build a support network for family caregivers.

* Family Caregivers Day is on the fourth Sunday of November every year.  It hopes to raise public awareness and concern for family caregivers and hopes to make policies to support and help them.

===Ukraine===
There is no known or formal caregiver association established in the Ukraine; however, there is an [http://geront.kiev.ua/ Institute of Gerontology] which was established in 1958, and it has four main centers or associations which include:
*State Educational and Methodical Geriatric Center
*Ukrainian Scientific Center of Osteoporosis
*Ukrainian Association of Osteoporosis
*Ukrainian Association of Menopause, Andropause, and Disease of Bone and Joint System
This Institute has contributed research and publications which can be very helpful in assisting the older population of the country and the caregivers of this population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geront.kiev.ua/history.htm  geront.kiev.ua.  Retrieved from]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental epidemiology''' is a branch of [[epidemiology]] concerned with determining how environmental exposures impact human health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/163589221|title=Environmental epidemiology : principles and methods|last=Merrill|first=Ray M.|date=|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|year=2008|isbn=9780763741525|location=Sudbury, Mass.|pages=8-9|oclc=163589221}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This field seeks to understand how various external risk factors may predispose to or protect against disease, illness, injury, developmental abnormalities, or death. These factors may be naturally occurring or may be introduced into environments where people live, work, and play. 

==Description==
Environmental exposures can be broadly categorized into those that are proximate (e.g., directly leading to a health condition), including chemicals, physical agents, and [[microbiological]] [[pathogens]], and those that are [[distal]], such as socioeconomic conditions, [[climate change]], and other broad-scale [[environmental change]]s. Proximate exposures occur through air, food, water, and skin contact. Distal exposures cause adverse health conditions directly by altering proximate exposures, and indirectly through changes in ecosystems and other support systems for human health.&lt;ref&gt;Slikker, William  Jr., Chang, Louis W., ''Handbook of Developmental Neurotoxicology'', p. 460, 1998, Academic Press, {{ISBN|0080533434}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TU4ObOjKdUsC&amp;pg=PA460 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental epidemiology research can inform [[risk assessment]]s; development of standards and other risk management activities; and estimates of the co-benefits and co-harms of policies designed to reduce global environment change, including policies implemented in other sectors (e.g. food and water) that can affect human health.

[[Vulnerability index|Vulnerability]] is the summation of all risk and protective factors that ultimately determine whether an individual or subpopulation experiences adverse health outcomes when an exposure to an environmental agent occurs. Sensitivity is an individual’s or subpopulation’s increased responsiveness, primarily for biological reasons, to that exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Balbus | first=John M |author2=Catherine Malina | title=Identifying vulnerable subpopulations for climate change health effects in the United States | journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine | date=January 2009 | pmid=19136871 | doi=10.1097/JOM.0b013e318193e12e | issn=1536-5948 | volume=51 | issue=1 | pages=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biological sensitivity may be related to developmental stage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/817736465|title=Only one chance : how environmental pollution impairs brain development--and how to protect the brains of the next generation|last=Grandjean|first=Phillipe|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780199985388|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=817736465}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Pre-existing condition|pre-existing medical conditions]], acquired factors, and [[Genetic disorder|genetic factors]]. Socioeconomic factors also play a critical role in altering vulnerability and sensitivity to environmentally mediated factors by increasing the likelihood of exposure to harmful agents, interacting with biological factors that mediate risk, and/or leading to differences in the ability to prepare for or cope with exposures or early phases of illness. Populations living in certain regions may be at increased risk due to location and the environmental characteristics of a region.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}

'''Healing''' is the process of the restoration of [[health]] from an unbalanced, diseased or damaged organism. The result of healing can be a cure to a health challenge, but one can heal without being cured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samueliinstitute.org/File%20Library/About%20Us/Samueli-Institute-Strategic-Plan.pdf|title=Building the Science of Healing|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession of nursing has been traditionally concerned with matters of healing, whereas historically the profession of medicine has been concerned with curing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McElligott|first=D|date=2010|title=Healing: The journey from concept to nursing practice|journal=Journal of Holistic Nursing|volume=28 | issue = 4 |pages=251–9|via=|pmid=20660908|doi=10.1177/0898010110376321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With physical damage or disease suffered by an organism, healing involves the repair of living [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and the [[biological system]] as a whole and resumption of normal functioning. It is the process by which the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[Human body|body]] regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or [[necrosis|necrotic]] area and replace it with new living tissue. The replacement can happen in two ways: by ''regeneration'' in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form similar tissue as was originally there; or by ''repair'' in which injured tissue is replaced with [[scar|scar tissue]]. Most [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms.

It is also referred to in the context of the grieving process.

In [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]], healing is the process by which [[neuroses]] and [[psychoses]] are resolved to the degree that the client is able to lead a normal or fulfilling existence without being overwhelmed by [[Psychopathology|psychopathological]] phenomena. This process may involve [[psychotherapy]], [[pharmaceutical]] treatment or [[alternative medicine|alternative]] approaches such as [[Holistic health|traditional spiritual healing]].

==Regeneration==
In order for an [[injury]] to be healed by regeneration, the cell type that was destroyed must be able to replicate. Cells also need a [[collagen]] framework along which to grow. Alongside most cells there is either a [[basement membrane]] or a [[extracellular matrix|collagenous network]] made by [[fibroblast]]s that will guide the cells' growth.  Since [[ischaemia]] and most [[toxin]]s do not destroy collagen, it will continue to exist even when the cells around it are dead.

===Example===
[[Acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN) in the [[kidney]] is a case in which cells heal completely by regeneration. ATN occurs when the [[epithelial cell]]s that line the kidney are destroyed by either a lack of [[oxygen]] (such as in [[hypovolemic shock]], when blood supply to the kidneys is dramatically reduced), or by toxins (such as some [[antibiotic]]s, [[heavy metals]] or [[carbon tetrachloride]]).

Although many of these epithelial cells are dead, there is typically patchy necrosis, meaning that there are patches of epithelial cells still alive. In addition, the collagen framework of the tubules remains completely intact.

The existing epithelial cells can replicate, and, using the basement membrane as a guide, eventually bring the kidney back to normal. After regeneration is complete, the damage is undetectable, even [[Microscope|microscopically]].

Healing must happen by repair in the case of injury to cells that are unable to regenerate (e.g. neurons). Also, damage to the collagen network (e.g. by [[enzyme]]s or physical destruction), or its total collapse (as can happen in an [[infarct]]) cause healing to take place by repair.

==Wound healing==
{{main | Wound healing}}

In response to an incision or wound, a [[Wound healing|wound healing cascade]] is unleashed.  This cascade takes place in four phases: clot formation, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation.

===Clotting phase===
Healing of a wound begins with [[clot]] formation to stop bleeding and to reduce infection by bacteria, [[virus]]es and [[fungi]]. Clotting is followed by [[neutrophil]] invasion three to 24 hours after the wound has been incurred, with [[mitosis|mitoses]] beginning in [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells after 24 to 48 hours .{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Inflammation phase===
In the inflammatory phase, [[macrophage]]s and other [[phagocytosis|phagocytic]] cells kill bacteria, debride damaged tissue and release chemical factors such as [[growth hormone]]s that encourage fibroblasts, [[epithelial cell]]s and endothelial cells which make new [[capillary|capillaries]] to migrate to the area and divide.

===Proliferative phase===
In the proliferative phase, immature [[granulation tissue]] containing plump, active fibroblasts forms. Fibroblasts quickly produce abundant type III [[collagen]], which fills the defect left by an open wound. Granulation tissue moves, as a wave, from the border of the injury towards the center.

As granulation tissue matures, the fibroblasts produce less collagen and become more spindly in appearance. They begin to produce the much stronger type I collagen. Some of the fibroblasts mature into myofibroblasts which contain the same type of [[actin]] found in [[smooth muscle]], which enables them to contract and reduce the size of the wound.

===Maturation phase===
During the maturation phase of wound healing, unnecessary vessels formed in granulation tissue are removed by [[apoptosis]], and type III collagen is largely replaced by type I. Collagen which was originally disorganized is cross-linked and aligned along tension lines. This phase can last a year or longer. Ultimately a scar made of collagen, containing a small number of fibroblasts is left.

== Tissue damaged by inflammation ==
After inflammation has damaged tissue (when combatting bacterial infection for example) and pro-inflammatory [[eicosanoid]]s have completed their function, healing proceeds in 4 phases.&lt;ref&gt;''The Anti-Inflammation Zone'', Barry Sears, pages 230-233, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recall phase===
In the recall phase the [[adrenal gland]]s increase production of [[cortisol]] which shuts down eicosanoid production and inflammation.

===Resolution phase===
In the Resolution phase, pathogens and damaged tissue are removed by [[macrophage]]s (white blood cells). Red blood cells are also removed from the damaged tissue by macrophages. Failure to remove all of the damaged cells and pathogens may retrigger inflammation. The two subsets of macrophage M1 &amp; M2 plays a crucial role in this phase, M1 macrophage being a pro inflammatory while as M2 is a regenerative and the plasticity between the two subsets determine the tissue inflammation or repair.

===Regeneration phase===
In the Regeneration phase, blood vessels are repaired and new cells form in the damaged site similar to the cells that were damaged and removed.  Some cells such as neurons and muscle cells (especially in the heart) are slow to recover.

===Repair phase===
In the Repair phase, new tissue is generated which requires a balance of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids.  Anti-inflammatory eicosanoids include [[lipoxin]]s, [[epi-lipoxin]]s, and [[resolvin]]s, which cause release of growth hormones.

== History ==
The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the [[Biomedical model|biomedical]] perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by [[disease]]. An example of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with [[Human body|physical]], [[biological]], [[Psychology|psychological]], and [[social stress]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stokes|first=J.|last2=Noren|first2=J.|last3=Shindell|first3=S.|date=1982-01-01|title=Definition of terms and concepts applicable to clinical preventive medicine|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=8|issue=1|pages=33–41|issn=0094-5145|pmid=6764783|doi=10.1007/bf01324395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to [[well-being]], in terms of "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/37089|title=The first ten years of the World Health Organization|last=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|year=1958|isbn=|location=Geneva|publication-date=1958|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phprimer.afmc.ca/Part1-TheoryThinkingAboutHealth/ConceptsOfHealthAndIllness/DefinitionsofHealth|title=Part 1 – Theory: Thinking About Health Chapter 1 Concepts of Health and Illness|website=phprimer.afmc.ca|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as there was a shift from viewing disease as a state to thinking of it as a process, the same shift happened in definitions of health. Again, the WHO played a leading role when it fostered the development of the health promotion movement in the 1980s. This brought in a new conception of health, not as a state, but in dynamic terms of resiliency, in other words, as "a resource for living". 1984 WHO revised the definition of health defined it as "the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment. Health is a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/107835|title=Health promotion : a discussion document on the concept and principles : summary report of the Working Group on Concept and Principles of Health Promotion, Copenhagen, 9–13 July 1984|last=World Health Organization. Regional Office for Europe|first=|publisher=WHO Regional Office for Europe|year=1984|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=|type=ICP/HSR 602(m01)5 p}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, health referred to the ability to maintain homeostasis and recover from insults. Mental, intellectual, emotional and social health referred to a person's ability to handle stress, to acquire skills, to maintain relationships, all of which form resources for resiliency and independent living.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This opens up many possibilities for health to be taught, strengthened and learned. 

Since the late 1970s, the federal Healthy People Initiative has been a visible component of the United States’ approach to improving population health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/tools-and-resources/Federal-Prevention-Initiatives Federal Prevention Initiatives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615184241/https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/tools-and-resources/Federal-Prevention-Initiatives |date=2016-06-15 }}.

Progress has been limited to many objectives, leading to concerns about the effectiveness of Healthy People in shaping outcomes in the context of a decentralized and uncoordinated US health system. Healthy People 2020 gives more prominence to health promotion and preventive approaches and adds a substantive focus on the importance of addressing social determinants of health. A new expanded digital interface facilitates use and dissemination rather than bulky printed books as produced in the past. The impact of these changes to Healthy People will be determined in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jonathan |first=E.

Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by [[health care provider]]s. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary sciences]]. The term "healthy" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of [[healthy community design|healthy communities]], [[healthy city|healthy cities]] or [[healthy environment]]s. In addition to [[health care]] interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions and spirituality; these are referred to as "determinants of health." Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24756311 |title=BBC News – How stressed are you? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-11-06 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decade of the 21st century, the conceptualization of health as an ability opened the door for self-assessments to become the main indicators to judge the performance of efforts aimed at improving human health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jadad|first=Alejandro R.|date=2016-11-01|title=Creating a pandemic of health: What is the role of digital technologies?|journal=Journal of Public Health Policy|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=260–268|doi=10.1057/s41271-016-0016-1|pmid=27899800|issn=0197-5897}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It also created the opportunity for every person to feel healthy, even in the presence of multiple chronic diseases, or a terminal condition, and for the re-examination of determinants of health, away from the traditional approach that focuses on the reduction of the prevalence of diseases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harvardpublichealthreview.org/creating-a-pandemic-of-health-opportunities-and-lessons-for-a-university-initiative-at-the-intersection-of-health-equity-and-innovation/|title=Creating a Pandemic of Health: Opportunities and Lessons for a University Initiative at the Intersection of Health, Equity, and Innovation {{!}} Harvard Public Health Review: A Student Publication|website=harvardpublichealthreview.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Generally, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance for both his health status and quality of  their life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037| pmid=29301638|title = Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility| journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine| volume=200| pages=258–261|year = 2018|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of [[health science]], but also through the efforts and intelligent [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] choices of the individual and society. According to the [[World Health Organization]], the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment, the physical environment and the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.&lt;ref name="The determinants of health"&gt;World Health Organization.

An increasing number of studies and reports from different organizations and contexts examine the linkages between health and different factors, including lifestyles, environments, [[health care system|health care organization]] and [[health policy]], one specific health policy brought into many countries in recent years was the introduction of the sugar tax. Beverage taxes came into light with increasing concerns about obesity, particularly among youth. Sugar-sweetened beverages have become a target of anti-obesity initiatives with increasing evidence of their link to obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreyeva|first=Tatiana|last2=Chaloupka|first2=Frank J.|last3=Brownell|first3=Kelly D.|title=Estimating the potential of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages to reduce consumption and generate revenue|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=52|issue=6|pages=413–416|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.03.013|pmid=21443899|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;– such as the 1974 [[Lalonde report]] from Canada;&lt;ref name="Lalonde"/&gt; the [[Alameda County Study]] in California;&lt;ref name="Housman &amp; Dorman 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Housman|first1=Jeff|last2=Dorman|first2=Steve|title=The Alameda County Study: A Systematic, Chronological Review|journal=American Journal of Health Education|date=September–October 2005|volume=36|issue=5|pages=302–308|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ792845|accessdate=27 December 2011|format=PDF|issn=1055-6699|id=ERIC document number EJ792845|ref=CITEREFHousmanDorman2005|doi=10.1080/19325037.2005.10608200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the series of [[World Health Report]]s of the World Health Organization, which focuses on [[global health]] issues including access to health care and improving [[public health]] outcomes, especially in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

The concept of the "''health field,''" as distinct from [[medicine|medical care]], emerged from the Lalonde report from Canada. The report identified three interdependent fields as key determinants of an individual's health. These are:&lt;ref name="Lalonde"/&gt;
* Lifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e., over which the individual has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause, illness or death;
* Environmental: all matters related to health external to the [[human body]] and over which the individual has little or no control;
* Biomedical: all aspects of health, physical and mental, developed within the human body as influenced by genetic make-up.

The maintenance and promotion of health is achieved through different combination of physical, [[mental health|mental]], and social well-being, together sometimes referred to as the ''"health triangle."''&lt;ref&gt;Georgia State University. 1998. [http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwche/ ''Health Triangle Slides''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nutter S. (2003) ''The Health Triangle''. Anchor Points, Inc., {{ISBN|0974876003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's 1986 ''[[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]]'' further stated that health is not just a state, but also "a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities."&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/previous/ottawa/en/index.html The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion.] Adopted at the First International Conference on Health Promotion, Ottawa, 21 November 1986 – WHO/HPR/HEP/95.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional health, data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve their health via [[exercise]], enough [[sleep]], maintaining a healthy [[body weight]], limiting [[alcohol]] use, and avoiding [[smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Housman|Dorman|2005|pp=303–304}}. "The linear model supported previous findings, including regular exercise, limited alcohol consumption, abstinence from smoking, sleeping 7–8 hours a night, and maintenance of a healthy weight play an important role in promoting longevity and delaying illness and death."

The environment is often cited as an important factor influencing the health status of individuals. This includes characteristics of the [[natural environment]], the [[built environment]] and the [[social environment]]. Factors such as clean [[water]] and [[air]], adequate [[house|housing]], and safe communities and [[road traffic safety|roads]] all have been found to contribute to good health, especially to the health of infants and children.&lt;ref name="The determinants of health"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. [http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/facts_figures/basic_needs.shtml ''The UN World Water Development Report: Facts and Figures – Meeting basic needs.''] Accessed 12 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that a lack of neighborhood recreational spaces including natural environment leads to lower levels of personal satisfaction and higher levels of [[obesity]], linked to lower overall health and well being.&lt;ref name="Fanny Price"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Björk J, Albin M, Grahn P, Jacobsson H, Ardö J, Wadbro J, Ostergren PO | title = Recreational Values of the Natural Environment in Relation to Neighborhood Satisfaction, Physical Activity, Obesity and Well being | journal = Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = e2 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18365329 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2007.062414 | url = http://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/5178417/1056501.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the positive health benefits of natural space in urban neighborhoods should be taken into account in [[public policy]] and land use.

[[Genetics]], or inherited traits from parents, also play a role in determining the health status of individuals and populations. This can encompass both the [[genetic predisposition|predisposition]] to certain diseases and health conditions, as well as the habits and behaviors individuals develop through the lifestyle of their [[families]]. For example, genetics may play a role in the manner in which people cope with [[Stress (biology)|stress]], either mental, emotional or physical. For example, [[obesity]] is a significant problem in the United States that contributes to bad mental health and causes stress in the lives of great numbers of people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Human Factors, Business Management, Training and Education {{!}} SpringerLink|volume = 498|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-42070-7|series = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|year = 2017|isbn = 978-3-319-42069-1|last1 = Kantola|first1 = Jussi Ilari|last2 = Barath|first2 = Tibor|last3 = Nazir|first3 = Salman|last4 = Andre|first4 = Terence}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  (One difficulty is the issue raised by the [[nature versus nurture|debate]] over the relative strengths of genetics and other factors; interactions between genetics and environment may be of particular importance.)

{{Citation style|section|date=March 2014}}

A number of types of health issues are common around the globe.  [[Disease]] is one of the most common. According to GlobalIssues.org, approximately 36&amp;nbsp;million people die each year from non-communicable (not contagious) disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease (Shah, 2014).

Among communicable diseases, both viral and bacterial, [[AIDS]]/[[HIV]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]] are the most common, causing millions of deaths every year (Shah, 2014).

Another health issue that causes death or contributes to other health problems is malnutrition, especially among children.  One of the groups malnutrition affects most is young children.  Approximately 7.5&amp;nbsp;million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition, usually brought on by not having the money to find or make food (Shah, 2014).

Bodily injuries are also a common health issue worldwide.  These injuries, including broken bones, fractures, and burns can reduce a person's quality of life or can cause fatalities including infections that resulted from the injury or the severity injury in general (Moffett, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Anup (5 January 2014). [http://www.globalissues.org/issue/587/health-issues "Health Issues."] ''Global Issues''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifestyle choices are contributing factors to poor health in many cases.  These include smoking cigarettes, and can also include a poor diet, whether it is overeating or an overly constrictive diet.  Inactivity can also contribute to health issues and also a lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and neglect of oral hygiene (Moffett2013).There are also genetic disorders that are inherited by the person and can vary in how much they affect the person and when they surface (Moffett, 2013).

Though the majority of these health issues are preventable, a major contributor to global ill health is the fact that approximately 1 billion people lack access to health care systems (Shah, 2014). Arguably, the most common and harmful health issue is that a great many people do not have access to quality remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/health/ |title=United Nations Global Issues |publisher=Un.org |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608150700/http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/health/ |archivedate=2016-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intrahealth.org/page/the-top-10-global-health-issues-to-watch-in-2013 |title=The Top 10 Global Health Issues to Watch in 2013 |publisher=Intrahealth.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
{{main article|Mental health}}
The [[World Health Organization]] describes mental health as "a state of [[well-being]] in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community".&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2005). Promoting Mental Health: Concepts, Emerging evidence, Practice: A report of the World Health Organization, Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse in collaboration with the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation and the University of Melbourne. World Health Organization. Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mental Health is not just the absence of mental illness.&lt;ref name= Bos&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bos, E.H.|author2=Snippe, E.|author3=de Jonge, P.|author4=Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = e0150867 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 |pmid=26963923|pmc=4786317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental illness is described as 'the spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral conditions that interfere with social and emotional well-being and the lives and productivity of people. Having a mental illness can seriously impair, temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person. Other terms include: 'mental health problem', 'illness', 'disorder', 'dysfunction'.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Steven W. [https://web.archive.org/web/20161012224715/http://lac.niu.edu.tw/files/archive/73_37d1d9ea.pdf Lifestyle Management: Achieving &amp; Maintaining Good Healt]. niu.edu.tw&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly a quarter of all adults 18 and over in the US are considered diagnosable with mental illness. Mental illnesses are the leading cause of disability in the US and Canada. Examples include, [[schizophrenia]], [[ADHD]], [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and [[Autism spectrum|autism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america/index.shtml The numbers count: Mental disorders in America]. nih.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Many teens suffer from mental health issues in response to the pressures of society and social problems they encounter. Some of the key mental health issues seen in teens are: [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[eating disorders]], and [[drug abuse]]. There are many ways to prevent these health issues from occurring such as communicating well with a teen suffering from mental health issues. Mental health can be treated and be attentive to teens' behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/teen/pages/Mental-Health-and-Teens-Watch-for-Danger-Signs.aspx |title=Mental Health and Teens: Watch for Danger Signs |publisher=HealthyChildren.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&amp;nbsp;Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:
* Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry
* Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse
* Family history of mental health [https://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics/what-is-mental-health/index.html problems]

==Maintaining==
Achieving and maintaining health is an ongoing process, shaped by both the evolution of [[health care]] knowledge and practices as well as personal strategies and organized interventions for staying healthy.

===Diet===
{{Main article|Healthy diet | Human nutrition}}
[[File:Overweight or obese population OECD 2010.png|upright=0.95|thumb|right|Percentage of overweight or obese population in 2010, Data source: OECD's iLibrary, http://stats.oecd.org&lt;ref name="OECDOverwObese"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=53508|title=OECD.StatExtracts, Health, Non-Medical Determinants of Health, Body weight, Overweight or obese population, self-reported and measured, Total population|publisher=OECD's iLibrary|year=2013|format=Online Statistics|accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An important way to maintain your personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide [[nutrients]] to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. [[blood pressure]]). The [[food guide pyramid]] is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e. Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, and Sugars). Making healthy food choices is important because it can lower your risk of heart disease, developing some types of [[cancer]], and it will contribute to maintaining a healthy weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livelifewell.nsw.gov.au/healthyeating/ |title=Healthy Eating: Why should I make healthy food choices? |publisher=Livelifewell.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227194359/http://www.livelifewell.nsw.gov.au/healthyeating/ |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mediterranean diet]] is commonly associated with health-promoting effects due to the fact that it contains some bioactive compounds like [[phenolic compound]]s, [[isoprenoid]]s and [[alkaloid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Garrido M |author2=González-Flores D |author3=Marchena AM |author4=Propr E |author5=García-Parra J |author6=Barriga C |author7=Rodríguez A.B. |title=A lycopene-enriched virgin olive oil enhances antioxidant status in humans |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |volume=93 |issue=8 |pages=1820–6 |pmid=23225211 |year=2013 |doi=10.1002/jsfa.5972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise===
{{Main article | Exercise}}
[[Exercise|Physical exercise]] enhances or maintains [[physical fitness]] and overall health and wellness. It strengthens muscles and improves the [[cardiovascular system]]. According to the [[National Institutes of Health]], there are four types of exercise: [[endurance]], [[Physical strength|strength]], [[flexibility]], and [[Balance (ability)|balance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 Types of Exercise|url=https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/4-types-exercise|publisher=Go4Life, National Institute on Aging, US National Institutes of Health|language=en|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sleep===
{{Main article | Sleep | Sleep deprivation}}
Sleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing [[sleep deprivation]] has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pilkington |first=Stephanie |date=August 7, 2013 |title=Causes and consequences of sleep deprivation in hospitalized patients |journal=Nursing Standard |volume=27 |issue=49 |pages=35–42 |doi=10.7748/ns2013.08.27.49.35.e7649|pmid=23924135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/august/sleep-and-sickness.html |title=New Research Confirms Lack of Sleep Connected to Getting Sick |publisher=cmu.edu |author=Shilo Rea |date=2015-08-31|accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the role of sleep in regulating [[Sleep and metabolism|metabolism]], insufficient sleep may also play a role in [[weight gain]] or, conversely, in impeding [[weight loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Patel |first=Sanjay R. |last2=Hu |first2=Frank B. |date=January 17, 2008 |title=Short sleep duration and weight gain: a systematic review |journal=Obesity (Silver Spring) |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=643–653 |doi=10.1038/oby.2007.118 |pmid=18239586 |pmc=2723045}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the [[World Health Organization]], declared that "shiftwork that involves [[Circadian rhythm|circadian]] disruption is probably [[carcinogen]]ic to humans," speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2007/pr180.html |title=IARC Monographs Programme finds cancer hazards associated with shiftwork, painting and firefighting |publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer |date=December 5, 2007 |access-date=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age and concluded that "Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hirshkowitz, Max |author2=Whiton, Kaitlyn | title=National Sleep Foundation's sleep time duration recommendations: methodology and results summary | journal= Sleep Health: Journal of the National Sleep Foundation |url= http://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/S2352-7218(15)00015-7/fulltext |date=14 January 2015 | pmid = 29073412| doi= 10.1016/j.sleh.2014.12.010 |accessdate=25 November 2015  |display-authors=etal | volume=1 |issue=1 | pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of science===
{{Main article|Health science|Health care}}
[[File:Nieuws uit Indonesië, het werk van de Nederlandse dienst voor Volksgezondheid Weeknummer 46-21 - Open Beelden - 16742.ogv|thumb|upright=0.95|The Dutch Public Health Service provides medical care for the natives of the [[Dutch East Indies]], May 1946]]
[[Health science]] is the branch of science focused on health. There are two main approaches to health science: the study and [[research]] of the [[Human body|body]] and health-related issues to understand how humans (and animals) function, and the application of that knowledge to improve health and to prevent and cure [[disease]]s and other physical and mental impairments. The science builds on many sub-fields, including [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[physics]], [[epidemiology]], [[pharmacology]], [[medical sociology]]. Applied health sciences endeavor to better understand and improve human health through applications in areas such as [[health education]], [[biomedical engineering]], [[biotechnology]] and [[public health]].

Organized interventions to improve health based on the principles and procedures developed through the health sciences are provided by practitioners trained in [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[nutrition]], [[pharmacy]], [[social work]], [[psychology]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]] and other [[health care provider|health care professions]]. Clinical practitioners focus mainly on the health of individuals, while public health practitioners consider the overall health of communities and populations. [[Workplace wellness]] programs are increasingly adopted by companies for their value in improving the health and well-being of their employees, as are [[school health services]] in order to improve the health and well-being of children.

===Role of public health===
{{Main article|Public health}}
{{See also|Global health}}

[[File:NewZealand-Stamp-1933-Health.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|right|Postage stamp, [[New Zealand]], 1933. Public health has been promoted&amp;nbsp;– and depicted&amp;nbsp;– in a wide variety of ways.]]
Public health has been described as "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Winslow CE | title = The Untilled Fields of Public Health | journal = Science | volume = 51 | issue = 1306 | pages = 23–33 | year = 1920 | pmid = 17838891 | doi = 10.1126/science.51.1306.23 | url = https://archive.org/details/cihm_90880 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on [[population health]] analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a [[pandemic]]). Public health has many sub-fields, but typically includes the interdisciplinary categories of [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]]. [[Environmental Health|Environmental health]], [[community health]], [[behavioral health]], and [[occupational health]] are also important areas of public health.

The focus of public health interventions is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the [[health promotion|promotion of healthy behavior]], [[healthy community design|communities]], and (in aspects relevant to human health) [[environmental protection|environments]]. Its aim is to prevent health problems from happening or re-occurring by implementing [[health education|educational programs]], developing [[health policy|policies]], administering services and conducting [[research]].&lt;ref&gt;Association of Schools of Public Health. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050307160406/http://www.whatispublichealth.org/about/index.html ''What is Public Health?''] Retrieved 2010-06-24&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, treating a disease or controlling a [[pathogen]] can be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an [[outbreak]]. [[Vaccination]] programs and distribution of [[condom]]s to prevent the spread of [[communicable disease]]s are examples of common preventive public health measures, as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and the use of condoms (including overcoming resistance to such).

[[Public health]] also takes various actions to limit the health disparities between different areas of the [[country]] and, in some cases, the [[continent]] or [[world]]. One issue is the access of individuals and communities to health care in terms of financial, geographical or socio-cultural constraints to accessing and using services.&lt;ref&gt;Hispanics and the Future of America. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19910 ''Access to and Quality of Health Care'']&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of the public [[health system]] include the areas of [[maternal health|maternal]] and child health, health services administration, emergency response, and prevention and control of [[infectious disease|infectious]] and [[chronic disease]]s.

The great positive impact of public health programs is widely acknowledged. Due in part to the policies and actions developed through public health, the 20th century registered a decrease in the mortality rates for [[infants]] and [[child]]ren and a continual increase in [[life expectancy]] in most parts of the world. For example, it is estimated that life expectancy has increased for Americans by thirty years since 1900,&lt;ref&gt;Association of Schools of Public Health. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050228214104/http://www.whatispublichealth.org/impact/index.html ''Impact of Public Health''.] Retrieved 2010-6-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and worldwide by six years since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

===Self-care strategies===
{{Main article|Self care}}
{{See also|Chronic care management|Social relation|Stress management}}
&lt;!--[[File:Nanogreens-2.gif|thumb|Example of [[nanogreens]] from health and hygiene.]] --&gt;
[[File:Borch Lady washing hands.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A lady washing her hands c. 1655]]
Personal health depends partially on the active, passive, and assisted cues people observe and adopt about their own health. These include personal actions for preventing or minimizing the effects of a disease, usually a chronic condition, through [[disease management (health)|integrative care]]. They also include personal [[hygiene]] practices to prevent infection and illness, such as [[bathing]] and [[washing hands]] with soap; [[oral hygiene|brushing and flossing teeth]]; storing, preparing and handling [[food safety|food safely]]; and many others. The information gleaned from personal [[Observations of Daily Living|observations of daily living]]&amp;nbsp;– such as about sleep patterns, exercise behavior, nutritional intake and environmental features&amp;nbsp;– may be used to inform personal decisions and actions (''e.g.'', "I feel tired in the morning so I am going to try sleeping on a different pillow"), as well as clinical decisions and treatment plans (''e.g.'', a patient who notices his or her shoes are tighter than usual may be having exacerbation of left-sided heart failure, and may require diuretic medication to reduce fluid overload).&lt;ref name="e-primer3"&gt;Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. (2008). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080828125539/http://www.projecthealthdesign.org/media/file/E-primer_3.pdf ''Health in Everyday Living''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal health also depends partially on the social structure of a person's life. The maintenance of strong [[social relation]]ships, [[volunteering]], and other social activities have been linked to positive mental health and also increased longevity. One American study among [[old age|seniors]] over age 70, found that frequent volunteering was associated with reduced risk of dying compared with older persons who did not volunteer, regardless of physical health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris AH, Thoresen CE | title = Volunteering is Associated with Delayed Mortality in Older People: Analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Aging | journal = Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 739–52 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16176953 | doi = 10.1177/1359105305057310 | url = http://www.chce.research.va.gov/docs/pdfs/pi_publications/Harris/2005_Harris_Thoresen_JHS.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110722153152/http://www.chce.research.va.gov/docs/pdfs/pi_publications/Harris/2005_Harris_Thoresen_JHS.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study from Singapore reported that volunteering retirees had significantly better [[cognition|cognitive performance]] scores, fewer [[mood disorder|depressive symptoms]], and better mental well-being and [[life satisfaction]] than non-volunteering retirees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwingel A, Niti MM, Tang C, Ng TP | title = Continued work employment and volunteerism and mental well-being of older adults: Singapore longitudinal ageing studies | journal = Age and Ageing | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 531–7 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19474036 | doi = 10.1093/ageing/afp089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolonged [[psychological stress]] may negatively impact health, and has been cited as a factor in [[cognitive impairment]] with aging, depressive illness, and expression of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McEwen BS | title = Protective and damaging effects of stress mediators: central role of the brain | journal = Dialogues Clin Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–81 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17290796 | pmc = 3181832 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stress management]] is the application of methods to either reduce stress or increase tolerance to stress. [[Relaxation technique]]s are physical methods used to relieve stress. Psychological methods include [[cognitive therapy]], [[meditation]], and [[Optimism|positive thinking]], which work by reducing response to stress. Improving relevant skills, such as [[problem solving]] and [[time management]] skills, reduces uncertainty and builds confidence, which also reduces the reaction to stress-causing situations where those skills are applicable.

==Occupational==
{{Main article|Occupational safety and health}}
In addition to [[safety]] risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common [[occupational diseases]] are various forms of [[pneumoconiosis]], including [[silicosis]] and [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis|coal worker's pneumoconiosis (black lung disease)]]. [[occupational asthma|Asthma]] is another [[respiratory illness]] that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including [[eczema]], [[dermatitis]], [[urticaria]], [[sunburn]], and [[skin cancer]].&lt;ref name=hse&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/skin/ HSE (Health and Safety Executive of Great Britain) Skin at work] Retrieved on June 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="niosh-skin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Skin Exposure &amp; Effects|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/|website=NIOSH Topics|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other occupational diseases of concern include [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] and [[lead poisoning]].

As the number of [[service sector]] jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]], presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with [[manufacturing]] and the [[primary sector]]. Contemporary problems, such as the growing rate of [[obesity]] and issues relating to [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and [[overwork]] in many countries, have further complicated the interaction between work and health.

Many governments view occupational health as a social challenge and have formed public organizations to ensure the health and safety of workers. Examples of these include the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Health and Safety Executive]] and in the [[United States]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], which conducts research on occupational health and safety, and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], which handles regulation and policy relating to worker safety and health.&lt;ref name="niosh-site"&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="osha-site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url=https://www.osha.gov/|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hse-site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health and Safety Executive|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/|publisher=U.K. Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This data, collected by [[health care provider]]s, typically includes a record of services received, conditions of those services, and clinical outcomes or information concerning those services.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Tzourakis|first=Melissa|year=1996|title=The Healthcare Industry and Data Quality|url=http://mitiq.mit.edu/iciq/Documents/IQ%20Conference%201996/Papers/TheHealthCareIndustryandDataQuality.pdf|conference=International Conference on Information Quality|conference-url=http://mitiq.mit.edu/iciq/iqpapers.aspx?iciqyear=1996|editor=Richard Y. Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, most health data have been sourced from this framework. The advent of [[eHealth]] and advances in [[health information technology]], however, have expanded the collection and use of health data—but have also engendered new security, privacy, and ethical concerns. The increasing collection and use of health data by patients is a major component of [[digital health]].

== Types ==
Health data are classified as either structured or unstructured. Structured health data are standardized and easily transferable between health information systems.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://insights.datamark.net/white-papers/unstructured-data-in-electronic-health-record-systems-challenges-and-solutions|title=Unstructured Data in Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems: Challenges and Solutions|last=|first=|date=Oct 2013|publisher=Datamark Incorporated|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a patient's name, date of birth, or a blood-test result can be recorded in a structured data format. Unstructured health data, unlike structured data, are not standardized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Emails, audio recordings, or physician notes about a patient are examples of unstructured health data. While advances in [[health information technology]] have expanded collection and use, the complexity of health data has hindered standardization in the health care industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As of 2013, it was estimated that approximately 60% of health data in the United States were unstructured.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Collection ==
[[Health informatics]], a field of health data management, superseded medical informatics in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eckD3fSrPagC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=health+informatics+history+of&amp;ots=wuA80Lg8q0&amp;sig=S0TfTdOjq2Y8GUc7y3rbzOAypM8#v=onepage&amp;q=health%20informatics%20history%20of&amp;f=false|title=Health Informatics: An Overview|last=Hovenga|first=Evelyn J. S.|date=2010|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=9781607500926|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health informatics, which is broadly defined as the collection, storage, distribution, and use of health data, differs from medical informatics in its use of [[information technology]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Individuals are the origin of all health data, yet the most direct if often overlooked is the informal personal collection of data. Examples include an individual checking off that they've taken their medication on a personal calendar, or an individual tallying the amount sleep they've gotten over the last week. 
[[File:Sources of healthdatav Created by GoInvo.png|thumb|Sources of health data]]
Prior to recent technological advances, most health data were collected within health care systems. As individuals move through health care systems, they interact with health care providers and this interaction produces health information. These touch points include, clinics/physician offices, pharmacies, payers/insurance companies, hospitals, laboratories, and senior homes. Information is also collected through participation in clinical trials, health agency surveys, medical devices, and genomic testing. This information, once recorded, becomes health data. This data typically includes a record of services received, conditions of those services, and clinical outcomes consequent of those services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, a blood draw may be a service received, a white blood cell count may be a condition of that service, and a reported measurement of white blood cells may be an outcome of that service. Information also frequently collected and  found in medical records includes, administrative and billing data, patient demographic information, progress notes, vital signs, medications diagnoses, immunization dates, allergies, and lab results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/faqs/what-information-does-electronic-health-record-ehr-contain|title=What information does an electronic health record (EHR) contain? {{!}} FAQs {{!}} Providers &amp; Professionals {{!}} HealthIT.gov|website=www.healthit.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in health information technology have expanded the scope of health data. Advances in health information technology have fostered the [[eHealth]] paradigm, which has expanded the collection, use, and philosophy of health data. EHealth, a term coined in the health information technology industry,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; has been described in academia as &lt;blockquote&gt;an emerging field [at] the intersection of medical informatics, public health and business, referring to health services and information delivered or enhanced through the Internet and related technologies. In a broader sense, the term characterizes not only a technical development, but also a state-of-mind, a way of thinking, an attitude, and a commitment for networked, global thinking, to improve health care ... using information and communication technology.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eysenbach|first=G|date=2001-06-18|title=What is e-health?|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.2196/jmir.3.2.e20|issn=1438-8871|pmc=1761894|pmid=11720962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;From the confluence of eHealth and [[mobile technology]] emerged [[mHealth]], which is considered a subsector of eHealth.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://www.who.int/goe/publications/goe_mhealth_web.pdf|title=mHealth: New horizons for health through mobile technologies|date=2011|volume=Global Observatory for eHealth series - Volume 3|isbn=978 92 4 156425 0|access-date=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; mHealth has been defined as&lt;blockquote&gt;medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices  ... . mHealth involves the use and capitalization on a mobile phone's core utility of voice and short messaging service (SMS) as well as more complex functionalities and applications including general packet radio service (GPRS), third and fourth generation mobile telecommunications (3G and 4G systems), global positioning system (GPS), and Bluetooth technology.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The emergence of eHealth and mHealth have expanded the definition of health data by creating new opportunities for patient-generated health data (PGHD).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:sBGK87xih9YJ:scholar.google.com/+patient+generated+health+data+AND+mhealth&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,9|title=Patient-Generated Health Data  White Paper|last=Technology|first=Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information|website=scholar.googleusercontent.com|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; PGHD has been defined as "health-related data—including health history, symptoms, biometric data, treatment history, lifestyle choices, and other information—created, recorded, gathered, or inferred by or from patients or their designees ... to help address a health concern."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; MHealth allows patients to monitor and report PGHD outside of a clinical setting. For example, a patient could use a blood monitor interfaced with her or his smartphone to track and distribute PGHD.

PGHD, mHealth, eHealth, and other technological development such as telemedicine, constitute a new [[digital health]] paradigm. Digital health describes a patient-centric health care system in which patients manage their own health and wellness with new technologies that will gather and assess their data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/digitalhealth/|title=Digital Health|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data has become increasingly valuable in the 21st century and new economies have been shaped by who controls it&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721634-how-it-shaping-up-data-giving-rise-new-economy|title=Data is giving rise to a new economy|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;—health data and the [[Healthcare industry|health care industry]] are unlikely to be an exception. An increase in PGHD has led some experts to envision a future in which patients have greater influence over the health care system.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Patients may use their leverage as data producers to demand more transparency, [[open science]], clearer data use consent, more patient engagement in research, development, and delivery, and greater access to research outcomes.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nam.edu/disruptive-innovation-and-transformation-of-the-drug-discovery-and-development-enterprise/|title=Disruptive Innovation and Transformation of the Drug Discovery and Development Enterprise - National Academy of Medicine|date=2016-07-20|work=National Academy of Medicine|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.17226/24685|title=Real-World Evidence Generation and Evaluation of Therapeutics: Proceedings of a Workshop|last=Discovery|first=Forum on Drug|last2=Development|last3=Translation|first3=and|last4=Policy|first4=Board on Health Sciences|last5=Division|first5=Health and Medicine|last6=Sciences|first6=National Academies of|last7=Engineering|last8=Medicine|first8=and|date=2017-02-15|isbn=9780309455626|language=en|doi=10.17226/24685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, it is foreseeable that "health care will be owned, operated, and driven by consumers."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Moreover, some large [[Technology company|technology companies]] have entered the PGHD space. One example is [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] ResearchKit. These companies may use their newfound PGHD leverage to enter and disrupt the health care market.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Uses ==
Health data can be used to benefit individuals, public health, and medical research and development.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raghupathi|first=Wullianallur|last2=Raghupathi|first2=Viju|date=2014-12-01|title=Big data analytics in healthcare: promise and potential|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2047-2501-2-3|journal=Health Information Science and Systems|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1186/2047-2501-2-3|issn=2047-2501}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uses of health data are classified as either primary or secondary. Primary use is when health data is used to deliver health care to the individual from whom it was collected.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Safran|first=Charles|last2=Bloomrosen|first2=Meryl|last3=Hammond|first3=W.

Digitization and health information technology have expanded the primary and secondary uses of health data. Over the last decade the U.S. health care system widely adopted [[electronic health record]]s (EHRs)—an inevitable shift given EHR benefits over paper systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunter|first=Tracy D|last2=Terry|first2=Nicolas P|date=2005|title=The Emergence of National Electronic Health Record Architectures in the United States and Australia: Models, Costs, and Questions|url=http://www.jmir.org/2005/1/e3/|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|language=EN|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.2196/jmir.7.1.e3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/physician-ehr-adoption-trends.php|title=Office-based Physician Electronic Health Record Adoption|website=dashboard.healthit.gov|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; EHRs have expanded the secondary uses of health data for [[quality assurance]], [[clinical research]], [[medical research]] and development, [[public health]], and [[big data]] [[Health care analytics|health analytics]], among other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hersh|first=William R.|date=June 2007|title=Adding value to the electronic health record through secondary use of data for quality assurance, research, and surveillance|journal=The American Journal of Managed Care|volume=13|issue=6 Part 1|pages=277–278|issn=1936-2692|pmid=17567224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pakhomov|first=Serguei|last2=Weston|first2=Susan A.|last3=Jacobsen|first3=Steven J.|last4=Chute|first4=Christopher G.|last5=Meverden|first5=Ryan|last6=Roger|first6=Véronique L.|date=June 2007|title=Electronic medical records for clinical research: application to the identification of heart failure|journal=The American Journal of Managed Care|volume=13|issue=6 Part 1|pages=281–288|issn=1936-2692|pmid=17567225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Botsis|first=Taxiarchis|last2=Hartvigsen|first2=Gunnar|last3=Chen|first3=Fei|last4=Weng|first4=Chunhua|date=2010-03-01|title=Secondary Use of EHR: Data Quality Issues and Informatics Opportunities | journal=Summit on Translational Bioinformatics|volume=2010|pages=1–5|issn=2153-6430|pmc=3041534|pmid=21347133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; [[Personal health record]]s (PHRs), while less popular than EHRs,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; have expanded the primary uses of health data.

== Security and privacy ==

In the United States, prior to the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) of 1996, there were no comprehensive federal policies that regulated the security or privacy of health data.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Melissa M.|last2=Pewen|first2=William F.|date=2013-11-01|title=The Hipaa Omnibus Rule: Implications for Public Health Policy and Practice|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003335491312800615|journal=Public Health Reports|language=en|volume=128|issue=6|pages=554–558|doi=10.1177/003335491312800615}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HIPAA regulates the use and disclosure of [[protected health information]] (PHI) by specified entities, including health providers, health care clearinghouses, and health plans.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; HIPAA implementation, delayed by federal-level negotiations, became broadly effective in 2003.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

While HIPAA established health data security and privacy in the U.S., gaps in protection persisted. The emergence of new health information technologies exacerbated these gaps.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ren|first=Y.|last2=Werner|first2=R.|last3=Pazzi|first3=N.|last4=Boukerche|first4=A.|date=February 2010|title=Monitoring patients via a secure and mobile healthcare system|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5416351/?reload=true|journal=IEEE Wireless Communications|volume=17|issue=1|pages=59–65|doi=10.1109/MWC.2010.5416351|issn=1536-1284}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act]] was passed. The legislation aimed to close the existing gaps in HIPAA by expanding HIPAA regulations to more entities, including business associates or subcontractors which store health data.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 2013, an Omnibus Rule implementing final provisions of HITECH was revealed by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Despite these legislative amends, security and privacy concerns continue to persist as healthcare technologies advance and grow in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Arora | first = Shifali | last2 = Yttri | first2 = Jennifer | last3 = Nilsen | first3 = Wendy | date=2014 | title = Privacy and Security in Mobile Health (mHealth) Research | journal = Alcohol Research: Current Reviews|volume=36|issue=1|pages=143–151|issn=2168-3492|pmc=4432854|pmid=26259009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noticing that in 2018, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Indicators_Research  Social Indicators Research] published the scientific evidence of 173,398,820 (over 173 million) individuals affected in USA from October 2008 (when the data were collected) to September 2017 (when the statistical analysis took place).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-018-1837-z | title=Electronic Health Record Breaches as Social Indicators | accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical considerations ==
There are important ethical considerations for the collection and secondary use of health data. While discussions on the ethical collection and use of health data typically focus on research, it is important not to overlook potential data misuse by non-research organizations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wade|first=Derick|date=2007-06-28|title=Ethics of collecting and using healthcare data|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/334/7608/1330|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=334|issue=7608|pages=1330–1331|doi=10.1136/bmj.39247.679329.80|issn=0959-8138|pmid=17599978}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the collection and use of health data for any non-clinical purpose, "is ethically sound only if there is (or could reasonably arise) a question to be answered; the methodology (design, data collected, etc) will answer the question; and the costs, including both communal health care resources and any risks and burden imposed on the participants, justify the benefits to society."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

This article provides a brief overview of the health systems of the world, sorted by continent.

==Africa==

===Algeria===
{{Main article|Health in Algeria}}

When Algeria gained its independence from France in 1962, there were only around 300 doctors across the whole country and no proper system of healthcare. Over the next few decades, great progress was made in building up the health sector, with the training of doctors and the creation of many health facilities. Today, Algeria has an established network of hospitals (including university hospitals), clinics, medical centres and small health units or dispensaries. While equipment and medicines may not always be the latest available, staffing levels are high and the country has one of the best healthcare systems in Africa. Access to health care is enhanced by the requirement that doctors and dentists work in [[public health]] for at least five years. The government provides [[universal health care]].

===Cape Verde===
{{Main article|Health in Cape Verde}}

Medical facilities in [[Cape Verde]] are limited, and some medicines are in short supply or unavailable.  There are hospitals in [[Praia]] and [[Mindelo]], with smaller medical facilities in other places.  The islands of [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]] and [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]] no longer have functioning airports so air evacuation in the event of a medical emergency is nearly impossible from these two islands.  Brava also has limited inter-island ferry service.&lt;ref name=us&gt;[[United States Department of State]], [https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1083.html "Cape Verde: Country Specific Information"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125120707/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1083.html# |date=25 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eritrea===
{{Main article|Health in Eritrea}}

Eritrea is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for health. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have identified the high prioritisation of health and education both within the government and amongst Eritreans at home and abroad. Innovative multi-sectoral approaches to health were also identified with the success. About one-third of the population lives in extreme [[poverty]], and more than half survives on less than US$1 per day.  Health care and welfare resources generally are believed to be poor, although reliable information about conditions is often difficult to obtain. In 2001, the most recent year for which figures are available, the Eritrean government spent 5.7 percent of [[gross domestic product]] on national health accounts. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimated that in 2004 there were only three physicians per 100,000 people in [[Eritrea]]. The two-year war with [[Ethiopia]], coming on the heels of a 30-year struggle for independence, negatively affected the health sector and the general welfare. The rate of prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]), in Eritrea is believed to be at 0.7%(2012)which is reasonably low. In the decade since 1995, impressive results have been achieved in lowering maternal and [[child mortality]] rates and in immunizing children against childhood diseases. In 2008 average life expectancy was slightly less than 63 years, according to the WHO. Immunisation and child nutrition has been tackled by working closely with schools in a multi-sectoral approach; the number of children vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years, from 40.7% to 78.5% and the underweight prevalence among children decreased by 12% in 1995–2002 (severe underweight prevalence by 28%). This has helped to some small extent even out rural-urban and rich-poor inequity in health.

===Ethiopia===
{{Main article|Health in Ethiopia}}

Throughout the 1990s, the government, as part of its reconstruction program, devoted ever-increasing amounts of funding to the social and health sectors, which brought corresponding improvements in school enrollments, adult [[literacy]], and [[infant mortality rate]]s. These expenditures stagnated or declined during the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War|1998–2000 war with Eritrea]], but in the years since, outlays for health have grown steadily. In 2000–2001, the budget allocation for the health sector was approximately US$144 million; health expenditures per capita were estimated at US$4.50, compared with US$10 on average in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2000 the country counted one hospital bed per 4,900 population and more than 27,000 people per primary health care facility. The [[physician]] to population ratio was 1:48,000, the [[nurse]] to population ratio, 1:12,000. Overall, there were 20 trained health providers per 100,000 inhabitants. These ratios have since shown some improvement. Health care is disproportionately available in urban centers; in rural areas where the vast majority of the population resides, access to health care varies from limited to nonexistent. As of the end of 2003, the [[United Nations]] (UN) reported that 4.4 percent of adults were infected with [[human immunodeficiency virus]]/[[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (HIV/AIDS); other estimates of the rate of infection ranged from a low of 7 percent to a high of 18 percent. Whatever the actual rate, the [[HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia|prevalence of HIV/AIDS]] has contributed to falling life expectancy since the early 1990s. According to the [[Ministry of Health (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Health]], one-third of current young adult deaths are AIDS-related. [[Malnutrition]] is widespread, especially among children, as is [[food insecurity]]. Because of growing population pressure on agricultural and pastoral land, soil degradation, and severe droughts that have occurred each decade since the 1970s, per capita food production is declining. According to the UN and the [[World Bank]], Ethiopia at present suffers from a structural food deficit such that even in the most productive years, at least 5 million Ethiopians require food relief.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

In 2002 the government embarked on a poverty reduction program that called for outlays in education, health, sanitation, and water. A [[polio]] [[vaccination]] campaign for 14 million children has been carried out, and a program to [[Resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia|resettle]] some 2 million subsistence farmers is underway. In November 2004, the government launched a five-year program to expand primary health care. In January 2005, it began distributing [[antiretroviral drugs]], hoping to reach up to 30,000 HIV-infected adults.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Ghana===
{{Main article|Health in Ghana}}

In [[Ghana]], most health care is provided by the government, but hospitals and clinics run by religious groups also play an important role.  Some for-profit clinics exist, but they provide less than 2% of health services.  Health care is very variable through the country.  The major urban centres are well served, but rural areas often have no modern health care.  Patients in these areas either rely on traditional medicine or travel great distances for care. In 2005, Ghana spent 6.2% of GDP on health care, or US$30 per capita. Of that, approximately 34% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Guinea===
{{see also|Guinea#Health}}

[[Guinea]] has been reorganizing its health system since the [[Bamako Initiative]] of 1987 formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of [[primary health care]] to the population, including community ownership and local budgeting, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of drugs and other essential health care resources.&lt;ref&gt;Knippenberg R et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10173105?dopt=Abstract "Implementation of the Bamako Initiative: strategies in Benin and Guinea."] ''Int J Health Plann Manage''. 1997 Jun;12 Suppl 1:S29-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the Guinean government announced the establishment of an air ticket solidarity levy on all flights taking off from national soil, with funds going to [[UNITAID]] to support expanded access to treatment for [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[malaria]].&lt;ref name="UNITAID"&gt;UNITAID.

===Mali===
{{Main article|Health in Mali}}

Health in [[Mali]], one of the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|world’s poorest nations]], is greatly affected by [[poverty]], [[malnutrition]], and inadequate [[hygiene]] and [[sanitation]]. Mali's health and development indicators rank among the worst in the world. In 2000 only 62–65 percent of the population was estimated to have access to safe drinking water and only 69 percent to sanitation services of some kind; only 8 percent was estimated to have access to modern sanitation facilities. Only 20 percent of the nation’s villages and livestock watering holes had modern water facilities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Mali.pdf Mali country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (January 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Mali is dependent on international development organizations and foreign missionary groups for much of its health care. In 2001 general government expenditures on health constituted 6.8 percent of total general government expenditures and 4.3 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), totaling only about US$4 per capita at an average exchange rate. Medical facilities in Mali are very limited, especially outside of [[Bamako]], and medicines are in short supply. There were only 5 [[physicians]] per 100,000 inhabitants in the 1990s and 24 hospital beds per 100,000 in 1998. In 1999 only 36 percent of Malians were estimated to have access to health services within a five-kilometer radius.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Morocco===
{{Main article|Health in Morocco}}

According to the United States government, [[Morocco]] has inadequate numbers of [[physicians]] (0.5 per 1,000 people) and hospital beds (1.0 per 1,000 people) and poor access to [[water]] (82 percent of the population) and [[sanitation]] (75 percent of the population). The health care system includes 122 hospitals, 2,400 health centers, and 4 university clinics, but they are poorly maintained and lack adequate capacity to meet the demand for medical care. Only 24,000 beds are available for 6 million patients seeking care each year, including 3 million emergency cases. The health budget corresponds to 1.1 percent of [[gross domestic product]] and 5.5 percent of the central government budget.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Morocco.pdf Morocco country profile].

===Niger===
{{Main article|Health in Niger}}

Health care system of [[Niger]] suffers from a chronic lack of resources and a small number of health providers relative to population. Some medicines are in short supply or unavailable.  There are government hospitals in [[Niamey]] (with three main hospitals in Niamey, including the ''Hôpital National de Niamey'' and the ''Hôpital National De Lamordé''), [[Maradi, Niger|Maradi]], [[Tahoua]], [[Zinder]] and other large cities, with smaller medical clinics in most towns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stone-env.com/docs/atlases/NigerPrelimPov/Map8.pdf REPUBLIC OF NIGER PRELIMINARY ATLAS OF POVERTY/VULNERABILITY.

Government hospitals, as well as [[public health]] programmes, fall under the control of the [[Nigerien Ministry of Health]]. A number of private for profit clinics ("''Cabinets Médical Privé''") operate in Niamey. The total expenditure on health per capita in 2005 was Intl $25.  There were 377 [[Physicians]] in Niger in 2004, a ratio of 0.03 per 10,000 population.  In 2003, 89.2 percent of individual expenditures on health care were "out-of-pocket" (paid by the patient).&lt;ref name=who2006&gt;[http://www.afro.who.int/home/countries/fact_sheets/niger.pdf Niger.

===Nigeria===
{{Main article|Health in Nigeria}}

Health care provision in [[Nigeria]] is a [[wikt:concurrent|concurrent]] responsibility of the three tiers of government in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Rais Akhtar; Health Care Patterns and Planning in Developing Countries, Greenwood Press, 1991. pp 264&lt;/ref&gt; However, because Nigeria operates a [[mixed economy]], private providers of health care have a visible role to play in health care delivery. The [[Politics of Nigeria|federal government]]'s role is mostly limited to coordinating the affairs of the [[university]] [[teaching hospital]]s, while the state government manages the various [[hospital|general hospitals]] and the [[local government]] focus on [[dispensaries]]. The total expenditure on health care as % of GDP is 4.6, while the percentage of federal government expenditure on health care is about 1.5%.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 18&lt;/ref&gt; A [[long run]] indicator of the ability of the country to provide food sustenance and avoid [[malnutrition]] is the rate of growth of per capita food production; from 1970 to 1990, the rate for Nigeria was 0.25%.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt; Though small, the positive rate of per capita may be due to Nigeria's importation of food products. Historically, health insurance in Nigeria can be applied to a few instances: government-paid health care provided and financed for all citizens, health care provided by government through a special health insurance scheme for government employees and private firms entering contracts with private health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 101-102&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are few people who fall within the three instances. In May 1999, the government created the [[National Health Insurance]] Scheme, the scheme encompasses government employees, the organized [[private sector]] and the informal sector. Legislative wise, the scheme also covers children under five, permanently disabled persons and prison inmates. In 2004, the administration of Obasanjo further gave more legislative powers to the scheme with positive amendments to the original 1999 legislative act.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia Monye; 'An Appraisal of the National Health Insurance Scheme of [[Nigeria]]', Commonwealth Law Bulletin, 32:3 415-427&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senegal===
{{Main article|Health in Senegal}}

The health budget in Senegal has tripled between 1980 and 2000, leading to the Senegalese people leading healthier and longer lives – the life expectancy at birth is approximately 55.34 years for men, 58.09 years for women, and 56.69 years for the entire population. Also, the prevalence rate of AIDS in Senegal is one of the lowest in Africa, at 0.9%. However, large disparities still exist in Senegal's health coverage, with 70% of doctors, and 80% of pharmacists and dentists, living in the nation's capital city, Dakar.

===South Africa===
{{Main article|Health in South Africa}}

In [[South Africa]], parallel private and public systems exist.  The public system serves the vast majority of the population, but is chronically underfunded and understaffed.  The wealthiest 20% of the population uses the private system and are far better served.  This division in substantial ways perpetuates racial inequalities created in the pre-apartheid segregation era and apartheid era of the 20th century. In 2005, South Africa spent 8.7% of GDP on health care, or US$437 per capita. Of that, approximately 42% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Sudan===
{{Main article|Health in Sudan}}

Outside urban areas, little health care is available in [[Sudan]], helping account for a relatively low average [[life expectancy]] of 57 years and an [[infant mortality]] rate of 69 deaths per 1,000 live births, low by standards in Middle Eastern but not African countries. For most of the period since independence in 1956, Sudan has experienced [[civil war]], which has diverted resources to military use that otherwise might have gone into health care and training of professionals, many of whom have migrated in search of more gainful employment. In 1996 the [[World Health Organization]] estimated that there were only 9 doctors per 100,000 people, most of them in regions other than the South. Substantial percentages of the population lack access to safe water and sanitary facilities. [[Malnutrition]] is widespread outside the central Nile corridor because of population displacement from war and from recurrent droughts; these same factors together with a scarcity of medicines make diseases difficult to control. Child immunization against most major childhood diseases, however, had risen to approximately 60 percent by the late 1990s from very low rates in earlier decades. Spending on health care is quite low – only 1 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 1998 (latest data). The [[United Nations]] placed the rate of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS]]) infection in late 2003 at 2.3 percent for adults, quite low by regional standards. The United Nations suggested, however, that the rate could be as high as 7.2 percent. Between 400,000 and 1.3 million adults and children were living with HIV, and AIDS deaths numbered 23,000. As of late 2004, some 4 million persons in the South had been internally displaced and more than 2 million had died or been killed as a result of two decades of war. Comparable figures for [[Darfur]] were 1.6 million displaced and 70,000 dead since fighting began there in early 2003.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Sudan.pdf Sudan country profile].

[[Bhutan]]'s health care system development accelerated in the early 1960s with the establishment of the Department of Public Health and the opening of new hospitals and dispensaries throughout the country. By the early 1990s, health care was provided through twenty-nine general hospitals (including five leprosy hospitals, three army hospitals, and one mobile hospital), forty-six dispensaries, sixty-seven basic health units, four indigenous-medicine dispensaries, and fifteen [[malaria]] eradication centers. The major hospitals were the [[National Referral Hospital (Thimphu)|National Referral Hospital]] in [[Thimphu]], and other hospitals in [[Geylegphug]], and [[Tashigang]]. Hospital beds in 1988 totaled 932. There was a severe shortage of health care personnel with official statistics reporting only 142 [[physician]]s and 678 [[paramedic]]s, about one health care professional for every 2,000 people, or only one physician for almost 10,000 people. Training for health care assistants, nurses' [[nurse's aide|aides]], [[midwive]]s, and primary health care workers was provided at the [[Royal Institute of Health Sciences (Bhutan)|Royal Institute of Health Sciences]], associated with Thimphu General Hospital, which was established in 1974. Graduates of the school were the core of the national public health system and helped staff the primary care basic health units throughout the country. Additional health care workers were recruited from among volunteers in villages to supplement primary health care.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Worden, Robert L. "Health".

{{See also|Health in Hong Kong|Health in Macau}}

The effective public health work in controlling epidemic disease during the early years of the PRC and, after reform began in 1978, the dramatic improvements in nutrition greatly improved the health and life expectancy of the Chinese people. The 2000 WHO [[World Health Report|''World Health Report – Health systems: improving performance'']] found that China's health care system before 1980 performed far better than countries at a comparable level of development, since 1980 ranks much lower than comparable countries.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"&gt;World Health Organization. (2000). ''World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance.'' Geneva, WHO http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the famed "[[barefoot doctor]]" system was abolished in 1981.

China is undertaking a [[Healthcare system reform in the People's Republic of China|reform on its health care system]]. The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS) is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the health care system, particularly intended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical cover is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid in by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70–80% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to about 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;"The reform of the rural cooperative medical system in the People's Republic of China: interim experience in 14 pilot counties." Authors: Carrin G.1; Ron A.; Hui Y.; Hong W.; Tuohong Z.; Licheng Z.; Shuo Z.; Yide Y.; Jiaying C.; Qicheng J.; Zhaoyang Z.; Jun Y.; Xuesheng L.

Health care was provided in both rural and urban areas through a three-tiered system. In rural areas the first tier was made up of barefoot doctors working out of village medical centers. They provided preventive and primary-care services, with an average of two doctors per 1,000 people. At the next level were the township health centers, which functioned primarily as out-patient clinics for about 10,000 to 30,000 people each. These centers had about ten to thirty beds each, and the most qualified members of the staff were assistant doctors. The two lower-level tiers made up the "rural collective health system" that provided most of the country's medical care. Only the most seriously ill patients were referred to the third and final tier, the county hospitals, which served 200,000 to 600,000 people each and were staffed by senior doctors who held degrees from 5-year [[medical school]]s. Health care in urban areas was provided by paramedical personnel assigned to factories and neighborhood health stations. If more professional care was necessary the patient was sent to a district hospital, and the most serious cases were handled by municipal hospitals. To ensure a higher level of care, a number of state enterprises and government agencies sent their employees directly to district or municipal hospitals, circumventing the paramedical, or barefoot doctor, stage.

===India===
{{Main article|Health in India}}

In [[India]], the hospitals are run by government, charitable trusts and by private organizations. The government hospitals in rural areas are called [[Primary Health Centre]]s (PHCs). Major hospitals are located in district headquarters or major cities. Apart from the modern system of medicine, traditional and indigenous medicinal systems like [[Ayurvedic]] and [[Unani]] systems are in practice throughout the country. The modern system of medicine is regulated by the [[Medical Council of India]], whereas the alternative systems recognised by Government of India are regulated by the Department of [[AYUSH]] (an acronym for [[Ayurveda]], [[Yoga]], [[Unani]], [[Siddha]] &amp; [[Homeopathy]]) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)|Ministry of Health, Government of India]]. PHCs are non-existent in most places, due to poor pay and scarcity of resources. Patients generally prefer private health clinics. These days some of the major corporate hospitals are attracting patients from neighboring countries such as [[Pakistan]], countries in the [[Middle East]] and some [[Europe]]an countries by providing quality treatment at low cost. In 2005, India spent 5% of GDP on health care, or US$36 per capita. Of that, approximately 19% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

In [[Japan]], services are provided either through regional/national public hospitals or through private hospitals/clinics, and patients have universal access to any facility, though hospitals tend to charge higher for those without a referral.{{Fact|date=January 2018}} Public health insurance covers most citizens/residents and pays 70% or more cost for each care and each prescribed drug. Patients are responsible for the remainder (upper limits apply). The monthly insurance premium is 0–50,000 JPY per household (scaled to annual income). Supplementary private health insurance is available only to cover the co-payments or non-covered costs, and usually makes a fixed payment per days in hospital or per surgery performed, rather than per actual expenditure. In 2005, Japan spent 8.2% of GDP on health care, or US$2,908 per capita. Of that, approximately 83% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Jordan===
{{Main article|Health in Jordan}}

In comparison to most of its neighbors, [[Jordan]] has quite an advanced [[health care]] system, although services remain highly concentrated in [[Amman]]. Government figures have put total health spending in 2002 at some 7.5 percent of [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP), while international health organizations place the figure even higher, at approximately 9.3 percent of GDP. The country’s health care system is divided between public and private institutions. In the public sector, the Ministry of Health operates 1,245 primary health care centers and 27 hospitals, accounting for 37 percent of all hospital beds in the country; the military’s Royal Medical Services runs 11 [[hospital]]s, providing 24 percent of all beds; and the [[Jordan University Hospital]] accounts for 3 percent of total beds in the country. The private sector provides 36 percent of all hospital beds, distributed among 56 hospitals. On 1 June 2007, Jordan Hospital (as the biggest private hospital) was the first general specialty hospital who gets the international accreditation (JCI). Treatment cost in Jordan hospitals is less than in other countries.

===Kazakhstan===
{{Main article|Health in Kazakhstan}}

In principle, health care is paid for by the government. However, [[bribes]] often are necessary to obtain needed care. The quality of health care, which remained entirely under state control in 2006, has declined in the post-Soviet era because of insufficient funding and the loss of technical experts through emigration. Between 1989 and 2001, the ratio of [[physician|doctors]] per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 15 percent, to 34.6, and the ratio of hospital beds per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 46 percent, to 74. By 2005 those indicators had recovered somewhat, to 55 and 77, respectively. Since 1991, health care has consistently lacked adequate government funding; in 2005 only 2.5 percent of [[gross domestic product]] went for that purpose. A government health reform program aims to increase that figure to 4 percent in 2010. A compulsory [[health insurance]] system has been in the planning stages for several years. Wages for health workers are extremely low, and equipment is in critically short supply. The main foreign source of medical equipment is Japan. Because of cost, the emphasis of treatment increasingly is on outpatient care instead of the hospital care preferred under the Soviet system. The health system is in crisis in rural areas such as the [[Aral Sea]] region, where health is most affected by [[pollution]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Kazakhstan.pdf Kazakhstancountry profile].

===Malaysia===
{{Main article|Health in Malaysia}}

Health care in [[Malaysia]] is divided into private and public sectors. Doctors are required to undergo a 2-year internship and perform 3 years of service with public hospitals throughout the nation, ensuring adequate coverage of medical needs for the general population. Foreign doctors are encouraged to apply for employment in Malaysia, especially if they are qualified to a higher level.

Malaysian society places importance on the expansion and development of health care, putting 5% of the government social sector development budget into [[Publicly funded health care|public health care]] – an increase of more than 47% over the previous figure. This has meant an overall increase of more than RM 2 billion. With a rising and ageing population, the Government wishes to improve in many areas including the refurbishment of existing hospitals, building and equipping new hospitals, expansion of the number of polyclinics, and improvements in training and expansion of [[telehealth]]. Over the last couple of years they have increased their efforts to overhaul the systems and attract more foreign investment.

There is still a shortage in the medical workforce, especially of highly trained specialists. As a result, certain medical care and treatment is available only in large cities. Recent efforts to bring many facilities to other towns have been hampered by lack of expertise to run the available equipment made ready by investments.

The majority of [[private hospital]] facilities are in urban areas and, unlike many of the public hospitals, are equipped with the latest diagnostic and imaging facilities.

===North Korea===

[[North Korea]] has a national medical service and health insurance system.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; As of 2000, some 99 percent of the population had access to [[sanitation]], and 100 percent had access to water, but water was not always [[potable]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Medical treatment is paid for by the state.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; In the past, there reportedly has been one doctor for every 700 inhabitants and one hospital bed for every 350 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Health expenditures in 2001 were 2.5 percent of gross domestic product, and 73 percent of health expenditures were made in the public sector.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; There were no reported human immuno-deficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS]]) cases as of 2007.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; However, it is estimated that between 500,000 and 3 million people died from [[famine]] in the 1990s, and a 1998 [[United Nations]] (UN) [[World Food Program]] report revealed that 60 percent of children suffered from [[malnutrition]], and 16 percent were acutely malnourished.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; UN statistics for the period 1999–2001 reveal that North Korea’s daily per capita food supply was one of the lowest in Asia, exceeding only that of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], and [[Tajikistan]], and one of the lowest worldwide.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Because of continuing economic problems, food shortages and chronic malnutrition prevail in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/North_Korea.pdf North Korea country profile].

===Oman===
{{Main article|Oman#Health|l1=Health in Oman}}

Oman's healthcare system was ranked at number 8 by the [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|WHO health systems ranking]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"/&gt; Universal healthcare (including prescriptions and dental care) is provided automatically to all citizens and also to expatriates working in the public sector by the Ministry of Health. Non-eligible individuals such as expatriates working in the private sector and foreign visitors can be treated in the government hospitals and clinics for a reasonable fee or they can opt for the more expensive private clinics and medical centres. The Ministry of Health also finances the treatment of citizens abroad if the required treatment is not available in Oman. The life expectancy in Oman as of 2007 was 71.6. It had 1.81 doctors per 1000 pop., 1.9 beds per 1000 pop. and an infant mortality rate of 9 per 1000 live births. Health expenditure accounts for 4.5% of government revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moh.gov.om/stat/2008/index_eng.htm |title=Annual Health Report |publisher=Moh.gov.om |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404120955/http://www.moh.gov.om/stat/2008/index_eng.htm |archivedate=4 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
{{Main article|Health in Pakistan}}

Pakistan's [[health indicators]], health funding, and health and [[sanitation]] infrastructure are generally poor, particularly in rural areas. About 19 percent of the population is [[malnourished]] – a higher rate than the 17 percent average for developing countries – and 30 percent of children under age five are malnourished. Leading causes of sickness and death include [[gastroenteritis]], [[respiratory infections]], [[congenital abnormalities]], [[tuberculosis]], [[malaria]], and [[typhoid fever]]. The [[United Nations]] estimates that in 2003 Pakistan’s [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) prevalence rate was 0.1 percent among those 15–49, with an estimated 4,900 deaths from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a major health concern, and both the government and religious community are engaging in efforts to reduce its spread. In 2003 there were 68 physicians for every 100,000 persons in Pakistan. According to 2002 government statistics, there were 12,501 health institutions nationwide, including 4,590 dispensaries, 906 [[hospitals]] with a total of 80,665 hospital beds, and 550 rural health centers with a total of 8,840 beds. According to the [[World Health Organization]], Pakistan’s '''total health expenditures''' amounted to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product ([[GDP]]) in 2001, and per capita health expenditures were US$16. The government provided 24.4 percent of total health expenditures, with the remainder being entirely private, out-of-pocket expenses.

===Philippines===
{{Main article|Health in the Philippines}}

In 2000 the [[Philippines]] had about 95,000 [[physician]]s, or about 1 per 800 people. In 2001 there were about 1,700 [[hospital]]s, of which about 40 percent were government-run and 60 percent private, with a total of about 85,000 beds, or about one bed per 900 people. The leading causes of morbidity as of 2002 were [[diarrhea]], [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[influenza]], [[hypertension]], [[tuberculosis]], [[heart disease]], [[malaria]], [[chickenpox]], and [[measles]]. [[Cardiovascular diseases]] account for more than 25 percent of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS). Other estimates state that there may have been as many as 9,400 people living with HIV/AIDS in 2001.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Philippines.pdf Philippines country profile].

===Singapore===
{{Main article|Health in Singapore}}

[[Health care in Singapore]] is mainly under the responsibility of the [[Singapore Government]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Singapore)|Ministry of Health]]. Singapore generally has an efficient and widespread system of health care. It implements a [[universal health care]] system, and co-exists with private health care system. [[Infant mortality]] rate: in 2006 the crude birth rate stood at 10.1 per 1000, and the crude death rate was also one of the lowest in the world at 4.3 per 1000. In 2006, the total fertility rate was only 1.26 children per woman, the 3rd lowest in the world and well below the 2.10 needed to replace the population. Singapore was ranked 6th in the [[World Health Organization]]'s ranking of the world's health systems in the year 2000.

[[Singapore]] has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private sector provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select.cfm |title=World Health Organization Statistical Information System: Core Health Indicators |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore currently has the lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equaled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/entity/whosis/whostat2007_1mortality.pdf "World Health Statistics 2007: Mortality"], based on 2005 data.&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore has "one of the most successful health care systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in community health outcomes," according to an analysis by global consulting firm [[Watson Wyatt Worldwide|Watson Wyatt]].&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore"/&gt; Singapore's system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payroll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized catastrophic health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as "actively regulating the supply and prices of health care services in the country" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a "very difficult system to replicate in many other countries." Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by the government's programs.&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore"&gt;John Tucci, [http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 "The Singapore health system – achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419231253/http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 |date=19 April 2010 }}, Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore’s well-established health care system comprises a total of 13 private hospitals, 10 public (government) hospitals and several specialist clinics, each specializing in and catering to different patient needs, at varying costs.

Patients are free to choose the providers within the government or private health care delivery system and can walk in for a consultation at any private clinic or any government polyclinic. For emergency services, patients can go at any time to the 24-hour Accident &amp; Emergency Departments located in the government hospitals.

Singapore's medical facilities are among the finest in the world, with well qualified doctors and dentists, many trained overseas.

Singapore has [[medical savings account]] system known as [[Medisave]].

===Syria===
{{Main article|Health in Syria}}

The [[Baath Party]] has placed an emphasis on [[health care]], but funding levels have not been able to keep up with demand or maintain quality. Health expenditures reportedly accounted for 2.5 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2001. Syria’s health system is relatively decentralized and focuses on offering primary health care at three levels: village, district, and provincial. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in 1990 Syria had 41 general [[hospital]]s (33 public, 8 private), 152 specialized hospitals (16 public, 136 private), 391 rural health centers, 151 urban health centers, 79 rural health units, and 49 specialized health centers; [[hospital bed]]s totaled 13,164 (77 percent public, 23 percent private), or 11 beds per 10,000 inhabitants. The number of state hospital beds reportedly fell between 1995 and 2001, while the population had an 18 percent increase, but the opening of new hospitals in 2002 caused the number of hospital beds to double. WHO reported that in 1989 Syria had a total of 10,114 [[physician]]s, 3,362 [[dentist]]s, and 14,816 [[nurse]]s and [[midwive]]s; in 1995 the rate of health professionals per 10,000 inhabitants was 10.9 physicians, 5.6 dentists, and 21.2 nurses and midwives. Despite overall improvements, Syria’s health system exhibits significant regional disparities in the availability of health care, especially between urban and rural areas. The number of private hospitals and doctors increased by 41 percent between 1995 and 2001 as a result of growing demand and growing wealth in a small sector of society. Almost all private health facilities are located in large urban areas such as [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[Tartus]], and [[Latakia]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Syria.pdf Syria country profile].

===Taiwan===
{{Main article|Health in Taiwan}}

The current health care system in [[Taiwan]], known as National Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchiang, Cecilia.[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&amp;CtNode=122 "New IC health insurance card expected to offer many benefits"], ''Taiwan Journal, 2 January 2004'' Accessed 28 March 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606010447/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&amp;CtNode=122 |date=6 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers. Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side. However, many health care providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services to a larger number of patients and then billing the government. In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment, NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002.

According to [[T.R. Reid]], Taiwan achieves "remarkable efficiency", costing ≈6 percent of GDP [[universal health care|universal coverage]]; however, this underestimates the cost as it is not fully funded and the government is forced to borrow to make up the difference. "And frankly, the solution is fairly obvious: increase the spending a little, to maybe 8 percent of GDP. Of course, if Taiwan did that, it would still be spending less than half of what America spends."&lt;ref name=trr&gt;[[T.R. Reid]] [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89651916 "Taiwan Takes Fast Track to Universal Health Care"], [[NPR]] 15 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
{{Main article|Health in Thailand}}

The majority of health care services in Thailand is delivered by the public sector, which includes 1,002 hospitals and 9,765 health stations. [[Universal health care]] is provided through three programs: the civil service welfare system for civil servants and their families, Social Security for private employees, and the Universal Coverage scheme theoretically available to all other Thai nationals. Some private hospitals are participants in these programs, though most are financed by patient self-payment and private insurance.

The [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Ministry of Public Health]] (MOPH) oversees national health policy and also operates most government health facilities. The National Health Security Office (NHSO) allocates funding through the Universal Coverage program. Other health-related government agencies include the Health System Research Institute (HSRI), Thai Health Promotion
Foundation ("ThaiHealth"), National Health Commission Office (NHCO), and the Emergency Medical Institute of Thailand (EMIT). Although there have been national policies for decentralization, there has been resistance in implementing such changes and the MOPH still directly controls most aspects of health care.

===Turkmenistan===
{{Main article|Health in Turkmenistan}}

In the post-Soviet era, reduced funding has put the health system in poor condition. In 2002 [[Turkmenistan]] had 50 hospital beds per 10,000 population, less than half the number in 1996. Overall policy has targeted specialized inpatient facilities to the detriment of basic, outpatient care. Since the late 1990s, many rural facilities have closed, making care available principally in urban areas. President [[Saparmurat Niyazov|Niyazov]]’s 2005 proposal to close all hospitals outside [[Ashgabat]] intensified this trend. [[Physicians]] are poorly trained, modern medical techniques are rarely used, and medications are in short supply. In 2004 Niyazov dismissed 15,000 medical professionals, exacerbating the shortage of personnel. In some cases, professionals have been replaced by military conscripts. Private health care is rare, as the state maintains a near monopoly. Government-paid public health care was abolished in 2004.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Turkmenistan.pdf Turkmenistan country profile].

===United Arab Emirates===
{{Main article|Health in the United Arab Emirates}}

Standards of health care are considered to be generally high in the [[United Arab Emirates]], resulting from increased government spending during strong economic years. According to the UAE government, total expenditures on health care from 1996 to 2003 were US$436 million. According to the [[World Health Organization]], in 2004 total expenditures on health care constituted 2.9 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and the per capita expenditure for health care was US$497. Health care currently is government-paid only for UAE citizens. Effective January 2006, all residents of [[Abu Dhabi]] are covered by a new comprehensive health insurance program; costs will be shared between employers and employees. The number of [[physician|doctors]] per 100,000 (annual average, 1990–99) is 181. The UAE now has 40 public hospitals, compared with only seven in 1970. The Ministry of Health is undertaking a multimillion-dollar program to expand health facilities – hospitals, medical centers, and a trauma center – in the seven emirates. A state-of-the-art general hospital has opened in Abu Dhabi with a projected bed capacity of 143, a trauma unit, and the first home health care program in the UAE. To attract wealthy UAE nationals and expatriates who traditionally have traveled abroad for serious medical care, Dubai is developing [[Dubai Healthcare City]], a hospital free zone that will offer international-standard advanced private health care and provide an academic medical training center; completion is scheduled for 2010.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/UAE.pdf United Arab Emirates country profile].

===Uzbekistan===
{{Main article|Health in Uzbekistan}}

In the post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, the quality of [[Uzbekistan]]’s [[health care]] has declined. Between 1992 and 2003, spending on health care and the ratio of hospital beds to population both decreased by nearly 50 percent, and Russian [[emigration]] in that decade deprived the health system of many practitioners. In 2004 Uzbekistan had 53 hospital beds per 10,000 population. Basic medical supplies such as disposable [[Hypodermic needle|needles]], [[anesthetics]], and [[antibiotics]] are in very short supply. Although all citizens nominally are entitled to [[government-paid health care|free health care]], in the post-Soviet era [[bribery]] has become a common way to bypass the slow and limited service of the state system. In the early 2000s, policy has focused on improving primary health care facilities and cutting the cost of inpatient facilities. The state budget for 2006 allotted 11.1 percent to health expenditures, compared with 10.9 percent in 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Uzbekistan.pdf Uzbekistan country profile].

===Vietnam===
{{Main article|Health in Vietnam}}

The overall quality of '''health in [[Vietnam]]''' is regarded as good, as reflected by 2005 estimates of [[life expectancy]] (70.61 years) and infant mortality (25.95 per 1,000 live births). However, [[malnutrition]] is still common in the provinces, and the life expectancy and [[infant mortality]] rates are stagnating. In 2001 government spending on health care corresponded to just 0.9 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Government subsidies covered only about 20 percent of health care expenses, with the remaining 80 percent coming out of individuals’ own pockets.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Vietnam.pdf Vietnam country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 the government in the North established a public health system that reached down to the hamlet level. After reunification in 1976, this system was extended to the South. Beginning in the late 1980s, the quality of health care began to decline as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces, and the introduction of charges. Inadequate funding has led to delays in planned upgrades to [[water supply]] and [[sewage]] systems. As a result, almost half the population has no access to clean water, a deficiency that promotes such infectious diseases as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], [[typhoid]], and [[cholera]]. Inadequate funding also has contributed to a shortage of [[nurses]], [[midwives]], and hospital beds. In 2000 Vietnam had only 250,000 hospital beds, or 14.8 beds per 10,000 people, a very low ratio among Asian nations, according to the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Yemen===
{{Main article|Health in Yemen}}

Despite the significant progress [[Yemen]] has made to expand and improve its health care system over the past decade, the system remains severely underdeveloped. Total expenditures on health care in 2002 constituted 3.7 percent of [[gross domestic product]]. In that same year, the per capita expenditure for health care was very low, as compared with other [[Middle East]]ern countries – US$58 according to [[United Nations]] statistics and US$23 according to the [[World Health Organization]]. According to the [[World Bank]], the number of [[physician|doctors]] in Yemen rose by an average of more than 7 percent between 1995 and 2000, but as of 2004 there were still only three doctors per 10,000 persons. In 2003 Yemen had only 0.6 hospital beds available per 1,000 persons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated17&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Yemen.pdf Yemen country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Health care services are particularly scarce in rural areas; only 25 percent of rural areas are covered by health services, as compared with 80 percent of urban areas. [[Emergency services]], such as [[ambulance]] service and [[blood banks]], are non-existent. Most childhood deaths are caused by illnesses for which [[vaccines]] exist or that are otherwise preventable. According to the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]], in 2003 an estimated 12,000 people in Yemen were living with [[human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (HIV/AIDS).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Belgium===
{{main article|Healthcare in Belgium}}

As in most countries, the Belgian system divides itself into state and private, though fees are payable in both. A person must have adequate coverage through either the state or private insurance. In the state ''mutuelle/mutualiteit'' scheme a person has the ability to choose any doctor, clinic or hospital in any location without referral, according to the patient's needs in much the same way as with private insurance.

====Doctors====
General practitioners can be found in private practices or attached to clinics and hospitals. A person is free to consult or register with any of their own choosing.  Similarly with specialist consultants. Reimbursements are available for those with insurance, either private or public. If a patient is on a private scheme, or is uninsured, the fee is payable in full at the time of the appointment. The patient then brings, mails or deposits the receipt to his insurance mutuality which then immediately repays the amount.

The majority of dentists in Belgium are private, though there are those who accept part-payment on state insurance.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

As with general practitioners, patients can arrange to see a specialist of their choice at any hospital. Those going into hospital for a planned stay need to take personal care items (such as a towel, soap etc.) with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jessazh.be/patienten-bezoekers/opname/campus-salvator/gewone-opname/wat-meebrengen |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115045216/http://www.jessazh.be/patienten-bezoekers/opname/campus-salvator/gewone-opname/wat-meebrengen |archivedate=15 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brussels]], the eleven big public hospitals are organized under the Iris association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iris-hopitaux.be/|title=Hôpitaux du réseau Iris Bruxelles|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complementary health care====
The Ministry of Health recognizes [[homeopathy]], [[acupuncture]], [[osteopathy]] and [[chiropractic]] as reimbursable alternative treatments.  Reimbursement is possible only if the practitioner is registered as a qualified doctor.

====Emergency treatment====
If a call is made to the Emergency services using the [[Emergency telephone number|old emergency number ('''100''')]] or the [[112 (emergency telephone number)|European telephone number ('''112''')]], an ambulance will transport the patient to the nearest hospital or the best centre suited according to the needs of the patient, for example, a [[Burn center|Specialist Burns Unit]].

====Pharmacies====
[[Pharmacies]] are common in Belgium and are marked with a green cross on the street. There is a rota system for pharmacists to open outside of usual hours through the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riziv.fgov.be/care/nl/infos/infobox/pharmacists/pdf/infobox_pharmacists.pdf|title= |publisher=INAMI|accessdate=30 November 2016}}{{deadlink|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health Insurance====
Health care insurance is a part of the Belgian social security system. To enroll, a person must first join a health insurance fund ''mutuelle'' (''mutualité'') or ''ziekenfonds'' (''mutualiteit'') for which an employer's certificate is required if the employer is to contribute to the cost. If employed a person's contributions is automatically deducted from salary. The employer will also pay a contribution. Health insurance funds will reimburse medical costs. The choice of mutual insurer is up to the individual. Most of them are affiliated to a religious or political institution but there is no real difference between them because reimbursement rates are fixed by the Belgian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&amp;la=N&amp;table_name=wet&amp;cn=1994071438|title=LOI|publisher=WET|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurance funds do not always cover the full costs of treatment and typical reimbursement is between half to three-quarters of a typical doctors or specialists visit. A deciding factor here depends on one's job. From people who are unemployed or disabled, receiving other benefits or business-owners receive somewhat less.  There is also a ''"yearly maximum bill"'' meaning that someone who has paid a certain amount to their doctor/hospital within the year does not have to make any further payment. From this point, any extra is returned from the patient's insurance. In general, the poor, even without reaching the necessary sum, do not pay anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.socialsecurity.be/CMS/nl/citizen/displayThema/health/SANTH_4/SANTH_4_3.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610230110/https://www.socialsecurity.be/CMS/nl/citizen/displayThema/health/SANTH_4/SANTH_4_3.xml |archivedate=10 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
{{Main article|Health in Bulgaria}}

[[Bulgaria]] began overall reform of its antiquated health system, inherited from the [[communist]] era, only in 1999. In the 1990s, private medical practices expanded somewhat, but most Bulgarians relied on communist-era public [[clinic]]s while paying high prices for special care. During that period, national health indicators generally worsened as economic crises substantially decreased health funding. The subsequent health reform program has introduced mandatory employee health insurance through the [[National Health Insurance Fund]] (NHIF), which since 2000 has paid a gradually increasing portion of primary health care costs. Employees and employers pay an increasing, mandatory percentage of [[Salary|salaries]], with the goal of gradually reducing state support of health care. Private health insurance plays only a supplementary role. The system also has been decentralized by making municipalities responsible for their own health care facilities, and by 2005 most primary care came from private [[physician]]s. Pharmaceutical distribution also was decentralized.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Bulgaria.pdf Bulgaria country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (October 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, the hospital system was reduced substantially to limit reliance on hospitals for routine care. Anticipated membership in the [[European Union]] (2007) was a major motivation for this trend. Between 2002 and 2003, the number of hospital beds was reduced by 56 percent to 24,300. However, the pace of reduction slowed in the early 2000s; in 2004 some 258 hospitals were in operation, compared with the estimated optimal number of 140. Between 2002 and 2004, health care expenditures in the national budget increased from 3.8 percent to 4.3 percent, with the NHIF accounting for more than 60 percent of annual expenditures.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

In the 1990s, the quality of medical research and training decreased seriously because of low funding. In the early 2000s, the emphasis of medical and [[paramedic]]al training, which was conducted in five medical schools, was preparation of primary-care personnel to overcome shortages resulting from the communist system’s long-term emphasis on training specialists. Experts considered that Bulgaria had an adequate supply of [[physician|doctors]] but a shortage of other medical personnel. In 2000 Bulgaria had 3.4 doctors, 3.9 nurses, and 0.5 midwives per 1,000 population.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Denmark===
{{Main article|Health care in Denmark}}

Denmark's health care system has retained the same basic structure since the early 1970s. The administration of hospitals and personnel is dealt with by the Ministry of the Interior, while primary care facilities, health insurance, and community care are the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Anyone can go to a physician for no fee and the public health system entitles each Dane to his/her own doctor. Expert medical/surgical aid is available, with a qualified nursing staff. Costs are borne by public authorities, but high taxes contribute to these costs. As of 1999, there were an estimated 3.4 physicians and 4.5 hospital beds per 1,000 people. The number of hospital beds, like that in other EU countries, has undergone a major decline since 1980, from around 40,000 to about 23,000 in 1998/99. Deinstitutionalization of psychiatric patients has contributed significantly to this trend. The ratio of doctors to population, by contrast, has increased during this period.

The total fertility rate in 2000 was 1.7, while the maternal mortality rate was 10 per 100,000 live births as of 1998. Studies show that between 1980 and 1993, 63% of married women (ages 15 to 49) used contraception. As of 2002 cardiovascular diseases and cancer were the leading causes of death. Denmark's cancer rates were the highest in the European Union. In 1999, there were only 12 reported cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people. As of 1999, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS was estimated at 4,300 and deaths from AIDS that year were estimated at less than 100. HIV prevalence was 0.17 per 100 adults.

Danish citizens may choose between two systems of primary health care: medical care paid for by the government provided by a doctor whom the individual chooses for a year and by those specialists to whom the doctor refers the patient; or complete freedom of choice of any physician or specialist at any time, with state reimbursement of about two-thirds of the cost for medical bills paid directly by the patient. Most Danes opt for the former. All patients receive subsidies on pharmaceuticals and vital drugs; everyone must pay a share of dental bills. As of 1999, total health care expenditure was estimated at 8.4% of GDP.

Responsibility for the public hospital service rests with county authorities. Counties form public hospital regions, each of which is allotted one or two larger hospitals with specialists and two to four smaller hospitals where medical treatment is practically totally paid for by the government. State-appointed medical health officers, responsible to the National Board of Health, are employed to advise local governments on health matters. Public health authorities have waged large-scale campaigns against tuberculosis, venereal diseases, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis. The government-paid guidance and assistance given to mothers of newborn children by public health nurses have resulted in a low infant mortality rate of 4 per 1,000 live births (2000). Medical treatment is government-paid up to school age, when government-paid school medical inspections begin. As of 1999, children up to one year of age were vaccinated against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (99%) and measles (92%). In 2000, life expectancy at birth was 76 years for males and females. The overall death rate was 11 per 1,000 people in 1999.

===Estonia===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Estonia}}

Healthcare in Estonia is supervised by the [[Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs|Ministry of Social Affairs]] and funded by general taxation through the National Health Service.

===Finland===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Finland}}

In [[Finland]], public medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 78% by [[taxation]], 20% by patients through access charges, and by others 2%. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example, GP visits are (€11 per visit with annual €33 cap), hospital outpatient treatment (€22 per visit), a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines (€26 per 24 hours, or €12 if in a psychiatric hospital). After a patient has spent €590 per year on public medical services, all treatment and medications thereafter are paid for by the government. Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. Patients can claim re-imbursement of part of their prescription costs from [[KELA (Finnish Social Insurance)|KELA]]. Finland also has a much smaller private medical sector which accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of these also choose to do some work in the public sector. Private sector patients can claim a contribution from KELA towards their private medical costs (including [[dentistry]]) if they choose to be treated in the more expensive private sector, or they can join private insurance funds. However, private sector health care is mainly in the primary care sector. There are virtually no private hospitals, the main hospitals being either municipally owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). In 2005, Finland spent 7.5% of GDP on health care, or US$2,824 per capita. Of that, approximately 78% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===France===
{{Main article|Health care in France}}

In its [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|2000 assessment of world health systems]], the [[World Health Organization]] found that France provided the "best overall health care" in the world.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"/&gt; In 2005, France spent 11.2% of GDP on health care, or US$3,926 per capita. Of that, approximately 80% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

In [[France]], most doctors remain in private practice; there are both [[Private sector|private]] and [[public hospital|public]] [[hospital]]s. Social Security consists of several public organizations, distinct from the state government, with separate budgets that refunds patients for care in both private and public facilities. It generally refunds patients 70% of most health care costs, and 100% in case of costly or long-term ailments. Supplemental coverage may be bought from private insurers, most of them [[nonprofit]], [[mutual insurer]]s, to the point that the word "{{ill|mutuelle|fr|Mutuelle de santé en France|vertical-align=sup}}" (mutual) has come to be a synonym of supplemental private insurer in common language.

Until recently, social security coverage was restricted to those who contributed to social security (generally, workers, unemployed or retirees), excluding some few poor segments of the population; the government of [[Lionel Jospin]] put into place the "universal health coverage" allowing the entire French population to benefit from Health care. In some systems, patients can also take private health insurance but choose to receive care at public hospitals, if allowed by the private [[insurer]]. For serious illness, regardless of the insurance regime, the national health system will assume the cost of long-term remedial treatment.

===Germany===
{{Main article|Health in Germany}}
[[File:UniKlinik (Freiburg) 4.jpg|thumb|The [[University Medical Center Freiburg]] in [[Germany]]]]

[[Germany]] has a universal multi-payer system with two main types of health insurance: "Law-enforced health insurance" (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung) known as sickness funds "Krankenkasse" and "Privat" (Private Krankenversicherung)
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm |title=The Case for Universal Health Care in the United States |publisher=Cthealth.server101.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.willamette.edu/centers/publicpolicy/projects/oregonsfuture/PDFvol5no2/countries_healthcare.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221134435/http://www.willamette.edu/centers/publicpolicy/projects/oregonsfuture/PDFvol5no2/countries_healthcare.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory insurance applies to those below a set income level and is provided through private non-profit "sickness funds" at similar rates for all members, and is paid for with joint employer-employee contributions. Provider compensation rates are negotiated in complex [[corporatism|corporatist]] social bargaining among specified autonomously organized interest groups (e.g. physicians' associations) at the level of [[States of Germany|federal states]] (Länder).  The sickness funds are mandated to provide a wide range of coverage and cannot refuse membership or otherwise discriminate on an actuarial basis. Small numbers of persons are covered by tax-funded government employee insurance or social welfare insurance. Persons with incomes above the prescribed compulsory insurance level may decide to remain in the sickness fund system, which a majority do, or opt out &amp; take private insurance.  Private supplementary insurance to the sickness funds of various sorts is available.

In 2005, Germany spent 10.7% of GDP on health care, or US$3,628 per capita. Of that, approximately 77% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Greece===
{{Main article|Health care in Greece}}

The [[Health care in Greece|Greek healthcare system]] is [[universal healthcare|universal]] and is ranked as one of the best in the world. In a 2000 [[World Health Organization]] report it was ranked 14th in the overall assessment and 11th at quality of service, surpassing countries such as the [[United Kingdom]] (18th) and [[Germany]] (25th).&lt;ref name="WHO report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |title=Health Systems: Improving Performance |work=The World Health Report 2000 |publisher=www.who.int |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 there were 131 hospitals with 35,000 beds in the country, but on 1 July 2011 the [[Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity (Greece)|Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity]] announced its proposal to shorten the number to 83 hospitals with 33,000 beds.&lt;ref name="Health Reform"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tovima.gr/files/1/2011/07/%CE%A0%CF%81%CF%8C%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B7%20%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%AC%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%BE%CE%B7%CF%82.pdf |script-title=el:ΠΡΟΤΑΣΗ ΛΕΙΤΟΥΡΓΙΚΩΝ ΑΝΑΔΙΑΤΑΞΕΩΝ ΜΟΝΑΔΩΝ ΥΓΕΙΑΣ ΕΣΥ |language=Greek |date=1 July 2011 |publisher=www.tovima.gr |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece's healthcare expenditures as a percentage of [[GDP]] were 9.6% in 2007 according to a 2011 [[OECD]] report, just above the OECD average of 9.5%.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/45/54/38979850.pdf |title=OECD Health Data 2011: How Does Greece Compare |publisher=www.oecd.org |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has the largest number of doctors-to-population ratio of any OECD country.&lt;ref name="OECD" /&gt;

===Iceland===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Iceland}}

Healthcare in [[Iceland]] is universal. The healthcare system is largely paid for by taxes (85%) and to some extent by service fees (15%) and is administrated by the Ministry of Welfare. A considerable portion of government spending is assigned to healthcare. There is almost no private health insurance in Iceland and no private hospitals.

===Ireland===
{{Main article|Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland}}

All persons resident in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are entitled to health care through the public health care system, which is managed by the [[Health Service Executive]] and funded by general taxation. A person may be required to pay a subsidised fee for certain health care received; this depends on income, age, illness or disability. All maternity services are however paid for by the government, as well as health care of infants under 6 months of age. Emergency care is provided at a cost of €120 for a visit to a hospital Emergency Department.

===Italy===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Italy}}

According to [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|WHO in 2000]], Italy had the world's "second overall best" healthcare system in the world, coming after [[France]], and surpassing [[Spain]], [[Oman]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/media_centre/press_release/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; World Health Organization Assesses the World's Health Systems |publisher=Who.int |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 [[Italy]] adopted a tax-funded [[universal health care]] system called "National Health Service" (in [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''[[Servizio Sanitario Nazionale]]''), which was closely modeled on the British system. The SSN covers general practice (distinct between adult and pediatric practice), outpatient and inpatient treatments, and the cost of most (but not all) drugs and sanitary ware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jose Marc Castro |url=http://www.expatforum.com/articles/health/health-care-in-italy.html |title=Health Care in Italy |publisher=Expatforum.com |date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The government sets LEA (fundamental levels of care, ''Livelli essenziali di assistenza'' in Italian) which cover all necessary treatments, which the state must guarantee to all, paid for by the government, or for a "ticket", a share of the costs (but various categories are exempted).&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.ministerosalute.it/programmazione/lea/lea.jsp LEA]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118215835/http://www.ministerosalute.it/programmazione/lea/lea.jsp |date=18 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The public system has also the duty of prevention at place of work and in the general environment.
A private sector also exists, with a minority role in medicine but a principal role in [[dental health]], as most people prefer private dental services.

In Italy the public system has the unique feature of paying general practitioners a fee [[per capita]] per year, a salary system, that does not reward repeat visits, testing, and referrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ess-europe.de/en/italy.htm |title=Health Service/Insurance Industry in Italy |publisher=Ess-europe.de |date=30 November 1998 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720065219/http://www.ess-europe.de/en/italy.htm |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While there is a paucity of nurses, Italy has one of the highest doctor per capita ratios at 3.9 [[Physician|doctors]] per 1,000 patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/53/12/38976551.pdf |title=Practising physicians per 1000 population, OECD countries, 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005, Italy spent 8.9% of GDP on health care, or US$2,714 per capita. Of that, approximately 76% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{Main article|Health in the Netherlands}}

[[Health care in the Netherlands]], has since January 2006 been provided by a system of compulsory insurance backed by a [[risk equalization]] program so that the insured are not penalized for their age or health status. This is meant to encourage competition between health care providers and insurers. Children under 18 are insured by the government, and special assistance is available to those with limited incomes. In 2005, the Netherlands spent 9.2% of GDP on health care, or US$3,560 per capita. Of that, approximately 65% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Norway===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Norway}}

Norway has a government run and government financed universal health care system, covering
physical and mental health for all and dental health for children under the age of 16. Hospitals are paid by the state and doctor visit fees are capped at a fairly low rate. Short-term prescriptions for medication are market price, but long-term prescriptions, defined as more than three months a year, are eligible for a large discount. In addition, a yearly cap applies for people with high medical expenses.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Some health care is private.  For example, most adults use private dental care, whereas the public system only treats people, for a normal fee, when they have free capacity. Health-related plastic surgery (like burn damage) is covered by the public system, while cosmetic surgery in general is private. There are a number of private psychologists, there are also some private general practice doctors and specialists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Public health care is financed by a special-purpose income tax on the order of 8-11%, loosely translated as "public benefits fee" (Norwegian: "trygdeavgift og Folketrygden"). This can be considered a mandatory public insurance, covering not only health care but also loss of income during sick leave, public pension, unemployment benefits, benefits for single parents and a few others. The system is supposed to be self-financing from the taxes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Norwegian citizens living in Norway are automatically covered, even if they never had taxable income. Norwegian citizens living and working abroad (taxable elsewhere and therefore not paying the "public benefits fee" to Norway) are covered for up to one year after they move abroad, and must pay an estimated market cost for public health care services. Non-citizens such as foreign visitors are covered in full.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

According to WHO, total health care expenditure in 2005 was 9% of GDP and paid 84% by government, 15% by private out-of-pocket and ≈1% by other private sources.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS"/&gt;

===Poland===

Health care public system has been improved but it is still poor by European standards, and access is limited in rural areas. In 2007 health expenditures were equal to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product. In 2007 there were 2.2 physicians and 6.4 hospital beds per 1,000 people. The system is funded by the National Health Care Insurance Fund, to which employers and employees make mandatory contributions. Private health care system has developed slowly but now consists of 22 private hospitals and more than 240 clinics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Romania.pdf Romania country profile].

The [[Sweden|Swedish]] public health system is funded through taxes levied by the [[County Councils of Sweden|county councils]], but partly run by private companies. There is a fixed charge of SEK 150 (US$21) for each visit to a doctor or a hospital but some may vary depending on the business itself and cause of admission &amp; desired service whereas prices can vary up to SEK 350 (US$52). Healthcare services that are accepted by the Swedish Board of Health (hälsovårdsnämnden) have "safe net" limits for visitors placed upon them to a maximum SEK 800 (US$111) per year along with prescription medicine from those clinics are also limited to 1,800 SEK (US$249) per year. Government-paid dental care for children under 21 years old is included in the system, and dental care for grown-ups is to a small extent subsidised by it.
Sweden also has a smaller private health care sector, mainly in larger cities or as centers for preventive health care financed by employers.

===Switzerland===

[[File:Spaceship-style Hospital in Zurich.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A private hospital in [[Zurich, Switzerland]].]]

In [[Switzerland]], compulsory [[health insurance]] covers the costs of medical treatment and hospitalization of the insured. The Swiss healthcare system is a combination of public, subsidized private and totally private healthcare providers, where the insured person has full freedom of choice among the providers in his region.  Insurance companies independently set their price points for different age groups, but are forbidden from setting prices based on health risk. In 2000, Switzerland topped all European countries’ health care expenditure when calculated as per capita expenditure in US dollar purchasing parity terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e68670.pdf |title=Front |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss health care system was the last for-profit system in Europe.  In the 1990s, after the private carriers began to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions – and when the uninsured population of Switzerland reached 5% – the Swiss held a referendum (1995) and adopted their present system.

'''Health care in [[Turkey]]''' used to be dominated by a centralized state system run by the Ministry of Health. In 2003 the government introduced a sweeping health reform program aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state health provision and making health care available to a larger share of the population. Information from the [[Turkish Statistical Institute]] states that 76.3 billions of [[Turkish Lira]]s are being spent in healthcare, with 79.6% of funding coming from the [[Sosyal Güvenlik Kurumu]] and most of the remainder (15.4%) coming from out-of-pocket payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/24892271.asp|title=Sağlığa 76,3 milyar lira harcandı|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 27.954 medical institutions, one doctor for 587 people and 2.54 beds for 1000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuik.gov.tr/UstMenu.do?metod=temelist|title=..::Türkiye İstatistik Kurumu Web sayfalarına Hoş Geldiniz::..|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Health care in the United Kingdom}}

The four [[countries of the United Kingdom]] have separate but co-operating public health care systems that were created in 1948: in [[England]] the public health system is known as the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]], in [[Scotland]] it is known as [[NHS Scotland]], in [[Wales]] as [[NHS Wales|NHS Wales (GIG Cymru)]], and in [[Northern Ireland]] it is called [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland]]. All four provide state-paid healthcare to all UK residents, paid for from general taxation. Though the public systems dominate, private health care and a wide variety of alternative and complementary treatments are available for those who have private health insurance or are willing to pay directly themselves.

One difference between the four public health care systems is the patient cost for prescriptions. Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have recently abolished, or are in the process of abolishing, all prescription charges, while England (with the exception of [[birth control pills]], which are paid for by the state) continues to charge patients who are between 18 and 60 years old a fixed prescription fee of £8.40 per item, unless they are exempt because of certain medical conditions (including cancer) or are on low income. Since health care delivery is a [[devolution|devolved matter]], considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems], [[BBC]], 2 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
{{Main article|Health care in Canada}}

[[Canada]] has a federally sponsored, publicly funded [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] system. Most services are provided by the public sector, and the remainder are provided by the private sector.

;Political responsibility
The Medicare system spans the federal and provincial governments and funding flows from the federal governments to the provinces to administer. The country's prime minister and most provincial premiers say they are committed to the [[Social Union Framework Agreement]] that promotes "comprehensiveness, universality, portability, public administration and accessibility" in health care.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada, Social Union, News Release, "[http://socialunion.gc.ca/news/020499_e.html A Framework to Improve the Social Union for Canadians: An Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Governments of the Provinces and Territories, February 4, 1999]."&lt;/ref&gt; Retrieved 20 December 2006.

;GDP
In 2005, Canada spent 9.8% of GDP on health care, or US$3,463 per capita.  Of that, approximately 70% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

;Services and costs
Canada's system is a [[single payer system]], where basic services are provided by private doctors. Hospitals provide additional services as well as community health clinics, and private clinics. Costs are paid for by the government for many services, but other services can be covered by private health plans that many employers offer as benefits. Some provinces still charge premiums to individuals and families. As well, some hospitals charge minimal user fees for [[emergency department]] visits.

;Private sector involvement
Other areas of health care, such as [[dentistry]] and [[optometry]], are wholly private, although in some provinces, emergency visits to optometrists are partly covered by medicare. Some provinces also allow private services which replicate those that are publicly offered, such as diagnostic services such as ultrasounds, x-Rays, and MRI. 
As well, many private companies acting as benefits or medical insurance providers have flourished.

;Doctor billings
Billing by doctors is complex and varies from province to province. In 1984, the [[Canada Health Act]] was passed, which prohibited extra billing by doctors on patients while at the same time billing the public insurance system. Each province may opt out, though none currently choose to. Most family doctors receive a fee per visit. These rates are negotiated between the provincial governments and the province's medical associations, usually on an annual basis.  A physician cannot charge a fee for a service that is higher than the negotiated rate – even to patients who are not covered by the publicly funded system – unless he or she opts out of billing the publicly funded system altogether.

;Pharmaceuticals
Pharmaceutical costs are set at a global median by government price controls.

;Improvement of the Canadian healthcare system
In May 2011, the Health Council released a report entitled: "Progress Report 2011: Health Care Renewal in Canada", which provides a pan-Canadian look at five key commitments of the 2003 First Ministers' Accord on Health Care Renewal&lt;ref name=2003accord&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 First Ministers Accord on Health Care Renewal|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2003accord/index-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=5 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806071254/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2003accord/index-eng.php|archivedate=6 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2004 10-Year Plan to Strengthen Health Care.&lt;ref name=10yrplan&gt;{{cite web|title=A 10-year plan to strengthen health care|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2004-fmm-rpm/index-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=5 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819164453/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2004-fmm-rpm/index-eng.php|archivedate=19 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report highlights the progress being achieved to date on wait times, pharmaceuticals management, electronic health records, teletriage, and health innovation.

===Costa Rica===
{{Main article|Health care in Costa Rica}}

[[Costa Rica]] provides universal health care to its citizens and permanent residents.

===Cuba===
{{Main article|Health care in Cuba}}

Health care in [[Cuba]] consists of a government-coordinated system that guarantees universal coverage and consumes a lower proportion of the nation's GDP (7.3%) than some highly privatised systems (e.g. USA: 16%) (OECD 2008). The system does charge fees in treating elective treatment for patients from abroad, but tourists who fall ill are treated free in Cuban hospitals. Cuba attracts patients mostly from [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]] by offering care of comparable quality to a developed nation but at much lower prices. Cuba's own health indicators are the best in Latin America and surpass those of the US in some respects (infant mortality rates, underweight babies, HIV infection, immunisation rates, doctor per population rates). (UNDP 2006: Tables 6,7,9,10) In 2005, Cuba spent 7.6% of GDP on health care, or US$310 per capita. Of that, approximately 91% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

=== El Salvador ===
Healthcare in El Salvador is free at the point of delivery. The public health system, which is regulated by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, has 30 public hospitals in the country plus various primary care facilities and 27 basic health care systems. According to the law of El Salvador, all individuals are given basic health services in public health institutions.

[[File:HOSPITAL LA RAZA DEL I. M. S. S..jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]] ''La Raza Medical Center'', a typical public hospital in Mexico]]
'''Health care in Mexico''' is provided via [[public]] institutions or private entities.  Health care delivered through private health care organizations operates entirely on the [[free-market]] system (e.g. it is available to those who can afford it). Public health care delivery, on the other hand, is accomplished via an elaborate provisioning and delivery system put in place by the Mexican Federal Government and the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS).

Advances in medicine and increasing health knowledge have increased the life expectancy in [[Mexico]] by an average of 25 years in the last years of the 20th century. Of the 6.6% [[GDP]] of government revenue spent on health, this provides only health insurance to 40% of the population who are privately employed. The health care system has three components: the social security institute, governmental services for the un-insured (Seguro Popular), and the private sector that is financed almost completely from out of pocket money. The [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]], the largest social institution in Latin America, is the governmental institution responsible of executing the Federal Government's health policy. The number of public hospitals in Mexico has increased 41% in ten years from 1985 to 1995.

According to the site www.internationalliving.com, health care in Mexico is described as very good to excellent while being highly affordable, with every medium to large city in Mexico having at least one first-rate hospital.  In fact, some California insurers sell [[health insurance]] policies that require members to go to Mexico for health care where costs are 40% lower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guaranteedhealthcare.org/files/facts_healthcare_calif.pdf Insurers require insured to go to Mexico] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103164431/http://guaranteedhealthcare.org/files/facts_healthcare_calif.pdf# |date=3 January 2012 }} Retrieved 10 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Mexico's top-rate hospitals are internationally accredited.&lt;ref&gt;

===Trinidad and Tobago===
{{Main article|Health care in Trinidad and Tobago}}

[[Trinidad and Tobago]] operates under a two-tier health care system. That is, there is the existence of both private health care facilities and public health care facilities.
The Ministry of Health is responsible for leading the health sector. The service provision aspect of public health care has been devolved to newly created entities, the Regional Health Authorities (RHAs). The Ministry of Health is shifting its focus to concentrate on policy development, planning, monitoring and evaluation, regulation, financing and research. Citizens can access government-paid health care at public health care facilities where health insurance is not required. The health care system in the country is universal as almost all citizens utilise the services provided. Some, though, opt for private health care facilities for their ailments.

Recently, the government of Trinidad and Tobago has launched CDAP (Chronic Disease Assistance Programme). The Chronic Disease Assistance Programme provides citizens with government-paid prescription drugs and other pharmaceutical items to combat several health conditions.

[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The United States currently operates under a [[mixed market]] health care system.  Government sources (federal, state, and local) account for 45% of U.S. health care expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;CMS Annual Statistics, [http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/proj2008.pdf United States Department of Health and Human Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205102333/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/proj2008.pdf |date=5 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private sources account for the remainder of costs, with 38% of people receiving health coverage through their employers and 17% arising from other private payment such as private insurance and out-of-pocket co-pays. [[Health care reform in the United States]] usually focuses around three suggested systems, with proposals currently underway to integrate these systems in various ways to provide a number of health care options. First is [[Single-payer health care|single-payer]], a term meant to describe a single agency managing a single system, as found in most modernized countries as well as some states and municipalities within the United States. Second are employer or individual insurance mandates. Finally, there is consumer-driven health, in which systems, consumers, and patients have more control of how they access care. Over the past thirty years, most of the nation's health care has moved from the second model operating with not-for-profit institutions to the third model operating with for-profit institutions.

In the US, the social and political issues surrounding access to health care have led to vigorous public debate and the almost colloquial use of terms such as health care (medical management of illness), [[health insurance]] (reimbursement of health care costs), and [[public health]] (the collective state and range of health in a population).  In the US, 12% to 16% of the citizens do not have health insurance.  State boards and the Department of Health regulate inpatient care to reduce the national health care deficit. To tackle the problems of the perpetually increasing number of uninsured, and costs associated with the US health care system, President [[Barack Obama]] says he favors the creation of a universal health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obama.senate.gov/speech/070125-the_time_has_co/|title=The Time Has Come for Universal Health Care |publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226054555/http://obama.senate.gov/speech/070125-the_time_has_co/|archivedate=26 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view is not shared across the country (see, for example, quotes from ''[[New York Times]]'' opinion columnist [[Paul Krugman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/opinion/04krugman.html|title=Clinton, Obama, Insurance|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=4 February 2008 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Factcheck.org]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jess Henig |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/141829 |title=Obama's Inflated Health Savings |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=15 June 2008 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A few states have taken serious steps toward universal health care coverage, most notably [[Minnesota]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[Connecticut]], with recent examples being the [[Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usliberals.about.com/od/healthcare/i/MassHealthIns.htm |title=About.com's Pros &amp; Cons of Massachusetts' Mandatory Health Insurance Program |publisher=Usliberals.about.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Connecticut's [[SustiNet]] plan to provide quality, affordable health care to state residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html |accessdate=21 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017010420/http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html |archivedate=17 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The state of Oregon and the city of San Francisco are both examples of governments that adopted universal healthcare systems for strictly fiscal reasons.

The United States is alone among developed nations in not having a [[universal health care]] system; the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] provides a nationwide [[health insurance exchange]] that came to fruition in 2014, but this is not universal in the way similar countries mean it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm The Case For Single Payer, Universal Health Care For The United States].&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare in the U.S. does, however, have significant publicly funded components. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] covers the elderly and disabled with a historical work record, [[Medicaid]] is available for some, but not all of the poor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/ Overview – What is Not Covered], U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] covers children of low-income families. The [[Veterans Health Administration]] directly provides health care to U.S. military veterans through a nationwide network of government hospitals; while active duty service members, retired service members and their dependents are eligible for benefits through [[TRICARE]]. Together, these tax-financed programs cover 27.8% of the population&lt;ref name="Census 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf233.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004234451/http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf233.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-10-04 | title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States:2007 |accessdate=2008-08-26 | format=PDF |work=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; and make the government the largest health insurer in the nation. The U.S. also spends 17.9% GDP per year on healthcare, more than double the nearest developed nations expenditure.

===Australia===
{{Main article|Health care in Australia}}

In [[Australia]] the current system, known as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], was instituted in 1984. It coexists with a private health system. All legal permanent residents are entitled to government-paid public hospital care. Treatment by private doctors is also paid by the government when the doctor direct bills the Health Department (Bulk Billing). Medicare is funded partly by a 1.5% income tax levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An additional levy of 1% is imposed on high-income earners without private health insurance. There is a means tested 30% subsidy on private health insurance. As well as Medicare, there is a separate [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] under which listing and a government subsidy is dependent on expert evaluation of the comparative cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals. In 2005, Australia spent 8.8% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] on health care, or US$3,181 per capita.  Of that, approximately 67% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/data/Search.jsp |title=WHO Statistical Information System |accessdate=2008-09-23 |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{Main article|Health care in New Zealand}}

In [[New Zealand]] hospitals are public and treat citizens or permanent residents, with the fees paid by the government, and are managed by [[District Health Boards (New Zealand)|District Health Boards]]. Under the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] coalition governments (1999–2008), there were plans to make [[primary health care]] available with charges paid for by the government. At present government subsidies exist in health care. The cost of visiting a GP ranges from government-paid to $45.00 for children and from government-paid to $75.00 for adults under the current subsidies. This system is funded by taxes. The New Zealand government agency [[Pharmaceutical Management Agency|Pharmac]] subsidizes certain pharmaceuticals depending upon their category. Co-payments exist, however these are lower if the user has a ''Community Services Card'' or ''High User Health Card''. In 2005, New Zealand spent 8.9% of GDP on health care, or US$2,403 per capita. Of that, approximately 77% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Argentina===
{{Main article|Health in Argentina}}

[[Argentina]]’s health care system is composed of three sectors: the [[public sector]], financed through [[tax]]es; the [[private sector]], financed through voluntary [[health insurance|insurance schemes]]; and the [[social security]] sector, financed through obligatory insurance schemes.  The Ministry of Health and Social Action (MSAS), oversees all three subsectors of the health care system and is responsible for setting of regulation, evaluation and collecting statistics.

Argentina has three sectors. The public sector is funded and managed by Obras Sociales, umbrella organizations for Argentine worker's unions.  There are over 300 Obras Sociales in Argentina, each chapter being organized according to the occupation of the beneficiary. These organizations vary greatly in quality and effectiveness. The top 30 chapters hold 73% of the beneficiaries and 75% of resources for all Obras Sociales schemes and the monthly average a beneficiary receives varies from $5–80 per month.&lt;ref name="idrc"&gt;IDRC ''Reshaping Health Care in Latin America''http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609013649/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html# |date=9 June 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  MSAS has established a Solidarity Redistribution Fund (FSR) to try to address these beneficiary inequities.  Only workers employed in the formal sector are covered under Obras Sociales insurance schemes and after [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|Argentina’s economic crisis of 2001]], the number of those covered under these schemes fell slightly (as unemployment increased and employment in the [[informal sector]] rose).  In 1999, there were 8.9 million beneficiaries covered by Obras Sociales.&lt;ref name="Barrientos"&gt;Armando Barrientos "Reforming Health Insurance in Argentina and Chile" ''Health Policy and Planning'' 15(4): 420&lt;/ref&gt; The private health care sector in Argentina is characterized by great heterogeneity and is made up of a great number of fragmented facilities and small networks; it consists of over 200 organizations and covers approximately 2 million Argentines.&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; 

Private insurance often overlaps with other forms of health care coverage, thus it is difficult to estimate the degree to which beneficiaries are dependent on the public and private sectors.  According to a 2000 report by the IRBC, foreign [[Competition (economics)|competition]] has increased in Argentina’s private sector, with [[Switzerland|Swiss]], American and other [[Latin America]]n [[health care provider]]s entering the [[Market (economics)|market]] in recent years.  This has been accompanied by little formal regulation.&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; The public system serves those not covered by Obras Sociales or private insurance schemes. It also provides [[emergency department|emergency services]].  According to above-mentioned IRBC report, Argentina’s public system exhibits serious structural deterioration and managerial inefficiency; a high degree of administrative centralization at the [[Provinces of Argentina|provincial level]]; rigidity in its staffing structure and labour relationships; no adequate system of incentives; inadequate information systems on which to base decision-making and control; serious deficits in facilities and equipment maintenance; and a system of management ill-suited to its size. The public system is highly decentralized to the provincial level; often [[primary care]] is even under the purview of local townships.  Since 2001, the number of Argentines relying on public services has seen an increase.  According to 2000 figures, 37.4% of Argentines had no health insurance, 48.8 were covered under Obras Sociales, 8.6% had private insurance, and 3.8% were covered by both Obras Sociales and private insurance schemes.&lt;ref name="Barrientos"/&gt;

===Brazil===
{{Main article|Health in Brazil}}

The Brazilian health system is composed of a large, public, government managed system, the SUS ([[Sistema Único de Saúde]]), which serves the majority of the population completely free of charge or any form of fee, and a private sector, managed by health insurance funds and private entrepreneurs.

The public health system, SUS, was established in 1988 by the Brazilian Constitution, and sits on 3 basic principles of universality, comprehensiveness and equity. Universality states that all citizens must have access to health care services, without any form of discrimination, regarding skin color, income, social status, gender or any other variable. There is no form of charging or payment in any public hospitals or clinics, either for Brazilian nationals or foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/brazil/healthcare/health-system|title=Healthcare System in Brazil|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government standards state that citizen's health is the result of multiple variables, including employment, income, access to land, sanitation services, access and quality of health services, education, psychic, social and family conditions, and are entitled to full and complete health care, comprising prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. Equity states that health policies should be oriented towards the reduction of inequalities between population groups and individuals, being the most needed the ones for whom policies should be first directed.

SUS also has guidelines for its implementation, the most peculiar being popular participation, which defines that all policies are to be planned and supervised directly by the population, through local, city, state and national health councils and conferences.

The level of public spending is particularly high in relation to GDP for a country of Brazil’s income level and in comparison with its emerging-market peers. Government outlays on health care alone account for nearly 9% of GDP, the second largest item of spending following social protection. In health care, a number of conventional output indicators are not out of step with OECD averages. Following the decentralization of service delivery in the early 1990s, increasing emphasis has appropriately been placed on enhancing preventive care. But, in a decentralized setting, cost-effectiveness depends a great deal on the ability of service deliverers to exploit economies of scale and scope. Experience with inter-municipal initiatives for procurement, as well as flexible arrangements for hospital administration and human-resource management, is by and large positive.

Private Health Insurance is widely available in Brazil and may be purchased on an individual-basis or obtained as a work benefit (major employers usually offer private health insurance benefits). Public health care is still accessible for those who choose to obtain private health insurance. As of March 2007, more than 37 million Brazilians had some sort of private health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ans.gov.br/portal/site/informacoesss/informacoesss.asp |title=Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar  |publisher=ANS TABNET|date=23 February 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810061941/http://www.ans.gov.br/portal/site/informacoesss/informacoesss.asp |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{main article|Healthcare in Chile}}

[[Chile]] has maintained a dual health care system in which its citizens can voluntarily opt for coverage by either the public National Health Insurance Fund or any of the country's private health insurance companies. 68% of the population is covered by the public fund and 18% by private companies. The remaining 14% is covered by other not-for-profit agencies or has no specific coverage. The system's duality has led to increasing inequalities prompting the Chilean government to introduce major reforms in health care provision. Chile's health care system is funded by a universal income tax deduction equal to 7% of every worker's wage. Many private health insurance companies encourage people to pay a variable extra on top of the 7% premium to upgrade their basic health plans. Because of this arrangement, the public and private health subsystems have existed almost completely separate from each other rather than coordinating to achieve common health objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/179/12/1289.pdf|title=untitled&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paraguay===
{{Main article|Health in Paraguay}}

In terms of major indicators, [[health in Paraguay]] ranks near the median among [[South America]]n countries. In 2003 [[Paraguay]] had a [[child mortality]] rate of 1.5 deaths per 1,000 children, ranking it behind [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]], and [[Uruguay]] but ahead of [[Brazil]] and [[Bolivia]]. The health of Paraguayans living outside urban areas is generally worse than those residing in cities. Many preventable diseases, such as [[Chagas' disease]], run rampant in rural regions. Parasitic and respiratory diseases, which could be controlled with proper medical treatment, drag down Paraguay's overall health. In general, [[malnutrition]], lack of proper health care, and poor [[sanitation]] are the root of many health problems in Paraguay.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Paraguay.pdf Paraguay country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (October 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Health care funding from the national government increased gradually throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Spending on health care rose to 1.7 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2000, nearly triple the 0.6 percent of GDP spent in 1989. But during the past decade, improvement in health care has slowed. Paraguay spends less per capita (US$13−20 per year) than most other Latin American countries. A 2001 survey indicated that 27 percent of the population still had no access to medical care, public or private. Private health insurance is very limited, with pre-paid plans making up only 11 percent of private expenditures on health care. Thus, most of the money spent on private health care (about 88 percent) is on a fee-for-service basis, effectively preventing the poor population from seeing private doctors. According to recent estimates, Paraguay has about 117 [[physician]]s and 20 [[nurse]]s per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Peru===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Peru}}

Peruvian citizens can opt between a state-owned healthcare system and various private insurance companies. The country has a life expectancy higher than the global average but it also has a high risk of infection, especially near the jungle and other isolated areas, due to the warm climate that favours the reproduction of various insects and bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pe.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mortality rate of the population has been decreasing steadily since 1990 and now stands at 19 deaths per 1000 live births.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Venezuela===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Venezuela}}

The right to health care is guaranteed in the Venezuelan Constitution. Government campaigns for the prevention, elimination, and control of major health hazards have been generally successful. Immunization campaigns have systematically improved children's health, and regular campaigns to destroy disease-bearing insects and to improve water and sanitary facilities have all boosted Venezuela's health indicators to some of the highest levels in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/venezuela/20.htm|title=Health and Social Security|accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of low- or no-cost health care provided by the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security has also made Venezuela's health care infrastructure one of the more advanced in the region. However, despite being the most comprehensive and well funded in the region, the health care system has deteriorated sharply since the 1980s. Government expenditures on health care constituted an estimated 4.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2002. Total health expenditures per capita in 2001 totaled US$386. Per capita government expenditures on health in 2001 totaled US$240.

In April 2017 Venezuela’s health ministry reported that maternal mortality jumped by 65% in 2016 and that the number of infant deaths rose by 30%.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/world-week/21721971-politics-week|title=Politics this week|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also said that the number of cases of malaria was up by 76%.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt; The ministry had not reported health data in two years. Venezuela is suffering from acute shortages of food and medicines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34190">{{refimprove|date=May 2017}}This page serves as a partial list of countries by adult mean body weight and incidence of obese and overweight populations as calculated by [[body mass index]] (BMI).  

The data for 2014 was first published by the [[World Health Organization]] in 2015.

==Methodology==
{{Main|Body mass index}}
[[Arithmetic mean|Mean]] [[body mass index]] (BMI) provides a simplified measure of the comparative weight of populations on a country by country basis.  BMI calculates a person's mass (weight) divided by the square of their height. An individual with a BMI of 25 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or more is considered overweight.  An individual with a BMI of 30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or more is considered obese.

The data highlighted on this page comes from [[World Health Organization]] statistics for adult (18 years old and older) populations. Mean BMI data is shown separately for males and females, as well as a combined figure. Mean data highlights the [[central tendency]] of the population data and is but one method of calculating relative body weight between populations.

==Limitations on the usefulness of comparative BMI data==
{{Main|Body mass index#Limitations}}
There are significant limitations to the usefulness of comparative BMI data cited by both the medical community and statisticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olson|first1=Samantha|title=BMI Is No Longer A Good Indication Of Healthy Weight; Here Are 6 Better Ways To Measure Your Health|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/body-mass-index-bmi-calculator-healthy-weight-obesity-372852|website=Medical Daily|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMI data has significant weaknesses in terms of scalability and in accounting for variations in physical characteristics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3752">This is a '''[[list of countries]] by % of health expenditure covered by government''' as published by the [[OECD]] in 2016.

Public health expenditure consists of recurrent and capital spending from government (central and local) budgets, external borrowings and grants (including donations from international agencies and nongovernmental organizations), and social (or compulsory) health insurance funds. Total health expenditure is the sum of public and private health expenditure. It covers the provision of health services (preventive and curative), family planning activities, nutrition activities, and emergency aid designated for health but does not include provision of water and sanitation.

This is a '''list of countries by risk of premature death from non-communicable disease''' such as [[cardiovascular disease]], [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], or [[chronic respiratory disease]] between ages 30 and 70 as published by the [[World Health Organization]] in 2008. Measuring the risk of dying from target NCDs is important to assess the extent of burden from mortality due NCDs in a population.

Life tables specifying all-cause mortality rates by age and sex for WHO Member States are developed from available death registration data, sample registration systems (India, China) and data on child and adult mortality from censuses and surveys.
 
Cause-of-death distributions are estimated from death registration data, and data from population-based epidemiological studies, disease registers and notifications systems for selected specific causes of death. Causes of death for populations without usable death-registration data are estimated using cause-of-death models together with data from population-based epidemiological studies, disease registers and notifications systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.who.int/gho/indicatorregistry/App_Main/view_indicator.aspx?iid=3354&lt;/ref&gt;

This article includes 3 '''lists of [[list of sovereign states|countries of the world]] and their total expenditure on health [[per capita]]'''. Total expenditure includes both public and private expenditures.

The first table and bar chart lists [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Member countries|member countries]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). With each country's total expenditure on health [[per capita]] in [[purchasing power parity|PPP]] [[U.S. dollars]].

The next 2 tables use data from the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). One table uses U.S. dollars per capita. The other table uses 2011 [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international US dollars]] (inflation-adjusted to 2011 dollars).

The chart to the right measures the total cost of health care (public and private expenditures) as a percent of [[GDP]] (gross domestic product) for a few nations. GDP is a measure of the total economy of a nation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6339">The '''National Data Guardian for Health and Care in England''' is an independent, non-regulatory, advice giving body sponsored by the [[Department of Health and Social Care]]. Dame [[Fiona Caldicott]] has held the position since its inauguration in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/dame-fiona-caldicott-named-as-national-data-guardian|title=Dame Fiona Caldicott named as National Data Guardian|website=Nationalhealthexecutive.com|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalhealth.net/2014/11/caldicott-becomes-data-guardian/|title=Caldicott becomes data guardian {{!}} Digital Health|date=2014-11-14|work=Digital Health|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role ==
The National Data Guardian provides guidance to the UK Government and the health and adult social care system on data confidentiality, security and patient data choice. Its role is to "help make sure the public can trust their confidential information is securely safeguarded and make sure that it is used to support citizens’ care and to achieve better outcomes from health and care services"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-data-guardian/about|title=About us|work=GOV.UK|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a non-regulatory body, the National Data Guardian does not issue or enforce sanctions; it works with existing regulators such as the [[Information Commissioner's Office|Information Commissioner’s Office]] and the [[Care Quality Commission]] where this is required.

== The Health and Social Care (National Data Guardian) Bill 2017-19 ==
A [[Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Private Members' Bill]] to place the National Data Guardian role on a statutory footing was introduced to the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 2017. The Health and Social Care (National Data Guardian) Bill 2017-19 is sponsored by Member of Parliament [[Peter Bone]].

A consultation on the roles and functions of the National Data Guardian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/the-role-of-the-national-data-guardian-for-health-and-social-care|title=The role of the National Data Guardian for health and social care|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in 2015 in preparation for the bill's drafting. When enacted, it will give the role formal, advice-giving powers on matters related to the processing of health and adult social care data in England&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-06-06/debates/5decb14a-7c91-45fc-9c54-6dba2a90e841/HealthAndSocialCare(NationalDataGuardian)Bill|title=Health and Social Care (National  Data Guardian) Bill - Hansard|website=Hansard.parliament.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal reviews ==
=== Review of Data Security, Consent and Opt-outs (published July 2016) ===
In September 2015, the Secretary of State for Health [[Jeremy Hunt]] asked the National Data Guardian and the [[Care Quality Commission]] conduct a formal review into data security and use, delivering as its outcomes: recommendations for new data security standards for health and care; a method for testing compliance against the standards; and a new consent or opt-out model for data sharing in relation to patient confidential data.

The National Data Guardian's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-data-security-consent-and-opt-outs|title=Review of data security, consent and opt-outs|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Review of Data Security, Consent and Opt-outs'' was published in July 2016. It made 20 recommendations, including the introduction of 10 national data security standards for health and care and a new tool for measuring performance against them.

The Care Quality Commission published its report ''Safe Data Safe Care'' in tandem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cqc.org.uk/publications/themed-work/safe-data-safe-care|title=Safe data, safe care - Care Quality Commission|website=Cqc.org.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government's 2017 response, '''Your Data: Better Security, Better Choice, Better Care''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/new-data-security-standards-for-health-and-social-care|title=New health data security standards and consent/opt-out model|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, accepted the recommendations and reported on plans to deliver against them, including the development of a new national data opt-out system for patients, which was launched by [[NHS Digital]] in May 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252441825/NHS-to-launch-national-data-opt-out-tool|title=NHS to launch national data opt-out tool|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalhealth.net/2018/05/national-data-opt-out-programme/|title=National data opt-out programme comes into force|date=2018-05-25|work=Digital Health|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review also led to the closure of the [[care.data]] programme by [[NHS England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/nhs-england-to-close-caredata-programme-following-caldicott-review|title=NHS England to close care.data programme following Caldicott Review|website=Nationalhealthexecutive.com|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prior reviews by Dame Fiona Caldicott ===
The ''Review of Data Security, Consent and Opt-outs'' was the first formal report delivered by Dame Fiona Caldicott in her role as National Data Guardian. It is referred to as Caldicott 3, as it is her third formal report to Government on the protection and use of patient information. The first, her ''[[Caldicott Report|Report on the Review of Patient-identifiable Information]]'' is known as the [[Caldicott Report]] and was published in 1997. The second report &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-information-governance-review|title=Caldicott review: information governance in the health and care system|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as Caldicott 2 was published in 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14925">[[File:TaipeiMetro-Cleaner.JPG|thumb|Physical activity is not just [[exercise]]. It includes other activities that involve movement for example cleaning, working, active transport etc. ]]
Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health, 2009. World Health Organization. Geneva, Switzerland. Accessed 13/07/2018. Available at: http://www.who.int/ncds/prevention/physical-activity/en/&lt;/ref&gt;.  Physical activity encompasses all activities, at any intensity,  performed during the 24 hour day&lt;ref&gt;Pedišić, Ž. (2014). MEASUREMENT ISSUES AND POOR ADJUSTMENTS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SLEEP UNDERMINE SEDENTARY BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH—THE FOCUS SHOULD SHIFT TO THE BALANCE BETWEEN SLEEP, SEDENTARY BEHAVIOUR, STANDING AND ACTIVITY. ''Kinesiology, 46'' (1), 135-146. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://hrcak.srce.hr/123743&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. It includes [[exercise]] and incidental activity integrated into daily activity. This integrated activity may not be planned, structured, repetitive or purposeful for the improvement of fitness, and may include activities such as walking to the local shop, cleaning, working, active transport etc. 

=== Terminology Misconception ===
“[[Exercise]]” and “physical activity” are frequently are used interchangeably and generally refer to physical activity performed during leisure time with the primary purpose of improving or maintaining physical fitness, physical performance, or health. Physical activity is not exactly the ''same'' concept as [[exercise]]. Exercise is defined as a subcategory of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and purposeful in the sense that the improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness is the objective&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Conversely, physical activity includes exercise but may also be unplanned, unstructured, random and non-purposeful carried out for a multitude of reasons.  
[[File:Intensity and Energy Expenditure.png|thumb|460x460px|Intensity of physical activities on a continuum from sedentary behavior to vigorous physical activity. ]]

=== Intensity ===
Physical activity can be at any intensity, from a simple twitch of a muscle, to an all out sprint. For practicality, physical activity can be viewed as a continuum from sedentary behavior to vigorous intensity activity.  Intensities are broadly categorized according to [[energy expenditure]] using a standard measure of intensity, [[Metabolic equivalent|metabolic equivalents]] (METs). The broad categories are sedentary behavior, light activity, moderate activity and vigorous activity.  

==== Example activities at each intensity ====
The example activities presented below are just that, examples. Depending on the individual and the activity involved, activities may overlap intensity categories or change categories completely.

|slow walking, shuffling around the house
|-
|Moderate Physical Activity (MPA)
|Brisk walking, jogging, light swimming, stair climbing
|-
|Vigorous Physical Activity (VPA)
|Fast running, fast cycling, sprinting
|}

=== Physical Inactivity and Sedentary Behaviour ===
Physical inactivity is the absence of physical activity, which is conceptually different to sedentary behavior (not [[sedentary lifestyle]]). Sedentary behavior is defined as any waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure ≤1.5 [[Metabolic equivalent|metabolic equivalents (METs)]], while in a sitting, reclining or lying posture. In general this means that any time a person is passively sitting or lying down, they are engaging in sedentary behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sedentarybehaviour.org/what-is-sedentary-behaviour/|title=What is Sedentary Behaviour?|last=|first=|date=|website=Sedentary Behaviour Research Network (SBRN)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Recommendations for Physical Activity (Including Sleep and Sedentary Behavior) ==

=== Global Recommendations ===
The World Health Organization recommend the following&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==== Adults aged 18-64 ====
1. Adults aged 18–64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. 

2. Aerobic activity should be performed in bouts of at least 10 minutes duration. 

3. For additional health benefits, adults should increase their moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes per week, or engage in 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. 

4. Muscle-strengthening activities should be done involving major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week.

==== Adults aged 65+ ====
1. Adults aged 65 years and above should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorousintensity activity. 

2. Aerobic activity should be performed in bouts of at least 10 minutes duration. 

3. For additional health benefits, adults aged 65 years and above should increase their moderateintensity aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes per week, or engage in 150 minutes of vigorousintensity aerobic physical activity per week, or an equivalent combination of moderate-and vigorous-intensity activity. 

4. Adults of this age group, with poor mobility, should perform physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week. 

5. Muscle-strengthening activities should be done involving major muscle groups, on 2 or more days a week. 

6. When adults of this age group cannot do the recommended amounts of physical activity due to health conditions, they should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow.

==== Children and Adolescents aged 5-17 ====
1. Children and youth aged 5–17 should accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous intensity physical activity daily. 

2. Amounts of physical activity greater than 60 minutes provide additional health benefits. 

3. Most of the daily physical activity should be aerobic. Vigorous-intensity activities should be incorporated, including those that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 times per week.

=== Country-level Recommendations ===

'''''Early Years (Birth to 5 years)'''''

'''Physical Activity Recommendations'''

For healthy growth and development in:

* '''Infants (Birth to one year)''' physical activity particularly through supervised interactive floor-based play in safe environments should be encouraged from birth. For those not yet mobile, 30 minutes of tummy time including reaching and grasping, pushing and pulling, and crawling spread throughout the day during awake periods is encouraged.
* '''Toddlers (1 to 2 years)''' should spend at least 180 minutes a day doing a variety of physical activities including energetic play such as running, jumping and twirling spread throughout the day- noting more is better.
* '''Pre-schoolers (3 to 5 years)''' should spend at least 180 minutes a day in a variety of physical activities, of which 60 minutes is energetic play such as running, jumping and kicking and throwing, spread throughout the day - noting more is better.

'''Sedentary Behaviour Recommendations'''

* '''Infants (Birth to one year)''' should not be restrained for more than 1 hour at a time (e.g. in a stroller, car seat or high chair). Infants should also not spend any time watching television or using other electronic media (DVDs, computer and other electronic games) and instead, when sedentary, the caregiver is encouraged to engage with them through activities such as reading, singing, puzzles and storytelling.
* '''Toddlers (aged 1-2 years)''' should not be restrained for more than 1 hour at a time (e.g. in a stroller, car seat or high chair) or sit for extended periods. For those toddlers younger than 2 years, screen time is not recommended during sedentary periods. For those aged 2 years, screen time should be no more than 1 hour in total throughout the 24-hour period- less is better. When toddlers are sedentary, the caregiver is encouraged to engage with them through activities such as reading, singing, puzzles and storytelling.
* '''Pre-schoolers (aged 3-5 years)''' should not be restrained, for more than 1 hour at a time e.g. in a stroller or car seat) or sitting for extended periods. Sedentary screen time should be no more than 1 hour in total throughout the 24-hour period -less is better. When pre-schoolers are sedentary, caregivers are encouraged to engage with them through activities such as reading, singing, puzzles and storytelling.

'''Sleep'''

* '''Infants (Birth to one year)''' are recommended to have 14 to 17 hours (for those aged 0-3 months) and 12 to 16 hours (for those aged 4-11 months) of good quality sleep, including naps during the 24 hour period.
* '''Toddlers (aged 1-2 years)''' are recommended to have from 11 to 14 hours of good quality sleep, including naps during the 24-hour period with consistent sleep and wake-up times.
* '''Pre-schoolers (aged 3-5 years)''' are recommended to have 10 to 13 hours of good quality sleep, which may include a nap, with consistent sleep and wake-up times.

'''''Children (5-12 years)'''''

'''Physical Activity'''

* For health benefits, children aged 5–12 years should accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity every day.
* Children’s physical activity should include a variety of aerobic activities, including some vigorous intensity activity.
* On at least three days per week, children should engage in activities that strengthen muscle and bone.
* To achieve additional health benefits, children should engage in more activity – up to several hours per day.

'''Sedentary Behaviour'''

* To reduce health risks, children aged 5-12 years should minimise the time they spend being sedentary every day. To achieve this:
** Limit use of electronic media for entertainment (e.g. television, seated electronic games and computer use) to no more than two hours a day – lower levels are associated with reduced health risks.
** Break up long periods of sitting as often as possible.

'''''Young People (13-17 years)'''''

'''Physical Activity Guidelines'''

* For health benefits, young people aged 13–17 years should accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity every day.
* Young peoples’ physical activity should include a variety of aerobic activities, including some vigorous intensity activity.
* On at least three days per week, young people should engage in activities that strengthen muscle and bone.
* To achieve additional health benefits, young people should engage in more activity – up to several hours per day.

'''Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines'''

* To reduce health risks, young people aged 13–17 years should minimise the time they spend being sedentary every day. To achieve this:
** Limit use of electronic media for entertainment (e.g. television, seated electronic games and computer use) to no more than two hours a day – lower levels are associated with reduced health risks.
** Break up long periods of sitting as often as possible.

'''''Adults (18-64 years)'''''

'''Physical Activity Guidelines'''

* Doing any physical activity is better than doing none. If you currently do no physical activity, start by doing some, and gradually build up to the recommended amount.
* Be active on most, preferably all, days every week.
* Accumulate 150 to 300 minutes (2 ½ to 5 hours) of moderate intensity physical activity or 75 to 150 minutes (1 ¼ to 2 ½ hours) of vigorous intensity physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both moderate and vigorous activities, each week.
* Do muscle strengthening activities on at least 2 days each week.

'''Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines'''

* Minimise the amount of time spent in prolonged sitting.
* Break up long periods of sitting as often as possible.

'''''Older Adults (65+ years)'''''

'''Physical Activity Recommendations'''

1. Older people should do some form of physical activity, no matter what their age, weight, health problems or abilities. 

2. Older people should be active every day in as many ways as possible, doing a range of physical activities that incorporate fitness, strength, balance and flexibility. 

3. Older people should accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days. 

4. Older people who have stopped physical activity, or who are starting a new physical activity, should start at a level that is easily manageable and gradually build up the recommended amount, type and frequency of activity. 

5. Older people who continue to enjoy a lifetime of vigorous physical activity should carry on doing so in a manner suited to their capability into later life, provided recommended safety procedures and guidelines are adhered to.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5623">The '''Total Diet Study''' is the US [[FDA]]´s ongoing annual assessment of U.S. consumers' average [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] intake of about 800 contaminants and [[nutrient]]s since 1961.

==Description==
The Total Diet Study is the US [[FDA]]´s ongoing annual assessment of U.S. consumers' average [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] intake of about 800 contaminants and nutrients. To this effort its [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]] at College Park, Maryland has been buying, preparing, and analyzing about "280 kinds of foods and beverages from representative areas of the country, four times a year".
To make estimates as realistic as possible, foods are bought from the same places "as consumers do", in each of four regions of the country (North Central, West, South, and Northeast). The purchases or [[market basket]]s are identical as much as possible. It is bought in supermarkets, grocery stores, and fast-food restaurants in three cities per region, which change every year.&lt;ref name=tds&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/default.htm Total Diet Study] US FDA,Page Last Updated: 04/08/2016, accessed 10 Nov 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA Kansas City District Laboratory  in [[Lenexa, Kansas]] is the central lab for the country and prepares and analyzes each kind of food, combining samples from the 3 cities of a region to make one composite sample.&lt;ref name=studydesign/&gt; 
Foods are prepared "as consumers typically would",&lt;ref name=tds/&gt; which includes washing, peeling, cooking.&lt;ref name=compliance/&gt;{{rp|3}} Radionuclide analyses are only done from two market baskets per year at FDA's Engineering and Analytical Center in [[Winchester, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=studydesign/&gt;

With the analysis, FDA estimates the average consumption by the entire U.S. population, and split up by age and gender (from age 14 years onward) each year. The food list is adjusted about every 10 years to account for [[food trends]], changing patterns of what people eat. Likewise data on how much of those foods consumers eat may be adjusted.&lt;ref name=tds/&gt;
 
FDA states the purpose as tracking [[food trends]] and trends in the consumption of contaminants and nutrients in the average American diet, and developing interventions to reduce risks, as needed in its food safety and nutrition programs.&lt;ref name=tds/&gt;

==Foods and analytes==
Food categories include baby foods, beverages, dairy products, eggs, food mixtures, fruits and fruit juice, grain products, legumes &amp; nuts &amp; seeds, meat &amp; poultry &amp; fish, fats and oils, sweets, vegetables.&lt;ref name=food&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/ucm184970.htm Total Diet Study.Foods and analytes] US FDA, Page Last Updated: 04/08/2016, accessed 10 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
A Food/Analyte Matrix displays all the specific foods and analytes.&lt;ref name=matrix&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/UCM458731.pdf Total Diet Study. Food/Analyte Matrix] US FDA, Page Last Updated: 04/08/2016, accessed 10 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
Determination methods for analysis including [[Strontium-90]], a [[beta emitter]] and for [[Gamma emitter]]s are published .&lt;ref name=anal&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/ucm184646.htm Total Diet Study. Analytical Methods] US FDA, Page Last Updated: 04/08/2016, accessed 10 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of |November 2017}} the latest individual-year results for elements are from 2015 for pesticides are from 2012.&lt;ref name=anal/&gt;

==History==
In 1961, the US FDA began a program to monitor radioactive contamination of foods.
Over time, it expanded to include pesticides,{{when|date=November 2017}} industrial and other toxic chemicals, and nutrients.
Data are published annually, and electronic data since 1991 are available.&lt;ref name=tds/&gt; 

In 1991, the market baskets were updated, and the food list was chosen from the [[USDA]] 1987-88 "Nationwide Food Consumption Survey".&lt;ref name=studydesign&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/ucm184232.htm Total Diet Study. Study Design] US FDA, Page Last Updated: 04/08/2016, accessed 10 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 food-list update used a food list from the USDA's 1994-96, 1998 "Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals" (CSFII) published in 2000.&lt;ref name=studydesign/&gt;

In 2014, FDA updated methods of measuring elements in foods to detect and differentiate them at lower levels.&lt;ref name=anal/&gt;
 
==Controversy==
In 2016 the FDA has been criticized for not following their own compliance program guidance manual&lt;ref name=compliance&gt;US FDA [https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170406021314/https:/www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/ComplianceEnforcement/UCM073281.pdf compliance program guidance manual] 32 pp, 9/30/17, accessed 11 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt; to follow-up on unusual analytical findings. [[Perchlorate]] levels in the 2016 update had been far greater than in 2004-2006. Upon a [[FOIA request]], the Center for Food Science and Applied Nutrition could not find any records or communications of the coordinator investigating the possible cause of high levels of perchlorate in bologna, collard greens and salami lunchmeat nor receipts to identify brand and lot &lt;ref&gt;Tom Neltner [http://blogs.edf.org/health/2017/11/02/little-follow-up-when-fda-finds-high-levels-of-perchlorate-in-food/ Little follow-up when FDA finds high levels of perchlorate in food] Environmental Defense Fund, November 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The rankings are based on an index of five factors:&lt;ref name=whowhr2000/&gt;
* '''Health (50%) :''' disability-adjusted [[life expectancy]]
** ''Overall or average'' : 15%
** ''Distribution or equality'' : 35%
* '''Responsiveness (25%) :''' speed of service, protection of privacy, and quality of amenities
** ''Overall or average'' : 12.5%
** ''Distribution or equality'' : 12.5%
* '''Fair financial contribution''' : 25%

==Criticism==

The WHO rankings have been subject to many and varied criticisms since its publication.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Concerns raised over the five factors considered, data sets used and comparison methodologies have led health bodies and political commentators in most of the countries on the list to question the efficacy of its results and validity of any conclusions drawn. Such criticisms of a broad endeavour by the WHO to rank all the world's healthcare systems must also however be understood in the context of a predisposition to analytical bias commensurate with an individual nation's demographics, socio-economics and politics. In considering such a disparate global spectrum, ranking criteria, methodology, results and conclusions will always be an area for contention.

In over a decade of discussion and controversy over the WHO Ranking of 2000, there is still no consensus about how an objective world health system ranking should be compiled. Indeed, the 2000 results have proved so controversial that the WHO declined to rank countries in their [[World Health Report|World Health Reports since 2000]], but the debate still rages on. With burgeoning and ageing populations, spiralling costs and the recognition by most national governments that constant vigilance and periodic healthcare reform are necessary, the appetite for a means of measuring national performance in broader world contexts is ever increasing and all the more relevant. With this in mind, and in lieu of any further ranking information from the WHO since 2000, there are many analytical bodies now looking at national healthcare delivery in global contexts and publishing their findings. [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] finds "the U.S. spends the most on health care on a relative cost basis with the worst outcome"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-efficient-health-care-countries Most Efficient Health Care: Countries - bloomberg.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and notes [[Cuba]]ns live longer than Americans, but Americans pay more than fourteen times as much for less effective health care. The [[Commonwealth Fund]] ranked seven developed countries on health care, the US ranked lowest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/News/News-Releases/2010/Jun/US-Ranks-Last-Among-Seven-Countries.aspx U.S. Ranks Last Among Seven Countries on Health System Performance Based on Measures of Quality, Efficiency, Access, Equity, and Healthy Lives - June 23, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;([[Australia|AU]], [[Canada|CA]], [[Germany|DE]], [[Netherlands|NL]], [[New Zealand|NZ]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[United States|US]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/News/News-Releases/2010/Jun/~/media/Images/Publications/Fund%20Report/2010/jun/MM2010l.gif Overall Rankings - commonwealthfund.org]&lt;/ref&gt;).
