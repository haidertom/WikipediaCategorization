'''Axiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἀξία|ἀξία]]}}, ''axia'', "value, worth"; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[value (ethics)|value]]. It is either the collective term for [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to [[value theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]. The term was first used by Paul Lapie, in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapie|first=Paul|title=Logique de la volonté|year=1902|publisher=F. Alcan|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infotaste.com/axiology-and-aesthetics/|title=Axiology and aesthetics - article|website=www.infotaste.com|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eduard von Hartmann]], in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Hartmann|first=Eduard|title=Grundriss der Axiologie|year=1908|publisher=Hermann Haacke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel L. Hart. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2105883 Axiology—Theory of Values]. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of "beauty" and "harmony." '''Formal axiology,''' the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]], is exemplified by [[Robert S. Hartman]]'s [[science of value]].

==History==
Between the 5th and 6th century BC, it was important in Greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. Philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. [[Socrates]] believed that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. [[Socrates]]' student, [[Plato]] furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. With the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped Christianity. During the medieval period, [[Thomas Aquinas]] made the distinction between natural and supernatural (theological) virtues. This concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated70"&gt;Arneson, P.

[[File:Bertrand Russell leads anti-nuclear march in London, Feb 1961.jpg|thumb|[[Bertrand Russell]] with his wife, [[Edith Finch Russell]], leading an anti-nuclear demonstration in February 1961]]
The '''Bertrand Russell Society''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[learned society]] whose purpose is to foster a better understanding of [[Bertrand Russell]] and his work. The Society was founded in 1974 by, among others, [[Lady Katharine Tait]], Russell's only daughter.

The Society publishes the ''[https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/bulletin/ Bertrand Russell Society Bulletin]'', and all members receive ''[https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/russelljournal/ Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies]''. The Society holds an annual meeting, and offers numerous prizes for literature and other work. The Society also sponsors talks in conjunction with the [[American Philosophical Association]] ([https://www.apaonline.org/default.aspx APA]) and the Society for the Study of the History of Analytical Philosophy ([http://sshap.org/ SSHAP]).

==Aims and Motto==
[[File:Bust Of Bertrand Russell-Red Lion Square-London.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Bertrand Russell]] in [[Red Lion Square]]]]
The Bertrand Russell Society has three aims ([http://bertrandrussell.org/brs-bylaws/ Bylaws, Article 2]): 

# to promote interest in the life and work of Bertrand Russell; 
# to bring together persons interested in any aspect of the foregoing; 
# to promote causes that Russell championed.

The BRS motto is: "The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge."
-Bertrand Russell (1925) "What I Believe"; cited from p.&amp;nbsp;349 in [http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/The-Basic-Writings-of-Bertrand-Russell.pdf ''The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell''] (Routledge Classics, New York: 2009).

==About==
[[File:Russell in 1924 01.jpg|thumb|[[Bertrand Russell]] in 1924, pipe in hand]]
Founded in 1974, the Bertrand Russell Society seeks to foster a better understanding of the life, work, and writings of Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) and how his contributions relate to today’s world. The Society has a regular annual meeting featuring scholarly and popular presentations about Russell and related subjects, a business meeting, a banquet, and good fellowship. Usually in June, most often in a university setting, annual meetings have taken place at wide variety of [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/past-meetings/ locations].

The Society publishes the ''Bertrand Russell Society [http://bertrandrussellsociety.org/join/bulletin/ Bulletin]'', which is free to all members. Interested persons are invited to submit papers to the editor, William Bruneau. Members also receive the scholarly journal [https://escarpmentpress.org/russelljournal ''Russell''].

The [http://bertrandrussell.org/html/Stanley_Library/library.html Bertrand Russell Society Library] has a collection of Russell-related books and papers that members can borrow and a large selection of television and radio interviews of Russell online in the members area of the Library. Members of the Bertrand Russell Society may [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/contact/ contact us] for access.

The Society awards annual [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/student-paper-prize/ student-paper-prizes] for the best new papers about Russell by undergraduate and graduate students. Prize-winners present their papers at our annual meeting, receive $200, free registration, lodging and banquet at the meeting, and a 1-year membership in the BRS.

The Society also awards an annual [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/book-award/ BRS Book Award] for the best new book on Russell, an annual [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/brs-award/ BRS Award] to an individual or an organization whose work best furthers the interests and commitments of Bertrand Russell, and the [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/lee-eisler-service-award/ Lee Eisler Service Award] for service to the Russell Society.

The Society sponsors sessions of talks on Russell and early analytic philosophy more generally at meetings of the [[American Philosophical Association]] ([https://www.apaonline.org/default.aspx APA]), often in conjunction with the Society for the Study of the History of Analytical Philosophy ([http://sshap.org/ SSHAP]).

The Society helps support Russell scholarship, for example, the scholarly journal ''Russell: The Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'', which all BRS members receive as part of their membership, and maintains these web pages to provide information on Russell and related subjects and to further our shared interests and values.

'''Concepts''' are mental representations, abstract objects or abilities that make up the fundamental building blocks of [[thought]]s and [[belief]]s. They play an important role in all aspects of [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of Laurence and Margolis' book called Concepts: Core Readings. {{ISBN|9780262631938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, S. (1991). Knowledge Acquisition: Enrichment or Conceptual Change? In S. Carey and R. Gelman (Eds.), ''The Epigenesis of Mind: Essays on Biology and Cognition'' (pp. 257-291). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab at Stanford University|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=Eric Margolis|author2=Stephen Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Concepts as [[mental representation]]s, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)
* Concepts as [[skill|abilities]], where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
* Concepts as [[Fregean]] senses (see [[sense and reference]]), where concepts are [[abstract objects]], as opposed to mental objects and mental states

Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair".

[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables [[Hierarchy (thinking)|higher-level thinking]].]]

A concept is [[wikt:instantiate#Verb|instantiated (reified)]] by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other [[idea]]s.

Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the [[cognitive science]] disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[databases]] and [[artificial intelligence]] where they are sometimes called [[class (set theory)|classes]], [[database schema|schema]] or [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. In [[wikt:informal#Adjective|informal]] use the word ''concept'' often just means any [[idea]].

== Concepts in the representational theory of mind ==

Within the framework of the [[representational theory of mind]], the structural position of concepts can be understood as follows: Concepts serve as the building blocks of what are called ''mental representations'' (colloquially understood as ''ideas in the mind''). Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called ''propositional attitudes'' (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it "believing", "doubting", "wondering", "accepting", etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology. In this way, we have an analysis that ties our common everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical understanding of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Fodor]], ''Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of concepts ==
{{main article|Abstract object}}

A central question in the study of concepts is the question of what concepts ''are''. Philosophers construe this question as one about the [[ontology]] of concepts – what they are really like. The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept's ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonism|Platonist]] views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts and Cognitive Science|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=in Concepts: Core Readings|isbn=978-0-262-13353-1|pages=3–83|author=Stephen Lawrence|author2=Eric Margolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to the relationship between concepts and [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept "dog" is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept – or the reference class or [[Extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called "lexical concepts".&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt;

Study of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

In the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word "moon" (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only ''represents'' that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.

=== A priori concepts ===
{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori|Category (Kant)}}

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] declared that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]]. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction "a posteriori concepts" (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''a posteriori'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., §1, Note 1)

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.
{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:

# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;
# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally
# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...

In order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, §6}}

===Embodied content===
{{Main article|Embodied cognition}}

In [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Ontology===
{{Main article|Ontology}}

[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt Gödel]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.&lt;ref&gt;'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status (Morgolis:7).

According to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

== Mental representations ==
{{Main article|Mental representation}}

In a [[physicalism|physicalist]] [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally, a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gregory|title=The Big Book of Concepts|year=2002|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-13409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], [[decision making]], [[learning]], and [[inference]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Concepts are thought to be stored in long term [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] memory,&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[episodic memory]] of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in [[hippocampus]].  Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as [[patient HM]].  The abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more abstract concepts.  ("Sort" is itself another word for concept, and "sorting" thus means to organise into concepts.)

== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==

=== Classical theory ===
{{Main article|Definitionism}}

The classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts,&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;), and was prominently held until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both ''[[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]]'' and ''[[necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]'' for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A feature is considered sufficient if something has all the parts required by the definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; For example, the classic example ''[[bachelor]]'' is said to be defined by ''unmarried'' and ''[[man]]''.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the ''[[law of the excluded middle]]'', which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

The classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in [[philosophy]] – [[formal concept analysis|concept analysis]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For example, Shoemaker's classic "[[Time Without Change]]" explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.

==== Arguments against the classical theory ====
Given that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; summarized as follows:
*It seems that there simply are no definitions – especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don't know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
* [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s argument against analyticity in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]] also holds as an argument against definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*[[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; See below.
*Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

=== Prototype theory ===
{{Main article|Prototype theory}}

Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], Mervis, [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Anglin, and [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Posner]] are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roger|title=A New Paradigm of Reference|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc|isbn=0-12-497750-2|pages=159–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as ''family resemblances''. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm" /&gt; It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member – the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.

=== Theory-theory ===
Theory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; In this sense, concepts' structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is).&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish. In this sense, the Theory–Theory of concepts is responding to some of the issues of prototype theory and classic theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

== Ideasthesia ==
According to the theory of [[ideasthesia]] (or "sensing concepts"), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or [[qualia]]) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. {{doi|10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question is also known as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harnad (1995). Why and How We Are Not Zombies. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 1: 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Chalmers (1995). Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2 (3): 200–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on ideasthesia emerged from research on [[synesthesia]] where it was noted that a synesthetic experience requires first an activation of a concept of the inducer.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research expanded these results into everyday perception.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.'' 20(1–2): pp. 84–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts. Another theory is semantic pointers, which use perceptual and motor representations and these representations are like symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Blouw, P., Solodkin, E., Thagard, P., &amp; Eliasmith, C. (2016). Concepts as semantic pointers: A framework and computational model. Cognitive Science, 40(5), 1128–1162. {{doi|10.1111/cogs.12265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "concept" is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin ''[[Wikt:conceptus|conceptum]]'' – "something conceived").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706200201/http://bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }} The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest documentation of critical thinking are the teachings of [[Socrates]] recorded by Plato. Socrates established the fact that one cannot depend upon those in "authority" to have sound knowledge and insight. He demonstrated that persons may have power and high position and yet be deeply confused and irrational. He established the importance of asking deep questions that probe profoundly into thinking before we accept ideas as worthy of belief.

He established the importance of seeking evidence, closely examining reasoning and assumptions, analyzing basic concepts, and tracing out implications not only of what is said but of what is done as well. His method of questioning is now known as "Socratic Questioning" and is the best known critical thinking teaching strategy. In his mode of questioning, Socrates highlighted the need for thinking for clarity and logical consistency. Socrates asked people questions to reveal their irrational thinking or lack of reliable knowledge. Socrates demonstrated that having authority does not ensure accurate knowledge. He established the method of questioning beliefs, closely inspecting assumptions and relying on evidence and sound rationale. Plato recorded Socrates' teachings and carried on the tradition of critical thinking. Aristotle and subsequent Greek skeptics refined Socrates' teachings, using systematic thinking and asking questions to ascertain the true nature of reality beyond the way things appear from a glance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/a-brief-history-of-the-idea-of-critical-thinking/408|title=A Brief History of the Idea of Critical Thinking|website=www.criticalthinking.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates set the agenda for the tradition of critical thinking, namely, to reflectively question common beliefs and explanations, carefully distinguishing beliefs that are reasonable and logical from those that—however appealing to our native egocentrism, however much they serve our vested interests, however comfortable or comforting they may be—lack adequate evidence or rational foundation to warrant belief.

Critical thinking was described by Richard W. Paul as a movement in two waves (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=181–98|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "first wave" of critical thinking is often referred to as 
a 'critical analysis' that is clear, [[rationality|rational]] thinking involving [[critique]]. Its details vary amongst those who [[operational definition|define]] it. According to Barry K. Beyer (1995), critical thinking means making clear, reasoned judgments. During the process of critical thinking, ideas should be reasoned, well thought out, and judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://myweb.wvnet.edu/~jelkins/critproj/overview.html|title = The Critical Thinking Movement: Alternating Currents in One Teacher's Thinking|first=James R. | last=Elkins|accessdate = 23 March 2014 |website =myweb.wvnet.edu |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. National Council for Excellence in Critical Thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org//|title=Critical Thinking Index Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines critical thinking as the "&lt;nowiki&gt;intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.&lt;/nowiki&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766|title=Defining Critical Thinking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Critical Thinking Skills Diagram.jpg|thumb|

In the term '''critical thinking''', the word ''[[wikt:critical|critical]]'', (Grk. κριτικός = ''kritikos'' = "critic") derives from the word '''critic''' and implies a [[critique]]; it identifies the intellectual capacity and the means "of judging", "of judgement", "for judging", and of being "able to discern".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lesley. (ed.) ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (1993) p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual roots of critical&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dictionary.com/e/critical-thinking/|title=Lexical Investigations: Critical Thinking - Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|date=2013-06-25|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking are as [[Ancient history|''ancient'']] as its etymology, traceable, ultimately, to the [[Teachings and philosophy of Swami Vivekananda|teaching]] practice and vision of '''''[[Socrates]]'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/socrates-9488126|title=Socrates|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,500 years ago who discovered by a method of probing questioning that people could not rationally justify their confident claims to [[Knowledge|knowledge.]]

==Definitions==
Traditionally, critical thinking has been variously defined as follows:
* "The process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information to reach an answer or conclusion"&lt;ref name="reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/critical|title=Critical – Define Critical at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Disciplined thinking that is clear, rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence"&lt;ref name="reference.com"/&gt;
* "Reasonable, reflective thinking focused on deciding what to believe or do"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.education.illinois.edu/rhennis/SSConcCTApr3.html|title=SSConceptionCT.html|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Purposeful, [[Self-control|self-regulatory]] judgment which results in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, and inference, as well as explanation of the evidential, conceptual, methodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations upon which that judgment is based"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightassessment.com/CT-Resources/Teaching-For-and-About-Critical-Thinking/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts-PDF|format=PDF|last=Facione|first=Peter A.|title=Critical Thinking: What It is and Why It Counts|publisher=insightassessment.com|year=2011|page=26|access-date=4 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729185619/http://www.insightassessment.com/CT-Resources/Teaching-For-and-About-Critical-Thinking/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts-PDF|archive-date=29 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The skill and propensity to engage in an activity with reflective scepticism (McPeck, 1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6f70/0180f144583784708e022d9cd6cb49d89c33.pdf|title=Critical Thinking: A Question of Aptitude and Attitude?|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Thinking about one's thinking in a manner designed to organize and clarify, raise the efficiency of, and recognize errors and biases in one's own thinking. Critical thinking is not 'hard' thinking nor is it directed at solving problems (other than 'improving' one's own thinking). Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the [[rationality]] of the thinker. One does not use critical thinking to solve problems—one uses critical thinking to improve one's process of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, Kirby; letter to Olivetti, Laguna Salada Union School District, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "An appraisal based on careful analytical evaluation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/critical+analysis|title=critical analysis|newspaper=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary critical thinking scholars have expanded these traditional definitions to include qualities, concepts, and processes such as creativity, imagination, discovery, reflection, empathy, connecting knowing, feminist theory, subjectivity, ambiguity, and inconclusiveness.  Some definitions of critical thinking exclude these subjective practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to reason logically is a fundamental skill of rational agents, hence the study of the form of correct argumentation is relevant to the study of critical thinking.

"First wave" logical [[thinking]] consisted of understanding the connections between two concepts or points in thought. It followed a philosophy where the [[Thought|thinker]] was removed from the train of thought and the connections and the analysis of the connect was devoid of any bias of the thinker. Kerry Walters describes this ideology in his essay Beyond Logicism in Critical Thinking, "A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective. This model of [[thinking]] has become so entrenched in conventional academic wisdom that many educators accept it as canon".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt; The adoption of these principals parallels themselves with the increasing reliance on a quantitative understanding of the world.

In the ‘second wave’ of critical thinking, as defined by [[Kerry S. Walters]] (Re-thinking Reason, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;1), many authors moved away from the logocentric mode of critical thinking that the ‘first wave’ privileged, especially in institutions of higher [[learning]]. Walters summarizes logicism as "the unwarranted assumption that good thinking is reducible to logical thinking".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

"A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective."&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;
As the ‘second wave’ took hold, scholars began to take a more inclusive view of what constituted as critical thinking. Rationality and logic are still widely accepted in many circles as the primary examples of critical thinking.

===Deduction, abduction and induction===
{{main|logical reasoning}}
There are three types of [[logical reasoning]] Informally, two kinds of logical reasoning can be distinguished in addition to formal [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]: [[inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[abductive reasoning|abduction]].
* [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] is the conclusion of a consequence given premises that logically follow by [[modus ponens]].
  e.g., X is human and all humans have a face so X has a face.
* [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] is drawing a conclusion from a pattern that is guaranteed by the strictness of the structure to which it applies.
  e.g., The sum of even integers is even.
  2x+2y = 2(x+y); The sum of integers is an integer and x and y are integers, so 2x+2y=2z where z is an integer, thus 2z is an even integer, so the sum of even integers is even.
* [[Abductive reasoning|Abduction]] is drawing a conclusion using a [[heuristic]] that is likely, but not inevitable given some foreknowledge.
  e.g., I observe sheep in a field, and they appear white from my viewing angle, so sheep are white.
       Contrast with the deductive statement:"Some sheep are white on at least one side."

===Critical thinking and rationality===
Kerry S. Walters (Re-thinking Reason, 1994) argues that rationality demands more than just logical or traditional methods of problem solving and analysis or what he calls the "calculus of justification" but also considers "[[cognitive]] acts such as [[imagination]], conceptual creativity, [[intuition]] and insight" (p.&amp;nbsp;63). These "functions" are focused on discovery, on more abstract processes instead of linear, rules-based approaches to problem-solving. The linear and non-sequential mind must both be engaged in the [[rational]] [[mind]].&lt;ref name="Walters1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kerry S. Walters|title=Re-Thinking Reason: New Perspectives in Critical Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfT32n2Hvd0C|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2095-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to critically analyze an argument – to dissect structure and components, thesis and reasons – is essential. But so is the ability to be flexible and consider non-traditional alternatives and perspectives. These complementary functions are what allow for critical thinking to be a practice encompassing imagination and intuition in cooperation with traditional modes of deductive inquiry.&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

==Functions==
The list of core critical thinking skills includes observation, interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, explanation, and [[metacognition]]. According to Reynolds (2011), an individual or group engaged in a strong way of critical thinking gives due consideration to establish for instance:&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Martin (2011). Critical thinking and systems thinking: towards a critical literacy for systems thinking in practice. In: Horvath, Christopher P. and Forte, James M. eds. Critical Thinking. New York: Nova Science Publishers, pp. 37–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence through reality
* Context skills to isolate the problem from context
* Relevant criteria for making the judgment well
* Applicable methods or techniques for forming the judgment
* Applicable theoretical constructs for understanding the problem and the question at hand

In addition to possessing strong critical-thinking skills, one must be disposed to engage problems and decisions using those skills. Critical thinking employs not only [[logic]] but broad [[intellect]]ual criteria such as clarity, [[credibility]], [[accuracy]], precision, [[relevance]], depth, [[breadth]], significance, and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first= Elizabeth A., &amp; And Others |year=1995|title= National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identifying College Graduates' Essential Skills in Writing, Speech and Listening, and Critical Thinking.

==Procedure==
Critical thinking calls for the ability to:
* Recognize problems, to find workable means for meeting those problems
* Understand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem solving
* Gather and marshal pertinent (relevant) information
* Recognize [[unstated assumption]]s and values
* Comprehend and use [[language]] with accuracy, clarity, and [[wikt:discernment|discernment]]
* Interpret data, to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments
* Recognize the existence (or non-existence) of logical relationships between propositions
* Draw warranted conclusions and generalizations
* Put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives
* Reconstruct one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience
* Render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life

In sum:

"A persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports or refutes it and the further conclusions to which it tends."&lt;ref name=glaser&gt;{{Cite book| title=An Experiment in the Development of Critical Thinking| edition=| author=Edward M. Glaser| year=1941| publisher=New York, Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University| isbn=0-404-55843-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habits or traits of mind==
The habits of [[mind]] that characterize a person strongly disposed toward critical thinking include a desire to follow reason and evidence wherever they may lead, a systematic approach to problem solving, [[inquisitiveness]], even-handedness, and confidence in [[reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identification of the Skills to be Taught, Learned, and Assessed, NCES 94–286, US Dept of Education, Addison Greenwood (Ed), Sal Carrallo (PI). See also, Critical thinking: A statement of expert consensus for purposes of educational assessment and instruction. ERIC Document No. ED 315–423&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a definition analysis by Kompf &amp; Bond (2001), critical thinking involves problem solving, decision making, [[metacognition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html|title=Teaching Metacognition|website=Metacognition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; rationality, rational thinking, [[reasoning]], [[knowledge]], [[intelligence]] and also a moral component such as reflective thinking. Critical thinkers therefore need to have reached a level of maturity in their development, possess a certain attitude as well as a set of taught skills.

==Research==
Edward M. Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements:&lt;ref name=glaser/&gt;

#An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences
#Knowledge of the methods of logical [[inquiry]] and reasoning
#Some skill in applying those methods.
Educational programs aimed at developing critical thinking in children and adult learners, individually or in group problem solving and decision making contexts, continue to address these same three central elements.

The Critical Thinking project at Human Science Lab, [[London]], is involved in scientific study of all major [[educational system]] in prevalence today to assess how the systems are working to promote or impede critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk/research/| title=Research at Human Science Lab |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary cognitive psychology regards human reasoning as a complex process that is both reactive and reflective.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, S.A. (2002) "Two Systems of Reasoning," in ''Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment'', Govitch, Griffin, Kahneman (Eds), Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79679-8}}; ''Thinking and Reasoning in Human Decision Making: The Method of Argument and Heuristic Analysis'', Facione and Facione, 2007, California Academic Press.  {{ISBN|978-1-891557-58-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions is an empirical question. Some people have both in abundance, some have skills but not the disposition to use them, some are disposed but lack strong skills, and some have neither. A measure of critical thinking dispositions is the California Measure of Mental Motivation&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OT12dZ0binIC&amp;pg=PA46 ''Research on Sociocultural Influences on Motivation and Learning''], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Catherine, M.|date=2007|title=California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory: Further Factor Analytic Examination|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pms.104.1.141-151|journal=SAGE|volume=104|pages=141–151|via=SAGE|doi=10.2466/pms.104.1.141-151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CriTT is an alternative measure that examines student beliefs and attitudes about critical thinking&lt;ref&gt;Stupple, E. J. N., Maratos, F. A., Elander, J., Hunt, T. E., Cheung, K. Y., &amp; Aubeeluck, A. V. (2017). Development of the Critical Thinking Toolkit (CriTT): A measure of student attitudes and beliefs about critical thinking. Thinking Skills and Creativity, 23, 91-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[John Dewey]] is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner, the community, and the entire democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1910). ''How we think.'' Lexington, MA: D.C. Heath &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is significant in academics due to being significant in learning. Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of [[internalization]], in the construction of basic ideas, principles, and theories inherent in content.  And critical thinking is significant in the learning process of application, whereby those ideas, principles, and theories are implemented effectively as they become relevant in learners' lives.

Each discipline adapts its use of critical thinking concepts and principles. The core concepts are always there, but they are embedded in subject-specific content. For students to learn content, intellectual engagement is crucial. All students must do their own thinking, their own construction of knowledge. Good teachers recognize this and therefore focus on the questions, readings, activities that stimulate the mind to take ownership of key concepts and principles underlying the subject.

Historically, teaching of critical thinking focused only on logical procedures such as formal and informal logic. This emphasized to students that good thinking is equivalent to logical thinking. However, a second wave of critical thinking, urges educators to value conventional techniques, meanwhile expanding what it means to be a critical thinker. In 1994, Kerry Walters&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Kerry. (1994). ''Re-Thinking Reason''. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; compiled a conglomeration of sources surpassing this logical restriction to include many different authors’ research regarding connected knowing, empathy, gender-sensitive ideals, collaboration, world views, intellectual autonomy, morality and enlightenment. These concepts invite students to incorporate their own perspectives and experiences into their thinking.

In the English and Welsh school systems, ''Critical Thinking'' is offered as a subject that 16- to 18-year-olds can take as an [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]]. Under the [[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]], students can sit two exam papers for the AS: "Credibility of Evidence" and "Assessing and Developing Argument". The full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is now available: in addition to the two AS units, candidates sit the two papers "Resolution of Dilemmas" and "Critical Reasoning". The A-level tests candidates on their ability to think critically about, and analyze, arguments on their deductive or inductive validity, as well as producing their own arguments. It also tests their ability to analyze certain related topics such as credibility and ethical decision-making. However, due to its comparative lack of subject content, many universities do not accept it as a main A-level for admissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html Critical Thinking FAQs from Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411150135/http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html |date=11 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the AS is often useful in developing reasoning skills, and the full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is useful for degree courses in politics, philosophy, history or [[theology]], providing the skills required for critical analysis that are useful, for example, in biblical study.

There used to also be an [[Advanced Extension Award]] offered in Critical Thinking in the UK, open to any A-level student regardless of whether they have the Critical Thinking A-level. [[Cambridge International Examinations]] have an A-level in Thinking Skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/uppersec/alevel/subject/aleveldetails?assdef_id=765_804|title=Cambridge International AS and A Level subjects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008, [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance]] has also been offering an A-level Critical Thinking specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php "New GCEs for 2008"], Assessment and Qualifications Alliance {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217221100/http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php |date=17 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]] have also modified theirs for 2008. Many examinations for university entrance set by universities, on top of A-level examinations, also include a critical thinking component, such as the [[LNAT]], the [[UKCAT]], the [[BioMedical Admissions Test]] and the [[Thinking Skills Assessment]].

In [[Qatar]], critical thinking was offered by [[AL-Bairaq]]—an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on [[STEM fields]]. The idea behind [[AL-Bairaq]] is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at Qatar University. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |accessdate=5 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |title=

===Efficacy===
In 1995, a meta-analysis of the literature on teaching effectiveness in higher [[education]] was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Lion Gardiner, Redesigning Higher Education: Producing Dramatic Gains in Student Learning, in conjunction with: ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
The study noted concerns from higher [[education]], [[politician]]s, and [[business]] that higher education was failing to meet society's requirements for well-educated citizens.  It concluded that although faculty may aspire to develop students' [[thinking]] skills, in practice they have tended to aim at facts and concepts utilizing lowest levels of [[cognition]], rather than developing intellect or [[values]].

In a more recent meta-analysis, researchers reviewed 341 quasi- or true-experimental studies, all of which used some form of standardized critical thinking measure to assess the outcome variable.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"&gt;Abrami, P. C., Bernard, R. M., Borokhovski, E., Waddington, D. I., Wade, C. A., &amp; Persson, T. (2014). Strategies for Teaching Students to Think Critically: A Meta-Analysis. Review of Educational Research, 1–40&lt;/ref&gt; The authors describe the various methodological approaches and attempt to categorize the differing assessment tools, which include standardized tests (and second-source measures), tests developed by teachers, tests developed by researchers, and tests developed by teachers who also serve the role as the [[researcher]].  The results emphasized the need for exposing students to real-world problems and the importance in encouraging open dialogue within a supportive environment.  Effective strategies for teaching critical thinking are thought to be possible in a wide variety of [[educational]] settings.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"/&gt; One attempt to assess the [[humanities]]' role in teaching critical thinking and reducing belief in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims was made at [[North Carolina State University]]. Some success was noted and the researchers emphasized the value of the humanities in providing the skills to evaluate current events and qualitative data in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink1=Kendrick Frazier |title=Humanities, Too: In New Study, History Courses in Critical Thinking Reduce Pseudoscientific Beliefs |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Lilienfeld]] notes that there is some evidence to suggest that basic critical thinking skills might be successfully taught to children at a younger age than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lilienfeld |first1=Scott |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |title=Teaching Skepticism: How Early Can We Begin? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810182835/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2018-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in academia==
Critical thinking is an important element of all professional fields and academic disciplines (by referencing their respective sets of permissible questions, evidence sources, criteria, etc.). Within the framework of [[scientific skepticism]], the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a [[theory of justification|well-justified]] conclusion. The concepts and principles of critical thinking can be applied to any context or case but only by reflecting upon the nature of that application. Critical thinking forms, therefore, a system of related, and overlapping, modes of thought such as anthropological thinking, sociological thinking, historical thinking, political thinking, [[psychological]] thinking, philosophical thinking, mathematical thinking, chemical thinking, biological thinking, ecological thinking, legal thinking, ethical thinking, musical thinking, thinking like a painter, sculptor, engineer, business person, etc. In other words, though critical thinking principles are universal, their application to disciplines requires a process of reflective [[contextualism|contextualization]].

Critical thinking is considered important in the academic fields because it enables one to analyze, evaluate, explain, and restructure their thinking, thereby decreasing the risk of adopting, acting on, or thinking with, a false belief. However, even with knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, mistakes can happen due to a thinker's inability to apply the methods or because of character traits such as [[egocentrism]]. Critical thinking includes identification of [[prejudice]], [[bias]], propaganda, self-deception, distortion, [[misinformation]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/fallacy/biases.php |title=[F08] Cognitive biases |last1=Lau |first1=Joe |last2=Chan |first2=Jonathan |date= |website=Critical thinking web |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given research in [[cognitive psychology]], some [[education|educators]] believe that schools should focus on teaching their students critical thinking [[skill]]s and cultivation of intellectual traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/critical-thinking-moral-integrity-and-citizenship-teaching-for-the-intellectual-virtues/487 |title=Critical Thinking, Moral Integrity and Citizenship |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Criticalthinking.org |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking skills can be used to help nurses during the assessment process. Through the use of critical thinking, nurses can question, evaluate, and reconstruct the nursing care process by challenging the established theory and practice. Critical thinking skills can help nurses problem solve, reflect, and make a conclusive decision about the current situation they face. Critical thinking creates "new possibilities for the development of the nursing knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Catching the wave: understanding the concept of critical thinking (1999) {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.00925.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sociocultural, environmental, and political issues that are affecting healthcare delivery, it would be helpful to embody new techniques in nursing. Nurses can also engage their critical thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection. This practice standard is even part of some regulatory organizations such as the College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for Continuing Competencies (2006).&lt;ref&gt;College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for 
[http://www.cno.org/Global/4-LearnAboutStandardsAndGuidelines/prac/learn/modules/profstands/slides/Competence.pdf Continuing Competencies (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;
It requires nurses to engage in [[Reflective Practice]] and keep records of this continued professional development for possible review by the College.

Critical thinking is also considered important for [[human rights education]] for [[toleration]]. The [[International Day for Tolerance|Declaration of Principles on Tolerance]] adopted by [[UNESCO]] in 1995 affirms that "education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others, and could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement, ''critical thinking'' and ethical [[reasoning]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=UNESCO |title=International Day for Tolerance . Declaration of Principles on Tolerance, Article 4, 3 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13175&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is used as a way of deciding whether a claim is true, partially true, or false. It is a tool by which one can come about reasoned conclusions based on a reasoned process.

==In computer-mediated communication==
The advent and rising popularity of online courses has prompted some to ask if computer-mediated communication (CMC) promotes, hinders, or has no effect on the amount and quality of critical thinking in a course (relative to face-to-face communication). There is some evidence to suggest a fourth, more nuanced possibility: that CMC may promote some aspects of critical thinking but hinder others. For example, Guiller et al. (2008)&lt;ref name="Guiller2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guiller|first1=Jane|last2=Durndell|first2=Alan|last3=Ross|first3=Anne|title=Peer interaction and critical thinking: Face-to-face or online discussion?|journal=Learning and Instruction|date=2008|volume=18|pages=187–200|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, relative to face-to-face discourse, online discourse featured more justifications, while face-to-face discourse featured more instances of students expanding on what others had said. The increase in justifications may be due to the asynchronous nature of online discussions, while the increase in expanding comments may be due to the spontaneity of ‘real time’ discussion. Newman et al. (1995)&lt;ref name="Newman1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=D R|last2=Webb|first2=Brian|last3=Cochrane|first3=Clive|title=A content analysis method to measure critical thinking in face-to-face and computer supported group learning|journal=Interpersonal Computing and Technology|date=1995|volume=3|issue=September 1993|pages=56–77|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04569.x|pmid=18352969}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed similar differential effects. They found that while CMC boasted more important statements and linking of ideas, it lacked novelty. The authors suggest that this may be due to difficulties participating in a brainstorming-style activity in an asynchronous environment. Rather, the asynchrony may promote users to put forth “considered, thought out contributions.”

Researchers assessing critical thinking in online discussion forums often employ a technique called Content Analysis,&lt;ref name="Newman1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guiller2008" /&gt; where the text of online discourse (or the transcription of face-to-face discourse) is systematically coded for different kinds of statements relating to critical thinking. For example, a statement might be coded as “Discuss ambiguities to clear them up” or “Welcoming outside knowledge” as positive indicators of critical thinking. Conversely, statements reflecting poor critical thinking may be labeled as “Sticking to prejudice or assumptions” or “Squashing attempts to bring in outside knowledge.” The frequency of these codes in CMC and face-to-face discourse can be compared to draw conclusions about the quality of critical thinking.

Searching for evidence of critical thinking in discourse has roots in a definition of critical thinking put forth by Kuhn (1991),&lt;ref name="Kuhn1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|title=The skills of argument|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasizes the social nature of discussion and knowledge construction. There is limited research on the role of social experience in critical thinking development, but there is some evidence to suggest it is an important factor. For example, research has shown that 3- to 4-year-old children can discern, to some extent, the differential creditability&lt;ref name="Koenig2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=M A|last2=Harris|first2=P L|title=Preschoolers mistrust ignorant and inaccurate speakers|journal=Child Development|date=2005|volume=76|pages=1261–77|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00849.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expertise&lt;ref name="Lutz2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lutz|first1=D J|last2=Keil|first2=F C|title=Early understanding of the division of cognitive labor|journal=Child Development|date=2002|volume=73|pages=1073–84|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00458}}&lt;/ref&gt; of individuals. Further evidence for the impact of social experience on the development of critical thinking skills comes from work that found that 6- to 7-year-olds from China have similar levels of skepticism to 10- and 11-year-olds in the United States.&lt;ref name="Heyman2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyman|first1=G D|last2=Fu|first2=G|last3=Lee|first3=K|title=Evaluating claims peoplemake about themselves: The development of skepticism|journal=Child Development|date=2007|volume=78|pages=367–75|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01003.x|pmc=2570105}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the development of critical thinking skills was solely due to maturation, it is unlikely we would see such dramatic differences across cultures.

[[File:Norbert wiener.jpg|thumb|right|Norbert Weiner, the founder of cybernetics.]]
'''Dualism in cybernetics''' refers to systems or problems in which one or more [[intelligent]] adversaries attempt to exploit the weaknesses of the investigator. Examples could include a game-playing opponent, adversarial law, evolutionary systems of predator/parasite and prey/host, or politics/enslavement attempts. [[Norbert Wiener]], the founder of [[cybernetics]], contrasted "[[Manichean]] devils" (dualistic adversarial systems) with "[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] devils"—systems or problems that, though very complex and difficult to figure out, did not feature an adversary with contrary intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubberly.com/articles/cybernetics-and-counterculture.html|title=How cybernetics connects computing, counterculture, and design|website=www.dubberly.com|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victories or "expansions of knowledge" in the latter type of system were able to be built upon incrementally, through science (experimentation expanding empirical knowledge bases). Wiener noted that temporary weaknesses (such as errors to perceive all components of a system) were not fatal in attempts to defeat "Augustinian devils" because another experiment could simply be pursued (and he noted that he had personally defeated many "Augustinian devils" with his contributions to science and engineering). By contrast, Wiener observed that temporary lapses in judgment against "Manichean devils" were more often fatal or destructive, due to the desire of the opponent to "win/survive at all costs", even by introducing deception into the system. He said that he had been defeated by many "Manichean devils", such as on occasions when he was temporarily careless in chess.

Although this duality between complexity (in the case of the Augustinian devils) and opposition (in the case of Manichean devils) may seem obvious, it holds deep implications for many areas of science, such as [[game theory]], [[political science]], [[computer science]], [[network science]], [[Security|security science]], [[military science]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Cont/ContSato.htm|title=20th WCP: The Significance of System Cybernetics for Contemporary Philosophy- Post-Modernity in System Cybernetics|website=www.bu.edu|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fides quaerens intellectum''''' means "faith seeking understanding" or "faith seeking intelligence". It is the [[Theology|theological]] method stressed by [[Augustine]] (354–430) and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] ({{circa|1033}}&amp;nbsp;– 1109) in which one begins with belief in [[faith]] and on the basis of that faith moves on to further understanding of Christian truth.&lt;ref&gt; Donald K. McKim, Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 1996), 104&lt;/ref&gt; 
Anselm uses this expression for the first time in his [[Proslogion]] (II–IV). It articulates the close relationship between faith and [[Reason|human reason]]. This is the key to Anselm's theological thought and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] thinking. He would understand all things in faith. It means to understand intellectually what we already believe. Chronologically, faith precedes understanding, like when small children first trust their parents and believe what they state, and just later on, when they grow up, they want to examine and understand the reality by themselves. But, logically, intellect precedes faith, because we trust other people, at least in principle, only provisionally, but our aim is a direct personal knowledge. In the words of Anselm of Canterbury : "Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam" ("I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but rather, I believe in order that I may understand").

A '''paradox''' is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=paradox|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/paradox|website=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bolander|first1=Thomas|title=Self-Reference|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-reference/|accessdate=21 June 2016|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A paradox involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. K. and Lewis, M. W. (2011). Toward a theory of paradox: A dynamic equilibrium model of organizing. ''Academy of Management Review,'' 36, pp. 381-403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Y., Waldman, D. A., Han, Y., and Li, X. (2015). Paradoxical leader behaviors in people management: Antecedents and consequences. ''Academy of Management Journal,'' 58, pp. 538-566&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Waldman and    David E. Bowen (2016), Learning to Be a Paradox-Savvy Leader, ''Academy of Management -- Perspectives,'' vol. 30, no. 3, 316-327, {{doi|10.5465/amp.2015.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some logical paradoxes are known to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]] arguments but are still valuable in promoting [[critical thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eliason |first=James L. |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9604072434/using-paradoxes-teach-critical-thinking-science |title=Using Paradoxes to Teach Critical Thinking in Science |journal=Journal of College Science Teaching |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=341–44 |date=March–April 1996 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions assumed to be rigorous, and have caused [[axioms]] of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is [[Russell's paradox]], which questions whether a "list of all lists that do not contain themselves" would include itself, and showed that attempts to found [[set theory]] on the identification of sets with [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] were flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Crossley | first1=J.N. | last2=Ash | first2=C.J. | last3=Brickhill | first3=C.J. | last4=Stillwell | first4=J.C. | last5=Williams | first5=N.H. | title=What is mathematical logic? | zbl=0251.02001 | location=London-Oxford-New York | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1972 | isbn=0-19-888087-1 | pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Curry's paradox]], are not yet resolved.

Examples outside logic include the [[ship of Theseus]] from philosophy (questioning whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship). Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, [[M.C. Escher]] featured [[Perspective (visual)|perspective-based]] paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aminotes.tumblr.com/post/653017235/the-mathematical-art-of-m-c-escher-for-me-it |title=The Mathematical Art of M.C. Escher |website=Lapidarium notes |editor-first=Amira |editor-last=Skomorowska |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, the word "paradox" often refers to statements that may be both true and false i.e. [[irony|ironic]] or unexpected, such as "the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking".&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/paradox |title=Paradox |website=Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical paradox==
{{See also|List of paradoxes}}
Common themes in paradoxes include [[self-reference]], [[infinite regress]], [[circular definition]]s, and confusion between different levels of [[abstraction]].

[[Patrick Hughes (artist)|Patrick Hughes]] outlines three laws of the paradox:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Self-reference: An example is "This statement is false", a form of the [[liar paradox]]. The statement is referring to itself. Another example of self-reference is the question of whether the [[barber]] shaves himself in the [[barber paradox]]. One more example would be "Is the answer to this question 'No'?"
;Contradiction: "This statement is false"; the statement cannot be false and true at the same time. Another example of contradiction is if a man talking to a genie wishes that wishes couldn't come true.  This contradicts itself because if the genie grants his wish, he did not grant his wish, and if he refuses to grant his wish, then he did indeed grant his wish, therefore making it impossible either to grant or not grant his wish because his wish contradicts itself.
;Vicious circularity, or infinite regress: "This statement is false"; if the statement is true, then the statement is false, thereby making the statement true. Another example of [[vicious circle|vicious circularity]] is the following group of statements:
:: "The following sentence is true."
:: "The previous sentence is false."

Other paradoxes involve [[false statement]]s ("'impossible' is not a word in my vocabulary", a simple paradox) or [[half-truths]] and the resulting [[cognitive bias|biased]] assumptions.  This form is common in [[Howler (error)|howlers]].

For example, consider a situation in which a father and his son are driving down the road.  The car crashes into a tree and the father is killed.  The boy is rushed to the nearest hospital where he is prepared for emergency [[surgery]].  Upon entering the surgery-suite, the surgeon says, "I can't operate on this boy.  He's my son."

The apparent paradox is caused by a [[hasty generalization]], for if the surgeon is the boy's father, the statement cannot be true.  The paradox is resolved if it is revealed that the surgeon is a woman — the boy's mother.

Paradoxes which are not based on a hidden error generally occur at the fringes of context or [[language]], and require extending the context or language in order to lose their paradoxical quality.  Paradoxes that arise from apparently intelligible uses of language are often of interest to [[logic]]ians and [[philosopher]]s.  "This sentence is false" is an example of the well-known [[liar paradox]]: it is a sentence which cannot be consistently interpreted as either true or false, because if it is known to be false, then it is known that it must be true, and if it is known to be true, then it is known that it must be false. [[Russell's paradox]], which shows that the notion of ''the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all those sets that do not contain themselves'' leads to a contradiction, was instrumental in the development of modern logic and set theory.

[[Thought-experiment]]s can also yield interesting paradoxes. The [[grandfather paradox]], for example, would arise if a [[time-travel]]er were to kill his own grandfather before his mother or father had been conceived, thereby preventing his own birth. This is a specific example of the more general observation of the [[butterfly effect]], or that a time-traveller's interaction with the past — however slight — would entail making changes that would, in turn, change the future in which the time-travel was yet to occur, and would thus change the circumstances of the time-travel itself.

Often a seemingly paradoxical conclusion arises from an inconsistent or inherently contradictory definition of the initial premise.  In the case of that apparent paradox of a time-traveler killing his own grandfather, it is the inconsistency of defining the past to which he returns as being somehow different from the one which leads up to the future from which he begins his trip, but also insisting that he must have come to that past from the same future as the one that it leads up to.

==Quine's classification&lt;!--Linked from 'Willard Van Orman Quine'--&gt;==
{{see also|Veridicality}}

[[W. V. Quine]] (1962) distinguished between three classes of paradoxes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Ways of Paradox, and other essays | last1 = Quine | first1 = W.V. | authorlink = W.V. Quine | year = 1966 | publisher = Random House | publication-place = New York | chapter =  The ways of paradox }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''veridical paradox'' produces a result that appears absurd but is demonstrated to be true nonetheless.  Thus the paradox of Frederic's birthday in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' establishes the surprising fact that a twenty-one-year-old would have had only five birthdays if he had been born on a [[leap day]].  Likewise, [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] demonstrates difficulties in mapping voting- results to the will of the people.  The [[Monty Hall paradox]] demonstrates that a decision which has an intuitive 50–50 chance is in fact heavily biased towards making a decision which, given the intuitive conclusion, the player would be unlikely to make.  In 20th-Century science, [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and [[Schrödinger's cat]] are famously vivid examples of a theory being taken to a logical but paradoxical end.
* A ''falsidical paradox'' establishes a result that not only ''appears'' false but actually ''is'' false, due to a fallacy in the demonstration.  The various [[invalid proof|invalid mathematical proofs]] (e.g., that 1 = 2) are classic examples, generally relying on a hidden [[division by zero]]. Another example is the inductive form of the [[All horses are the same colour|horse paradox]], which falsely generalises from true specific statements.  [[Zeno's paradoxes]] are 'falsidical', concluding, for example, that a flying arrow never reaches its target or that a speedy runner cannot catch up to a tortoise with a small head-start.
* A paradox that is in neither class may be an ''[[antinomy]]'', which reaches a self-contradictory result by properly applying accepted ways of reasoning.  For example, the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]] points out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of truth and description.
A fourth kind has sometimes been described since Quine's work.
* A paradox that is both true and false at the same time and in the same sense is called a ''[[dialetheia]]''.  In Western logics it is often assumed, following [[Aristotle]], that no ''dialetheia'' exist, but they are sometimes accepted in Eastern traditions (e.g. in the [[Mohists]],&lt;ref name="SchoolOfNames"&gt;The [[School of Names|Logicians]] ([[Warring States period]]),[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/school-names/paradoxes.html "Miscellaneous paradoxes"] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gongsun Longzi]],&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Zen]]&lt;ref&gt;Chung-ying Cheng (1973) "[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Philosophical/OnZenLanguage.htm On Zen (Ch’an) Language and Zen Paradoxes]" ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'', '''V. 1''' (1973) pp. 77-102&lt;/ref&gt;) and in [[paraconsistent logic]]s.  It would be mere equivocation or a matter of degree, for example, to both affirm and deny that "John is here" when John is halfway through the door but it is self-contradictory simultaneously to affirm and deny the event.

==In philosophy==
A taste for paradox is central to the philosophies of [[Laozi]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Bhartrhari]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[G.K. Chesterton]], among many others.  Søren Kierkegaard, for example, writes in the ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' that
&lt;blockquote&gt;But one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow.  But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall.  This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |editor1-first=Howard V. |editor1-last=Hong |editor2-first=Edna H. |editor2-last=Hong |title=Philosophical Fragments |year=1844 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuMoXUAaEr0C&amp;pg=PA37 |publisher=Princeton University Press |publication-date=1985 |isbn=9780691020365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In medicine==
A [[paradoxical reaction]] to a [[drug]] is the opposite of what one would expect, such as becoming agitated by a [[sedative]] or sedated by a [[stimulant]]. Some are common and are used regularly in medicine, such as the use of  stimulants such as [[Adderall]] and [[Ritalin]] in the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (also known as ADHD) while others are rare and can be dangerous as they are not expected, such as severe agitation from a [[benzodiazepine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Psychopharmacology of Agitation: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA Psychopharmacology Workgroup |pmc=3298219 |website=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophical ethology''' is a rather young multidisciplinary research field gathering [[natural science]]s, social science, human studies and dedicates to the issue of animal subjectivity. It is about an ontological concept needing a philosophical place other than a descriptive issue, just as it was in the 19th century.

== History ==
Philosophical ethology develops from the thought of continental philosophers, which researches involve ethology, philosophy and anthropology. Those authors had taken up the challenges coming from biology, phenomenology, critical theory, the Animal Studies and post-human philosophy. These are all disciplines dealing, each in its own way, with non-human animals and the interactions among living beings, in order to propose a new paradigm able to go beyond the tricks of the anthropocentrism, still alive and kicking underneath the traditional theories.

The mean critics by those authors is the Cartesian heiress of automata:&lt;ref&gt;(IT) René Descartes, Discorso sul metodo, Opere, I, Roma-Bari, Laterza, [1637] 1967, pp. 129-182.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the classical ethology and behaviourism have described how the animal machine would work and which were the mechanisms regulating processes, nevertheless these authors did not challenge the mean idea, that is an animal is not a machine. Hence the need to elaborate a new multidisciplinary approach able to interpret the animal subjectivity ontologically speaking, and the different ontology correlated issues, such as the cultural dimensions, symbolicity and materiality in non-human animals and their intra and interspecific relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccat-lab.org/ccat-research-symposium-event-what-is-philosophical-ethology/ Report del convegno "What is Philosophical Ethology?" tenuto alla Curtin University (Australia) il 22 luglio 2015], ccat-lab.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leading figures ==
Three recent issues of magazine ''Angelaki. Journal of the Theoretical Humanities''&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Brett Buchanan, Jeffrey Bussolini &amp; Matthew Chrulew, [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cang20/current Philosophical ethology], in Angelaki. Journal of the Theoretical Humanities, I, II, III, Routledge, 2014 - 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; have explored the thought of three scholars considered among the most influential voices in the field of philosophical ethology by di editors of the magazine, Brett Buchanan, Jeffrey Bussolini and Matthew Chrulew: the three authos are Vinciane Despret, Dominique Lestel and Roberto Marchesini.

=== [[Vinciane Despret]] ===
Belgian philosopher and professo at the university of liege, Vinciane Despret has written many essays and articles about the history of ethology, psicology and human-animal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Vinciane Despret, Quando il lupo vivrà con l'agnello. Sguardo umano e comportamenti animali, Milano, Eleuthera, 2004, {{ISBN|978-8885060906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Vinciane Despret, Hans, il cavallo che sapeva contare, Milano, Eleuthera, 2005, {{ISBN|978-8885060982}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All along her career, Despert has worked together with few authors from different disciplines (ethology, arts, literature) and with many non-human animals (elephants, mice, rats, monkeys).&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Brett Buchanan, Matthew Chrulew &amp; Jeffrey Bussolini, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1039821 On asking the right questions. An interview with Vinciane Despret], in Angelaki. Philosophical ethology II - Vinciane Despret, vol. 20, nº 2, Roudledge, 2015, pp. 165-178.&lt;/ref&gt; These encounters allowed her to build a unique research path.

In Despret’s writings, what is peculiar is the methodological approach and her anecdotal and idiosyncratic style: the author chooses to tell stories about animals (or, better, stories of relationship among animals, humans included) rather than to write about animals.
Focal point to the authors is ''making the right questions'' to non-human animals.&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Vinciane Despret&amp;Brett Buchanan, What Would Animals Say If We Asked the Right Questions?, in Posthumanities, Minneapolis, University Of Minnesota Press, 2016, {{ISBN|978-0816692392}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that animals are not texts to hermeneutically interpret, not object to quest via scientific experiments, but they are subjects able to provide their own answers to the questions interesting to them.

Within philosophical ethology, Despret has stressed the repetitivity of any interspecific dialogue: non-human animals are being transformed by the encounter with the human beings, and, in the same way, human beings result transformed by the dialogue with the non-human. Despret’s stories are full of examples got by researchers, farmers, trainers – along with likewise important autobiographical reports – proving the enrichment coming from the encounter with the non-human animals.

=== Dominique Lestel ===
A French philosopher and ethologist, Lestel is "Maître de conférences" at École Normale Supérieure of Paris and director of a research team about eco-anthropology and etnonlogy at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum national d’histoire naturelle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://savoirs.ens.fr/conferencier.php?id=402 Dominique Lestel's Academic Positions], savoirs.ens.fr.&lt;/ref&gt;

His credit is stressing how a cultural phenomenon is not a human peculiarity.&lt;ref&gt;(FR) Dominique Lestel, Les origines animales de la culture, in Champs Essais, Paris, Flammarion, 2001, {{ISBN|978-2-0812-23042}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To Lestel, it necessary to see at anthropo-poiesis with an evolutionary and pluralist lens and at culture as a domain no longer apart from nature. It is necessary to become aware that we live in a multi-species society where each species produces their own kind of culture. This proximity of space and time among beings from different species allows the emergence of few sincere friendship and relationship, that have a historical, ethical and political importance, to Lestel.&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Matthew Chrulew, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0969725X.2014.976069 The animal outside the text. An interview with Dominique Lestel], in Angelaki. Philosophical ethology I: Dominique Lestel, vol. 19, nº 3, Routledge, 2014, pp. 187-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, during the International days of study GIS about human-animal held in Bologna, Lestel has rolled out his zoo-futurism, a philosophical artistic trend aiming to "re-animalise" the human being.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Dominique Lestel, [https://ilmanifesto.it/login L’animale è l’avvenire dell’umano. Guida allo zoo-futurismo], in il Manifesto, 29 ottobre 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roberto Marchesini ===
An Italian philosopher, ethologist and zooanthopologist, Marchesini is director of Siua (School of Human-Animal interaction), of Study Centre of post-human philosophy and professor at few Italian universities. For over 20 years, he is leading a multidisciplinary project research about Zooanthropology, posts-human philosophy and bioethics to demonstrate that non-human animals have a referent role during the identity structuring (anthropo-poiesis)&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, [http://www.metis.progedit.com/anno-iii-numero-1-giugno-2013-formare-tra-scienza-tecnica-tecnologia-temi/99-saggi/489-antropodecentramento-e-ibridazioni-progetto-posthuman-e-profilatura-identitaria.html Antropodecentramento e ibridazioni. Progetto Posthuman e profilatura identitaria], in MeTis. Mondi educativi, temi indagini suggestioni, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosophical consequences coming from this kind of relationship.

Main concepts in Marchesini’s thought are Zootropy and animal epiphany. With the term zootropy, Marchesini underlines the natural human tendency to turn to non-humans, like a kind of ''biophilia''&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Edward Osborne Wilson, Biophilia, Harvard University Press, 1986, {{ISBN|9780674074422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; rooted in our species that see in ethero-specifics some social counterparts able to contribute to anthropo-poiesis processes.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Fondamenti di zooantropologia. La zooantropologia teorica, Bologna, Apeiron, 2014, {{ISBN|9788887690132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other side, with the concept of "animal epiphany", Marchesini points out the characteristic of enunciation and revelation coming from humans-non humans relationship. Animal diversity let human being imagine new existential paths – in the flight of a bird, human being cannot see just the phenomenon per se, but perceive a new dimension of the thinking ''it is possible to fly''&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Epifania animale. L'oltreuomo come rivelazione, Milano, Mimesis, 2014, p. 71, {{ISBN|978-8857521350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; – and experiment an hybridational tension leading to identity slidings.

With the essay ''Philosophical ethology'',&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Etologia filosofica. Alla ricerca della soggettività animale, Milano, Mimesis, 2016, {{ISBN|978-8857532332}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marchesini focus on subjectivity. To him, subjectivity is foundation to conscience, not the opposite. Animals get constantly engaged from the external world through new occurrences asking for creativity and initiative not explicable with any automatism.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) R. Marchesini, Intelligenza emotiva versus intelligenza cognitiva, in Pluriverso, vol. 3, La Nuova Italia, 2001, pp. 22-33.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, to Marchesini, desire connects animals and the world, desire make them acting in their present.

== Introduction ==

=== Knowledge ===
Traditionally, the term "philosophy" referred to any body of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name="auto23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=philosophy|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education and politics. Newton's 1687 "[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]" is classified in the 2000s as a book of physics; he used the term  "[[natural philosophy]]" because it used to encompass disciplines that later became associated with sciences such as [[astronomy]], [[medicine]] and [[physics]].{{sfn|Lindberg|2007|p=3}}

In the first part of the first book of his ''Academics'', [[Cicero]] introduced the division of philosophy into logic, physics, and ethics; in section thirteen of the first book of his [[Lives_and_Opinions_of_Eminent_Philosophers|''Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers'']], the 3rd-century [[Diogenes_Laërtius|Diogenes Laërtius]], the first historian of philosophy, established the traditional division of philosophical inquiry into three parts: 

* [[Science|Natural philosophy]] ("physics," from ''ta physika'', "things having to do with nature (''physis'')" was the study of the constitution and processes of transformation in the physical world;
* [[Ethics|Moral philosophy]] ("ethics," from ''êthika,'' literally, "having to do with character, disposition, manners") was the study of goodness, right and wrong, justice and virtue.
* [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical philosophy]] ("logic") was the study of [[existence]], causation, [[God]], [[logic]], [[Universal (metaphysics)|forms]] and other abstract objects ("''meta ta physika"'' lit: "After [the book] the Physics").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kant: Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|date=2012|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=YASbAEhCLw0C}}|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107401068|edition=2nd|quote="Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three branches of knowledge: natural science, ethics, and logic."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This division is not obsolete but has changed. Natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences, especially astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and cosmology. Moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences, but still includes value theory (including aesthetics, ethics, political philosophy, etc.). Metaphysical philosophy has birthed formal sciences such as logic, mathematics and philosophy of science, but still includes epistemology, cosmology and others.

=== Philosophical progress ===
Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today.

== {{anchor|History}}Historical overview&lt;!--'History of philosophy' redirects here--&gt; ==
In one general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom, intellectual culture and a search for knowledge. In that sense, all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions such as "how are we to live" and "what is the nature of reality". A broad and impartial conception of philosophy then, finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality, morality and life in all world civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield  (Editor), Edelglass (Editor), ''The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Western philosophy]] is the philosophical tradition of the [[Western world]] and dates to [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] thinkers who were active in [[Ancient Greece]] in the 6th century BCE such as [[Thales]] (c. 624–546 BCE) and [[Pythagoras]] (c. 570–495 BCE) who practiced a "love of wisdom" (''philosophia'')&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=b_VvghYDArwC}}|title=Lectures on the History of Philosophy: Greek philosophy|last=Hegel|first=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich|last2=Brown|first2=Robert F.|date=2006|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-927906-7|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were also termed ''physiologoi'' (students of ''physis'', or nature). [[Socrates]] was a very influential philosopher, who insisted that he possessed no ''wisdom'' but was a ''pursuer of'' wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DSym.%3Asection%3D201d|title=Plato's "Symposium"|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|page=201d and following|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western philosophy]] can be divided into three eras: [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient]] (Greco-Roman), [[Medieval philosophy]] (Christian European), and [[Modern philosophy]].

The Ancient era was dominated by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophical schools]] which arose out of the various pupils of Socrates, such as [[Plato]], who founded the [[Platonic Academy]] and his student [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="process"/&gt; founding the [[Peripatetic school]], who were both extremely influential in Western tradition. Other traditions include [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], [[Stoicism]], [[Skepticism#Philosophical skepticism|Greek Skepticism]] and [[Epicureanism]]. Important topics covered by the Greeks included [[metaphysics]] (with competing theories such as [[atomism]] and [[monism]]), [[cosmology]], the nature of the well-lived life ([[eudaimonia]]), the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason ([[logos]]). With the rise of the [[Roman empire]], Greek philosophy was also increasingly discussed in [[Latin language|Latin]] by [[Romans]] such as [[Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].

[[Medieval philosophy]] (5th – 16th century) is the period following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and was dominated by the rise of [[Christianity]] and hence reflects [[Judeo-Christian]] theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of [[God]], the nature of [[faith]] and reason, metaphysics, the [[problem of evil]] were discussed in this period. Some key Medieval thinkers include [[St. Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Laon|Anselm]] and [[Roger Bacon]]. Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to [[Theology]] (''ancilla theologiae'') and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of [[Scholasticism]], a text critical method developed in [[medieval universities]] based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The [[Renaissance]] period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust [[Humanism]].
[[Early modern philosophy]] in the Western world begins with thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650).&lt;ref name="diane"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fifty Major Philosophers, A Reference Guide|page=125|author=Diane Collinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rise of natural science, [[Modern philosophy]] was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;ref name="philosophical12"&gt;Rutherford, ''The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', p. 1: "Most often this [period] has been associated with the achievements of a handful of great thinkers: the so-called 'rationalists' (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz) and 'empiricists' (Locke, Berkeley, Hume), whose inquiries culminate in Kant's 'Critical philosophy.' These canonical figures have been celebrated for the depth and rigor of their treatments of perennial philosophical questions..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="traditional"&gt;Nadler, ''A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', p. 2: "The study of early modern philosophy demands that we pay attention to a wide variety of questions and an expansive pantheon of thinkers: the traditional canonical figures (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), to be sure, but also a large 'supporting cast'..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philosophical13"&gt;[[Bruce Kuklick]], "Seven Thinkers and How They Grew: Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz; Locke, Berkeley, Hume; Kant" in Rorty, Schneewind, and Skinner (eds.), ''Philosophy in History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), p. 125: "Literary, philosophical, and historical studies often rely on a notion of what is ''canonical''. In American philosophy scholars go from Jonathan Edwards to John Dewey; in American literature from James Fenimore Cooper to F. Scott Fitzgerald; in political theory from Plato to Hobbes and Locke […] The texts or authors who fill in the blanks from A to Z in these, and other intellectual traditions, constitute the canon, and there is an accompanying narrative that links text to text or author to author, a 'history of' American literature, economic thought, and so on. The most conventional of such histories are embodied in university courses and the textbooks that accompany them. This essay examines one such course, the History of Modern Philosophy, and the texts that helped to create it. If a philosopher in the United States were asked why the seven people in my title comprise Modern Philosophy, the initial response would be: they were the best, and there are historical and philosophical connections among them."&lt;/ref&gt; [[19th-century philosophy]] is influenced by the wider movement termed [[the Enlightenment]], and includes figures such as [[Hegel]] a key figure in [[German idealism]], [[Kierkegaard]] who developed the foundations for [[existentialism]], [[Nietzsche]] a famed anti-Christian, [[J.S. Mill]] who promoted [[Utilitarianism]], [[Karl Marx]] who developed the foundations for [[Communism]] and the American [[William James]]. The 20th century saw the split between [[Analytic philosophy]] and [[Continental philosophy]], as well as philosophical trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], [[Existentialism]], [[Logical Positivism]], [[Pragmatism]] and the [[Linguistic turn]].

===Middle Eastern philosophy===

{{See also|Islamic philosophy|Middle Eastern philosophy}}
The regions of the [[fertile Crescent]], [[Iran]] and [[Arabia]] are home to the earliest known philosophical [[Wisdom literature]] and is today mostly dominated by [[Islamic culture]]. Early wisdom literature from the fertile crescent was a genre which sought to instruct people on ethical action, practical living and virtue through stories and proverbs. In [[Ancient Egypt]], these texts were known as [[sebayt]] ('teachings') and they are central to our understandings of [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy]]. [[Babylonian astronomy]] also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the Ancient Greeks. [[Jewish philosophy]] and [[Christian philosophy]] are religio-philosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe, which both share certain early Judaic texts (mainly the [[Tanakh]]) and monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as the [[Geonim]] of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]] and [[Maimonides]] engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] who ushered in the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish Enlightenment), [[Jewish existentialism]] and [[Reform Judaism]].

Pre-Islamic [[Iranian philosophy]] begins with the work of [[Zoroaster]], one of the first promoters of [[monotheism]] and of the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] between good and evil. This dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as [[Manichaeism]], [[Mazdakism]], and [[Zurvanism]].

After the [[Muslim conquests]], [[Early Islamic philosophy]] developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions. This [[Islamic Golden Age]] influenced European intellectual developments. The two main currents of early Islamic thought are [[Kalam]] which focuses on [[Islamic theology]] and [[#Falsafa|Falsafa]] which was based on [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. The work of Aristotle was very influential among the falsafa such as [[al-Kindi]] (9th century), [[Avicenna]] (980 – June 1037) and [[Averroes]] (12th century). Others such as [[Al-Ghazali]] were highly critical of the methods of the Aristotelian falsafa. Islamic thinkers also developed a [[scientific method]], experimental medicine, a theory of optics and a legal philosophy. [[Ibn Khaldun]] was an influential thinker in [[philosophy of history]].

In [[History of Iran|Iran]] several schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age and include currents such as [[Illuminationist philosophy]], [[Sufi philosophy]], and [[Transcendent theosophy]]. The 19th- and 20th-century [[Arab world]] saw the [[Al-Nahda|Nahda]] (awakening or renaissance) movement which influenced [[contemporary Islamic philosophy]].

===Indian philosophy===
{{Main|Eastern philosophy|Indian philosophy}}
[[Indian philosophy]] ({{lang-sa|{{IAST|darśana}}}}; 'world views', 'teachings')&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=darzana&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 Soken Sanskrit, ''darzana'']&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the diverse philosophical traditions that emerged since the ancient times on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Jainism and Buddhism originated at the end of the Vedic period, while Hinduism emerged as a fusion of diverse traditons, starting after the end of the Vedic period.

Hindus generally classify these traditions as either orthodox or heterodox – [[Āstika and nāstika|āstika or nāstika]] – depending on whether they accept the authority of the [[Vedas]] and the theories of [[Brahman]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self) therein.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=On Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8vRAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-936008-6|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orthodox schools include the Hindu traditions of thought, while the heterodox schools include the Buddhist and the Jain traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karl Potter| title=A Fresh Classification of India’s Philosophical Systems|journal = Journal of Asian Studies|volume=21| issue=1|year=1961| pages=25-32|jstor=2050985}}, Quote: "Whatever the source of the generally accepted classification of Indian philosophical systems, its six divisions do not appear to most scholars in this field to stem from logic. As a systematic attempt to deal with theoretical problems of metaphysics, logic, epistemology, and related topics, the “six systems” account has several glaring deficiencies. Two of these will be mentioned briefly. [...] A second deficiency in the “six-system” account is that it only covers orthodox philosophers, i.e., the Hindu schools of thought. From a philosophical standpoint, the views of the Buddhists and Jains are equally important."&lt;/ref&gt; Other schools include the [[Ajñana]], [[Ajivika]] and [[Cārvāka]] which became extinct over their history.&lt;ref name=andrewoverview&gt;Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 2-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bilimoriaastika&gt;P Bilimoria (2000), Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1135703226}}, page 88&lt;/ref&gt; 

Important Indian philosophical concepts shared by the Indian philosophies include [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[artha]], [[kama]], [[dukkha]] (suffering), [[anitya]] (anicca, impermanence), [[meditation|dhyana]] (jhana, meditation), renunciation (with or without monasticism or asceticism), various [[samsara]] with cycles of rebirth, [[moksha]] (nirvana, kaivalya, liberation from rebirth), and virtues such as [[ahimsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

====Jain philosophy====
[[File:Aklank swami.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.4|Akalanka]]
{{Main|Jain philosophy}}
Jain philosophy accepts the concept of a permanent soul (jiva) as one of the five ''astikayas'', or eternal infinite categories that make up the substance of existence. The other four being ''dharma'', ''adharma'', ''akasha'' (space) and ''pudgala'' (matter). The Jain thought separates matter from the soul completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two major subtraditions: Digambara (sky dressed, naked) and Svetambara (white dressed), along with several more minor traditions such as Terapanthis.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|authorlink=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt6-YXE2aUwC|year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press|isbn= 978-0-415-26606-2|pages=2–3, 45–49, 260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asceticism]] is a major monastic virtue in Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|authorlink=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt6-YXE2aUwC|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-26606-2|pages=163–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain texts such as the ''[[Tattvartha Sutra]]'' state that right faith, right knowledge and right conduct is the path to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Natubhai Shah|title=Jainism: The World of Conquerors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLNQKGcDIhsC&amp;pg=PA90|year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1938-2|pages=90–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two major subtraditions: Digambara and Svetambara, along with several more minor traditions such as Terapanthis.

====Buddhist philosophy====
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist ethics}}
[[File:Monks debating at Sera monastery, 2013.webm|thumb|Monks debating at [[Sera monastery]], Tibet, 2013.]]
[[Buddhist philosophy]] begins with the thought of [[Gautama Buddha]] (fl. between sixth and fourth centuries BCE) and is preserved in the [[Buddhist texts#Texts of the Early schools|early Buddhist texts]]. It originated in India and later spread to [[East Asia]], [[Tibet]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]], developing syncretic traditions in these regions. The Buddhist philosophy is traditionally classified into four schools, states Karl Potter – the editor of ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies''. These are the Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, Yogacara (or Vijnanavada), and Madhyamika schools. They contributed to the two major surviving traditions of Buddhism, the Mahayana and the Theravada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karl Potter| title=A Fresh Classification of India’s Philosophical Systems|journal = Journal of Asian Studies|volume=21| issue=1|year=1961| pages=25-32|jstor=2050985}}, Quote: "Within Buddhist philosophy there is also a traditional classification into four schools — Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, Yogacara (or Vijnanavada), and Madhyamika."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahayana form of Buddhist thought is the dominant philosophical tradition in East Asian regions such as [[China]], [[South Korea|Korea]] and [[Japan]]. The Theravada form is dominant in Southeast Asian countries such as [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]]. Buddhist philosophy incorporates epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and psychology to end rebirth and associated [[dukkha]]. Key innovative concepts include the [[Four Noble Truths]], [[Anatta]] (not-self), [[Anicca]] (impermanence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ| year=2006| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, '''Quote:''' "All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E. Buswell Jr.|author2=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXN2AAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-4805-8|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Buddhist philosophical traditions developed complex phenomenological psychologies termed '[[Abhidharma]]'. [[Mahayana]] philosophers such as [[Nagarjuna]] and [[Vasubandhu]] developed the theories of [[Shunyata]] (emptiness of all phenomena) and Vijnapti-matra (appearance only), a form of phenomenology or [[transcendental idealism]]. The [[Dignāga]] school of [[Pramāṇa]] promoted a complex form of [[epistemology]] and [[Buddhist logic]]. After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the [[Tibetan Buddhist]], [[East Asian Buddhist]] and [[Theravada Buddhist]] traditions.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The six are listed in three pairs: Samkhya-Yoga, Vedanta-Mimamsa, Nyaya-Vaisheshika."&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedas as a knowledge source were interpreted differently by these six schools of Hindu philosophy, with varying degrees of overlap. They represent a "collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection", according to Chadha.&lt;ref&gt;M Chadha (2015), The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion (Editor: Graham Oppy), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1844658312}}, pages 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; They also reflect a tolerance for a diversity of philosophical interpretations within Hinduism while sharing the same foundation.&lt;ref name="Sharma1990p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=A Hindu Perspective on the Philosophy of Religion|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jKewCwAAQBAJ|year=1990|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-20797-8|pages=1–2}}, Quote: "The attitude towards the existence of God varies within the Hindu religious tradition.

Some of the earliest surviving Hindu mystical and philosophical texts are the [[Upanishads]] of the [[Vedic period#Later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE)|later Vedic period]] (1000–500 BCE).

It is certainly its most distinct, as has been pointed out by G.P. Malalasekera: "In its denial of any real permanent Soul or Self, Buddhism stands alone." A similar modern Sinhalese perspective has been expressed by Walpola Rahula: "Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence of such a Soul, Self or Ātman." The "no Self" or "no soul" doctrine (Sanskrit: anātman; Pāli: anattan) is particularly notable for its widespread acceptance and historical endurance. It was a standard belief of virtually all the ancient schools of Indian Buddhism (the notable exception being the Pudgalavādins), and has persisted without change into the modern era. [...] both views are mirrored by the modern Theravādin perspective of Mahasi Sayadaw that "there is no person or soul" and the modern Mahāyāna view of the fourteenth Dalai Lama that "[t]he Buddha taught that … our belief in an independent self is the root cause of all suffering".&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the teachings and enlightenment of [[Gautama Buddha]].

East Asian philosophical thought began in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] begins during the [[Western Zhou]] Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" flourished (6th century to 221 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Garfield  (Editor), Edelglass (Editor); ''The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy'', Chinese philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pe"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ebrey |first=Patricia|year=2010 |page= 42|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Daoism]] as well as numerous other less influential schools. These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such  [[Tao]], [[Yin and yang]], [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]] and [[Li (Confucianism)|Li]] which, along with [[Chinese Buddhism]], directly influenced [[Korean philosophy]], [[Vietnamese philosophy]] and [[Japanese philosophy]] (which also includes the native [[Shinto]] tradition). Buddhism began arriving in China during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), through a [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|gradual Silk road transmission]] and through native influences developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/[[Zen]]) which spread throughout the [[East Asian cultural sphere]]. During later Chinese dynasties like the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean [[Joseon dynasty]] (1392–1897) a resurgent [[Neo-Confucianism]] led by thinkers such as [[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought, and was promoted by the imperial state.

In the Modern era, Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophy. [[Chinese Marxist philosophy]] developed under the influence of [[Mao Zedong]], while a Chinese pragmatism under [[Hu Shih]] and [[New Confucianism]]'s rise was influenced by [[Xiong Shili]]. Modern Japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong Western influences such as the study of Western Sciences ([[Rangaku]]) and the modernist [[Meirokusha]] intellectual society which drew from European enlightenment thought. The 20th century saw the rise of [[State Shinto]] and also [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|Japanese nationalism]]. The [[Kyoto School]], an influential and unique Japanese philosophical school developed from Western phenomenology and Medieval Japanese Buddhist philosophy such as that of [[Dogen]].

===African philosophy===
{{Main|African philosophy}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Frantz Fanon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Frantz Fanon]].]] --&gt;
African philosophy is philosophy produced by [[African people]], philosophy that presents African worldviews, ideas and themes, or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods. Modern African thought has been occupied with [[Ethnophilosophy]], with defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be [[African people|African]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce B. Janz, Philosophy in an African Place (2009), pp. 74–79, Plymouth, UK: Lexington Books, https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0739136682&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, [[Ethiopian philosophy]] developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]]. Another early African philosopher was [[Anton Wilhelm Amo]] (c. 1703–1759) who became a respected philosopher in Germany. Distinct African philosophical ideas include [[Ujamaa]], the Bantu idea of [[Bantu Philosophy|'Force']], [[Négritude]], [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]]. Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of [[Africana philosophy]], the philosophical literature of the [[African diaspora]] which includes currents such as [[black existentialism]] by [[African-Americans]]. Modern African thinkers have been influenced by [[Marxism]], [[African-American literature]], [[Critical theory]], [[Critical race theory]], [[Postcolonialism]] and [[Feminism]].

===Indigenous American philosophy===
{{Main|Indigenous American philosophy}}
[[File:1479 Stein der fünften Sonne, sog. Aztekenkalender, Ollin Tonatiuh anagoria.JPG|thumb|The Aztec [[Aztec calendar stone|Sun Stone]], also known as the Aztec Calendar Stone, at [[National Museum of Anthropology]], [[Mexico City]].]]
Indigenous American philosophy is the philosophy of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas]]. There is a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among these different American cultures. Among some of the [[Native Americans in the United States]] there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the "Great Mystery" ([[Siouan]]: [[Wakan Tanka]], [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]: [[Gitche Manitou]]). Another widely shared concept was that of [[Orenda]] or "spiritual power". According to Peter M. Whiteley, for the Native Americans, "Mind is critically informed by transcendental experience (dreams, visions and so on) as well as by reason."&lt;ref name="rep.routledge.com"&gt;Whiteley; Native American philosophy, https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/native-american-philosophy/v-1&lt;/ref&gt; The practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed [[Shamanism]]. Another feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants.&lt;ref name="rep.routledge.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierotti, Raymond; Communities as both Ecological and Social entities in Native American thought, http://www.se.edu/nas/files/2013/03/5thNAScommunities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mesoamerica]], [[Aztec philosophy]] was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called [[Tlamatini]] ('those who know something') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OI9J7R-R1awC&amp;q=120#v=onepage&amp;q=Tlamatini&amp;f=false |title=Use of "Tlamatini" in ''Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind – Miguel León Portilla'' |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its ideas are preserved in various [[Aztec codices]]. The Aztec worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called [[Ometeotl]] which can be translated as "Dual Cosmic Energy" and sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing, "slippery" world. The theory of Teotl can be seen as a form of [[Pantheism]].&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;IEP, Aztec Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/&lt;/ref&gt; Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics, epistemology, values, and aesthetics. Aztec ethics was focused on seeking ''tlamatiliztli'' (knowledge, wisdom) which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the Nahua proverb "the middle good is necessary".&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

The [[Inca civilization]] also had an elite class of philosopher-scholars termed the Amawtakuna who were important in the [[Inca education]] system as teachers of religion, tradition, history and ethics. Key concepts of Andean thought are [[Yanantin]] and [[Yanantin#Masintin|Masintin]] which involve a theory of “complementary opposites” that sees polarities (such as male/female, dark/light) as interdependent parts of a harmonious whole.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Hillary S.; Yanantin and Masintin in the Andean World: Complementary Dualism in Modern Peru Hardcover – March 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories ==
Philosophical questions can be grouped into categories. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions. The groupings also make philosophy easier for students to approach. Students can learn the basic principles involved in one aspect of the field without being overwhelmed with the entire set of philosophical theories.

Various sources present different categorical schemes. The categories adopted in this article aim for breadth and simplicity.

These five major branches can be separated into sub-branches and each sub-branch contains many specific fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consc.net/taxonomy.html|title=A Taxonomy of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]
* [[Value theory]]
* Science, [[logic]] and mathematics
* History of Western philosophy{{sfn|Kenny|2012}}
* Philosophical traditions

These divisions are neither exhaustive, nor mutually exclusive. (A philosopher might specialize in [[Kant]]ian epistemology, or [[Plato]]nic aesthetics, or modern political philosophy.) Furthermore, these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science, religion or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/religion-science/|title=Religion and Science|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|date=2014|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysics ===
{{Main|Metaphysics}}

Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of [[reality]], such as [[existence]], [[time]], [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and their [[Property (philosophy)|properties]], wholes and their parts, events, processes and [[Causality|causation]] and the relationship between [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]]. Metaphysics includes [[cosmology]], the study of the [[world]] in its entirety and [[ontology]], the study of [[being]].

A major point of debate is between [[Philosophical realism|realism]], which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception and [[idealism]], which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial. Metaphysics deals with the topic of [[Personal identity|identity]]. [[Essence]] is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]] is a property that the object has, without which the object can still retain its identity. [[Particular]]s are objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to [[abstract object]]s, such as numbers, and [[universals]], which are properties held by multiple particulars, such as redness or a gender. The type of existence, if any, of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate.

=== Epistemology ===
{{Main|Epistemology}}
[[File:Dignaga.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Dignaga]] founded a school of [[Buddhist logic|Buddhist epistemology and logic]].]]
Epistemology is the study of knowledge (Greek episteme).&lt;ref name="WebsterRUD"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = G &amp; C. Merriam Co. |author1-link = Merriam-Webster |title = Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |edition = 1913 |editors = Noah Porter |publisher = G &amp; C. Merriam Co. |year = 1913 |page = 501 |url = http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=epistemology&amp;use1913=on |accessdate = 13 May 2012 |quote = E*pis`te*mol"o*gy (?), n. [Gr. knowledge + -logy.] The theory or science of the method or grounds of knowledge. |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131015165808/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=epistemology&amp;use1913=on |archivedate = 15 October 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epistemologists study the putative sources of knowledge, including intuition, a priori reason, memory, perceptual knowledge, self-knowledge and testimony. They also ask: What is [[truth]]? Is knowledge justified true belief? Are any beliefs [[Theory of justification|justified]]? Putative knowledge includes propositional knowledge (knowledge that something is the case), know-how (knowledge of how to do something) and acquaintance (familiarity with someone or something). Epistemologists examine these and ask whether knowledge is really possible.

[[Philosophical skepticism|Skepticism]] is the position which doubts claims to knowledge. The [[regress argument]], a fundamental problem in epistemology, occurs when, in order to completely prove any statement, its justification itself needs to be supported by another justification. This chain can go on forever, called [[infinitism]], it can eventually rely on [[basic beliefs]] that are left unproven, called [[foundationalism]], or it can go in a circle so that a statement is included in its own chain of justification, called [[coherentism]].

[[Rationalism]] is the emphasis on reasoning as a source of knowledge. It is associated with [[a priori knowledge]], which is independent of experience, such as math and logical deduction. [[Empiricism]] is the emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge.

Among the numerous topics within metaphysics and epistemology, broadly construed are:
* [[Philosophy of language]] explores the nature, the origins and the use of language.
* [[Philosophy of mind]] explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body. It is typified by disputes between [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[materialism]]. In recent years this branch has become related to [[cognitive science]].
* [[Human nature|Philosophy of human nature]] analyzes the unique characteristics of human beings, such as rationality, politics and culture.
* [[Metaphilosophy]] explores the aims of philosophy, its boundaries and its methods.

=== Value theory ===
Value theory (or [[axiology]]) is the major branch of philosophy that addresses topics such as goodness, beauty and justice. Value theory includes ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, feminist philosophy, philosophy of law and more.

==== Ethics ====
{{Main|Ethics}}
[[File:BeijingConfuciusTemple9.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|The [[Beijing]] [[Guozijian (Beijing)|imperial college]] was an intellectual center for Confucian ethics and classics during the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties.]]
Ethics, or "moral philosophy", studies and considers what is good and bad [[Action (philosophy)|conduct]], right and [[wrong]] [[values (philosophy)|values]], and [[good and evil]]. Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of [[morality]]. It also includes [[Meta-analysis|meta-investigations]] about whether a best way to live or related standards exists. The main branches of ethics are [[normative ethics]], [[meta-ethics]]  and [[applied ethics]].

A major area of debate involves [[consequentialism]], in which actions are judged by the potential results of the act, such as to maximize happiness, called [[utilitarianism]], and [[deontology]], in which actions are judged by how they adhere to principles, irrespective of negative ends.

==== Aesthetics ====
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Aesthetics is the "critical reflection on art, culture and [[nature]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1998) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlisna.org/artdoc/vol18/iss2/01.pdf Review] by Tom Riedel ([[Regis University]])&lt;/ref&gt; It addresses the nature of [[art]], [[beauty]] and [[Taste (sociology)|taste]], enjoyment, emotional values, perception and with the creation and appreciation of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetic|title=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetics Definition 1 of ''aesthetics''] from the [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] Online.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more precisely defined as the study of [[Senses|sensory]] or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called [[judgment]]s of [[Feeling|sentiment]] and taste.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Nick. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ Aesthetic Judgment]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 02-28-2003/10-22-2007. Retrieved 24 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Its major divisions are art theory, [[literary theory]], [[film theory]] and [[music theory]]. An example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the [[Cubist]] aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/aesthetic|title=aesthetic – definition of aesthetic in English from the Oxford dictionary|website=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[philosophy of film]] analyzes films and filmmakers for their philosophical content and explores film (images, cinema, etc.) as a medium for philosophical reflection and expression.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==== Political philosophy ====
{{Main|Political philosophy}}
[[File:Thomas_Hobbes_(portrait).jpg|left|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]]]]

Political philosophy is the study of [[government]] and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the [[State (polity)|state]]. It includes questions about justice, law, property and the rights and obligations of the citizen. Politics and ethics are traditionally linked subjects, as both discuss the question of how people should live together.

Other branches of value theory:
* [[Philosophy of law]] (often called [[jurisprudence]]) explores the varying theories explaining the nature and interpretation of laws.
* [[Philosophy of education]] analyzes the definition and content of education, as well as the goals and challenges of educators.
* [[Feminist philosophy]] explores questions surrounding gender, sexuality and the body including the nature of [[feminism]] itself as a social and philosophical movement.
* [[Philosophy of sport]] analyzes sports, games and other forms of play as sociological and uniquely human activities.

=== Logic, science and mathematics ===
Many academic disciplines generated philosophical inquiry. The relationship between "X" and the "philosophy of X" is debated. [[Richard Feynman]] argued that the philosophy of a topic is irrelevant to its primary study, saying that "[[philosophy of science]] is as useful to scientists as [[ornithology]] is to birds." [[Curtis White (author)|Curtis White]], by contrast, argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities, sciences and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Science Delusion: Asking the Big Questions in a Culture of Easy Answers|last=White|first=Curtis|date=2014|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=e2mPgcXPNNIC}}|publisher=Melville House|isbn=9781612193908|location=Brooklyn, NY|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The topics of philosophy of science are [[number]]s, symbols and the formal methods of reasoning as employed in the [[social science]]s and [[natural sciences]].

==== Logic ====
{{Main|Logic}}Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. An argument is "''a'' ''connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition''." The connected series of statements are "[[premise]]s" and the proposition is the conclusion. For example:
# All humans are mortal. (premise)
# Socrates is a human. (premise)
# Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion)
[[Deductive reasoning]] is when, given certain premises, conclusions are [[Logical consequence|unavoidably implied]]. [[Rules of inference]] are used to infer conclusions such as, [[modus ponens]], where given “A” and “If A then B”, then “B” must be concluded.

Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carnap|first=Rudolf|date=1953|title="Inductive Logic and Science"|jstor=20023651|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume=80|issue=3|pages=189–197|doi=10.2307/20023651|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; social sciences and humanities disciplines, logic became a [[formal science]]. Sub-fields include [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophical logic]], [[Modal logic]], [[computational logic]] and [[non-classical logic]]s. A major question in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] is whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered, called mathematical realism, or invented, called mathematical antirealism.

==== Philosophy of science ====
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
This branch explores the foundations, methods, history, implications and purpose of science. Many of its sub-divisions correspond to a specific branch of science. For example, [[philosophy of biology]] deals specifically with the metaphysical, epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences. The [[philosophy of mathematics]] studies the philosophical assumptions, foundations and implications of mathematics.

=== History of philosophy ===
{{See also|Metaphilosophy|History of ethics}}
{{further|Philosophical progress|List of years in philosophy}}
Some philosophers specialize in one or more historical periods. The history of philosophy (study of a specific period, individual or school) is related to but not the same as the [[philosophy of history]] (the theoretical aspect of history, which deals with questions such as the nature of historical evidence and the possibility of objectivity).

Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'' influenced many philosophers to interpret truth in light of history, a view called [[historicism]].

=== Philosophy of religion ===
{{Main|Philosophy of religion}}

Philosophy of religion deals with questions that involve [[religion]] and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective (as opposed to [[theology]] which begins from religious convinctions).&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590855/theology/14945/Relationship-to-philosophy Theology; Relationship of theology to the history of religions and philosophy; Relationship to philosophy.]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper, the idea of a separate field only arose in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, WJ., [https://books.google.com/books?id=GbcuCf9TlDgC&amp;dq=oxford+handbook+Philosophy+religion&amp;q=%22come+into+general%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22come%20into%20general%22&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion''], Oxford Handbooks Online, 2004, p. 3. "The expression “philosophy of religion” did not come into general use until the nineteenth century, when it was employed to refer to the articulation and criticism of humanity's religious consciousness and its cultural expressions in thought, language, feeling, and practice."&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues include the [[existence of God]], the relationship between reason and [[faith]], questions of [[religious epistemology]], the [[relationship between religion and science]], how to interpret [[religious experiences]], questions about the possibility of an [[afterlife]], the [[problem of religious language]] and the existence of [[souls]] and responses to [[religious pluralism]] and diversity.

=== Philosophical schools ===
Some philosophers specialize in one or more of the major philosophical schools, such as [[Continental philosophy]], [[Analytical philosophy]], [[Thomism]], [[Asian philosophy]] or [[African philosophy]].

== Other approaches ==
A variety of other academic and non-academic approaches have been explored.

=== Applied philosophy {{anchor|Applied philosophy}} ===
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of academic disciplines]] and target of redirect [[Applied philosophy]] --&gt;
[[File:Martin Luther King Jr NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Martin Luther King Jr]] ]]
The ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs. [[Richard M. Weaver|Weaver]] argued that ideas have consequences. Philosophy yields applications such as those in [[ethics]] – [[applied ethics]] in particular – and [[political philosophy]]. The political and economic philosophies of [[Confucius]], [[Sun Tzu]], [[Chanakya]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Ibn Rushd]], [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Adam Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions. Progressive education as championed by [[John Dewey|Dewey]] had a profound impact on 20th-century US educational practices. Descendants of this movement include efforts in [[philosophy for children]], which are part of [[philosophy education]]. [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]]'s political [[philosophy of war]] has had a profound effect on [[Public administration|statecraft]], [[international politics]] and [[military strategy]] in the 20th century, especially around [[World War II]]. Logic is important in [[mathematics]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering]].

Other important applications can be found in [[epistemology]], which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge, sound evidence and justified belief (important in [[law]], [[economics]], [[decision theory]] and a number of other disciplines). The [[philosophy of science]] discusses the underpinnings of the [[scientific method]] and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation. Philosophy thus has fundamental implications for science as a whole. For example, the strictly empirical approach of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment. [[Deep ecology]] and [[animal rights]] examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also. [[Aesthetics]] can help to interpret discussions of [[music]], [[literature]], the [[plastic arts]] and the whole artistic dimension of life. In general, the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields.

Some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers, typically by working as [[professor]]s who teach, research and write in academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/where-can-philosophy-take-me|title=Where Can Philosophy Take Me? {{!}} Philosophy|website=philosophy.as.uky.edu|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law, journalism, religion, sciences, politics, business, or various arts.&lt;ref name="whystudyphilosophy.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/26/business/philosophers-find-the-degree-pays-off-in-life-and-in-work.html|title=Philosophers Find the Degree Pays Off in Life And in Work|last=Cropper|first=Carol Marie|date=1997-12-26|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, public figures who have degrees in philosophy include comedians [[Steve Martin]] and [[Ricky Gervais]], filmmaker [[Terrence Malick]], [[Pope John Paul II]], Wikipedia co-founder [[Larry Sanger]], technology entrepreneur [[Peter Thiel]], Supreme Court Justice [[Stephen Breyer|Stephen Bryer]] and vice presidential candidate [[Carly Fiorina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mansfield.edu/philosophy/famous-philosophy-majors.cfm|title=Famous Philosophy Majors {{!}} Mansfield University|last=Marketing|first=Mansfield University Department of|website=www.mansfield.edu|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailynous.com/2014/12/08/famous-philosophy-majors-poster/|title=Famous Philosophy Majors Poster (updated with new link)|last=W|first=Justin|date=2014-12-08|website=Daily Nous|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent efforts to avail the general public to the work and relevance of philosophers include the million-dollar [[Berggruen Prize for Philosophy|Berggruen Prize]], first awarded to [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/books/canadian-philosopher-wins-1-million-prize.html|title=Canadian Philosopher Wins $1 Million Prize|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|date=October 4, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional==
Germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy. The [[doctorate of philosophy|doctorate of philosophy (PhD)]] developed in Germany as the terminal Teacher's credential in the mid 17th century.&lt;ref name=EWG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |title=Erhard-Weigel-Gesellschaft: Biographie Weigels |website=Erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de |date= |accessdate=2016-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124147/http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |archivedate=2016-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1817, Hegel was the first philosopher to be appointed Professor by the State, namely by the Prussian Minister of Education, as an effect of Napoleonic reform in Prussia. In the United States, the professionalisation grew out of reforms to the American higher-education system largely based on the German model.

Within the last century, philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities, like other academic disciplines. Accordingly, it has become less general and more specialized. In the view of one prominent recent historian: "Philosophy has become a highly organized discipline, done by specialists primarily for other specialists. The number of philosophers has exploded, the volume of publication has swelled, and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied. Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind, something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields."&lt;ref name="philosophical16"/&gt; Some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/socrates-tenured|title=Socrates Tenured – Rowman &amp; Littlefield International|website=www.rowmaninternational.com|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical, peer-reviewed journals. While it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious, political or philosophical views that they consider their "philosophy", these views are rarely informed by or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today. Furthermore, unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books, magazines, and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace, works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare. Philosopher [[Michael Sandel]]'s book ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?'' and [[Harry Frankfurt]]'s ''[[On Bullshit]]'' are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of non-philosophers. Both works became '''New York Times'' best sellers.

==Non-professional==
Many inquiries outside of academia are philosophical in the broad sense. Novelists, playwrights, filmmakers, and musicians, as well as scientists and others engage in recognizably philosophical activity.

[[Ayn Rand]] is the foremost example of an intellectual working contemporaneously with contemporary philosophy but whose contributions were not made within the professional discipline of "philosophy": "For all her [Ayn Rand's] popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact."[15]

Also working from outside the profession were philosophers such as [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] (''Die reine und die praktische Philosophie. Drei Vorträge zur philosophischen'' Praxis, 1983) and [[Michel Weber]] (see his ''Épreuve de la philosophie'', 2008) who have proposed since the 1980s various forms of philosophical counseling claiming to bring Socratic dialogues back to life in a quasi-psychotherapeutic framework.

[[Pierre Hadot]] is famous for his analysis on the conception of philosophy during Greco-Roman antiquity. Hadot identified and analyzed the "spiritual exercises" used in ancient philosophy (influencing Michel Foucault's interest in such practices in the second and third volumes of his History of Sexuality). By "spiritual exercises" Hadot means "practices ... intended to effect a modification and a transformation in the subjects who practice them.[6] The philosophy teacher's discourse could be presented in such a way that the disciple, as auditor, reader, or interlocutor, could make spiritual progress and transform himself within."[7] Hadot shows that the key to understanding the original philosophical impulse is to be found in Socrates. What characterizes Socratic therapy above all is the importance given to living contact between human beings. Hadot's recurring theme is that philosophy in antiquity was characterized by a series of spiritual exercises intended to transform the perception, and therefore the being, of those who practice it; that philosophy is best pursued in real conversation and not through written texts and lectures; and that philosophy, as it is taught in universities today, is for the most part a distortion of its original, therapeutic impulse. He brings these concerns together in ''What Is Ancient Philosophy?'',[7] which has been critically reviewed.[8]

==Role of women==
{{Main|Women in philosophy}}
[[File:Langer.Susanne.foto 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|American philosopher of mind and philosopher of art [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985).]]
Although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse, women have engaged in philosophy throughout history. [[Women in philosophy|Women philosophers]] have contributed since ancient times–notably [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active c. 325 BCE) and [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BCE). More were accepted during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]] and [[Modern philosophy|modern]] eras, but no women philosophers became part the [[Western canon]] until the 20th and 21st century, when some sources indicate that [[Susanne Langer]], [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] entered the canon.&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane. Eight women philosophers: theory, politics, and feminism. University of Illinois Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.hipporeads.com/why-i-left-academia-philosophys-homogeneity-needs-rethinking/#|title=Why I Left Academia: Philosophy's Homogeneity Needs Rethinking – Hippo Reads|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609133754/http://read.hipporeads.com/why-i-left-academia-philosophys-homogeneity-needs-rethinking/|archivedate=9 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], producing more female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy, and that philosophy is one of the least gender-proportionate fields in the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173; 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93). See also "Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities." National Center For Education Statistics, E.D. Tabs, July 1997. U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 97-973;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-93).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline's own long history of [[misogyny]] and [[sexual harassment]]" of women students and professors.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/19/unofficial-internet-campaign-outs-professor-alleged-sexual-harassment-attempted|title=Unofficial Internet campaign outs professor for alleged sexual harassment, attempted assault|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Sheffield]] philosophy professor [[Jennifer Saul]] stated in 2015 that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jan/05/philosophy-is-for-posh-white-boys-with-trust-funds-why-are-there-so-few-women|title=Philosophy is for posh, white boys with trust funds' – why are there so few women?|first1=Rebecca|last1=Ratcliffe|first2=Claire|last2=Shaw|date=5 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] noted a gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis |publisher=National Association of Scholars}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Neven |last1=Sesardic |first2=Rafael |last2=De Clercq |title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis |doi= 10.1007/s12129-014-9464-x|journal=Academic Questions|volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=461 |year=2014 |url=http://www.ln.edu.hk/philoso/staff/sesardic/WIP-AQ.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males – the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan Thompson suggests that discrimination, differences in abilities, grade differences and the lack of role models in philosophy could be potential factors for the gender gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Morgan|date=2017-03-01|title=Explanations of the gender gap in philosophy|journal=Philosophy Compass|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=n/a|doi=10.1111/phc3.12406|issn=1747-9991}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|first=Jennifer M.|last=Saul|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
In 2000, the [[Open Court Publishing Company]] began publishing a series of books on philosophy and [[popular culture]]. Each book consists of essays written by philosophers for general readers. The books "explore the meanings, concepts and puzzles within television shows, movies, music and other icons of popular culture"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opencourtbooks.com/categories/pcp.htm|title=Popular Culture and Philosophy|website=www.opencourtbooks.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzing topics such as the TV shows ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies and related media and new technological developments such as the [[iPod]] and [[Facebook]]. Their most recent publication ({{As of|2016|lc=y}}) is titled ''Louis C.K. and Philosophy''; its subject is the comedian [[Louis C.K.]].

''[[The Matrix]]'' makes numerous references to philosophy including [[Buddhism]], [[Vedanta]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Messianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]. The film's premise resembles [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave|Allegory of the cave]], Descartes's [[evil demon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reflections on the [[Phenomenon]] versus the [[Noumenon|Ding an sich]], [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'s "[[Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly]]", Marxist social theory and the [[brain in a vat]] thought experiment. Many references to [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]]'s ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' appear in the film, although Baudrillard himself considered this a misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |title=IJBS |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021010544/http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |archivedate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends.

'''Philosophy of Architecture''' is a branch of [[philosophy of art]], dealing with aesthetic value of [[architecture]], its [[semantics]] and relations with development of [[culture]].

==History ==

=== Early history ===

[[Plato]], whose influence on architecture is widely documented (e.g., 'idealism', 'neo-Platonic' architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendrix | first=John Shannon | authorlink=John Shannon Hendrix | date=1999 | title=Neoplatonic Philosophy and Roman Baroque Architecture | journal=The European Studies Journal | publisher=University of Northern Iowa | volume=16 | issue=1 |pages=31–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;), may be counted as part of a classical geometric model of cosmology, the popularity of which could be attributed to earlier thinkers such as [[Pythagoras]]. In early history, philosophers distinguished architecture ('technion') from building ('demiorgos'), attributing the former to mental traits, and the latter to the divine or natural. It was only with Socratic irony that the name craftsman could become representative of a religious deity. The presence of some degree of formalism ala Platonism continues to be an important trait in distinguishing one architectural style from another, and thus in distinguishing the philosophy of a style.

Due to the nature of critique, the philosophy of architecture is an outgrowth of the [[philosophy of art]], which began to be expressed in books on architecture and history of architecture during the latter half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29"&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Harries K. | title= Philosophy and the Task of Architecture | journal=Journal of Architectural Education | volume=40 | issue=2 | date=Winter 1987 | pages=29 | doi=10.2307/1424928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, largely because of its reliance on technology and engineering, architecture was seen as incompatible, or beneath, the proper subject areas of classical aesthetics as delimited by, notably, [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], with their ideal of "pure art."&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29" /&gt;

=== Modern period ===

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb | Panopticon. Drawing by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in 1791.]]
As it was noted by [[Michel Foucault]], the architecture is able to set the life of society, and therefore it is particularly important for understanding of the person's values and culture. In "[[Discipline and Punish]]" Foucault analized contemporary culture through architecture project of principally new prison [[Panopticon]]. The point of this project by [[Jeremy Bentham]] was to create a special transparent environment for prisoners, where everyone would be under constant surveillance. Although the project was not realized, Bentham's thought deeply influenced ideology of prisons, changing social practices of punishment. Simultaneously with its main conclusions Foucault reached other goal - his instrumental use of architecture in cultural studies showed the potential of this philosophical theme.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

However, philosophy of architecture as a full-fledged part of the Philosophy of Art, would not have been possible without the [[Avant-garde]]`s shift of the aesthetic paradigm. Art, set in the conditions of [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|mechanical reproduction of the image]], was forced to look for new ways. Around the same time architectural styles of [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] find way to justify new, totally engineering aesthetics. Side of the architecture, which had been considered a shame (as a sign of its connection with the pragmatic needs of man and society), became a major advantage, central part of new system of aesthetic values. [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] set aesthetic, full of mechanized, slaughtered, brutal forms, what was very close to the same engineering ideal. All this created more than favorable environment to change status of architecture in our system of art, as well as our understanding of art by itself.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Postmodernism ===
[[File:Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village crop.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photography "[[Stuyvesant Town - Peter Cooper Village]]," according to Martin R.&lt;ref name="Martin R."&gt;Martin R. "Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern." ''Grey Room,'' No. 22 (Winter, 2006), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; it is an architectural work, which may serve as one of the first manifestations of postmodernism]]
Architecture assumed much more significant role after establishing of the phenomenon of [[Postmodernism]]. According to R. Martin "it remains surprising how many influential accounts of cultural postmodernism make reference to architecture."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt;
Some scholars go so far as to claim that the entire post-modernism comes from the practice of architecture, and the rejection of "[[Art Nouveau|style of Modern]]" as an architectural style, and by so architects terminologically formulated postmodernism. Thus, F. Jameson writes that "it is in the realm of architecture, however, that modifications in aesthetic production are most dramatically visible, and that their theoretical problems have been most centrally raised and articulated (...) it was indeed from architectural debates that my own conception of post-modernism (...) initially began to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As it was noted by researchers, "Barthes and Eco, taking their cue from Russian Formalism, see norm breaking as the mark of the aesthetic (sc., the aesthetic code). Art is characteristically inventive in its capacity to have signs do duty as signifier of further meanings in a potentially endless play upon convention as well as within it or on its margin."&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"&gt;Donougho M. The Language of Architecture // Journal of Aesthetic Education, Vol. 21, No. 3 (Autumn, 1987), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; So important to postmodern writers like [[Barthes, Roland|R. Bart]] and [[Eco, Umberto|U. Eco]], saw architecture as a source of revolutionary innovations in art.&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"/&gt;
[[File:The Luxor From Airport.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photo of casino "Luxor", an example of architecture of "Las Vegas", which formed the basis for post-modernist manifesto of [[Robert Venturi]] and has played a key role in the development of post-modernism according to F. Jameson]]F. Jameson believes that there is a special relationship between postmodernism and American architecture, in which the birth of a national architecture coincided, in his opinion, with the emergence of the terminology or even the reality of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all researchers agree with his post-modern "architectural origins," so [[Andreas Huyssen]], suggests that the conceptual frame of postmodernism has been defined within certain movements of literature. However, this researcher also notes the special role of architecture in the development of post-modernism. Martin describes, that "Huyssen credits architecture with helping to disseminate the term postmodernism, originally from literature, into the expanded aesthetic sphere during the 1970s."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] contends that postmodern architects have nothing in common with true Postmodernism &lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; and, as Lyotard states it in his article, ''Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism?'': "under the name of postmodernism, architects are getting rid of the Bauhaus project, throwing out the baby of experimentation with the bathwater of functionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard J.-F. Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism? // Lyotard J.-F. The Posmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. 1984. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special figure for the philosophy of architecture can be considered the architect [[Robert Venturi]], whose books may have played a no lesser role in the development of [[postmodernism]], than his stylistic experiments in architecture. R. Venturi first lead attention of architects to [[pop-art]]. In his rejection of architectural modernism Venturi  gave rise to the new cultural setting. By this Venturi showed a deep connection between civilization and architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin R. Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern // Grey Room, No. 22 (Winter, 2006), pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wittgenstein and philosophy of architecture ==
[[File:Wittgenstein haus.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo of Wittgenstein House]]
The [[Wittgenstein House]] is considered one of the most important examples of interactions between philosophy and architecture. Built by renowned [[Austria]]n philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], the house has been the subject of extensive research about the relationship between its stylistic features, Wittgenstein's personality, and his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb G.

The '''philosophy of business''' considers the fundamental principles that underlie the formation and operation of a [[business enterprise]]; the nature and purpose of a [[business]], and the [[moral obligation]]s that pertain to it.

== Influence ==

[[Philipp Blom]] summarises the development and impact of business-centric ideas in society prior to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008 | global financial crisis of 2008]]:

The '''philosophy of copyright''' considers philosophical issues linked to [[copyright]] [[policy]], and other [[jurisprudence|jurisprudential]] problems that arise in legal systems' interpretation and application of copyright law.

One debate concerns the purpose of copyright.  Some take the approach of looking for coherent ''justifications'' of established copyright systems, while others start with general ethical theories, such as [[utilitarianism]] and try to analyse policy through that lens.  Another approach denies the meaningfulness of any ethical justification for existing copyright law, viewing it simply as a result (and perhaps an undesirable result) of political processes.

Another widely debated issue is the relationship between [[copyrights]] and other forms of "[[intellectual property]]", and material property.  Most scholars of copyright agree that it can be called a kind of [[property]], because it involves the [[exclusive right|exclusion]] of others from something.  But there is disagreement about the extent to which that fact should allow the transportation of other beliefs and intuitions about material possessions.

There are many other [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions which arise in the jurisprudence of copyright.  They include such problems as determining when one work is "derived" from another, or deciding when information has been placed in a "tangible" or "material" form.

==Justifications for copyright==

Legal scholars often approach copyright in search of a coherent ethical justification for its existence and character.  This approach may seem to be backwards—it might make more sense to start with an objective and then examine the law against it—but it is widely practised.  Thus, the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] or ethical theories that might naively be regarded as tests for copyright law to pass are often called "justifications" of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justifications for copyright can generally be approximated into two groups: deontological or consequentialist. Deontological justifications for copyright seek to justify copyright as a matter of rights or duty; they seek to assert a justification for copyright (or intellectual property more generally) on the basis that it is morally correct to do so. Contrariwise, consequentialist theories of copyright seek to justify or criticise copyright protection based on the consequences of that protection, by asserting or providing evidence that the protection of copyright produces some desirable effect. Examples of such theories include incentives theories that view intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivising the creation of new creative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dutfield|first=Graham|last2=Suthersanen|first2=Uma|title=Global intellectual property law|year=2008|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham, UK|isbn=978-1-84720-364-9|pages=51–52, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural rights===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Natural rights]] are linked to the logic{{clarify|date=June 2013}} of [[property]]. [[John Locke]] is often cited as an authority, although it is not clear that Locke actually viewed copyright as a natural right.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} {{citation needed span|text=[[Personality rights]] are the basis of German copyright law.This position regards copyrightable works to be extensions of the author's personality. The author is given certain powers to control those works on account of his or her connection to them.|date=June 2013}}

===Morality===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
Proponents of copyright and patent laws believe that morality supports their stance.

=== Economics ===
{{Disputed section|date=June 2013}}
Many economists{{who|date=June 2013}} believe that, {{citation needed span|text=in the absence of intellectual property protections such as [[copyright]] and [[patents]], various types of intangible assets would be under-produced{{according to whom|date=June 2013}}, because there would be [[free-rider problem|insufficient incentives]] for commercial organisations to produce them.|date=June 2013}}  From this perspective, the objective of [[copyright law]] is primarily to balance the public benefits{{how|date=June 2013}} that can arise from the widespread circulation, use and reuse of a copyright work with the need to provide protection, incentive and reward to the creator or owner of the copyright by granting a limited{{clarify|date=June 2013}} [[monopoly]] to exploit the copyright to that body or individual.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Lilley (July 2006) Inside the Creative Industries - Copyright on the ground, [[ippr]],[http://www.ippr.org.uk/publicationsandreports/publication.asp?id=483] {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}

===Consequentialist theories===
Consequentialist theories of copyright hold that we should have the laws that will produce the 'best' results for society.  The most common consequentialist position is [[utilitarianism]], which defines the 'best' situations to be those in which people are in total as happy or fulfilled as possible.  Economists' analyses of copyright tend to follow this philosophical approach.

A related class of theories is called [[instrumentalism]]; it holds that copyright law must exist for clear, coherent and necessary purposes, without being so strict as to require that it maximise some kind of 'goodness' in its outcome.

Some copyright scholars believe that, regardless of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that without a significant period of legal protection of their future income, many valuable books and artworks would not be created.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; They argue that the public interest is best served by repeated extension of copyright terms to encompass multiple generations beyond the copyright holder's life, as this increases the present value of the copyright, encouraging the creation for new works and making additional investments in older works (for example, the restoration of old movies) economically viable.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{cite journal| author = Scott M. Martin | date = September 24, 2002 | title = The Mythology of the Public Domain: Exploring the Myths Behind Attacks on the Duration of Copyright Protection | journal = Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review | volume = 36| issue = 1| page = 280| publisher = Loyola Law Review| issn = 1533-5860 | url = http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2343&amp;context=llr| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors' heirs continue to profit if copyrights are enforced post-death and this provides a substantial incentive for continued  fresh work even as authors age.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

The modern, market-driven copyright system provides authors with independent financing (through royalties). Without a feasible way to recoup investments of creative time through copyright, there would be little economic incentive to produce and works would need to be motivated by a desire for fame from already affluent authors or those able to obtain patronage (with associated constraints on independence). Proponents of copyright dispute that copyright erodes precepts for creators to be able to build on published expression pointing to concepts such as [[Scènes à faire]] and [[Idea-expression divide]]. Copyright only protects the artist's expression of his/her work and not the ideas, systems, or factual information conveyed in it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus artists are free to get ideas from copyrighted works.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

Defenders of the present system of strong copyrights argue that it has been largely successful in financing the creation and distribution of a wide variety of works, especially those requiring significant labor and capital. Moderate scholars seem to support that view while recognizing the need for exceptions and limitations, such as the [[fair use]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|page=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, a substantial portion of the current U.S. Copyright Act (sections 107–120) is devoted to such exceptions and limitations.

====Consequentialism in the United States====

[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] of the [[United States Constitution]] authorizes [[United States Congress|Congress]] to "''promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries''".

Many authors thought that this wording would actually require U.S. copyright laws to serve the purpose of "promoting the progress of science and useful arts". {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In the US in 2003 controversial changes implemented by the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] extending the length of copyright under [[U.S. copyright law]] by 20 years were challenged in the [[United States Supreme Court]]. However, the Court, in the case called [[Eldred v. Ashcroft]], held, ''inter alia'', that in placing existing and future copyrights in parity in the CTEA, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutional limitations. Other jurisdictions have enacted legislation to provide for similar extensions of the copyright term.

== Opposition to copyright ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Copyright]] --&gt;
{{main article|Anti-copyright}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2008}}
[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Anti-copyright demonstration in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], 2006.]]
Critics of copyright as a whole fall broadly into two categories: Those who assert that the very concept of copyright has never benefited society, and has always served simply to enrich a few at the expense of creativity; and those who assert that the existing copyright regime must be reformed to maintain its relevance in the new [[Information society]]. The [[French copyright law|French ''droit d'auteur'']] ("Rights of the Author"), which influenced the 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]], must also be noted as a significant alternative to the usual Anglo-Saxon concept of copyright.

Among the latter group, there are also some who continue to agree with copyright as a way to grant authors rights, but feel that it "outlives its welcome" by granting copyright for too long (e.g., far beyond the lifetime of the author), and is therefore of little direct benefit to him or her.  The prolongation of copyright term is commonly attributed to effective corporate [[lobbying]], based on a desire for the continuance of a profitable monopoly. In the US, this is often phrased as a conspiracy to 'control the Mouse' (meaning [[Mickey Mouse]], a [[trademark]]ed character controlled by the Disney Company whose early works would have moved into the public domain save for such an extension).

To many critics, the general problem is that the current (international) copyright system undermines its own goal.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The concepts of the [[public domain]] and the intrinsic freedom of information are necessary precepts for creators to be able to build on published expression.  But these are gradually being eroded, as copyright terms are repeatedly extended to last beyond the lifetime of the audience which experienced and knows of the original work.

Another effect of the repeated extension of copyright term is that current authors are shielded from competition from a wide public domain: by the time current works enter the public domain, they will almost always have become obsolete. This reduces the risk of commoditization of topical non-fiction. Out-of-copyright publishing, such as classic literature where margins are very low, generally offers only the best of each genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karjala|first=Dennis|title=About Copyright Term Extension|url=http://www.law.asu.edu/HomePages/Karjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/what.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030827220623/http://www.law.asu.edu/homepages/karjala/opposingcopyrightextension/what.html|archivedate=2003-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Luck|first=Randolph|title=Letter to Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, opposing copyright term extension in the 104th Congress, June 28th 1996|url=http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/letters/Luck%27sMusic01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to current copyright practice also relates to the non-observance of the principal requirement of the original Queen Anne Act, which specified that for a work to obtain copyright a copy had to be deposited in a library of record, so that unlimited copies could be made when the copyright expired. This was observed for many years but was later successfully opposed by the motion picture industry, which refused to provide copies of their films, resulting in the loss of many early films. Civilization experiences a similar loss of ancient documents from being held in private collections until they rot.

The recent success of [[free software]] projects such as [[Linux|GNU/Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and the [[Apache web server]] has demonstrated that quality works can be created even in the absence of a copyright-enforced monopoly rent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.cio.com/consultant/report2214.html&lt;/ref&gt;  These products use copyright to enforce their license terms, which are designed to ensure the free nature of the work, rather than securing exclusive rights for the holder for monetary gain. Such licenses include [[copyleft]], [[free software license|free software]], and [[open source license]]s.

Even in more traditional forms such as prose, some authors, such as [[Cory Doctorow]], retain the copyright to their work but license it for free distribution (for example under a [[Creative Commons license]]).  This has the benefit of providing a structured scheme under which authors can loosen some of the barriers that copyright imposes on others, allowing them to partially contribute the work to the community (in the form of giving a general grant on copying, reproduction, use or adaptation subject to certain conditions) while retaining other exclusive rights they hold in it.

Copyright can also be used to stifle political criticism. For example, in the US the contents of talk shows and similar programs are covered by copyright. [[Robert Greenwald]], a director of ''Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War'' documentary was refused the right to use a clip of a [[George W. Bush]] interview from [[NBC]]'s ''Meet the Press''. Although the fair use provisions of statute and common law may apply in such cases, the risks of loss in court should there be a lawsuit and pressure from insurance companies, who regard use of almost anything (e.g., three words forming the opening of a song,) without permission as too risky, usually precludes use of materials without explicit permission, and so without a license fee.

Copyright is also conceived by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Electronic Frontier Foundation|url=https://www.eff.org/work}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be an artificial barrier in that "expressions" could be freely exchanged between individuals and groups if there were no copyright or other legal restrictions preventing. Such people believe that as the [[State (polity)|state]] does not necessarily possess the [[moral authority]] to enact copyright laws, individuals may vary in their observation of such laws. Others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Copyright Alliance|url=http://www.copyrightalliance.org/issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Motion Picture Association of America|url=http://www.mpaa.org/contentprotection/copyright-info}}&lt;/ref&gt; disagree, believing that copyright (which in the United States system, for instance, arises from provisions in the U.S. Constitution), has made and continues to make a valuable even essential contribution to the creation and dissemination of works. They also point out the social dangers inherent in the view that each individual is entitled to judge the "moral authority" of laws and to observe them or not according to individual judgments.

==Modern challenges to copyright==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=March 2017}}
Copyright concepts are under challenge in the modern era, primarily from the increasing use of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]]. Major copyright holders, such as the major [[record labels]] and the [[major film studios|movie industry]], blame the ease of copying for their decreasing profits. Alternative explanations have been put forward, such as poor product content and excessive license charges.

In the United States [[public interest]] groups, major corporations and the like, are entering the public education system to teach the curriculum from their perspectives. The lobbying group for the [[MPAA]] provide a curriculum entitled ''What's the Diff?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediainfocenter.org/story.asp?story_id=61684893 What's the Diff?]&lt;/ref&gt; taught by a group of volunteers called Junior Achievement. The [[Business Software Alliance]] also has their own curriculum program called ''Play it Cybersafe'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playitcybersafe.com Play it Cybersafe]&lt;/ref&gt; which is distributed to school children through a magazine called ''[[The Weekly Reader]]''. The American Librarian Association released their own curriculum for librarians that was distributed in the winter of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org The American Librarian Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polanyi’s paradox''', named in honour of the British-Hungarian philosopher [[Michael Polanyi]], is the theory that human knowledge of how the world functions and capability are, to a large extent, beyond our explicit understanding. The theory was articulated by Michael Polanyi in his book ''The Tacit Dimension'' in 1966, but it was economist [[David Autor]] that named it as Polanyi’s paradox in his 2014 research paper on “Polanyi’s Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Autor|first=David|title=Polanyi's Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth|url=http://www.nber.org.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/papers/w20485.pdf|pages=1–48|year=2014|series=NBER Working Paper Series|place=Cambridge, MA|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarised in the slogan ‘We can know more than we can tell’, Polanyi’s paradox is mainly to explain the cognitive phenomenon that there exist many tasks which we, human beings, understand intuitively how to perform but cannot verbalize the rules or procedures behind it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This "self-ignorance" is common to many human activities, from driving a car in traffic to face recognition.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As Polanyi argues, humans are relying on their [[tacit knowledge]], which is difficult to adequately express by verbal means, when engaging these tasks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tacit Dimension|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=|year=May 2009|isbn=9780226672984|location=Chicago|pages=1–26|oclc=262429494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polanyi's paradox has been widely considered a major obstacle in the fields of AI and automation, since the absence of consciously accessible knowledge creates tremendous difficulty in programming.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Origins ==
British-Hungarian philosopher Michael Polanyi regularly studied the causes behind human ability to acquire knowledge that they cannot explain through logical deduction. In his work ''The Tacit Dimension'' (1966)'','' Polanyi explored the 'tacit' dimension to human knowledge and developed the concept of "tacit knowledge", as opposed to the term "[[explicit knowledge]]".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Tacit knowledge]] can be defined as knowledge people learn from experiences and internalize unconsciously, which is therefore difficult to articulate and codify it in a tangible form. Explicit knowledge, the opposite of tacit knowledge, is knowledge that can be readily verbalized and formalized.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tacit knowledge is largely acquired through [[implicit learning]], the process by which information is learned independently of the subjects' awareness. For example, native speakers tacitly acquire their language in early childhood without consciously studying specific grammar rules (explicit knowledge), but with extensive exposure to television and day-to-day communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reber|first=Arthur|date=September 1989|title=Implicit Learning and Tacit Knowledge|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arthur_Reber/publication/232481584_Implicit_learning_of_tacit_knowledge/links/0a85e533465dd6c4ef000000.pdf|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=118|pages=219–235|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, people can only limitedly transfer their tacit knowledge through close interactions (sharing experiences with one another or observing others' behaviors). A certain level of trust needs to be established between individuals to capture tacit knowledge.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ganga Rejuvenation : Governance Challenges and Policy Options|last=Asanarong|first=Thanathorn|last2=Jeon|first2=Sowon|last3=Ren|first3=Yuanlin|last4=Yeo|first4=Christopher|date=18 December 2018|publisher=World Scientific|others=Wu Xun, Robert James Wasson, Ora-Orn Poocharoen|isbn=9789814704588|location=New Jersey|pages=349|chapter=Creating a Knowledge Management Culture for Ganga River|oclc=1013819475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacit knowledge comprises a range of conceptual and sensory information that is featured with strong personal subjectivity. It is implicitly reflected in human actions; as argued by Polanyi, "tacit knowledge dwells in our awareness".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People's skills, experiences, insight, creativity and judgement all fall into this dimension.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Chugh|first=Ritesh|title=Do Australian Universities Encourage Tacit Knowledge Transfer|url=https://www.academia.edu/19661139|journal=Proceedings of the 7th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management|pages=128–135|year=2015|place=Lisbon, PT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tacit knowledge can also be described as ''know-how,'' distinguishing from ''know-that'' or ''facts.''&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Before Polanyi, Gilbert Ryle published a paper in 1945 drawing the distinction between ''knowing-that (knowledge of proposition)'' and ''knowing-how.'' According to Ryle, this ''know-how'' knowledge is the instinctive and intrinsic knowledge ingrained in the individual's human capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryle|first=Gilbert|date=1945|title=Knowing How and Knowing That: The Presidential Address|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|volume=46|pages=1–16|jstor=4544405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since tacit knowledge cannot be stated in propositional or formal form, Polanyi concludes such inability in articulation in the slogan ‘We can know more than we can tell’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Daily activities based on tacit knowledge include recognizing a face, driving a car, riding a bike, writing a persuasive paragraph, developing a hypothesis to explain a poorly understood phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Take facial recognition as an illustration: we can recognize our acquaintance's face out of a million others while we are not conscious about the knowledge of his face. It would be difficult for us to describe the precise arrangement of his eyes, nose and mouth, since we memorize the face unconsciously.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As a prelude to ''The Tacit Dimension'', in his book ''Personal Knowledge'' (1958), Polanyi claims that all knowing is personal, emphasizing the profound effects of personal feelings and commitments on the practice of science and knowledge. Arguing against the then dominant Empiricists view that minds and experiences are reducible to sense data and collections of rules, he advocates a [[Postpositivism|post-positivist]] approach that recognizes human knowledge is often beyond their explicit expression. Any attempt to specify tacit knowing only leads to self-evident axioms that cannot tell us why we should accept them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personal Knowledge : Towards a Post-critical Philosophy|last=Polanyi|first=Michael,|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|others=|year=1974|isbn=978-0226672885|edition=  |location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=880960082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
Polanyi's observation has deep implications in the AI field since the paradox he identified that "our tacit knowledge of how the world works often exceeds our explicit understanding" accounts for many of the challenges for computerization and automation over the past five decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Automation requires high levels of exactness to inform the computer what is supposed to be done while tacit knowledge cannot be conveyed in a propositional form. Therefore, machines cannot provide successful outcomes in many cases: they have explicit knowledge (raw data) but nevertheless, do not know how to use such knowledge to understand the task as whole.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This discrepancy between human reasoning and AI learning algorithms makes it difficult to automate tasks that demand common sense, flexibility, adaptability and judgment — human intuitive knowledge.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Android Dreams: the Past, Present and Future of Artificial Intelligence|last=Walsh|first=Toby|publisher=C Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd|date=September 7, 2017|isbn=9781849048712|location=London|pages=89–97|oclc=985805795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT economist David Autor is one of the leading sceptics who doubt the prospects for machine intelligence. Despite the exponential growth in computational resources and the relentless pace of automation since the 1990s, Autor argues, Polanyi's paradox impedes modern algorithms to replace human labor in a range of skilled jobs. The extent of machine substitution of human labor, therefore, has been overestimated by journalists and expert commentators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although contemporary computer science strives for prevailing over Polanyi's paradox, the ever-changing, unstructured nature of some activities currently presents intimidating challenges for automation. Despite years of time and billions of investment spent on the development of [[self-driving car]]s and cleaning robots, these machine learning systems continue to struggle with their low adaptability and interpretability, from self-driving cars' inability to make an unexpected detour to cleaning robots' vulnerability to unmonitored pets or kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humans as a Service : the Promise and Perils of Work in the Gig Economy|last=Prassl|first=Jeremias|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780198797012|edition=  |location=Oxford|pages=138–139|oclc=1005117556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, to let self-driving cars function optimally, we have to change current road infrastructure significantly, minimizing the need for human capabilities in the whole driving process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/15/5-confounding-questions-that-hold-the-key-to-the-future-of-driverless-cars/|title=5 Confounding Questions that Hold the Key to the Future of Driverless Cars|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=January 15, 2015|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing [[Job polarisation|occupational polarisation]] in the past few decades —the growth of both high-paid, high-skill abstract jobs and lower-paid, low-skill manual jobs — has been a manifestation of Polanyi's paradox. According to Autor, there are two types of tasks proven stubbornly challenging for artificial intelligence (AI): abstract tasks that require problem-solving capabilities, intuition, creativity and persuasion on the one hand, and manual tasks demanding situational adaptability, visual recognition, language understanding, and in-person interactions on the other. Abstract tasks are characteristic of professional, managerial, and technical occupations, while service and laborer occupations involve many manual tasks (e.g. cleaning, lifting and throwing). These jobs tend to be complemented by machines rather than substituted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By contrast, as the price of computing power declines, computers extensively substitute for routine tasks that can be codified into clear sets of instructions, resulting in a dramatical decline in employment of routine task-&amp;shy;intensive jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This polarization has resulted in a shrinking middle class across industrialized economies since many middle-income occupations in sales, office and administrative work and repetitive production work are task-&amp;shy;intensive. Moreover, the subsequent growth in income inequality and wealth disparity has recently emerged as a major socio-economic issue in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vardi|first=Moshe|date=February 2015|title=Is Information Technology Destroying the Middle Class?|url=https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/2/182648-is-information-technology-destroying-the-middle-class/fulltext|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=58|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some technological optimists argue that recent advances in [[machine learning]] have overcome Polanyi's paradox. Instead of relaying on programmer’s algorithms to instruct them in human knowledge, computer systems are now able to learn tacit rules from context, abundant data, and applied statistics on their own. Since machines can infer the tacit knowledge that human beings draw upon from examples without human assistance, they are no longer limited by those rules tacitly applied but not explicitly understood by humans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Susskind|first=Daniel|title=Re-Thinking the Capabilities of Machines in Economics|url=https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/papers/15127/825-susskind-capabilities-of-machines.pdf|pages=1–14|year=2017|series=University of Oxford Department of Economics Discussion Paper Series|place=Oxford, OX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lee Sedol (B) vs AlphaGo (W) - Game 1.jpg|thumb|Lee Sedol (B) vs AlphaGo (W) - Game 1]]
[[AlphaGo]] program built by the Google subsidiary [[DeepMind]] is a great example of how advances in AI have allowed mindless machines to perform tasks based on tacit knowledge outstandingly. In the 2016 tournament of the strategy game Go, DeepMind’s AlphaGo program successfully defeated one of the world’s top GO players, [[Lee Sedol|Lee Se-dol]], four games to one. DeepMind team employed an approach known as [[deep learning]] to build human-type judgment into AI systems; therefore, they can figure out complex winning strategies by seeing vast examples of Go matches.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/opinion/where-computers-defeat-humans-and-where-they-cant.html|title=Where Computers Defeat Humans, and Where They Can’t|last=McAfee|first=Andrew|date=16 March 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-04|last2=Brynjolfsson|first2=Erik|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, as Carr argues, the assumption that computers need to be able to reproduce tacit knowledge applied by humans to perform complicated tasks is essentially doubtable. When performing demanding tasks, it is not necessary for systems and machines to reflect the rules that human beings follow at all. The requirement is to replicate our outcomes for practical purposes, rather than our means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Glass Cage: Automation and Us|last=Carr|first=Nicholas|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|date=September 29, 2014|isbn=9780393240764|edition=  First|location=New York|pages=11–12|oclc=870098283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerry Kaplan]], a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and AI expert, also illustrates this point in his book ''Humans Need Not Apply'' by discussing four resources and capabilities required to accomplish any given task: awareness, energy, reasoning and means. Humans' biological system (the brain-body complex) naturally integrates all these four properties, while in the electronic domain machines nowadays are given these abilities by accelerating developments in robotics, machine learning, and perception powering systems. For example, sensory data provided by a wide network of sensors enable AI to perceive various aspects of the environment and respond instantly in chaotic and complex real-world situations (awareness); orders and signals for actuating devices can be centralised and managed in [[Computer cluster|server clusters]] or on the 'cloud' (reasoning).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humans Need Not Apply : a Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence|last=Kaplan|first=Jerry|publisher=Yale University Press|date=August 4, 2015|isbn=9780300223576|location=New Haven|pages=41–43, 145|oclc=907143085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan's argument directly supports the proposition that Polanyi's paradox can no longer impede further levels of automation, whether in performing routine jobs or manual jobs. As Kaplan puts it, "Automation is blind to the colour of your collar."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

One example confirms Kaplan's argument is the introduction of Cloud AutoML, an automated system that could help every business design AI software, by Google Brain AI research group in 2017. The learning algorithms of AutoML automates the process of building machine-learning models that can take on a particular task, aiming to democratize AI to the largest possible community of developers and businesses. According to Google’s CEO, Cloud AutoML has taken over some of the work of programmers (which is, in the words of Autor, "abstract task") and thereby offered one solution to the shortage in machine-learning experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607894/why-googles-ceo-is-excited-about-automating-artificial-intelligence/|title=Google’s CEO is excited about seeing AI take over some work of his AI experts|last=Simonite|first=Tom|date=May 17, 2017|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-30|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==

=== Moravec's paradox ===

[[Moravec's paradox|Moravec’s paradox]] is very closed related to Polanyi's paradox, which claims that compared with sophisticated tasks demanding high-level reasoning, it is harder for computers to master low-level physical and cognitive skills that are natural and easy for humans to perform. Examples include [[natural language processing]] and dextrous physical movements (e.g. running over rough terrain).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies|last=Brynjolfsson|first=Erik|last2=McAfee|first2=Andrew|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|others=|date=January 20, 2014|isbn=9780393239355|edition=  First|location=New York|pages=47–50|oclc=867423744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robotics experts have, therefore, discovered that machines are difficult to master the skills of even the least-trained manual worker, since these jobs require perception and mobility (tacit knowledge).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the words of the cognitive scientist Steven Pinker from his book ''[[The Language Instinct]],'' "The main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=William Morrow and Company|year=1994|isbn=978-0688121419|location=New York|pages=|oclc=28723210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corresponding to David Autor's discussion on jobs polarization, Pinker maintains that the appearance of the new generation's intelligent machines would place stock analysts, petrochemical engineers and parole board members in danger of being replaced. Gardeners, receptionists, and cooks are, by contrast, currently secure.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Moore's Law ===
[[Moore's Law]] is the observation articulated by [[Gordon Moore]] in 1965 that the number of transistors that could be fitted onto an integrated circuit doubles every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gordon|date=April 19, 1965|title=Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/jproc.2010.2044436|journal=Electronics|volume=38|issue=8|pages=114–117|doi=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's law has significantly contributed to the advancement of machine learning and AI. The larger and larger capacity of a chip allows for the advent of extremely small data-collecting devices, which could be placed on any intelligent machine. Innovations resulted from the exponentially growing power of computer chips include mobile apps, video games, spreadsheets, and accurate weather forecasts.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601441/moores-law-is-dead-now-what/|title=The Foundation of the Computing Industry’s Innovation is Faltering. What Can Replace It?|last=Simonite|first=Tom|date=May 13, 2016|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-30|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore’s Law changes the way people are valued. As machines can do more and more tasks for free, people become correspondingly expensive. On the other hand, Moore's Law to some extents erases the line between an ordinary person and a skilled person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/829937196|title=Who Owns the Future?|last=Lanier|first=Jaron|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2013|isbn=9781451654967|edition= First Simon &amp; Schuster hardcover |location=New York|pages=|oclc=829937196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Moore’s prediction had been realized until around 2012, Intel announced in 2015 that the pace was slowing to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/technology/smaller-faster-cheaper-over-the-future-of-computer-chips.html?&amp;moduleDetail=section-news-2&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Business%20Day&amp;region=Footer&amp;module=MoreInSection&amp;version=WhatsNext&amp;contentID=WhatsNext&amp;pgtype=article|title=Smaller, Faster, Cheaper, Over: The Future of Computer Chips|last=Markoff|first=John|date=September 26, 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-30|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Wenisch, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan, thinks the stagnant development of chips with denser transistors would create a problem for areas like mobile devices, data centers, and self-driving cars on different timescales. Without Moore's Law as the feedstock of innovation in computing, technology companies have to work harder to achieve new development levels (e.g. to get a new breakthrough on Polanyi's paradox).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

{{selfref|For information about user preferences on Wikipedia, see [[Help:Preferences]], or to view and modify your preferences on Wikipedia, go to [[Special:Preferences]].}}
A '''preference''' is a technical term in psychology, economics and philosophy usually used in relation to choosing between alternatives; someone has a preference for A over B if they would choose A rather than B.

Preference can also be used in insolvency terms.

==Psychology==

In [[psychology]], preferences refer to an individual’s attitude towards a set of objects, typically reflected in an explicit decision-making process (Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic, 2006). The term is also used to mean evaluative judgment in the sense of liking or disliking an object (e.g., Scherer, 2005) which is the most typical definition employed in psychology. However, it does not mean that a preference is necessarily stable over time. Preference can be notably modified by decision-making processes, such as [[choices]] (Brehm, 1956; Sharot, De Martino, &amp; Dolan, 2009), even unconsciously (see Coppin, Delplanque, Cayeux, Porcherot, &amp; Sander, 2010). Consequently, preference can be affected by a person's surroundings and upbringing in terms of geographical location, cultural background, religious beliefs, and education. These factors are found to affect preference as repeated exposure to a certain idea or concept correlates with a positive preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zajonc|first=Robert B.|last2=Markus|first2=Hazel|date=1982-09-01|title=Affective and Cognitive Factors in Preferences|url=http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/123|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–131|doi=10.1086/208905|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

{{main article|Preference (economics)}}

In [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s, ''preference'' refers to the set of assumptions related to ordering some alternatives, based on the degree of [[happiness]], satisfaction, [[gratification]], enjoyment, or [[utility]] they provide, a process which results in an optimal "[[choice]]" (whether real or imagined). Although economists are usually not interested in choices or preferences in themselves, they are interested in the theory of choice because it serves as a background for empirical demand analysis.

==Marketing==
Brand preference is strongly linked to brand choice that can influence the consumer decision making and activate brand purchase. "Brand preferences can be defined as the subjective, conscious and behavioral tendencies which influence consumer's predisposition toward a brand." Understanding the brand preferences of consumers will dictate the most suitable and successful Marketing Strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Prasanna Mohan Raj and Ananth, "Brand Preferences Of Newspapers- Factor Analysis Approach", Research Journal of Economics and Business Studies", Vol.5, No: 11, September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

"Preference" may also refer to non-choices, such as [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[Biology|biological]] explanations for one's preference. [[Sexual orientation]], for example, is no longer considered a sexual preference by most individuals, but is debatable based on philosophical and/or scientific ideas.

==Insolvency==
In Insolvency, the term can be used to describe when a company pays a specific creditor or group of creditors. From doing this, that creditor(s) is made better off, than other creditors. After paying the 'preferred creditor', the company seeks to go into a formal insolvency like an administration or liquidation.  There must be a desire to make the creditor better off, for them to be a preference. 
If the preference is proven, legal action can occur. It is a wrongful act of trading. Disqualification is a risk. &lt;ref name=Steven&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Keith|title=What Is A Preference Under The Insolvency Act 1986|url=https://www.companyrescue.co.uk/guides-knowledge/guides/what-is-a-preference-under-the-insolvency-act-1986-3748/|accessdate=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Projet de communauté philosophe''''' (translated as '''''Project for a Philosophical Community''''') is a book written by the [[French people|French]] philosopher [[Victor d'Hupay]], published in 1777.

== Review == 
This book can be seen as a cornerstone in the history of [[communism]], as it describes for the first time how "communists" (people living in a "[[commune]]") should understand this philosophy. 
In this work, the author advises to 'share all economic and material products between inhabitants of the "commune", so that all may benefit from everybody's work'.&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Cassely, 2016"&gt;Cassely, 2016 : ''Aix insolite et secrète'' JonGlez {{pp.|192-193}} ([http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb45058387v references from the Bibliothèque nationale de France])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Restif de la Bretonne]], a contemporary and friend of d'Hupay, thus describes him as a "communist" in a 1785 publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hupay.fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191812/http://www.hupay.fr/ |archivedate=2017-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grandjonc Jacques, 1983"&gt;Grandjonc Jacques,1983: ''Quelques dates à propos des termes communiste et communisme'' In: Mots, n°7, Octobre 1983 {{p.|146}} ([http://www.persee.fr/doc/mots_0243-6450_1983_num_7_1_1122 reference on the Persée library])&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was partly written in d'Hupay's own [[bastide]] in [[Meyreuil]], near [[Aix-en-Provence]], where he was determined to set his own commune and live by the communist philosophy, with neighbours and friends.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hupay.fr/pages/vie-d-hupay.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pseudophilosophy''' is a term, often considered derogatory{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, applied to criticize philosophical ideas or systems which are claimed not to meet an expected set of standards. The etymology of the term is based on appending the prefix [[pseudo-]] ("false") to the word [[philosophy]] ("love of wisdom"); another term to describe false philosophy is "cod philosophy".

==Targets==
{{Cleanup-list|section|date=August 2016}}
The term has been used against many different targets, including:
* To criticise [[dogmatism]] in general, “which is dissolved when philosophy incorporates the scientific method”;{{sfn|Kearney|Rainwater|1996|p=60}}
* To criticise any philosophy in general which does not meet the criteria of [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] or [[Positivism|positivistic philosophy]];{{sfn|Taylor|Kelly|2013|p=116-117}} 
* To criticise specific philosophical schools, traditions and systems:
** [[Platonism]] as "dogmatic [[metaphysics]]"{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}{{refn|group=note|Kant called Plato's ideas "dogmatic metaphysics" and "mysticism".{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}}}

* To criticise some [[Religion|theistic worldviews]]:
** [[Catholicism]];{{sfn|McGrath|2006|p=49}}{{refn|group=note|Heidegger "lambastes Catholicism as a "dogmatic and casuistic pseudo-philosophy, which poses as a particular system of religion," a system that "totally excludes an original and genuine religious experience of value."{{sfn|McGrath|2006|p=49}}}}
** [[Mysticism]];{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}}
** Modern [[spirituality]] and [[esotericism]]{{refn|group=note|Irwin and Gracia: "Philosophy needs to replace pseudo-philosophy (crystals, astrology, tarot cards)".{{sfn|Irwin|Gracia|2007|p=48}}}}

==Definitions==
According to Christopher Heumann, an 18th-century scholar, pseudo-philosophy has six characteristics:{{sfn|Hanegraaf|2012|p=131-134}}
# A preference for useless speculation
# It appeals merely to human authority
# It appeals to tradition instead of reason
# It syncretises philosophy with superstition
# It has a preference for obscure and enigmatic language and symbolism
# It is immoral

According to [[Michael Oakeshott]], pseudo-philosophy "is theorizing that proceeds partly within and partly outside a given mode of inquiry."{{sfn|Nardin|2001}}

Pieper notes that there cannot be a closed system of philosophy, and that any philosophy that claims to have discovered a "cosmic formula" is a pseudo-philosophy.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} In this he follows Kant, who rejected the postulation of a "highest principle" from which to develop [[Transcendental idealism]], calling this pseudo-philosophy and mysticism.{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}

[[Nicholas Rescher]], in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', describes ''pseudo-philosophy'' as "deliberations that masquerade as philosophical but are inept, incompetent, deficient in intellectual seriousness, and reflective of an insufficient commitment to the pursuit of truth." Rescher adds that the term is particularly appropriate when applied to "those who use the resources of reason to substantiate the claim that rationality is unachievable in matters of inquiry."

==History==
{{See also|Philosophy}}

According to Pieper, for Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle philosophy  is the human search "oriented toward [[Sophia (wisdom)|wisdom]] such as God possesses".{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} It suggests that philosophy includes, in its essence, an orientation toward theology.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} Pieper notes:
{{quote|Thus something is being expressed here that clearly contradicts what in the modern age has become the accepted notion of philosophy; for this new conception of philosophy assumes that it is the decisive feature of philosophical thought to disentangle itself from theology, faith and tradition.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}}}}

The term "pseudo-philosophy" appears to have been coined by [[Jane Austen]].{{sfn|Johnson|Tuite|2011}}

[[Ernest Newman]] (30 November 1868 – 7 July 1959), an English music critic and [[musicologist]], who aimed at intellectual objectivity in his style of criticism, in contrast to the more subjective approach of other critics, published in 1897 ''Pseudo-Philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century'', a critique of imprecise and subjective writing.

==Usage==
The term is almost always used [[pejorative]]ly and is often contentious.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Romanticism===
{{Main|Romanticism}}{{See also|Age of Enlightenment}}

According to Bunge,
{{quote|Pseudophilosophy is nonsense parading as deep philosophy. It may have existed since Lao-Tzu, but it was not taken seriously until about 1800, when the Romantics challenged the Enlightenment. By giving up rationality, they generated a lot of pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}}}}

For Kant, intellectual knowledge is discursive knowledge, not intuitive knowledge.{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} According to Kant, intuition is limited to the realm of senses, while knowledge is "essentially realised in the acts of researching, relating, comparing, differentiating, inferring, proving".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} Kant criticised Romantic philosophy, which is based on feeling and intuition,{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}} and not on "philosophical work":{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}}
{{quote|In philosophy, Kant writes, "the law of reason, of acquiring possessions through work", prevails. And because it is not work, the Romantic philosophy is not genuine philosophy - an objection that is also leveled by Kant against Plato, the "father of all rapturous fantasizing in philosophy", while it is noted, with both approval and assent, that "the philosophy of Aristotle is, by contrast, work".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13-14}}}}

Kant called Romantic philosophy pseudo-philosophy, "in which one is entitled not to work, but only to heed and enjoy the oracle in oneself in order to take complete possession of that wisdom toward which philosophy aims".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}}

===Mysticism===
{{Main|Mysticism}}

Mysticism has a long history. In the Age of Enlightenment mysticism had fallen into disrepute.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} Kant called mysticism pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} In the 19th century, with the rise of Romanticism, interest in mysticism was renewed. Rationalists and Lutherans wrote histories of mysticism to reject its claims, but there was a widespread interest in spiritualism and related phenomena.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}}

Interest in [[Meister Eckhart|Eckhart's works]] was revived in the early nineteenth century, especially by German Romantics and [[German idealism|Idealist]] philosophers.{{sfn|McGinn|2001|p=1}}{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxvii}} Since the 1960s debate has been going on in Germany whether Eckhart should be called a "mystic".{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxii}} The philosopher Karl Albert had already argued that Eckhart had to be placed in the tradition of philosophical mysticism of [[Parmenides]], [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]] and other [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonistic]] thinkers.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}} Heribert Fischer argued in the 1960s that Eckhart was a mediaeval theologian.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}}

===German Idealism===
{{Main|German Idealism}}

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] wrote the following about [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]:
{{quote|If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudophilosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.{{sfn|Schopenhauer|1965|p=15-16}}}}

However his opinion is not widely held of Hegelianism or German Idealism.

===Continental philosophy===
{{Main|Continental philosophy|Analytic philosophy}}

Soccio notes that analytical inclined philosophers tend to dismiss Heidegger's philosophy as pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Soccio|2011|p=497}} According to Christensen, Heidegger himself called the philosophy of Husserl ''scheinphilosophy''.{{sfn|Christensen|2008|p=7}}

===Scientism===
{{Main|Scientism}}

[[Dietrich von Hildebrand]] used the term to critique the central place modern science is occupying in western society:
{{quote|This pseudo philosophy, in which science takes the place of metaphysics and religion, more and more corrodes the life of man, making him more and more blind to the real cosmos, in all its plenitude, depth and mystery ... Today we are witnessing a revolt against the deformation expressed in this pseudo philosophy.{{sfn|Von Hildebrand|1960|p=7}}}}

===Objectivism===
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Jonathan Chait  used  the term in the title "Ayn Rand's Pseudo-Philosophy" of an article in ''New Republic'', in which he wrote, "She was a true amateur who insisted on seeing herself as the greatest human being who ever lived because she was almost completely unfamiliar with the entire philosophical canon."&lt;ref name="chait"/&gt;

'''Rebecca Roache''' is a British [[philosopher]] and Senior Lecturer at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], known for her work on the philosophy of language, practical ethics and philosophy of mind&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/rebecca-roache(59a8d9fa-c44f-4e78-9626-a78500c9013d).html]" Departmental website&lt;/ref&gt;. She is particularly noted for her work on swearing, which has featured in various media, such as the BBC&lt;ref&gt; “[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-39082467]” BBC article on swearing, accessed 27 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Biography ==

Roache received her BA in philosophy at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1996, and her MA in philosophy at the same university in 1997, where she worked among others closely with [[Robin Le Poidevin]]. She then took an MPhil (1999) and a DPhil (2002) at the [[University of Cambridge]], St. John’s College, with [[Jane Heal]] and [[D.H. Mellor]] as dissertation advisers&lt;ref&gt; “[https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.rebecca.roache]” Biography of Rebecca Roache, accessed 25 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. After completing her DPhil, she worked in various projects at the University of Oxford from 2006 onwards. She is currently Senior Lecturer at Royal Holloway, University of London&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/rebecca-roache(59a8d9fa-c44f-4e78-9626-a78500c9013d).html]" Departmental website&lt;/ref&gt;. From 2013 to 2018, she was Associate Editor for the [[Journal of Medical Ethics]]. 

== Notable philosophical views ==

Roache’s theory of swearing &lt;ref&gt; “[https://aeon.co/essays/where-does-swearing-get-its-power-and-how-should-we-use-it]” Roache, Rebecca. 2018. Naughty words. Aeon Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; examines why swearwords (including non-slurs and non-religious swearwords) are so powerful. She proposes that swearwords have a unique linguistic role, coupled to a unique emotional role.  According to Roache, swearing obtains its power because of speaker inferences: when someone swears, she knows her audience will find it offensive, and the swearer knows the audience knows she knows that the audience will find it offensive, and so on, a process termed ''offence escalation''. Speakers and listeners who belong to the same cultural and linguistic community will likely find similar things offensive, which explains why some expressions (disrespecting social hierarchy, sexual taboos, mention of bodily fluids etc) tend to cross-culturally recur as swearwords &lt;ref&gt; “[http://podbay.fm/show/257042117/e/1427640203?autostart=1]” Roache, Rebecca. 2018. Podcast on swearing. Philosophy Bites Podcast.&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
Roache is also noted for a blogpost where she said she unfriended people who voted for the Conservatives at the 2015 General Election. She argued that “Openly supporting a political party “that – in the name of austerity – withdraws support from the poor, the sick, the foreign, and the unemployed while rewarding those in society who are least in need of reward” was “as objectionable as expressing racist, sexist, or homophobic views.”&lt;ref&gt; “[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/election-results-backlash-as-liberal-philosopher-asks-people-to-unfriend-tories-10240131.html]” Independent article, Retrieved 10 May, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In addition to her work in the philosophy of language, Roache has published on a variety of topics in practical ethics and metaphysics, such as which biomedical modifications to humans could be used to fight climate change.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/mar/14/human-engineering-climate-change-philosophy]” Bioengineer humans to tackle climate change, say philosophers, The Guardian, 14 March 2012, accessed 25 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She has an active twitter feed&lt;ref&gt; “[https://twitter.com/rebecca_roache]” Rebecca Roache, Twitter feed.&lt;/ref&gt;. On 25 July 2018, she was listed among the top 100 philosophers on Twitter. &lt;ref&gt;“[https://truesciphi.org/phi.html]” Philosophers on Twitter, accessed 25 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virtue''' ({{lang-la|[[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]]}}, {{lang-grc|ἀρετή}} "[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]") is [[morality|moral]] [[excellence]]. A virtue is a trait or quality that is deemed to be morally [[Good and evil|good]] and thus is [[Value (ethics)|valued]] as a foundation of [[principle]] and good moral being. Personal virtues are characteristics [[Value (personal and cultural)|valued]] as promoting collective and individual greatness. In other words, it is a behavior that shows high moral standards. Doing what is right and avoiding what is wrong. The opposite of virtue is [[vice]]. 

The four classic cardinal  virtues are temperance, prudence, courage, and justice. Christianity derives the three theological virtues of faith, hope and love (charity) from 1 Corinthians. Together these make up the [[seven virtues]]. Buddhism's four [[brahmavihara]] ("Divine States") can be regarded as virtues in the European sense.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The Japanese [[Bushidō]] code is characterized by up to ten virtues,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} including rectitude, courage, and benevolence.

==Etymology==
The ancient Romans used the Latin word ''virtus'' (derived from ''vir'', their word for ''man'') to refer to all of the "excellent qualities of men, including physical strength, valorous conduct, and moral rectitude." The French words ''vertu'' and ''virtu'' came from this Latin root. In the 13th century, the word ''virtue'' was "borrowed into English".&lt;ref&gt;’’The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories’’. Merriam-Webster Inc., 1991. p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient history==
[[File:Maat.svg|thumb|upright|[[Maat]], to [[ancient Egypt]]ians, personified the virtue of [[truth]] and [[justice]]. Her feather represents truth.&lt;ref&gt;Karenga, M. (2004), Maat, the moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During Egyptian civilization, [[Maat]] or Ma'at (thought to have been pronounced *[muʔ.ʕat]), also spelled māt or mayet, was the [[ancient Egypt]]ian concept of [[truth]], [[balance (metaphysics)|balance]], [[Natural order (philosophy)|order]], [[law]], [[morality]], and [[justice]]. Maat was also personified as a goddess regulating the stars, seasons, and the actions of both mortals and the deities. The deities set the order of the universe from chaos at the moment of creation. Her (ideological) counterpart was [[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|Isfet]], who symbolized [[chaos (mythology)|chaos]], lies, and injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Norman Rufus Colin Cohn| title = Cosmos, Caos and the World to Come: The Ancient Roots of Apocalyptic Faith| year = 1993| isbn = 978-0-300-05598-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Assmann]], Translated by Rodney Livingstone, ''Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies'', Stanford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8047-4523-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical antiquity==
[[File:Arete - Areté- Éfeso.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Personification]] of virtue ([[Greek Language|Greek]] ''Ἀρετή'') in [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesos]], [[Turkey]]]]

===Platonic virtue===
The four classic [[cardinal virtues]] are:&lt;ref&gt;Stanley B. Cunningham (2002), Review of Virtues and Vices and Other Essays in Moral Philosophy, Dialogue, Volume 21, Issue 01, March 1982, pp. 133–37&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]]: {{lang|grc|σωφροσύνη}} (''sōphrosynē'')
* [[prudence]]: {{lang|grc|φρόνησις}} (''phronēsis'')
* [[courage]]: {{lang|grc|ἀνδρεία}} (''andreia'')
* [[justice (virtue)|justice]]: {{lang|grc|δικαιοσύνη}} (''dikaiosynē'')

This enumeration is traced to Greek philosophy and was listed by [[Plato]] in addition to [[piety]]: {{lang|grc|ὁσιότης}} (hosiotēs), with the exception that wisdom replaced prudence as virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, D. J. (1991), [http://www.peterlang.de/download/datasheet/42753/datasheet_61504.pdf The virtue of prudence], P. Lang., in Studies in Moral Philosophy. Vol. 5 General Editor: John Kekes&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. (1988), The cardinal virtues and Plato's moral psychologym The Philosophical Quarterly, 38(151), pp. 186–200&lt;/ref&gt; consider either of the above four virtue combinations as mutually reducible and therefore not cardinal.

It is unclear whether multiple virtues were of later construct, and whether Plato subscribed to a unified view of virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Vlastos, The Unity of the Virtues in the "Protagoras", The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. 25, No. 3 (Mar., 1972), pages 415-458&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' and ''[[Meno]]'', for example, he states that the separate virtues cannot exist independently and offers as evidence the contradictions of acting with wisdom, yet in an unjust way; or acting with bravery (fortitude), yet without wisdom.

=== Aristotelian virtue ===
In his work ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] defined a virtue as a point between a deficiency and an excess of a trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aristotle |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/ethics/summary.html |title=Sparknotes.com |publisher=Sparknotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point of greatest virtue lies not in the exact middle, but at a [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] sometimes closer to one extreme than the other. However, the virtuous action is not simply the "mean" (mathematically speaking) between two opposite extremes.  As Aristotle says in the Nicomachean Ethics: "at the right times, about the right things, towards the right people, for the right end, and in the right way, is the intermediate and best condition, and this is proper to virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |title=Nicomachean Ethics |publisher=Home.wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232937/http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |archive-date=2013-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not simply splitting the difference between two extremes.  For example, generosity is a virtue between the two extremes of miserliness and being profligate.  Further examples include: courage between cowardice and foolhardiness, and confidence between [[self-deprecation]] and vanity.  In Aristotle's sense, virtue is excellence at being human.

===Prudence and virtue===
[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], the Roman [[Stoicism|Stoic]], said that perfect [[prudence]] is indistinguishable from perfect virtue. Thus, in considering all consequences, a prudent person would act in the same way as a virtuous person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The same rationale was expressed by [[Plato]] in [[Meno]], when he wrote that people only act in ways that they perceive will bring them maximum good. It is the lack of wisdom that results in the making of a bad choice instead of a prudent one. In this way, wisdom is the central part of virtue. Plato realized that because virtue was synonymous with wisdom it could be taught, a possibility he had earlier discounted. He then added "correct belief" as an alternative to knowledge, proposing that knowledge is merely correct belief that has been thought through and "tethered".

===Roman virtues===
The term "virtue" itself is derived from the Latin [[Virtus (virtue)|"virtus"]] (the personification of which was the deity [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]]), and had connotations of [[masculinity|"manliness"]], [[honor|"honour"]], worthiness of deferential respect, and civic duty as both [[Cincinnatus|citizen and soldier]]. This virtue was but one of many virtues which Romans of good character were expected to exemplify and pass on through the generations, as part of the [[mos maiorum|Mos Maiorum]]; ancestral traditions which defined [[Romanitas|"Roman-ness"]]. Romans distinguished between the spheres of private and public life, and thus, virtues were also divided between those considered to be in the realm of private family life (as lived and taught by the [[paterfamilias]]), and those expected of an upstanding Roman [[Citizenship#Roman ideas|citizen]].

Most Roman concepts of virtue were also personified as a [[numina|numinous deity]]. The primary Roman virtues, both public and private, were:
* [[Auctoritas]] – "spiritual authority" – the sense of one's social standing, built up through experience, Pietas, and Industria. This was considered to be essential for a magistrate's ability to enforce law and order.
* Comitas – "humour" – ease of manner, courtesy, openness, and friendliness.
* Constantia – "perseverance" – military stamina, as well as general mental and physical endurance in the face of hardship.
* [[Clementia]] – "mercy" – mildness and gentleness, and the ability to set aside previous transgressions.
* [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|Dignitas]] – "dignity" – a sense of self-worth, personal self-respect and self-esteem.
* [[Disciplina]] – "discipline" – considered essential to military excellence; also connotes adherence to the legal system, and upholding the duties of citizenship.
* Firmitas – "tenacity" – strength of mind, and the ability to stick to one's purpose at hand without wavering.
* [[frugality|Frugalitas]] – "frugality" – economy and simplicity in lifestyle, without being miserly.
* [[Gravitas]] – "gravity" – a sense of the importance of the matter at hand; responsibility, and being earnest.
* Honestas – "respectability" – the image that one presents as a respectable member of society.
* [[Humanitas]] – "humanity" – refinement, civilization, learning, and generally being cultured.
* Industria – "industriousness" – hard work.
* [[justice|Iustitia]] – "justice" – sense of moral worth to an action; personified by the goddess [[Iustitia]], the Roman counterpart to the Greek [[Themis]].
* [[Pietas]] – "dutifulness" – more than religious piety; a respect for the natural order: socially, politically, and religiously. Includes ideas of patriotism, fulfillment of [[Cult (religious practice)|pious obligation to the gods]], and honoring other human beings, especially in terms of the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron and client relationship]], considered essential to an orderly society.
* [[Prudentia]] – "prudence" – foresight, wisdom, and personal discretion.
* Salubritas – "wholesomeness" – general health and cleanliness, personified in the deity [[Salus]].
* Severitas – "sternness" – self-control, considered to be tied directly to the virtue of gravitas.
* [[honesty|Veritas]] – "truthfulness" – honesty in dealing with others, personified by the goddess [[Veritas]]. Veritas, being the mother of [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]], was considered the root of all virtue; a person living an honest life was bound to be virtuous.
* [[Virtus (virtue)|Virtus]] – "manliness" – valor, excellence, courage, character, and worth. 'Vir' is Latin for "man".

===The Seven Heavenly Virtues===
In 410 CE, [[Prudentius| Aurelius Prudentius Clemens]] listed seven "heavenly virtues" in his book [[Psychomachia]] (Battle of Souls) which is an allegorical story of conflict between vices and virtues. The virtues depicted were:
*chastity
*temperance 
*charity
*diligence 
*patience 
*kindness
*humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prudentius Seven Heavenly Virtues |url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/values/prudentius_virtues.htm |website=Changing Minds |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Chivalric virtues==
In the 8th Century, upon the occasion of his coronation as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] published a list of knightly virtues:

Love God
Love your neighbour
Give alms to the poor
Entertain strangers
Visit the sick
Be merciful to prisoners
Do ill to no man, nor consent unto such
Forgive as ye hope to be forgiven
Redeem the captive
Help the oppressed
Defend the cause of the widow and orphan
Render righteous judgement
Do not consent to any wrong
Persevere not in wrath
Shun excess in eating and drinking
Be humble and kind
Serve your liege lord faithfully
Do not steal
Do not perjure yourself, nor let others do so
Envy, hatred and violence separate men from the Kingdom of God
Defend the Church and promote her cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The origins of Chivalry |url=http://www.baronage.co.uk/chivalry/chival1a.html |website=Baronage |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Religious traditions ==

===Judaism===
{{main article|Jewish ethics}}Loving God and obeying his laws, in particular the [[Ten Commandments]], are central to Jewish conceptions of virtue. Wisdom is personified in the first eight chapters of the [[Book of Proverbs]] and is not only the source of virtue but is depicted as the first and best creation of God (Proverbs 8:12-31). Wisdom is also celebrated in the [[Book of Wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/bible/wisdom/7#27007022|title=Wisdom, Chapter 7, Verse 22|last=|first=|date=|website=USCCB Bible|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic articulation of the Golden Rule came from the first century [[Hillel the Elder|Rabbi Hillel the Elder]]. Renowned in the Jewish tradition as a sage and a scholar, he is associated with the development of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] and, as such, one of the most important figures in [[Jewish history]]. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion in the most concise terms, Hillel replied (reputedly while standing on one leg): "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary; go and learn."&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], tractate Shabbat 31a. See also the [[ethic of reciprocity]] or "The [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Stiftskirche Niederhaslach Glasfenster (Kampf der Tugenden mit dem Laster).jpg|thumb|upright|Virtues fighting vices, stained glass window (14th century) in the [[Niederhaslach Church]]]]{{main article|Christian ethics}}{{See also|Seven virtues|Evangelical counsels}}
In [[Christianity]], the [[three theological virtues]] are [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|hope]] and [[Agape|love]], a list which comes from [[1 Corinthians 13]]:13 ({{lang|grc|νυνὶ δὲ μένει πίστις}} ''pistis'' (faith), {{lang|grc|ἐλπίς}} ''elpis'' (hope), {{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agape'' (love), {{lang|grc|τὰ τρία ταῦτα· μείζων δὲ τούτων ἡ ἀγάπη}}). The same chapter describes love as the greatest of the three, and further defines love as "patient, kind, not envious, boastful, arrogant, or rude." (The Christian virtue of love is sometimes called [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and at other times a Greek word [[agape]] is used to contrast the love of God and the love of humankind from other types of love such as friendship or physical affection.)

Christian scholars frequently add the four Greek [[cardinal virtues]] (prudence, justice, temperance, and courage) to the theological virtues to give the [[seven virtues]]; for example, these seven are the ones described in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', sections 1803–1829.

The Bible mentions additional virtues, such as in the "[[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]," found in Galatians 5:22-23: "By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit it is [[Temperance (virtue)|benevolent]]-love: joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, benevolence, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is absolutely no law against such a thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Aland]], [[Kurt Aland]], Matthew Black, [[Carlo M. Martini]], [[Bruce M. Metzger]] and [[Allen Wikgren]], ''The Greek New Testament'', 4th ed. (Federal Republic of Germany: United Bible Societies, 1993, c1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval and renaissance periods saw a number of models of sin listing the seven deadly sins and the virtues opposed to each.

===Islam===
{{main article|Islamic views on virtue}}
In Islam, the [[Qur'an]] is believed to be the literal word of God, and the definitive description of virtue. [[Muhammad]] is considered an ideal example of virtue in human form. The [[hadiths]], his reported sayings, are central to the Islamic understanding of virtue.

Virtue is defined in [[hadith]]. It is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam'an:
{{quote|"The Prophet Muhammad said, "Piety/virtue is good manner, and sin is that which creates doubt and you do not like people to know it.""|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6195}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6196}}}}

Wabisah bin Ma’bad reported:
{{quote|“I went to Messenger of Allah and he asked me: “Have you come to inquire about Piety/virtue?” I replied in the affirmative. Then he said: “Ask your heart regarding it. Piety/virtue is that which contents the soul and comforts the heart, and sin is that which causes doubts and perturbs the heart, even if people pronounce it lawful and give you verdicts on such matters again and again.”|Ahmad and Ad-Darmi}}

For Muslims fulfilling the human rights are valued as an important building block of Islam, According to Muslim beliefs Allah will forgive individual sins but the bad treatment of humans and injustice with others will only be pardoned by the humans and not by Allah.

===Hinduism===
{{main article|Hindu ethics}}Virtue is a much debated&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Hindery (2004), Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions, {{ISBN|978-8120808669}}; pages 268-72;
* Quote: "(In Hinduism), srutis did not pretend to deal with all situations or irregularities in the moral life, leaving these matters to human reasons (Mbh Xii.109); Accordingly, that again which is virtue may, according to time and place, be sin (...); Under certain conditions, acts that are apparently evil (such as violence) can be permitted if they produce consequences that are good (protection of children and women in self-defense when the society is attacked in war)
* Quote: "(The Hindu scripture) notes the interrelationship of several virtues, consequentially. Anger springs from covetousness; (the vice of) envy disappears in consequence of (the virtues) of compassion and knowledge of self (Mbh Xii.163);&lt;/ref&gt; and an evolving concept in ancient scriptures of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, S. Cromwell (1982), The evolution of Hindu ethical ideals, Asian Studies Program, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker and Becker (2001), Encyclopedia of Ethics, {{ISBN|978-0415936729}}, 2nd Edition, Routledge, pages 845-848&lt;/ref&gt; The essence, need and value of virtue is explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, [[Apastamba]] explained it thus: "virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagoner, see Foreword, in Srinivasan, Dharma: Hindu Approach to a Purposeful Life, {{ISBN|978-1-62209-672-5}};
* Also see: Apastamba, Dharma Sutra, 1.20.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtues lead to ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: पुण्य,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=puNya&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 puNya] Spoken Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; holy living) in Hindu literature; while vices lead to ''pap'' (Sanskrit: पाप,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html search for pApa] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[sin]]). Sometimes, the word ''punya'' is used interchangeably with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;What Is Hinduism?, Himalayan Academy (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-934145-00-5}}, page 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtues that constitute a [[dharma|dharmic]] life  - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' ([[forgiveness]]), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (freedom from anger).&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, K. N. (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought: A Philosophical Study of Hindu, Jaina, and Buddhist Morals, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1608-4}}, pp 52-55&lt;/ref&gt; In later verses, this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' ([[Ahimsa|Non-violence]]), ''Dama'' ([[Temperance (virtue)|self restraint]]), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B. (2006). BHAGAVAD GĪTĀ AS DUTY AND VIRTUE ETHICS. Journal of Religious Ethics, 34(3), 373-395.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohapatra &amp; Mohapatra, Hinduism: Analytical Study, {{ISBN|978-8170993889}}; see pages 37-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] - considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong - argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as [[Ahimsa]] must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S. P. (2003). The Concept in Hinduism of ‘Just War’. Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 8(2), pages 339-361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996&gt;[[Klaus K.

===Buddhism===
{{main article|Buddhist ethics}}
Buddhist practice as outlined in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] can be regarded as a progressive list of virtues.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
# Right View - Realizing the [[Four Noble Truths]] (samyag-vyāyāma, sammā-vāyāma).
# Right Mindfulness - Mental ability to see things for what they are with clear consciousness (samyak-smṛti, sammā-sati).
# Right Concentration - Wholesome one-pointedness of mind (samyak-samādhi, sammā-samādhi).

Buddhism's four ''[[brahmavihara]]'' ("Divine States") can be more properly regarded as virtues in the European sense. They are:
# [[Metta]]/Maitri: loving-kindness towards all; the hope that a person will be well; loving kindness is the wish that all sentient beings, without any exception, be happy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s15.htm |title=Buddhist Studies for Secondary Students, Unit 6: The Four Immeasurables |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Karuṇā]]: compassion; the hope that a person's sufferings will diminish; compassion is the wish for all sentient beings to be free from suffering.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# [[Mudita]]: altruistic joy in the accomplishments of a person, oneself or other; sympathetic joy is the wholesome attitude of rejoicing in the happiness and virtues of all sentient beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# Upekkha/[[Upeksa|Upeksha]]: equanimity, or learning to accept both loss and gain, [[praise]] and [[blame]], success and failure with detachment, equally, for oneself and for others. Equanimity means not to distinguish between friend, enemy or stranger, but to regard every sentient being as equal. It is a clear-minded tranquil state of mind - not being overpowered by delusions, mental dullness or agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |title=A View on Buddhism, The four immeasurables: Love, Compassion, Joy and Equanimity |access-date=2006-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819075238/http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |archive-date=2006-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also the [[Paramitas]] ("perfections"), which are the culmination of having acquired certain virtues. In [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]'s [[Pali Canon|canonical]] [[Buddhavamsa]]&lt;ref&gt;Buddhavamsa, chapter 2. For an on-line reference to the Buddhavamsa's seminality in the Theravada notion of ''parami'', see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel409.html Bodhi (2005).]&lt;br&gt;In terms of other examples in the [[Pali literature]], Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 454, [https://archive.is/20120629172506/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:2679.pali entry for "Pāramī,"] (retrieved 2007-06-24) cites [[Jataka]] i.73 and [[Dhammapada]] [[Atthakatha]] i.84. Bodhi (2005) also mentions Acariya [[Dhammapala]]'s treatise in the [[Cariyapitaka]]-[[Atthakatha]] and the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]] [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentary (''tika'')]].&lt;/ref&gt; there are Ten Perfections (''dasa pāramiyo''). In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, the [[Lotus Sutra]] (''Saddharmapundarika''), there are Six Perfections; while in the [[Dasabhumika Sutra|Ten Stages]] (''Dasabhumika'') Sutra, four more ''Paramitas'' are listed.

===Bahá'í faith===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], virtues are direct spiritual qualities that the human soul possesses, inherited from the world of God. The development and manifestation of these virtues is the theme of the ''[[Hidden Words]]'' of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and are discussed in great detail as the underpinnings of a divinely-inspired society by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] in such texts as ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Daoism===
"Virtue", translated from Chinese ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'' ([[Wikt:德|德]]), is also an important concept in [[Chinese philosophy]], particularly [[Daoism]]. ''De'' ({{zh|c=德|p=''dé''| w=''te''}}) originally meant normative "virtue" in the sense of "personal character; inner strength; integrity", but semantically changed to moral "virtue; kindness; morality". Note the semantic parallel for English ''[[Wikt:virtue|virtue]]'', with an archaic meaning of "inner potency; divine power" (as in "by virtue of") and a modern one of "moral excellence; goodness".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In early periods of [[Confucianism]], moral manifestations of "virtue" include ''ren'' ("[[Human nature|humanity]]"), ''xiao'' ("[[filial piety]]"), and ''li'' ("[[Li (Confucian)|proper behavior, performance of rituals]]"). The notion of [[Confucianism#Humaneness|ren]] - according to Simon Leys - means "humanity" and "goodness". [[Confucianism#Humaneness|Ren]] originally had the archaic meaning in the Confucian Book of Poems of "virility", but progressively took on shades of ethical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Lin Yu-sheng: "The evolution of the pre-Confucian meaning of jen and the Confucian concept of moral autonomy," Monumenta Serica, vol.31, 1974-75&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider the virtues identified in early Confucianism as non-theistic philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"&gt;Yang, C. K. (1971), Religion in Chinese society: a study of contemporary social functions of religion and some of their historical factors, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-88133-621-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Daoist concept of ''De'', compared to Confucianism, is more subtle, pertaining to the "virtue" or ability that an individual realizes by following the [[Tao|Dao]] ("the Way"). One important normative value in much of Chinese thinking is that one's social status should result from the amount of virtue that one demonstrates, rather than from one's birth. In the ''[[Analects]]'', [[Confucius]] explains ''de'' as follows: "He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu Lunyu 2/1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005031/http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu |date=2007-09-27 }}, tr. [[James Legge]]&lt;/ref&gt; In later periods, particularly from the Tang dynasty period, Confucianism as practiced, absorbed and melded its own concepts of virtues with those from Daoism and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt;

==Samurai virtue==
In [[Hagakure]], Yamamoto Tsunetomo encapsulates his views on 'virtue' in the four vows he makes daily:&lt;ref&gt;''Hagakure: The Secret Wisdom of the Samurai'', by Yamamoto Tsunetomo, Translated by Alexander Bennett, Tuttle Publishing, 2014, {{ISBN|978-4-8053-1198-1}} (Full Translation)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Never to be outdone in the way of the samurai or [[bushido]].
# To be of good use to the master.
# To be filial to my parents.
# To manifest great compassion and act for the sake of Man.

Yamamoto goes on to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If one dedicates these four vows to the gods and Buddhas every morning, he will have the strength of two men and never slip backward. One must edge forward like the inchworm, bit by bit. The gods and Buddhas, too, first started with a vow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bushidō code is typified by seven virtues:&lt;ref&gt;see Random House's Japanese-English, English-Japanese Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rectitude (義,gi)
* Courage (勇,yuu)
* Benevolence (仁,jin)
* Respect (礼,rei)
* Honesty (誠,sei)
* Honor (誉,yo)
* Loyalty (忠,chuu)

Others that are sometimes added to these:
* Filial piety (孝,kō)
* Wisdom (智,chi)
* Care for the aged (悌,tei)

==Philosophers' views==
===Valluvar===
While religious scriptures generally consider ''[[dharma]]'' or ''aṟam'' (the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] term for virtue) as a divine virtue, [[Valluvar]] describes it as a way of life rather than any spiritual observance, a way of harmonious living that leads to universal happiness.&lt;ref name=”Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers”&gt;{{cite book |author= N. Sanjeevi |title= First All India Tirukkural Seminar Papers |url= |year= 1973 |edition=2nd |publisher=University of Madras | location=Chennai |isbn = |page= xxiii–xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Valluvar keeps ''aṟam'' as the cornerstone throughout the writing of the [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]].&lt;ref name="UMI_WhyNationalBook?"&gt;{{cite book

While [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]] such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and their descendants opined that justice cannot be defined and that it was a divine mystery, Valluvar positively suggested that a divine origin is not required to define the concept of justice. In the words of [[V. R. Nedunchezhiyan]], justice according to Valluvar "dwells in the minds of those who have knowledge of the standard of right and wrong; so too deceit dwells in the minds which breed fraud."&lt;ref name=”Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers”/&gt;

===René Descartes===
For the [[Rationalism|Rationalist]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Men should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid blessedness or pleasure. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that these goods contribute to happiness, but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;Blom, John J., ''Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology''. New York University Press. 1978. {{ISBN|0-8147-0999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'', expresses true virtue as different from what commonly is known about this moral trait. In Kant's view, to be goodhearted, benevolent and sympathetic is not regarded as true virtue. The only aspect that makes a human truly virtuous is to behave in accordance with moral principles. Kant presents an example for more clarification; suppose that you come across a needy person in the street; if your [[sympathy]] leads you to help that person, your response does not illustrate your virtue. In this example, since you do not afford helping all needy ones, you have behaved unjustly, and it is out of the domain of principles and true virtue. Kant applies the approach of [[four temperaments]] to distinguish truly virtuous people. According to Kant, among all people with diverse temperaments, a person with [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] frame of mind is the most virtuous whose thoughts, words and deeds are one of principles.

=== Friedrich Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s view of virtue is based on the idea of an order of rank among people. For Nietzsche, the virtues of the strong are seen as vices by the weak and slavish, thus Nietzsche's virtue ethics is based on his distinction between [[master and slave morality|master morality and slave morality]]. Nietzsche promotes the virtues of those he calls "higher men", people like Goethe and Beethoven. The virtues he praises in them are their creative powers (“the men of great creativity” - “the really great men according to my understanding” (WP 957)).
According to Nietzsche these higher types are solitary, pursue a "unifying project", revere themselves and are healthy and life-affirming.&lt;ref name="Leiter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/#2 |last= Leiter |first=Brian |title=Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because mixing with the herd makes one base, the higher type “strives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd, the many, the great majority…” (BGE 26). The 'Higher type' also "instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities" (WP 944) in the form of an "organizing idea" for their life, which drives them to artistic and creative work and gives them psychological health and strength.&lt;ref name="Leiter"/&gt; The fact that the higher types are "healthy" for Nietzsche does not refer to physical health as much as a psychological resilience and fortitude. Finally, a Higher type affirms life because he is willing to accept the [[eternal return]] of his life and affirm this forever and unconditionally.

In the last section of ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche outlines his thoughts on the noble virtues and places [[solitude]] as one of the highest virtues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And to keep control over your four virtues: courage, insight, sympathy, solitude. Because solitude is a virtue for us, since it is a sublime inclination and impulse to cleanliness which shows that contact between people (“society”) inevitably makes things unclean. Somewhere, sometime, every
community makes people – “base.” (BGE §284)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche also sees truthfulness as a virtue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genuine honesty, assuming that this is our virtue and we cannot get rid of it, we free spirits – well then, we will want to work on it with all the love and malice at our disposal and not get tired of ‘perfecting’ ourselves in our virtue, the only one we have left: may its glory come to rest like a gilded, blue evening glow of mockery over this aging culture and its dull and dismal seriousness! ([[Beyond Good and Evil]], §227)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Benjamin Franklin ===
[[File:Seal of Virginia.svg|thumb|upright|Virtue, spear in hand, with her foot on the prostrate form of [[Tyranny]] on the [[Sic Semper Tyrannis|Great Seal of Virginia]]]]
These are the virtues&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftrain.com/franklin_improving_self.html Franklin's 13 Virtues] Extract of Franklin's autobiography, compiled by Paul Ford.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Benjamin Franklin]] used to develop what he called 'moral perfection'. He had a checklist in a notebook to measure each day how he lived up to his virtues.

They became known through [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's autobiography]].

# Temperance: Eat not to Dullness. Drink not to Elevation.
# Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling Conversation.
# [[Order (virtue)|Order]]: Let all your Things have their Places. Let each Part of your Business have its Time.
# Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
# Frugality: Make no Expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e. Waste nothing.
# Industry: Lose no Time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary Actions.
# Sincerity: Use no hurtful Deceit. Think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
# Justice: Wrong none, by doing Injuries or omitting the Benefits that are your Duty.
# Moderation: Avoid Extremes. Forbear resenting Injuries so much as you think they deserve.
# Cleanliness: Tolerate no Uncleanness in Body, Clothes or Habitation.
# Tranquility: Be not disturbed at Trifles, or at Accidents common or unavoidable.
# Chastity: Rarely use [[wikt:venery#Etymology 2|Venery]] but for Health or Offspring; Never to Dullness, Weakness, or the Injury of your own or another's Peace or Reputation.
# Humility: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

==Contemporary views==

===Virtues as emotions===
Marc Jackson in his book ''Emotion and Psyche'' puts forward a new development of the virtues. He identifies the virtues as what he calls the good emotions "The first group consisting of [[love]], [[kindness]], [[joy]], [[faith]], [[awe]] and [[pity]] is good"&lt;ref&gt;Marc Jackson (2010) ''Emotion and Psyche.'' O-books. p. 12 ({{ISBN|978-1-84694-378-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; These virtues differ from older accounts of the virtues because they are not character traits expressed by action, but emotions that are to be felt and developed by feeling not acting.

===In Objectivism===
[[Ayn Rand]] held that her morality, the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)#Ethics: rational self-interest|morality of reason]], contained a single axiom: existence exists, and a single choice: to live. All values and virtues proceed from these. To live, man must hold three fundamental values that one develops and achieves in life: Reason, Purpose, and Self-Esteem. A value is "that which one acts to gain and/or keep ... and the virtue[s] [are] the act[ions] by which one gains and/or keeps it." The primary virtue in [[Objectivist ethics]] is rationality, which as Rand meant it is "the recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge, one's only judge of values and one's only guide to action."&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness|The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism]]'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; These values are achieved by passionate and consistent action and the virtues are the policies for achieving those fundamental values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Gotthelf|Gotthelf, Allan]] ''On Ayn Rand''; p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Ayn Rand describes seven virtues: rationality, productiveness, pride, independence, integrity, honesty and justice. The first three represent the three primary virtues that correspond to the three fundamental values, whereas the final four are derived from the virtue of rationality. She claims that virtue is not an end in itself, that virtue is not its own reward nor sacrificial fodder for the reward of evil, that life is the reward of virtue and happiness is the goal and the reward of life. Man has a single basic choice: to think or not, and that is the gauge of his virtue. Moral perfection is an unbreached rationality, not the degree of your intelligence but the full and relentless use of your mind, not the extent of your knowledge but the acceptance of reason as an absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn (1961) ''For the New Intellectual Galt’s Speech,'' "[[For the New Intellectual|For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]", pp. 131, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern psychology===
[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]], two leading researchers in [[positive psychology]], recognizing the deficiency inherent in [[psychology]]'s tendency to focus on dysfunction rather than on what makes a healthy and stable [[personality]], set out to develop a list of "[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]".&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of study, 24 traits (classified into six broad areas of virtue) were identified, having "a surprising amount of similarity across cultures and strongly indicat[ing] a historical and cross-cultural convergence."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. p. 36. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; These six categories of virtue are courage, justice, humanity, temperance, transcendence, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. pp. 36-39. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists suggest that these virtues are adequately grouped into fewer categories; for example, the same 24 traits have been grouped into simply: Cognitive Strengths, Temperance Strengths, and Social Strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F. Krueger, Christopher S. Kallie. 2010. The structure of virtue: An empirical investigation of the dimensionality of

==Vice as opposite==
{{Main article|Vice}}
{{See also|List of virtues}}
The opposite of a virtue is a [[vice]]. Vice is a habitual, repeated practice of wrongdoing. One way of organizing the vices is as the corruption of the virtues.

As [[Aristotle]] noted, however, the virtues can have several opposites. Virtues can be considered the mean between two extremes, as the Latin maxim dictates ''in medio stat virtus'' - in the centre lies virtue. For instance, both cowardice and rashness are opposites of courage; contrary to prudence are both over-caution and insufficient caution; the opposites of pride (a virtue) are undue humility and excessive vanity. A more "modern" virtue, [[Toleration|tolerance]], can be considered the mean between the two extremes of narrow-mindedness on the one hand and over-acceptance on the other. Vices can therefore be identified as the opposites of virtues - but with the caveat that each virtue could have many different opposites, all distinct from each other.
