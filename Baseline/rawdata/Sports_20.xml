'''Amateur sports''' are [[sport]]s in which participants engage largely or entirely without [[remuneration]]. The distinction is made between amateur sporting participants and [[professional sports|professional]] sporting participants, who are paid for the time they spend competing and training. In the majority of sports which feature professional players, the professionals will participate at a higher standard of play than amateur competitors, as they can train full-time without the stress of having another job. The majority of worldwide sporting participants are amateurs. 

Sporting amateurism was a zealously guarded ideal in the 19th century, especially among the upper classes, but faced steady erosion throughout the 20th century with the continuing growth of pro sports and monetisation of amateur and collegiate sports, and is now strictly held as an ideal by fewer and fewer organisations governing sports, even as they maintain the word "[[amateur]]" in their titles.

==Background==
{{refimprove section|date = November 2014}}
Modern organized sports developed in the 19th century, with the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] taking the lead. Sporting culture was especially strong in private schools and universities, and the upper and middle class men who attended those institutions played as amateurs. Opportunities for working classes to participate in sport were restricted by their long six-day work weeks and Sunday Sabbatarianism. In the UK, the [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] of 1844 gave working men half a day off, making the opportunity to take part in sport more widely available. Working class sportsmen found it hard to play top level sport due to the need to turn up to work.  On occasion, cash prizes, particularly in individual competitions, could make up the difference;&lt;ref&gt;(looking for citation to prizes of a trophy filled with silver dollars)&lt;/ref&gt; some competitors also wagered on the outcomes of their matches. As professional teams developed, some clubs were willing to make "broken time" payments to players, ''i.e.'', to pay top sportsmen to take time off work, and as attendances increased, paying men to concentrate on their sport full-time became feasible. Proponents of the amateur ideal deplored the influence of money and the effect it has on sports. It was claimed that it is in the interest of the professional to receive the highest amount of pay possible per unit of performance, not to perform to the highest standard possible where this does not bring additional benefit.

The middle and upper class men who dominated the sporting establishment not only had a theoretical preference for amateurism, they also had a self-interest in blocking the professionalization of sport, which threatened to make it feasible for the working classes to compete against themselves with success. Working class sportsmen didn't see why they shouldn't be paid to play. Hence there were competing interests between those who wished sport to be open to all and those who feared that professionalism would destroy the 'Corinthian spirit'. This conflict played out over the course of more than one hundred years. Some sports dealt with it relatively easily, such as [[golf]], which decided in the late 19th century to tolerate competition between amateurs and professionals, while others were traumatized by the dilemma, and took generations to fully come to terms with professionalism even to a result of causing a breakdown in the sport (as in the case of [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]] in 1895).

=== Corinthian ===
''Corinthian'' has come to describe one of the most virtuous of amateur athletes—those for whom fairness and honor in competition is valued above victory or gain.  The Corinthian Yacht Club (now the [[Royal Corinthian Yacht Club]], RCYC) was established in Essex in 1872 with "encouragement of Amateur Yacht sailing" as its "primary object."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=140 years of amateur yachting excellence…|url=http://royalcorinthian.co.uk/history/|publisher=Royal Corinthian Yacht Club|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, club rules ensured that crews consisted of amateurs, while "no professional or paid hand is allowed to touch the tiller or in any way assist in steering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabe|first=Julius|title=Yachting: Historical Sketches of the Sport|date=1902|publisher=Lippincott|pages=110–111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIwoAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=corinthian&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the RCYC website derives the name ''Corinthian'' from the [[Isthmian Games]] of [[ancient Corinth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalcorinthian.co.uk/article/4000001/the-formation-of-the-club|title=The formation of the Corinthian Yacht Club|publisher=Royal Corinthian Yacht Club|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] derives the noun ''Corinthian'' from "the proverbial [[Classical Corinth|wealth, luxury, and licentiousness]] of ancient Corinth", with senses developing from "a wealthy man" (attested in 1577) through "a licentious man" (1697) and "a man of fashion about town" (1819)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Egan|first=Pierce|title=Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue|date=1823|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2xJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT92}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "a wealthy amateur of sport who rides his own horses, steers his own yacht, etc" (1823). [[Dixon Kemp]] wrote in ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'' published in 1900, "The term Corinthian half a century ago was commonly applied to the aristocratic [[patron]]s of sports, some of which, such as [[Boxing|pugilism]], are not now the fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|title=A Maual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1900|publisher=H. Cox|page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Corinthian ideal" of the [[gentleman]] amateur developed alongside [[muscular Christianity]] in late Victorian Britain, and has been analysed as a historical social phenomenon since the later 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=D. J.|title=On The Corinthian Spirit: The Decline of Amateurism in Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8aoY8Foyy0C&amp;pg=PT1|accessdate=15 September 2017|date=2010-08-31|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781409020684 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Corinthian F.C.|Corinthian Football Club]] founded in 1882 was the paragon of this. In the United States, "Corinthian" came to be applied in particular to amateur yachtsman, and remains current as such and in [[Corinthian Yacht Club (disambiguation)|the name of many yacht clubs]]; including [[Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club]] (founded 1874, added "Corinthian" to name in 1881)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Short History By past Commodore P. James Roosevelt|url=http://www.seawanhaka.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=225433&amp;ssid=73261&amp;vnf=1|publisher=Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yale Corinthian Yacht Club]] (likewise 1881 and 1893).

==Present day==&lt;!-- [[Shamateurism]] links here --&gt;
By the early 21st century the [[Olympic Games]] and all the major team sports accepted professional competitors. However, there are still some sports which maintain a distinction between amateur and professional status with separate competitive leagues. The most prominent of these are [[golf]] and [[boxing]]. In particular, only amateur boxers could compete at the Olympics up to 2016.

Problems can arise for amateur sportsmen when sponsors offer to help with an amateur's playing expenses in the hope of striking lucrative endorsement deals with them in case they become professionals at a later date. This practice, dubbed "'''shamateurism'''", was present as early as in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="GardinerBoyes2012"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Simon |last1=Gardiner|first2=Simon |last2=Boyes|first3=Urvasi |last3=Naidoo|first4=John |last4=O'Leary |first5=Roger |last5=Welch|title=Sports Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-zGBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT284|date=12 March 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-58812-9|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; As financial and political stakes in high-level were becoming higher, shamateurism became all the more widespread, reaching its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, when the International Olympic Committee started moving towards acceptance of professional athletes. The advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

==North American collegiate athletics==
{{Main|College athletics}}

All North American university sports are conducted by amateurs.  Even the very most commercialized college sports, such as [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college football|football]] and [[college basketball|basketball]], do not financially compensate competitors, although coaches and trainers generally are paid. College football coaches in Texas and other states are often the highest paid state employees, with some drawing salaries of over five million US dollars annually. [[Athletic scholarship]] programs, unlike academic scholarship programs, cannot cover more than the cost of food, housing, tuition, and other university-related expenses. 

In order to ensure that the rules are not circumvented, stringent rules restrict gift-giving during the recruitment process as well as during and even after a collegiate athlete's career; college athletes also cannot endorse products, which some{{who|date=May 2017}} may consider a violation of free speech rights.

Some{{who|date=May 2017}} have criticised this system as exploitative; prominent university athletics programs are major commercial endeavors, and can easily rake in millions of dollars in profit during a successful season. College athletes spend a great deal of time "working" for the university, and earn nothing from it at the time aside from scholarships sometimes worth tens of thousands of dollars; basketball and football coaches, meanwhile, earn salaries that can compare with those of professional teams' coaches.

Supporters of the system say that college athletes can always make use of the education they earn as students if their athletic career doesn't pan out, and that allowing universities to pay college athletes would rapidly lead to deterioration of the already-marginal academic focus of college athletics programs. They also point out that athletic scholarships allow many young men and women who would otherwise be unable to afford to go to college, or would not be accepted, to get a quality education. Also, most sports other than football and men's basketball do not generate significant revenue for any school (and such teams are often essentially funded by football, basketball, and donations), so it may not be possible to pay athletes in all sports. Allowing pay in some sports but not others could result in the violation of U.S. laws such as [[Title IX]].

==Olympics==
{{main|Olympic Games#Amateurism and professionalism}}
Through most of the 20th century the Olympics allowed only amateur athletes to participate and this amateur code was strictly enforced - [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of [[track and field]] medals for having taken expense money for playing baseball in 1912.

Later on, the nations of the [[Communist bloc]] entered teams of Olympians who were all nominally [[student]]s, [[soldier]]s, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.

Near the end of the 1960s, the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive against the Soviet team's full-time athletes and the other constantly improving European teams. They pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues but met opposition from the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) and the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). [[Avery Brundage]], president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, was opposed to the idea of amateur and professional players competing together. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF decided to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional hockey players&lt;ref name="Num17"&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html Story #17–Protesting amateur rules, Canada leaves international hockey].&lt;/ref&gt; at the 1970 World Championships in [[Montreal]] and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-40.html Story #40–Finally, Canada to host the World Championship].&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was reversed in January 1970 after Brundage said that ice hockey's status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made.&lt;ref name="Num17" /&gt; In response, Canada withdrew from all international ice hockey competitions and officials stated that they would not return until "open competition" was instituted.&lt;ref name="Num17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Summit Series '72 Summary |publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]] |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/GamesSummarySUM1972.shtml |accessdate=2009-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807130920/http://www.hhof.com/html/GamesSummarySUM1972.shtml |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Günther Sabetzki]] became president of the IIHF in 1975 and helped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA. In 1976, the IIHF agreed to allow "open competition" between all players in the World Championships. However, NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics, because of the unwillingness of the NHL to take a break mid-season and the IOC's amateur-only policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-6.html Story #6–First Canada Cup opens up the hockey world].&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1984 Winter Olympics, a dispute formed over what made a player a professional. The IOC had adopted a rule that made any player who had signed an NHL contract but played less than ten games in the league eligible. However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that any player contracted with an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play. The IOC held an emergency meeting that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, as long as they had not played in any NHL games.&lt;ref name="Pod1984"&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|1997|pp=147–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible. Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the [[World Hockey Association]]—were allowed to play.&lt;ref name="Pod1984"/&gt; Canadian hockey official [[Alan Eagleson]] stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Eagleson upset over hockey dispute|work=The New York Times|author=Litsky, Frank|date=1984-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Costello]] of the CAHA suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Canada considers hockey withdrawal|work=The New York Times|date=1984-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games starting in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Players in NHL are now eligible in the Olympics|work=Toronto Star|author=Monsebraaten, Laurie|date=1986-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but let the individual sport federations decide if they wanted to allow professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/olympics/owg98/osytr01.htm|title=Amateurism|date=1999-07-12|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1972 retirement of [[IOC]] President [[Avery Brundage]], the Olympic amateurism rules were steadily relaxed, amounting only to technicalities and lip service, until being completely abandoned in the 1990s (In the [[United States]], the [[Amateur Sports Act of 1978]] prohibits national governing bodies from having more stringent standards of amateur status than required by international governing bodies of respective sports.  The act caused the breakup of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] as a wholesale sports governing body at the Olympic level).

Olympic regulations regarding amateur status of athletes were eventually abandoned in the 1990s with the exception of wrestling, where the amateur fight rules are used due to the fact that professional wrestling is largely staged with pre-determined outcomes. Starting from the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], professionals were allowed to compete in boxing, though amateur fight rules are still used for the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/sports/olympics/olympics-is-opening-its-rings-to-professional-boxers.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==

===England===
English [[first-class cricket]] distinguished between [[History of English amateur cricket|amateur and professional cricketers]] until 1963. Teams below [[Test cricket]] level in England were normally, except in emergencies such as injuries, captained by amateurs. Notwithstanding this, sometimes there were ways found to give high performing "amateurs", for example [[W.G.Grace]], financial and other compensation such as employment.

On English overseas tours, some of which in the 19th century were arranged and led by professional cricketer-promoters such as [[James Lillywhite]], [[Alfred Shaw]] and [[Arthur Shrewsbury]], a more pragmatic approach generally prevailed.

In England the division was reflected in, and for a long time reinforced by, the series of [[Gentlemen v Players]] matches between amateurs and professionals. Few cricketers changed their status, but there were some notable exceptions such as [[Wally Hammond]] who became (or was allowed to become) an amateur in 1938 so that he could captain England.

Professionals were often expected to address amateurs, at least to their faces, as "Mister" or "Sir" whereas the amateurs often referred to professionals by their surnames. Newspaper reports often prefaced amateurs' names with "Mr" while professionals were referred to by surname, or sometimes surname and initials. At some grounds amateurs and professionals had separate dressing rooms and entered the playing arena through separate gates.

After the Second World War the division was increasingly questioned. When [[Len Hutton]] was appointed as [[English national cricket captain]] in 1952 he remained a professional. In 1962 the division was removed, and all cricket players became known as "cricketers".

===Other countries===

In Australia the amateur-professional division was rarely noticed in the years before [[World Series Cricket]], as many top level players expected to receive something for their efforts on the field: before World War 1 profit-sharing of tour proceeds was common. Australian cricketers touring England were considered amateurs and given the title "Mr" in newspaper reports.

Before the [[Partition of India]] some professionalism developed, but talented cricketers were often employed by wealthy princely or corporate patrons and thus retained a notional amateur status.

[[Women's cricket]] is, and always has been, almost entirely amateur.

==Association football==

'''[[Boot money]]''' has been a phenomenon in amateur sport for centuries. The term "boot money" became popularised in the 1880s when it was not unusual for players to find half a crown (corresponding to 12½ pence after [[Decimal Day|decimalisation]]) in their boots after a game.

[[The Football Association]] prohibited paying players until 1885, and this is referred to as the "legalisation" of professionalism because it was an amendment of the "Laws of the Game". However, a maximum salary cap of twelve pounds a week for a player with outside employment and fifteen pounds a week for a player with no outside employment lingered until the 1960s even as transfer fees reached over a hundred thousand pounds; again, "boot money" was seen as a way of topping up pay.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Today the most prominent English football clubs that are not professional are semi-professional (paying part-time players more than the old maximum for top professionals; this includes all the major existing [[women's football (soccer)|women's clubs]], in which full professionalism has not taken root yet) and the most prominent true amateur men's club is probably [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], the oldest football club in Scotland, founded in 1867 and with a home ground ([[Hampden Park]]) which is one of UEFA's five-star stadia. They have also won the Scottish Cup more times than any club outside the [[Old Firm]]. Amateur football in both genders is now found mainly in small village and Sunday clubs and the [[Amateur Football Alliance]].

==Sailing==
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
[[Sailing]] has taken the opposite course. Around the turn of the 20th century, much of sailing was professionals paid by interested idle rich. Today, sailing, especially [[dinghy]] sailing, is an example of a sport which is still largely populated by amateurs. For example, in the recent Team Racing Worlds, and certainly the American Team Racing Nationals, most of the sailors competing in the event were amateurs. While many competitive sailors are employed in businesses related to sailing (primarily sailmaking, naval architecture, boatbuilding and coaching), most are not compensated for their own competitions. In large keelboat racing, such as the Volvo Around the World Race and the America's Cup, this amateur spirit has given way in recent years to large corporate sponsorships and paid crews.

==Figure skating==
Like other Olympic sports, [[figure skating]] used to have very strict amateur status rules.  Over the years, these rules were relaxed to allow competitive skaters to receive token payments for performances in exhibitions (amid persistent rumors that they were receiving more money "under the table"), then to accept money for professional activities such as endorsements provided that the payments were made to trust funds rather than to the skaters themselves.

In 1992, trust funds were abolished, and the [[International Skating Union]] voted both to remove most restrictions on amateurism, and to allow skaters who had previously lost their amateur status to apply for reinstatement of their eligibility.  A number of skaters, including [[Brian Boitano]], [[Katarina Witt]], [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]], and [[Ekaterina Gordeeva]] and [[Sergei Grinkov]], took advantage of the reinstatement rule to compete at the [[1994 Winter Olympics]].  However, when all of these skaters promptly returned to the pro circuit again, the ISU decided the reinstatement policy was a failure and it was discontinued in 1995.

Prize money at ISU competitions was introduced in 1995, paid by the sale of the [[television]] rights to those events.  In addition to prize money, Olympic-eligible skaters may also earn money through appearance fees at shows and competitions, endorsements, movie and television contracts, coaching, and other "professional" activities, provided that their activities are approved by their national federations.  The only activity that is strictly forbidden by the ISU is participating in unsanctioned "pro" competitions, which the ISU uses to maintain their monopoly status as the governing body in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frogsonice.com/skateweb/faq/rules.shtml#Q6 |title=Competitive Figure Skating FAQ:Rules and Regulations |publisher=Frogsonice.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people in the skating world still use "turning pro" as jargon to mean retiring from competitive skating, even though most top competitive skaters are already full-time professionals, and many skaters who retire from competition to concentrate on show skating or coaching do not actually lose their competition eligibility in the process.

==Rugby football==

===Background===
Rugby has provided one of the most visible and lasting examples of the tension between amateurism and professionalism during the development of nationally organised sports in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in the late-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.englandrugby.com/twickenham/world-rugby-museum/rugby-history/the-amateur-era/#|title=The Amateur Era|last=|first=|date=|website=England Rugby|access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The split in rugby in 1895 between what became [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]] arose as a direct result of a dispute over the pretence of a strict enforcement of its amateur status - clubs in [[Leeds]] and [[Bradford]] were fined after compensating players for missing work, whilst at the same time the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) was allowing other players to be paid.{{citation needed|date=August 2011|reason=The 1888 British Isles tour to Australia was a private undertaken and they did not have the blessing of the RFU}}

Rugby football, despite its origins in the privileged English [[Independent school (UK)|public schools]], was a popular game throughout [[England]] by around 1880, including in the large working-class areas of the industrial north. However, as the then-amateur sport became increasingly popular and competitive, attracting large paying crowds, teams in such areas found it difficult to attract and retain good players. This was because physically fit local men needed to both work to earn a wage - limiting the time that they could devote to unpaid sport - and to avoid injuries that might prevent them working in the future. Certain teams faced with these circumstances wanted to pay so-called 'broken time' money to their players to compensate them for missing paid work due to their playing commitments, but this contravened the amateur policy of the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU).

===Organization===
Following a lengthy dispute on this point during the early 1890s, representatives of more than 20 prominent northern rugby clubs met in [[Huddersfield]] in August 1895 to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU), a breakaway administrative body which would permit payments to be made to players. The NRFU initially adopted established RFU rules for the game itself, but soon introduced a number of changes, most obviously a switch from 15 to 13 players per side. It became the [[Rugby Football League]] in 1922, by which time the key differences in the two codes were well established, with the 13-a-side variant becoming known as rugby league.

The RFU took strong action against the clubs involved in the formation of the NRFU, all of whom were deemed to have forfeited their amateur status and therefore to have left the RFU. A similar interpretation was applied to all players who played either for or against such clubs, whether or not they themselves received any compensation. Such players were effectively barred ''sine die'' from any involvement in organised rugby union. These comprehensive and enduring sanctions, combined with the very localised nature of most rugby competition, meant that most northern clubs had little practical alternative but to affiliate with the NRFU in the first few years of its existence.

Rugby football in Britain therefore became subject to a de facto schism along regional - and to some extent class - lines, reflecting the historical origins of the split. Rugby league - in which professionalism was permitted - was predominant in northern England, particularly in industrial areas, and was viewed as a working class game. Rugby union - which remained amateur - was predominant in the rest of England, as well as in [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. Rugby union also had a more affluent reputation, although there are areas - notably in [[South Wales]] and in certain English cities such as [[Gloucester]] - with a strong working-class rugby union tradition.

===Discrimination===
Discrimination against rugby league players could verge on the petty - former Welsh international [[Fred Perrett]] was once excluded in lists of players who died in the First World War due to his 'defection' to the league code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/warstories/pages/rugbyinternationals.shtml Rugby Heroes who went to War] [[BBC Online]] Matthew Ferris, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One [[British House of Commons|Member of Parliament]], [[David Hinchliffe]], described it as "one of the longest (and daftest) grievances in history" with anyone over the age of 18 associated with rugby league being banned forever from rugby union.&lt;ref name="hinch"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/do-i-not-like-that-----hypocrisy-has-to-end-david-hinchliffe-mp-explains-why-he-has-introduced-a-bill-to-stop-rugby-union-discriminating-against-the-league-code-1425064.html|publisher= The Independent|title= Do I not like that . . . / Hypocrisy has to end: David Hinchliffe MP explains why he has introduced a Bill to stop rugby union discriminating against the league code|author=David Hinchliffe|date=1994-06-26|accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland and Wales===
The [[Scottish Rugby Union]] was a particular bastion of amateurism and extreme care was taken to avoid the 'taint' of professionalism: a player rejoining the national team after the end of the Second World War applied to be issued with a new shirt and was reminded that he had been ''supplied with a shirt prior to the outbreak of hostilities''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In Wales the position was more equivocal with clubs attempting to stem the tide of players ''going north'' with ''boot money'', a reference to the practice of putting cash payments into player's footwear whilst they were cleaning up after a game. Sometimes payments were substantial. [[Barry John]] was once asked why he hadn't turned professional and responded, "I couldn't afford to."{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Open union===
Rugby union was declared "open" in August 1995 - almost exactly 100 years after the original split occurred - meaning that professionalism has been permitted in both rugby codes since that date. However, while the professional-amateur divide remained in force, there was originally very limited crossover between the two codes, the most obvious occasions being when top-class rugby union players 'switched codes' to rugby league in order to play professionally. Welsh international [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] was a high-profile example of this switch. Since professionalism has been allowed in rugby union the switches have started to come the opposite way. Union has swiftly grown to embrace the professional game with many league players joining union to take a slice of the larger amounts of money available in the sport.

Nowadays, while rugby union no longer makes the professional-amateur distinction, the professional-amateur split still exists within rugby league with the [[British Amateur Rugby League Association]] (BARLA) strictly amateur, though it allows some ex-professionals to play provided they are no longer under contract. The most recent club to get a ban for fielding a contracted professional was Brighouse Rangers who were expelled from the [[National Conference League]] during 2007-2008 season, and the player handed a sine die ban (though in part for gouging &lt;ref&gt;[http://brighouserangers.org.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=108&amp;Itemid=48 ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), although the club itself has since been admitted to the Pennine League.

Also, some rugby unions have amateur rules, most notably the [[Argentine Rugby Union]], where all member clubs are amateur. The [[Campeonato Argentino]], the national championship for provincial teams, does not include players contracted to the country's [[Super Rugby]] side, the [[Jaguares (Super Rugby)|Jaguares]].

Alternative sports, using the flying disc, began in the mid-sixties. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[Frisbee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Countercultural Sports in America: The History and Meaning of Ultimate Frisbee|url=https://www.amazon.com/Countercultural-Sports-America-History-Ultimate/dp/3838311957|author=Jordan Holtzman-Conston |publisher=Waltham, Mass|year= 2010|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What started with a few players, in the sixties, like Victor Malafronte, Z Weyand and [[Ken Westerfield]] experimenting with new ways of throwing and catching a [[Frisbee]], later would become known as playing [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc freestyle|work=Formative Years|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#chapter2|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized disc sports, in the 1970s,  began with promotional efforts from [[Wham-O]] and [[Irwin Toy]] (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using [[Frisbee]] show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events.

[[Ultimate (sport)|Disc ultimate]] is a [[team sport]] played with a [[flying disc]]. The object of the game is to score points by passing the disc to members of your own team, on a rectangular field, 120 yards (110m) by 40 yards (37m), until you have successfully completed a pass to a team member in the opposing teams end zone. There are currently over five million people that play some form of organized ultimate in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ultimate Frisbee Participation [SFIA]|url=http://sludgeonline.blogspot.com/2013/10/ultimate-frisbee-participation-sfia.html|publisher=Sludge Output|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimate has started to be played semi-professionally with two newly formed leagues, the [[American Ultimate Disc League]] (AUDL) and [[Major League Ultimate]] (MLU).

The game of [[Guts (game)|guts]] was invented by the Healy Brothers in the 1950s and developed at the International Frisbee Tournament (IFT) in [[Marquette, Michigan]]. The game of [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], the most widely played disc game, began in the late 1960s with [[Joel Silver]] and Jared Kass. In the 1970s it developed as an organized sport with the creation of the [[Ultimate Players Association]] with Dan Roddick, Tom Kennedy and Irv Kalb. [[Double disc court]] was invented and introduced in the early 1970s by Jim Palmeri. In 1974, [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]] competition was created and introduced by [[Ken Westerfield]] and [[Discraft]]s Jim Kenner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc freestyle|work=Development of Frisbee in Canada|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#appendix1|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the game of [[disc golf]] was standardized with targets called "pole holes" invented and developed by [[Wham-O]]'s Ed Headrick.

==High school sports==

Sports teams commonly exist at the [[high school]] level; students who participate, commonly referred to as [[student athlete]]s, do so during their course of study. Occasionally, sports success in high school sports may lead to a professional career in the field.

The benefit of sports in high school is debated; some believe that they promote discipline and teamwork,&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Fejgin. "Participation in High School Competitive Sports: A Subversion of School Mission or Contribution to Academic Goals?", ''Contemporary Issues in Sociology of Sport''&lt;/ref&gt; while others find that they can cause injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/61/3/465 |title=Injuries in High School Sports - Garrick and Requa 61 (3): 465 - Pediatrics |publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One study on the relationship between high school athletic and academic successes finds that, for the most part, higher participation and success rates in sports is positively related school-wide student successes on academic outcomes such as standardized test scores and educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowen|first=Daniel H.|author2=Greene, Jay P.|title=Does Athletic Success Come at the Expense of Academic Success?|journal=Journal of Research in Education|year=2012|volume=22|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Center for Educational Statistics]] reports that student athletes have a 20% higher chance of completing a college degree, and are more likely to be employed and in better health than non-athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Reports Participation in Varsity Intercollegiate Sports at 4-Year Colleges?|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs/web/97911.asp|publisher=Nation Center for Education Statistic|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a survey of high school athletes in 2006 showed that high school athletes are more likely to cheat inside of the classroom than non-athletes, especially boys participating in football, baseball, and basketball and girls participating in softball and basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey of high school athletes: 2006|url=http://josephsoninstitute.org/sports/programs/survey/|publisher=Josephson Institute Center for Sports Ethics|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey does not indicate to what extent cheating contributes to the greater academic outcomes of high school athletes.

In the world of middle school and high school sports, several fees have risen over the last few years making sports more expensive. The term “Pay-to-Play” means that students and their parents must pay a flat fee to participate, and that fee often leaves out the costs of uniforms, transportation, and other team fees. This affects low-income families (those who earn less than $60,000 per year) and their ability to participate in the sports. The average cost is $381 per child per sport (Pay-to-Play Sports). Physical and mental health can improve with the right amount of physical fitness incorporated into everyday life. It allows for the child to have a healthy developing body, and a BMI within the normal range. Physical activity has been proven to improve mood and decrease both stress and anxiety. Studies have shown that the more physical activity one participates in as a child, the happier and more stable that person will be as an adult. Thus, the more students who participate in school sports, the more students who will find themselves balanced and successful adults later in life.&lt;ref&gt;"Pay-to-play Sports Keeping Lower-income Kids out of the Game."

==Golf==
[[Golf]] still has amateur championships, most notably the [[U.S. Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur Championship]], [[British Amateur Championship]], [[U.S. Women's Amateur]], [[British Ladies Amateur]], [[Walker Cup]], [[Eisenhower Trophy]], [[Curtis Cup]] and [[Espirito Santo Trophy]]. However, amateur golfers are far less known than players of professional golf tours such as the [[PGA Tour]] and [[European Tour]]. Still, a few amateurs are invited to compete in open events, such as the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] and [[British Open]] or non-open event, such as the [[Masters Tournament]].

==Motorsport==
In motorsports, there are various forms of amateur drivers. When they compete at professional events, they are often referred to as "pay drivers". They have been a presence in [[Formula One]] for many years - drivers such as [[Felipe Nasr]], [[Esteban Gutiérrez]] and [[Rio Haryanto]] bring sponsorship to the tune of $30 million for a seat, even in backmarker teams. In sports car racing, drivers are often seeded into certain categories, including Amateur and Pro-Am classes. The vast majority of these "gentlemen drivers" however tend to participate at club level, often racing historic or classic cars, which are aimed primarily at amateurs.

==Other sports==
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
In Ireland, the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], or GAA, protects the amateur status of the country's national sports, including [[Gaelic football]], [[Hurling]] and [[Camogie]]. Major [[tennis]] championships prohibited professionals until 1968 but the subsequent admission of professionals virtually eliminated amateurs from public visibility. Paying players was considered disreputable in [[baseball]] until 1869.

[[File:Horse race, Churchill Downs 2008-04-18.jpg|thumb|250px|Horse racing is a very popular sporting event involving animals.]]

'''Animals in sport''' are a specific form of working animals.  Many animals, at least in more commercial sports, are highly trained.  Two of the most common animals in sport are horses and dogs.

==Types of animal sporting events==
There are many types of animal sporting events, with varying levels of participation from humans. Some are solely between the animals while others use the animals in a lesser role.  Most sports involve training, while some can also involve selective breeding.

There are some large-scale events that include animals in a variety of sports.  A rodeo can comprise many different sports, ranging from bull riding to pole bending. Some of the most well known types of animal racing may be, Horse racing, Dog racing (Greyhound racing), Pigeon racing, Camel racing, and (even Mule racing which mainly takes place in some parts of California etc,) as well as many more.
[[File:JASDogRace.JPG|thumb|Greyhounds preparing for a race.]]

===Racing===

Racing is the most popular form of animal-related sport, particularly horse racing.  Some racing events directly involve humans as riders while others see the animals race alone.  In some sports the rider is not directly riding the animal, instead being pulled along.  Examples of this include harness racing, dogsled racing and popular ancient Greece and Roman Empire sport of chariot racing.

[[Greyhound racing]], a popular form of animal racing, dates back to the 1800s in the United States, after the dogs were brought over from Europe to help control the [[hare]] population. While track racing is the most common, there are other forms of racing.  [[Pigeon racing]], for example, sees [[homing pigeons]] finding their way home from a set distance away. [[Kambala]], he-buffalo racing in coastal Karnataka, India is a rural spectator racing conducted every year during winter in about 50 towns/villages.
Racing events are a common way to [[gambling|gamble]], with billions spent worldwide every year.  This is one reason that some countries or states have made such sports illegal.

===One-on-one and team events===
There are some non-racing competitive events involving animals.  [[Polo]] is an example, with competitors hitting a [[ball]] with [[mallet]]s while on horseback.  [[Elephant polo]] dates back to the early 20th century when members of the British aristocracy in [[Nepal]] began playing the sport.

In the 14th to 16th centuries [[jousting]] was a popular one-on-one tournament event involving knights on horseback.

===Fighting===
[[File:Bull attacks matador.jpg|thumb|Bullfighting is legal in some countries.]]
In most counties the act of two or more animals fighting each other, such as [[cockfighting]], and [[dog fighting]], is seen as cruel and is therefore illegal.  Some legal animal fights take place around the world, including [[cow fighting]] and [[camel wrestling]].  There are also some legal forms of sport where humans fight animals, such as [[bullfighting]] which has a long history in Spanish and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] tradition.  Not all animals are large, however, with [[cricket fighting]] being a popular (though illegal to gamble on) sport in [[Macau]] and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theregister.co.uk/2004/08/16/cricket_fighting_ring/ HK feds bust illegal]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several other [[blood sport]]s in history that were intended as entertainment, many of which involved [[bait (dogs)|baiting by dogs]].  Many different types of animal have been placed into a pit, sometimes tied to a post, and set upon by dogs.  This ranges from [[rat-baiting]] and [[badger-baiting]] to [[bear-baiting]] and [[lion-baiting]].  There are even some tales of [[human-baiting]].

Animals that take part in animal fights are usually specifically bred for strength and stamina.

===Hunting===
[[File:BedaleHunt2005.jpg|thumb|Fox hunting has been a recent controversial issue, particularly in the United Kingdom.]]
{{main|Hunting}}
Hunting began as a crucial component of [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, being an important source of food.  The domestication of animals and the development of [[agriculture]] lessened the need for hunts, with food being more readily available. Hunting became a sport for those of the high [[social class]]es.  In most parts of [[medieval]] Europe, the upper-class (aristocracy and higher clergy) obtained as privilege the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory.

Dangerous hunting, as for lions or wild boars, usually on horseback (or from a [[chariot]], as in [[History of ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]]) also had function similar to [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and manly sports: an honourable, somewhat competitive pastime to help the aristocracy practice skills of war in times of peace.  In [[ancient Rome]] the "[[Venatio]]" was a form of entertainment that pitted humans against animals in an amphitheater.

In modern times, hunting is usually legal as long as the hunter has a license, though there are some unregulated forms in some countries.  Animals can be on either side of a hunt, assisting the hunters or being hunted themselves.

[[Fox hunting]] has been a controversial issue, particularly in the United Kingdom, regarding its necessity and the cruelty involved (See [[Fox hunting legislation]]).

====Fishing====
[[Fishing]] is somewhat different from other sports and is most commonly a pastime or hobby.  However, it can also be [[Sport fishing|a competitive sport]].

====Pigeon shooting====
[[Pigeon shooting]] was one of the [[Shooting at the 1900 Summer Olympics|shooting events]] of the [[1900 Summer Olympics]]. Competitors in these events had to kill as many live pigeons as possible. Birds were released one at a time from 'traps' in front of the shooters.

===Shows of training or breeding===
[[File:JackRussellJump wb.jpg|thumb|A [[Jack Russell Terrier]] competing in a dog agility event.]]
Shows are intended to highlight the excellence of training or [[Selective breeding|breeding]] of the animals involved.  There is a variety of horse riding sports in this category, including [[show jumping]] and [[dressage]], both of which are featured at the [[Olympic Games]]. At lower levels, [[horse show]]s offer a wide variety of competition both [[Equestrianism|riding and driving]] as well as [[halter (horse show)|In-hand]] classes that evaluate [[equine conformation]].

Dogs, being easily [[domesticated animal|domesticated]], are one of the most popular animals to have in shows. [[Cattle]] and [[sheepdog trial]]s are popular in many countries and are used to show how well a dog can [[muster (livestock)|gather]] livestock. Other [[dog sports]] of this category include [[dog agility]] events, whereby the dogs must tackle [[obstacle course]]s, and [[obedience trial]]s, where they must execute a predefined set of tasks.

[[Crufts]], a British [[conformation show]] for dogs, has grown since it started in 1886.  While dogs are the most common show animal, [[cat show]]s are also common.  Both of these animals have a wide variety of breeds and compete in categories, comparing each individual to the breed "ideal."

Some unusual animals also take part in shows, such as the competitors in [[rabbit show jumping]] and [[common chaffinch]]es in [[vinkenzetting]].

==Popular culture==
Films and television series about animals in sport can be realistic or fictional, involving animals in an activity that they cannot really perform.  ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]]'' is a fairly accurate portrayal of the famous American [[Seabiscuit|horse of the same name]], while ''[[MVP: Most Valuable Primate]]'', a film about a [[hockey]]-playing [[chimpanzee]], is unrealistic.

The 1980 [[animation|animated]] film ''[[Animalympics]]'' is a spoof of the Olympic Games and features [[anthropomorphic]]ised animals.  In the combination [[live action]] and [[animation]] film ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', animated animals play a game of [[association football|football]].  Similarly, several television commercials used the [[Budweiser Clydesdales]] and other animals in live-action and [[Computer animation|CGA]] roles to appear to be playing [[American football]].

From 1976 to 1999, the [[BBC]] broadcast ''[[One Man and His Dog]]'', a television series about sheepdog trials.  They also commissioned three series of ''[[Pets Win Prizes]]'', a [[game show]] with contestants' pets having to perform in various tasks.

''[[Man vs. Beast]]'' is an American television show that pitches humans against animals in a variety of unusual challenges, including [[competitive eating]] between world champion [[Takeru Kobayashi]] and a [[brown bear]].

'''Boardsports''' are sports that are played with some sort of board as the primary equipment. These sports take place on a variety of terrain, from paved flat-ground and snow-covered hills to water and air. Most boardsports are considered action sports or [[extreme sports]], and thus often appeal to youth. A large proportion of youth partaking in these sports, together with aesthetic damage to property from sports like skateboarding, has led to many board sports being marginalized by the greater world of sports in the past. However, many board sports are ever-more frequently gaining mainstream recognition, and with this recognition have enjoyed wider broadcast, sponsorship and inclusion in institutional sporting events, including the [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716183518/http://www.tackyworld.com/skateboard/article/?id=107551 It's Official: Skateboarding Joins the Olympics - Article - Tackyworld.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Surfing]] was the first boardsport, originating from [[Polynesian culture]]. [[Skateboarding]] was then invented by surfers looking to "surf" on land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/skateboard.html Inventor of the Week: Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is hard to estimate when most boardsports were "invented" because people have been making homemade versions throughout history. For example, it is not hard to conceive of a person, who is familiar with the concept of [[skiing]] or [[sledding]], standing sideways on a plank of wood and riding down a snow-covered slope. M.J. "Jack" Burchett is credited with first doing this in 1929, using horse reins and clothesline to secure his feet on the plank of wood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snowboardinghistory.com/ Snowboarding History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116084703/http://www.snowboardinghistory.com/ |date=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most boardsports have similar, equally unknown origins.

Using data collected in the past decade, it is estimated there are 18-50 million skateboarders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/skateboarding.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204013828/http://hickoksports.com/history/skateboarding.shtml#hist1 |archive-date=2010-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4021/is_2002_Oct_1/ai_92087410/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-25 million surfers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surfline.com/community/whoknows/whoknows.cfm?id=1012 Number Of Surfers In The World | Surfline.Com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and 10-20 million [[snowboarder]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuropeans.com/topic/sports/powderhausen/history/ Neuropeans - Arts, Sports, MKP2001, Neurope Tower, Europanto&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=587281&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; in the world.

==Classifications== 
There are a variety of board sports, which are characterized by terrain: Surf, Snow, Wake, Skate are the primary.

===Water===

;[[Surfing]]: The grandfather of all board sports, is a surface water sport that involves the participant being carried by a breaking wave.
;[[Stand Up Paddle Surfing|Stand Up Paddle Surfing (SUP)]]:A variant of surfing where one always a stands up on the board and propels oneself by a one-bladed paddle, without lying down on the board. Although originally the goal was to catch and surf the waves, a racing modality has emerged with similarities to kayaking.
;[[Skimboarding]] (1930s) :A discipline of surfing involving riding a board on wet sand or shallow water. A predominantly recreational activity that has evolved into a highly competitive water sport.
;[[Windsurfing]] (1970) : Also known as ''sailboarding''. A water sport involving travel over water on a small 2-4.7 metre board powered by wind acting on a single sail. The sail is connected to the board by a flexible joint
;[[Bodyboarding]] (1971) : Wave riding consisting of a small, roughly rectangular piece of foam, shaped to a hydrodynamic form. The bodyboard is ridden predominantly lying down, (or 'prone'). It can also be ridden in a half-standing stance (known as 'dropknee') or can even be ridden standing up.
;[[Kneeboarding]] (1973) :A discipline of surfing where the rider paddles on his belly into a wave on a kneeboard, then rides the wave face typically on both knees.
;[[Riverboarding]] (1978) : A boardsport in which the participant is prone on the board with fins on his/her feet for propulsion and steering.
;[[Wakeboarding]] (1983) : A surface watersport created from a combination of water skiing, snow boarding and surfing techniques. As in water skiing, the rider is towed behind a boat, or a [[cable skiing]] setup.
;[[Skurfing]] (1984) :Another fast growing boardsport is [[skurfing]] a mix of surfing and more conventional water sports in which the participant is towed behind the boat.
;[[Flowriding]] (1991) : Similar to surfing but done on a man-made artificial sheet wave.
;[[Wakeskating]] (1990s) :A rider is pulled behind a boat on a wakeskate which is smaller than a wakeboard and has no bindings with a foam or griptape surface.
;[[Kitesurfing]] (1996) : Also known as ''kiteboarding''. Boards similar to those known from windsurfing or wakeboarding are propelled by an inflatable or foil power kite, allowing for high speeds and high jumps. Other variations are to use a wheeled board or buggy on land, or skis or a snowboard on snow.
; [[Wakesurfing]] (1997) : A rider is pulled behind a boat on a mini surfboard and can ride the boat's wake with no rope.

===Land===
====Paved surface====

;[[Skateboarding]] (1950) : Uses a board mounted on wheels, and often ridden on a half-pipe, in urban settings, or emptied specially built swimming pools. 
;[[Longboarding]] (1970s) : Similar to freeboarding but with long skateboards that come in different shapes and sizes, longboarding is mostly a racing sport but there are many other styles as well.
;[[Snakeboard]] (1989) : Similar to skateboarding, but also influenced heavily by snowboarding. 
;[[Freestyle scootering]] (1996) : an action sport which involves using scooters to perform freestyle tricks, in a manner similar to skateboarding and BMX freestyle.
; [[Carveboarding]] : A board that has wheels similar to a car except smaller, it turns better than most boards on four wheels, its main purpose is to cruise and carve, it can turn 65 degrees, and has spring-loaded trucks that are almost as unique as a flowboards trucks.
;[[Freeboard (skateboard)|Freeboarding]]: Often said to be the board whose feel is the most similar to snowboarding. There are two extra castor wheels in the middle of the base that are somewhat lower than the other four. This allows the rider to distribute his weight to only one "edge", as in snowboarding. This gives the rider the ability to slide, an ability no other land board has besides the longboard.
;[[Caster board]] : Two narrow platforms known as "decks" are adjoined by a rubber or aluminium coated metal beam that houses a strong spring. Each truck has one wheel that is connected to the board in such a way that each wheel can rotate independently. Both wheels are mounted on slants that measure around 30� in angle, facing away from the front of the board. Similar to [[Vigorboard]] (2003) : Constructed from two platforms, each supported by a single caster with a single wheel giving the board a total of two wheels. the two platforms are connected by heavy metal torsion bar that enables the board to twist in the centre.
; [[Skurfing#Street Skurfing|Street Skurfing]] : Similar to Caster board, but the rider can move both feet independently.
; [[Freeline skates]] (2000's) : A pair of skates designed to give the feeling of skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing, and inline skates all in one. Freeline Skates are extremely portable, making them the smallest and lightest form of transportation. See also [[Skurfing#Street Skurfing|Street Skurfing]].
; [[Street surfing]] : A split deck board connected by a spring rod to allow each half of the board to twist independently from the other, each side only having 1 caster wheel, allowing for tight maneuvers and self propulsion.
; [[On-shore boards]] : A type of board that has four inline wheels and four in the back(two on each side) and is deeply concave in the front.
;[[T-board]]ing :A skateboard deck with two wheels that can spin 360 degrees.

====Off-paved surface====

;[[Land windsurfing]]: A sport similar to traditional windsurfing that is performed on land rather than water. A four-wheeled deck, similar to a mountain board or skateboard deck, is commonly used in conjunction with a mast and sail in order to project the board across land.
;[[Mountainboarding]] (1992) : Similar to snowboarding, but on snowless peaks (in between winter seasons). The board is wider and sturdier. [[Mountainboarding]] is similar to skateboarding in the way that mountainbiking is similar to regular biking.
;[[Kite landboarding]]: Similar to Kite Surfing but the kite is used to pull the rider along flat ground (often a hard packed sandy beach) on a mountainboard.

====Snow====

;[[Snowboarding]] (1977) :A cross between skateboarding and skiing, the board medium is snow, although the condition of the snow can have a major impact on snowboarding style and technique. The four subcategories are freeride, freestyle, alpine and powder.
;[[Snowskating]] (1998) :This is similar to snowboarding but there are no bindings used. Instead the snow skate has a foam grip similar to griptape, enabling you to do skateboard style tricks. There are four main types of snowskates: Single deck (a skateboard-deck-like platform made out of either wood and/or plastic)
; Bilevel (similar to a skate board but, instead of trucks and wheels, a small ski with metal edges called a subdeck is used with special trucks to be used on a ski hill);4x4 (a skateboard but the wheels are replaced by very small skis); Powderskate (can either be like a Bilevel snowskate or a single deck snowskate but longer and wider).
;[[Snowkiting]]: This is when a kite is used to pull a snowboarder along.

====Sand====

;[[Sandboarding]]: A recreational activity similar to snowboarding that takes place on sand dunes rather than snow-covered hills.

===Air===

;[[Skysurfing]]: A kind of skydiving in which the skydiver wears a board attached to their feet and performs surfing-style aerobatics during freefall.

A '''combat sport''', or '''fighting sport''', is a competitive [[contact sport]] that usually involves one-on-one combat. In many combat sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Common combat sports include [[Mixed Martial Arts|mixed martial arts]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[fencing]], [[savate]], [[kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Sanda (Sport)|Sanda]], [[Tae Kwon Do]], [[Capoeira]], [[Brazilian Jiu-jitsu]], [[Historical medieval battles|HMB]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]], [[Kyokushin]], and [[Kūdō]].

== History ==
{{further information|History of martial arts}}
[[Folk wrestling|Tradition styles of wrestling]] exist in most cultures; [[wrestling]] can be considered a [[cultural universal]]. [[Boxing]] contests date back to ancient [[Sumer]] in the 3rd millennium BCE and [[ancient Egypt]] ''circa'' 1350 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boxing|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/boxing|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|accessdate=May 12, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Olympic Games]] included several combat-related sports: [[Hoplitodromos|armored foot races]], boxing, wrestling, and [[pankration]], which was introduced in the [[Olympic Games]] of 648 BCE.

In [[ancient China]], combat sport appeared in the form of [[lei tai]]. It was a no-holds barred combat sport that combined boxing and wrestling. There is evidence of similar combat sports in ancient Egypt, [[History of India|India]] and [[History of Japan|Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brownell|first=Susan Elaine|title=The olympic movement on its way into Chinese culture|date=1990|publisher=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]]|pages=29, 63|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ita1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=ancient+leitai|language=en|quote=In both ancient China and Greece, the most popular sports were probably wrestling, boxing, and combinations thereof (Greek pankration, Chinese leitai). The same might be argued for ancient Egypt, India and Japan. [...] In both ancient China and Greece, the no-holds-barred combat sport (Greek pankration, Chinese leitai) was probably the most popular one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[Middle ages]] and [[Renaissance]], the [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]] was popular. Tournaments were competitions that featured several mock combat events, with [[jousting]] as a main event. While the tournament was popular among [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s, combat sports were practiced by all levels of society. The [[German school of fencing|German school]] of late medieval martial arts distinguished sportive combat (''schimpf'') from serious combat (''ernst''). In the [[German Renaissance]], sportive combat competitions were known as [[Fechtschule]]n, corresponding to the [[Prize Playing]] in [[Tudor England]]. Out of these Prize Playing events developed the English [[boxing]] (or ''prizefighting'') of the 18th century, which evolved into modern boxing with the introduction of the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]] in 1867.

[[Amateur boxing]] has been part of the modern Olympic Games since their introduction in 1904. [[Professional boxing]] became popular in the United States [[Boxing in the 1920s|in the 1920s]] and experienced a "golden age" [[Boxing in the 1950s|after World War II]].

The creation of [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] is attributed to the [[Gracie family|Gracie]] family of Brazil in 1925 after Asian martial arts were introduced to Brazil. [[Vale-tudo]], wrestling, [[muay thai]] kickboxing and luta livre gained popularity.
Modern [[Muay Thai]] was developed in the 1920s to 1930s. [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] was introduced in the [[Soviet Union]]. Modern [[Taekwondo]] also emerged after the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] and became an Olympic sport in 2000. [[Sanshou]] as part of [[Wushu (sport)|modern wushu]] was developed in the [[People's Republic of China]] since the 1950s. [[Kickboxing]] and [[full contact karate]] were developed in the 1960s and became popular in Japan and the West during the 1980s and 1990s. Modern [[Mixed Martial Arts]] developed out of the interconnected subcultures of [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] and [[shoot wrestling]]. It was introduced in Japan in the form of [[Shooto]] in 1985, and in the United States as [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) in 1993. The [[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]] were introduced in 2000, and the sport experienced peak popularity in the 2000s. During this period, multiple brands and promotions were established. The most well-known promotion for MMA is UFC.

[[File:José Aldo vs. Conor McGregor, UFC 189 World Tour London.jpg|thumb|363x363px|A photo of Conor McGregor, Jose Aldo, and Dana White at a press conference for the fight between McGregor and Aldo. This shows the two fighters posing for media, increasing revenue and interest in the fight.]]

== Popularity of combat sports by gender ==
Combat sports are generally more popular among men, both as athletes and as spectators. For many years, participation in combat sports was practically exclusive to men; [[USA Boxing]] had a ban on women's boxing until 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Boxing/About-Us/History-of-Amateur-Boxing.aspx|title=History of Amateur Boxing|work=Team USA|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A study conducted by Greenwell, Hancock, Simmons and Thorn in 2015 revealed that combat sports had a largely male audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenwell, Hancock, Simmons, Thorn|year=2015|title=The effects of gender and social roles on the marketing of combat sport.|journal=Sport Marketing Quarterly|volume=24|issue=1|page=19|issn=1061-6934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combat sport promotions such as UFC or [[Bellator MMA]] are generally advertised to men.

== Modern sports ==
Combat [[Sportsperson|athletes]] usually [[fight]] one-on-one. Different sports involve different skill sets and moves. For example, [[boxing]] only allows [[Punch (strike)|punches]], [[taekwondo]] largely involves [[kick]]s, and both [[muay thai|Muay Thai]] and [[Burmese boxing]] allow the use of [[Elbow (strike)|elbows]] and [[Knee (strike)|knees]]. There are also combat sports based on [[grappling]], such as both [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Collegiate wrestling]]. Modern [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] is similar to the ancient Greek Olympic sport of [[pankration]]; Both allow a wide range of both [[strike (attack)|striking]] and grappling techniques.

Some combat sports involve the use of [[weapons]] and armor, such as [[fencing]], [[kendo]], and the new sport [[SCA Heavy Combat]]; In [[Gatka]] and [[Modern Arnis]], sticks are used.

In combat sports the use of these various techniques are highly regulated to minimize permanent or severe physical damage to each participant though means of organized officiating by a single or multiple referees that can distribute penalties or interrupt the actions of the competitors during the competition. In weapon based sports, the weapons used are made to be non-lethal by means of modifying the striking portions of the weapon and requiring participants to wear protective clothing/armor.

== Olympic Combat Sports ==
* [[Amateur boxing]] - (1904 - 2016). Boxing has been staged at every summer Olympic games since 1904 except Stockholm in 1912 due to Swedish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/boxing-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Boxing Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Judo]] - (1964, 1972 - 2016). Judo was not included in the 1968 Mexico City summer Olympics. Women's judo was added to the Olympics in 1992 in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/judo-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Judo Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Taekwondo]] - 1988 Seoul Games (demonstration sport), 2000 - 2016. Became an official medal sport at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/taekwondo-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Taekwondo Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wrestling ([[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]]) - (1908 - 2016). The first form of wrestling to be held at the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/wrestling-greco-roman-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Wrestling Greco Roman Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wrestling ([[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]]) - (1920 - 2016). Was modified at the 2000 Sydney Games and reduced the amount of weight categories provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/wrestling-freestyle-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Wrestling Freestyle Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pankration]] and [[singlestick]] are two other forms of combat sports that have been included in the olympics. These combat sports were introduced to the Olympic Games in the early 1900s however singlestick was only represented at the 1904 Olympic games and pankration whilst lasting four centuries in Ancient Greek Olympia's, was not included at all after 1900.
* [[Fencing]] - (1896 - 2016) Competitive fencing is one of the five activities which have been featured in every modern Olympic Games, the other four being athletics, cycling, swimming, and gymnastics.

== Protective Gear/Clothing ==
In combat sports, victory is obtained from blows, punches or attacks to the head to a point of physical injury that the opponent is unable to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ama.com.au/position-statement/combat-sport-2015|title=Combat Sport - 2015|date=2015-11-21|website=Australian Medical Association|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of combat sport have different rules and regulations into the equipment competitors have to wear. In Amateur boxing seen at the Olympics, competitors are permitted to wear head guards and correctly weighted padded gloves, mouth guards are optional and the canvas floor protection from a hard fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/boxing-equipment-and-history|title=Boxing Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sports such as Taekwondo, competitors are permitted to wear a trunk protector, head guard, gloves, groin guard and shin and forearm pads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/taekwondo-equipment-and-history|title=Taekwondo Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional boxing and UFC are two of the most dangerous combat sports in the world due to the lack of protective gear worn. Competitors in these two sports have the option to wear a mouthguard and must wear suitable gloves. The lack of protective clothing makes competitors vulnerable to concussion and further traumatic head injuries. A scientific experiment, conducted last year by Dr Andrew McIntosh of ACRISP at the Federation University of Australia, tested the impact of 7 different head guards in combat sport. The results of the experiment revealed the benefits of the combination of a glove and headguard in maximising the impact energy attenuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/17/1113.full|title=Sign In|publisher=|pmid=26192195}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by Lystad showed that combat sports with little to no protective gear such as MMA or boxing has an injury incidence rate range of 85.1-280.7 per 1000 athletes in comparison to another striking combat sport like Taekwondo which has a large amount of protective gear such as pads, headgear, mouth guard and gloves, has an injury incidence rate range of 19.1-138.8 per 1000 athletes. This means that injury rates are drastically lowered when protective gear is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lystad|first=Reidar|year=2015|title=Epidemiology of injuries in full-contact combat sports|journal=Australasian Epidemiologist|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''List of Protective Gear/Clothing'''
* Gloves
* Head gear
* Mouthguard
* Shin Guards
* Arm Guards
* Groin Guard
* Trunk Protector
* Wraps (Material wrapped around the hand that provides added protection and support)

== Fighting area ==
*Mat
::Circular, rectangular layout
*Ring
::boxing ring, sumo ring ([[dohyō]]), sand ring
*Fenced area (generically referred to as "cage")
::Can be round or have at least six sides. Cages vary: some replace the metal fencing with a net, others have a different shape (a hexagon, an octagon). The fenced area is called a cage, or a hexagon, an octagon depending on the shape.
*No-rope ring (sometimes referred by fans as "the pit") 
::A circle which is 27 feet in diameter, of which the inner 24 feet is colored blue. The next 3 feet is yellow, which is the caution area. When the fighter gets to the yellow area, he knows he's getting close to stepping out-of-bounds. The last edge of the ring is the red zone, which features a 30-degree upward angle. When a fighter steps on the red area, he's stepping up slightly, letting him know he's out-of-bounds.

'''Disabled sports''', also '''adaptive sports''' or '''parasports''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is parasport?|url=http://paralympic.ca/what-parasport|website=Canadian Paralympic Committee|publisher=Canadian Paralympic Committee|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sports played by persons with a [[disability]], including [[physical disability|physical]] and [[intellectual disabilities]]. As many disabled sports are based on existing able bodied sports, modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as ''adapted sports''. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in non-disabled sports. Disability exists in four categories: physical, mental, permanent and temporary.

==Organization and history==
Organized sport for athletes with a [[disability]] is generally divided into three broad disability groups: the [[deaf]], people with [[Physical disability|physical disabilities]], and people with [[intellectual disabilities]]. Each group has a distinct history, organization, competition program, and approach to sport.

Formal international competition in deaf sport began with the 1924 Paris ''Silent Games'', organized by the [[Comité International des Sports des Sourds]], CISS (The International Committee of Sports for the Deaf). These games evolved into the modern [[Deaflympics]], governed by the CISS. The CISS maintains separate games for deaf athletes based on their numbers, their special communication needs on the sports field, and the social interaction that is a vital part of sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=International Committee of Sport for the Deaf
 |url=http://www.deaflympics.com/about/ |accessdate=12 September 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized sport for persons with physical disabilities existed as early as 1911, when the "Cripples Olympiad" was held in the U.S.A.  One of the successful athletes was Walter William Francis, a Welshman, who won both the running and wrestling championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skipper Francis at Thames Star, New Zealand|date= 17 October 1913|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=THS19131017.2.25|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, events often developed out of rehabilitation programs. Following the [[Second World War]], in response to the needs of large numbers of injured ex-service members and civilians, sport was introduced as a key part of rehabilitation. Sport for rehabilitation grew into recreational sport and then into competitive sport. The pioneer of this approach was [[Ludwig Guttmann|Sir Ludwig Guttmann]] of the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England. In 1948, while the [[1948 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] were being held in London, he organized a sports competition for wheelchair athletes at Stoke Mandeville. This was the origin of the [[Stoke Mandeville Games]], from which evolved both the [[IWAS World Games]] and the [[Paralympic Games]]. The first official Paralympic Games, which were simultaneously the 9th International Stoke Mandeville Games ('international' having been added when Dutch service personal first took part in the Games in 1952), were held in Rome in 1960. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Paralympic Games were simultaneously the 13th, 17th and 21st international Stoke Mandeville Games.

In 1975, the Paralympic Games expanded to include those with limb amputations and visual impairments. Individuals with [[cerebral palsy]] were allowed to compete beginning in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Rory A.|last2=Nowak|first2=Christopher J.|title=Paralympics and veterans|journal=[[Journal of Rehabilitation Research &amp; Development]]|date=2011|volume=48|issue=10|pages=xi–xii|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2011.11.0209}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[Paralympic sports|Paralympic sport]] is governed by the [[International Paralympic Committee]], in conjunction with a wide range of other international sport organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympic Games|url=http://www.paralympic.org/Paralympic_Games/|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are numerous sport opportunities throughout the United States for injured service members, including cycling, wheelchair tennis, shooting, wheelchair basketball, track and field, adapted water sports, and snow skiing. One such program is the [[Army Wounded Warrior Program]], which offers [[sitting volleyball]] to injured service members. Some organizations also offer sport opportunities to family and friends of injured service members in addition to the members themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goff|first1=Mandy|title=Adapted Sport Programs for Veterans with Disabilities|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=March 2012|volume=83|issue=3|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport for persons with intellectual disabilities began to be organized in the 1960s through the [[Special Olympics]] movement.  This grew out of a series of summer camps organized by [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]], beginning in 1962. In 1968 the first international Special Olympics were held, in Chicago. Today, Special Olympics provides training and competition in a variety of sports for persons with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref name="so-history"&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=September 12, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport for persons with physical disabilities began to be organized in the US in the late 1960s through [[Disabled Sports USA]].  Disabled Sports USA was established in 1967 by disabled military veterans, including Jim Winthers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disabled Sports: Early History|url=http://www.disabledsportsusa.org/disabled-sports-early-history/|website=Disabled Sports USA|publisher=Disabled Sports USA|accessdate=2016-02-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205185150/http://www.disabledsportsusa.org/disabled-sports-early-history/|archivedate=2016-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help rehabilitate the injured soldiers returning from Vietnam&lt;ref&gt;Megan Crandall, [http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/newsroom/2011/april/NR_04_12_2011.html "BLM Enters Into Memorandum of Understanding with Disabled Sports USA"], ''US Bureau of Land Management Press Release'', December 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and originally named the National Amputee Skiers Association.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Durso, [http://www.pcma.org/Convene/Issue-Archives/June-2010/Leading-By-Example.htm "Leading By Example: Kirk Bauer Able-Bodied"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604114307/http://www.pcma.org/Convene/Issue-Archives/June-2010/Leading-By-Example.htm |date=June 4, 2012 }}, ''Convene Magazine'', June, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Hal O'Leary founded the [[National Sports Center for the Disabled]] (NSCD) at Winter Park in Colorado. Today, NSCD has 19 certified instructors and more than 1,000 volunteers. Disabled Sports USA has become one of the largest national multi-sport, multi-disability organizations in the United States, serving more than 60,000 wounded warriors, youth and adults annually.&lt;ref&gt;Candus Thomson, [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-07-31/sports/bs-sp-disabled-kilimanjaro-climber-20100731-12_1_mount-kilimanjaro-disabled-veterans-disabled-sports-usa "Disabled veterans vow to conquer Mount Kilimanjaro"], ''Baltimore Sun'', July 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the [[International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability]] (INAS-FID) was formed to support elite competition for athletes with intellectual disabilities. This was established in contrast to the more participative, "sport for all" approach of Special Olympics. For a time, athletes with intellectual disabilities were included in the Paralympic Games. After [[cheating at the Paralympic Games|a cheating scandal]] at the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]], where a number of athletes participating in intellectual disability events were revealed to not be disabled, INAS-FID athletes were banned from Paralympic competition, but the ban on intellectually disabled athletes has since been lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Extremity Games were formed for people with limb loss or limb difference to compete in [[extreme sports]]. [[College Park Industries]], a manufacturer of prosthetic feet, organized this event to give amputee athletes a venue to compete in this increasingly popular sports genre also referred to as [[action sports]].  This annual event held in the summer in Orlando, FL includes competitions in skateboarding, wakeboarding, rock climbing, mountain biking, surfing, moto-x and kayaking. Various organizations, such as Paradox Sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paradoxsports.org|title=Paradox Sports - Physical Adaptive Sports|work=Paradox Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; have arisen to help empower and inspire disabled people through equipping and welcoming them into the extreme sports community.

Also in 2006, The Federation de Internationale Powerchair Football Association and The [[United States Power Soccer Association]] were formed to standardize the rules of play and promote one of the few competitive team sports for motorized wheelchair users. [[Powerchair football]] (or power soccer).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/983162005|title=COMMUNICATION, SPORT AND DISABILITY : the case of power soccer.|last=S.|first=JEFFRESS, DR. MICHAEL|date=2017-01-01|publisher=ROUTLEDGE|isbn=9781138053588|oclc=983162005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a group of [[San Diego]], [[California]]-based athletes, coaches, volunteers, and parents split from [[Special Olympics]] Southern California to gain local control over disabled athletics programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20070426-9999-7m26special.html |title=Special Olympics members break away |publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune |date=2007-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group – [[SPORTS for Exceptional Athletes]] (S4EA) – serves people with developmental disabilities within the age range of 5 years old through adults. By combining people with and without disabilities, S4EA hopes that participating athletes will interact and form lasting bonds of friendship through shared sports and recreational activities in S4EA's served communities. Although the organization's focus is primarily [[San Diego County]], S4EA has grown from this base to satellite programs in [[Ventura, California|Ventura]] and [[Temecula]], [[California]].

Since 1988, the International Olympic Committee has chosen to validate Disabled Sports (physical disabilities) and incorporate it as a part of the Games: the staging of the Paralympic Games immediately follows the Olympic Games. This scheduling helps to foster greater interest in disabled sports. An investigation published on a Swiss website has /shown that more and more International Sports Federations list disabled athletes than any other sportsmen or sportswomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AB40V |location= Lausanne, Switzerland |url=http://www.wheelchair.ch/fra/sports/sports.html#ioh |title=Le Sport avant tout, avec ou sans handicap – Info Stades, Salle polyvalentes, Fédération Sportives, Clubs, Championnats... tout le Handisport |publisher=Wheelchair.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Paralympic-style [[multi-sport event]]s exist exclusively for wounded, injured or sick armed services personnel and veterans. These are the [[Warrior Games]] in the United States and the [[Invictus Games]] which originated in the United Kingdom.

Adapted sports help society learn about disability. They also can help remove some of the stigma associated with having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|last2=Nowak|title=Paralympics and veterans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==

A wide range of sports have been adapted to be played by people with various [[disability|disabilities]], as well as several that are unique just to disabled athletes. Within each movement, different sports are practised at different levels; for example, not all sports in the Paralympic movement are part of the Paralympic Games. In addition, many sports are practiced by persons with a disability outside the formal sports movements.

== Training ==
There is evidence to support that the use of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) as a training intervention can be implemented to increase the aerobic fitness, respiratory function, and overall quality of life in this population of athletes. Long term physiological adaptations through prolonged training demonstrated within athletes with disabilities include increased respiratory volume, improved executive functions and increased reaction time among other benefits in relation to non athletes in the same age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dehghansai|first=Nima|date=January 2017|title=Touro College-New York|url=https://erms.tourolib.org/url/http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=s3h&amp;AN=121353697&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Adapted physical activity quarterly|volume=34| issue =  1|pages=72–90|doi=10.1123/APAQ.2016-0030|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusion==
Beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s, work began within several countries and organizations to include athletes with disabilities in the non-disabled sport system. This included adding events for athletes with disabilities to major games such as the [[Olympic Games]] and the [[Commonwealth Games]], and integration of these athletes into non-disabled sports organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since 1984, the Olympics have included exhibition events for Paralympic athletes. However, integration of full medal events has not taken place, and the status of athletes with a [[disability]] in the Olympic movement remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2004 IOC decision |url=http://www.rickhansen.com/Media/News2004/IOCdecision.htm |website=www.rickhansen.com |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323103328/http://www.rickhansen.com/Media/News2004/IOCdecision.htm |archivedate=March 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the Commonwealth Games, athletes with a disability were first included in 1990 Auckland Commonwealth Games, then at the [[1994 Commonwealth Games|exhibition events in 1994]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Individual athletes such as swimmer [[Natalie du Toit]] and track athlete [[Oscar Pistorius]] have competed as equals against able bodied athletes at various events including the Olympic Games.

2013 the [[FIFA]] decided that Austrian footballer [[Martin Hofbauer]] can continue to play competitive [[association football|football]] with prosthetics after he lost his right lower leg due to cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steiermark.orf.at/news/stories/2583850/ FIFA erlaubt Steirer Einsatz mit Prothese], orf.at, 2013-05-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[self-determination theory]] has been one of the most proven theories on how athletes participate in competitions of this level. Studies have supported this theory especially in intellectually or developmentally disabled athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self Determination Theory: An Approach to Human Motivation &amp; Personality|url=http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have continued to question the motivation for joining such competitions like the [[Special Olympics]] as well as the [[Paralympic Games]]. The [[Motivations for joining the Special Olympics]] uncover themes among individuals and families for their participation or abstention from these Olympic programs.

There are specific strategies that may be employed to increase inclusion of people with disabilities in sports. This includes modifying rules or adapting activities for a  particular individual. As well, maintaining a non-competitive focus helps to increase the inclusion of participants with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Geidne"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geidne|first=Susanna|last2=Jerlinder|first2=Kajsa|date=2016-05-01|title=How sports clubs include children and adolescents with disabilities in their activities. A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ssr.2015.25.issue-1-2/ssr-2016-0002/ssr-2016-0002.xml|journal=Sport Science Review|language=en|volume=25|issue=1-2|doi=10.1515/ssr-2016-0002|issn=2069-7244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including children with intellectual disabilities in sports programs in which they play with non-disabled athletes results in these children becoming more involved in mainstream sports, incorporating more physical activity in their daily lives and it increases their interactions with children who are not disabled. It is important for children with disabilities to get different types of support while participating in sports programs, for example, direct support from coaches and other athletes, indirect support from parents and non-human support from therapy dogs. Activities should be modified to suit different types of children's abilities and inclusivity is easier when activities are non-competitive.&lt;ref name="Geidne"/&gt;

===Unified sports===
"Unified sports" involve teams made up of athletes with and without disabilities.&lt;ref name="specialolympics.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/unified-sports.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Unified Sports|work=specialolympics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, Special Olympics Unified Sports have been promoting social inclusion through shared sports training and competition. This initiative has expanded globally and now involves more than 700,000 players in 127 countries worldwide. The principle behind Unified Sports is simple: training together and playing together is a quick path to friendship and understanding.

The NBA has been a major supporter of Unified Sports, sponsoring the annual NBA Cares Special Olympics Unified Basketball Game during the NBA All-Star Weekend. The Walt Disney Company, ESPN and Special Olympics are also working on a two-year global initiative that will leverage the power of sports to promote an environment of social inclusion and acceptance.&lt;ref name="specialolympics.org"/&gt;

Disabled drivers have competed in motorsport versus fully abled drivers, for example [[Alex Zanardi]], [[Albert Llovera]], [[Clay Regazzoni]] and [[Jason Watt]].

==Summary==
The definition of an extreme sport is not exact and the origin of the term is unclear, but it gained popularity in the 1990s when it was picked up by [[marketing]] companies to promote the [[X Games]] and when the [[Extreme Sports Channel]] and the Extreme Sports Company launched. More recently, the commonly used definition from research is  "a competitive (comparison or self-evaluative) activity within which the participant is subjected to natural or unusual physical and mental challenges such as speed, height, depth or natural forces and where fast and accurate cognitive perceptual processing may be required for a successful outcome" by Dr. Rhonda Cohen (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/view/creators/Cohen=3ARhonda=3A=3A.html The relationship between personality, sensation seeking, reaction time and sport participation: evidence from drag racers, sport science students and archers]. PhD thesis, Middlesex University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Rhonda|last2=Baluch|first2=Bahman|last3=Duffy|first3=Linda J.|date=2018-10-18|title=Defining Extreme Sport: Conceptions and Misconceptions|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01974|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01974|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While use of the term "extreme sport" has spread everywhere to describe a multitude of different activities, exactly which sports are considered 'extreme' is debatable. There are, however, several characteristics common to most extreme sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cqresearcherblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/what-athletes-told-me.html|title=What the Athletes Told Me|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not the exclusive domain of youth, extreme sports tend to have a younger-than-average target demographic. Extreme sports are rarely sanctioned by schools.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Extreme sports tend to be more solitary than traditional sports&lt;ref name="americansportsdata.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |title='Generation Y' drives increasingly popular... |date=August 1, 2002 |publisher=AmericanSportsData.com |accessdate=2008-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162957/http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (rafting and paintballing are notable exceptions, as they are done in teams). In addition, beginning extreme athletes tend to work on their craft without the guidance of a coach (though some may hire a coach later).

Activities categorized by media as extreme sports differ from traditional [[sport]]s due to the higher number of inherently uncontrollable variables. These environmental variables are frequently weather and terrain related, including wind, snow, water and mountains. Because these natural phenomena cannot be controlled, they inevitably affect the outcome of the given activity or event.

In a traditional sporting event, athletes compete against each other under controlled circumstances. While it is possible to create a controlled sporting event such as X Games, there are environmental variables that cannot be held constant for all athletes. Examples include changing snow conditions for [[snowboard]]ers, rock and ice quality for [[climbing|climbers]], and wave height and shape for [[surfing|surfers]].

Whilst traditional sporting judgment criteria may be adopted when assessing performance (distance, time, score, etc.), extreme sports performers are often evaluated on more subjective and aesthetic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Jungmin Lee (2004), [https://ideas.repec.org/p/ecm/nasm04/122.html Extreme Sports Evaluation: Evidence from Judging Figure Skating, Econometric Society]&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a tendency to reject unified judging methods, with different sports employing their own ideals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/19/DI2006061900992.html|title='Adrenaline': Extreme Sports|accessdate=2008-07-11 | work=The Washington Post | first1=Jon | last1=Wile | first2=Sonny | last2=Amato | date=2006-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed having the ability to evolve their assessment standards with new trends or developments in the sports.

==Classification==
While the exact definition and what is included as extreme sport is debatable, some attempted to make classification for extreme sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomlinson, Joe |title=Extreme Sports: In Search of the Ultimate Thrill |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd |location=Hove |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-55297-992-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument is that to qualify as an "extreme sport" '''both''' expression terms need to be fulfilled;
* "'''sport'''": The participant has to dispose of considerable skill and/or physical ability to avoid ''poor execution of the activity'';
* "'''extreme'''": ''poor execution of the activity'' has to result in considerable risk of serious physical harm to the participant;

Along this definition, an activity such as [[bungee jumping]] may not qualify as no skill or physical ability is required to execute a good jump (i.e., avoid poor execution). A passenger in a canyon [[jet boat]] ride will not fulfill the requirements, as the skill required pertains to the pilot, not the passengers. "[[Thrill seeking]]" might in these cases be a more suitable qualification than "extreme sport".{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Extreme sports may be subdivided into:

===Extreme vehicle sports===

These sports require the use of  snow, ice or water sports ("sports de glisse" in French) and '''rolling''' sports. Another subdivision can be made along '''motorized''' and '''non motorized''' vehicle sports, resulting in the following matrix;{{cn|date=July 2018}}

== History ==

[[File:ExtremeSports3.png|right|thumb|upright=2]]

The origin of the divergence of the term "extreme sports" from "sports" may date to the 1950s in the appearance of a phrase usually, but wrongly, attributed to [[Ernest Hemingway]].&lt;ref name="Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timelesshemingway.com/content/quotationsfaq#threesports |title=Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203013838/http://www.timelesshemingway.com/content/quotationsfaq |archivedate=February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The implication of the phrase was that the word "sport" defined an activity in which one might be killed. The other activities being termed "games". The phrase may have been invented by either writer [[Barnaby Conrad]] or automotive author [[Ken Purdy]].&lt;ref name="Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5"/&gt;

The [[Dangerous Sports Club]] of [[Oxford University]], [[England]] was founded by [[David Kirke (bungee jumper)|David Kirke]], Chris Baker, Ed Hulton and [[Alan Weston]]. They first came to wide public attention by inventing modern day [[bungee jumping]], by making the first modern jumps on 1 April 1979, from the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], [[Bristol, England]]. They followed the Clifton Bridge effort with a jump from the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (including the first female bungee jump by Jane Wilmot), and with a televised leap from the [[Royal Gorge]] Suspension Bridge in [[Colorado]], sponsored by and televised on the popular [[United States|American]] television program ''[[That's Incredible!]]'' [[Bungee jumping]] was treated as a novelty for a few years, then became a craze for young people, and is now an established industry for thrill seekers.
The Club also pioneered a surrealist form of skiing, holding three events at [[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], in which competitors were required to devise a sculpture mounted on skis and ride it down a mountain. The event reached its limits when the Club arrived in St. Moritz with a London [[double-decker bus]], wanting to send it down the ski slopes, and the Swiss resort managers refused.

Other Club activities included expedition [[hang gliding]] from active [[volcano]]es; the launching of giant (60&amp;nbsp;ft) plastic spheres with pilots suspended in the centre ([[zorbing]]); [[microlight]] flying; and [[BASE jumping]] (in the early days of this sport).

In recent decades the term ''extreme sport'' was further promoted after the [[Extreme Sports Channel]], Extreme.com launched and then the X Games, a multi-sport event was created and developed by [[ESPN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-364109.html |title=extreme sports |year=2007 |publisher=[[Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023120444/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-364109.html |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15836448.html |title=Generation Ex – the Extreme Games, a competition for people with exceptional athletic talents |year=1994 |author=Josh Krulewitz |work=American Fitness |via=[[HighBeam]]|subscription=yes |accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first X Games (known as 1995 Extreme Games) were held in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Mount Snow]], and [[Vermont]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589555/Extreme_Sports.html |publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia |title=Extreme Sports – Encarta |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwc2bMeg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589555/Extreme_Sports.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutXGames&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expn.go.com/intl/s/about.html |title=About International X Games |year=2002 |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829202819/http://expn.go.com/intl/s/about.html |archivedate=2008-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain extreme sports clearly trace back to other extreme sports, or combinations thereof. For example, [[windsurfing]] was conceived as a result of efforts to equip a [[surfing|surfboard]] with a [[Sailing|sailing boat's]] propulsion system (mast and sail). [[Kitesurfing]] on the other hand was conceived by combining the propulsion system of [[kite buggying]] (a [[parafoil]]) with the bi-directional boards used for [[wakeboarding]]. [[Wakeboarding]] is in turn derived from [[snowboarding]] and [[waterskiing]].

== Marketing ==
[[File:Hanggliding03042006.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hang glider]] launching from [[Mount Tamalpais]]]]
Some contend&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE5DD133DF93BA35751C0A96E958260 "Extreme Sport, Extreme Chic, Extreme Hype"], ''New York Times'', February 8, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one has as much to do with marketing as with the level of danger involved or the adrenaline generated. For example, rugby union is both dangerous and adrenaline-inducing but is not considered an extreme sport due to its traditional image, and because it does not involve high speed or an intention to perform [[stunt]]s (the aesthetic criteria mentioned above) and also it does not have changing environmental variables for the athletes.

== Motivation ==
[[File:Snowboarder cornice at sugarbowl.jpg|right|thumb|Snowboarder drops off a cornice.]]
A feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce an [[adrenaline]] rush in participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |date=August 1, 2002 |title='Generation Y' Drives Increasingly Popular... |publisher=AmericanSportsData.com |accessdate=2008-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162957/http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the medical view is that the rush or high associated with the activity is not due to adrenaline being released as a response to fear, but due to increased levels of [[dopamine]], [[endorphin]]s and [[serotonin]] because of the high level of physical exertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konkel|first1=Lindsey|title=Extreme Psychology|url=http://scienceline.org/2009/07/health-konkel-extreme-sports-risk-psychology/|website=ScienceLine.org|publisher=New York University|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a recent study suggests that the link to adrenaline and 'true' extreme sports is tentative.&lt;ref&gt;Brymer, Eric and Gray, Tonia, ''Extreme Sports: A Challenge to Phenomenology''. University of Wollongong, Australia, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The study defined 'true' extreme sports as a leisure or recreation activity where the most likely outcome of a mismanaged accident or mistake was death. This definition was designed to separate the marketing hype from the activity.

Eric Brymer&lt;ref&gt;Brymer, Eric, ''Extreme Dude: A Phenomenological Perspective on the Extreme sports experience ''. University of Wollongong, Australia, 2005 {{cite web|url=http://www.library.uow.edu.au/adt-NWU/public/adt-NWU20060508.145406/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721115425/http://www.library.uow.edu.au/adt-NWU/public/adt-NWU20060508.145406/index.html |archivedate=2008-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also found that the potential of various extraordinary human experiences, many of which parallel those found in activities such as meditation, was an important part of the extreme sport experience. Those experiences put the participants outside their [[comfort zone]] and are often done in conjunction with [[adventure travel]].

Some of the sports have existed for decades and their proponents span generations, some going on to become well known personalities. Rock climbing and [[ice climbing]] have spawned publicly recognizable names such as [[Edmund Hillary]], [[Chris Bonington]], [[Wolfgang Güllich]] and more recently [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]. Another example is surfing, invented centuries ago by the inhabitants of [[Hawaii]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Mortality==
[[File:Wingsuit-01.jpg|thumb|[[Wingsuit flying]] is a recent activity.]]
Extreme sports by their nature can be extremely dangerous, conducive to fatalities, near-fatalities and other serious injuries, and sometimes consist in treading along the brink of death. This imminent and inherent danger in these sports has been considered a somewhat necessary part of its appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://articles.philly.com/2013-02-03/sports/36723401_1_extreme-sports-snowmobile-backflip |title = In extreme sports, the X-factor is death |last = Smallwood |first = John |accessdate= 11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is partially a result of pressure for athletes to make more money and provide maximum entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://money.msn.com/now/post.aspx?post=1ef3fc34-dc7b-4421-974f-d3b7b37e8006 |title = Recent deaths draw attention to extreme sports |last = Kennedy |first = Bruce |accessdate= 11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disabled community==
Disabled people participate in extreme sports. Nonprofit organizations such as Adaptive Action Sports seek to increase awareness of the participation in action sports by members of the disabled community, as well as increase access to the adaptive technologies that make participation possible and to competitions such as The X Games.{{Advert inline|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Adaptive-Sports.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Adaptive Action Sports - Amy Purdy"'' (2010)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/x-games.html|title=''Ability Magazine: X Games - Adaptive Sports"'' (2010)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
Extreme sports is a sub-category of sports than are described as any kind of sport "of a character or kind farthest removed from the ordinary or average".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/14931/|title = A Phenomenological Investigation of the Experience of Taking Part in 'Extreme Sports'|last = Willig|first = Carla|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Health Psychology|doi = 10.1177/1359105307082459|pmid = |access-date =|volume=13|pages=690–702}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of sports often carry out the potential risk of serious and permanent physical injury and even death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/55275/|title = Extreme sports are good for your health: A phenomenological understanding of fear and anxiety in extreme sport.|author1=Brymer, E. |author2= Schweitzer, R. |last-author-amp=yes |date = 2013 |origyear=2012|journal = Journal of Health Psychology|doi = 10.1177/1359105312446770|pmid = |access-date = |volume=18 |pages=477–487}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these sports also have the potential to produce drastic benefits on mental and physical health.

Health is an individual's state of mental and physical well-being in which they are maximising their daily potential. It is divided into two main categories: mental and physical.

Mental health is a cognitive state of well-being, in this state the individual is aware of his or how own potential and is able to; cope with stresses of normal life and work productively, as well as willing to give their contribution to his or her community in a beneficial way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/mental_health/en/|title = Mental Health|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical health can be defined as a state of complete physical well-being in which an individual is mechanically fit to perform their daily activities and duties without any problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cheshireeast.gov.uk/social_care_and_health/health_advice/physical_health.aspx|title = Physical Health|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme sports trigger the release of the hormone adrenaline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = X-games: Are you equipped for the extreme? (high-risk sports).|last = Globus|first = S|date = 1997|journal = Current Health 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very powerful hormone as it can cause human beings to perform tremendous stunts of many sorts. However, with a bad mix of other hormones it can lead people to execute terrible actions. It is believed that the implementation of extreme sports on mental health patients improves their perspective and recognition of aspects of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''fantasy sport''' (also known less commonly as '''rotisserie''' or '''roto''') is a type of online game where participants assemble imaginary or virtual teams of real players of a professional sport.  These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those players' players in actual games.  This performance is converted into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by each fantasy team's manager.  These point systems can be simple enough to be manually calculated by a "league commissioner" who coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of the professional sport.  In fantasy sports, team owners draft, trade and cut (drop) players, analogously to real sports.

Simulation games such as [[Strat-O-Matic]] are not considered fantasy sport, because they are not scored using real results of actual sporting events.

==History==

===Early history===

The concept of picking players and running a contest based on their year-to-date stats has been around since shortly after [[World War II]]. One of the earliest published accounts of fantasy sports involved [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] businessman and one time [[Oakland Raiders]] limited partner Wilfred "Bill" Winkenbach.  He devised [[fantasy golf]] in the latter part of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/sports/wink-wilfred-bill-winkenbach-invented-fantasy-football-way-back-in-1962-with-gopppl-in-oakland|title='Wink': Wilfred 'Bill' Winkenbach invented Fantasy Football way back in 1962 with GOPPPL in Oakland|publisher=newsnet5.com|date=2014-09-11|accessdate=2015-09-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929163914/http://www.newsnet5.com/sports/wink-wilfred-bill-winkenbach-invented-fantasy-football-way-back-in-1962-with-gopppl-in-oakland|archivedate=2015-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each player selected a team of professional golfers and the person with the lowest combined total of strokes at the end of the tournament would win.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Golf is a simple fantasy game to administer and keep tabs on, since each participant is concerned only with the scores of his or her team members without anything else to complicate it. However, it was never organized into a widespread hobby or formal business.

In Oakland in 1962, Winkenbach formed the first reported [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]] league, called the Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League (GOPPPL), with eight teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jon | last=Saraceno | coauthors= | title=As fantasy football fever continues to spread, it's not all geeks to me | date=2006-08-17 | publisher= | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/saraceno/2006-08-17-saraceno-fantasy-football_x.htm | work =USA Today | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Blanda]] was the first player taken in the first draft in 1963.
[http://www.nflplayers.com/fantasy/gopppl_draft.htm 1963 draft results]

The first reported [[fantasy baseball]] league began in Boston in 1960. [[Harvard University]] [[sociologist]] [[William A. Gamson|William Gamson]] started the "Baseball Seminar" where colleagues would form rosters that earned points on the players' final standings in batting average, [[Run batted in|RBI]], [[Earned run average|ERA]] and wins.&lt;ref name="The Numbers Game p. 175"&gt;[[Alan Schwarz]]: ''The Numbers Game : Baseball's Lifelong Fascination with Statistics'' [[Thomas Dunne Books]] p. 175, {{ISBN|0-312-32222-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamson later brought the idea with him to the [[University of Michigan]] where some professors played the game. One professor playing the game was Bob Sklar, who taught an American Studies seminar which included [[Daniel Okrent]], who learned of the game his professor played.&lt;ref name="The Numbers Game p. 175"/&gt; At around the same time a league from [[Rowan University|Glassboro State College]] also formed a similar baseball league and had its first draft in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Modern founding of rotisserie===

An important development in fantasy sports came with the development of Rotisserie League Baseball in 1980 (although research 
suggests a team of players from Southern New Jersey have been running the same style league since 1976 making them the first Rotisserie players).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Magazine writer/editor [[Daniel Okrent]] is credited with inventing it, the name coming from the New York City restaurant La Rotisserie Francaise where he and some friends used to meet and play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lisa | last=Tozzi | coauthors= | title=The Great Pretenders | year=1999 | publisher=The Austin Chronicle | url =http://weeklywire.com/ww/07-05-99/austin_xtra_feature2.html | work = | pages = | accessdate =2008-12-16 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game's innovation was that "owners" in a Rotisserie league would draft teams from the list of active Major League Baseball players and would follow their statistics during the ongoing season to compile their scores.  In other words, rather than running realistic simulations using statistics for seasons whose outcomes were already known, the owners would have to make similar predictions about players' playing time, health, and expected performance that real baseball managers must make.

Because Okrent was a member of the media, other journalists, especially sports journalists, were introduced to the game. Many early players were introduced to the game by these sports journalists, especially during the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike]]; with little else to write about, many baseball writers wrote columns about Rotisserie league.  A July 8, 1980 New York Times Article titled "What George Steinbrenner is to the American League, Lee Eisenberg is to the Rotisseries League" set off a media storm that led to stories about the league on CBS TV and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Sam | last=Walker | coauthors= | title=Fantasyland | year=2006 | publisher=Viking | url =http://www.fantasyland.com | work = | page =145 | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1981, Dan Okrent wrote an essay about the Rotisserie League for [[Inside Sports]] called "The Year George Foster Wasn't Worth $36."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Sam | last=Walker | coauthors= | title=Fantasyland | year=2006 | publisher=Viking | url =http://www.fantasyland.com | work = | page =70 | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article included the rules of the game. Founders of the original Rotisserie league published a guide book starting in 1984.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1982, Ballantine published the first widely available [[Bill James]] Abstract, which helped fuel fantasy baseball interest. Fantasy fans often used James' statistical tools and analysis as a way to improve their teams.&lt;ref name="moneyball"&gt;[[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]]: ''Moneyball: the art of winning an unfair game'' [[W. W. Norton]], [[New York City|New York]] c2003., {{ISBN|0-393-05765-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was not a fantasy player and barely acknowledged fantasy baseball in his annual Abstract, but fantasy baseball interest is credited with his strong sales.&lt;ref name="moneyball"/&gt;

In 1988, [[USA Today]] estimated that there were thousands of leagues in the US, typically 8 to 12 players.&lt;ref name="USAT1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shushter|first1=Rachel|title=The game is fantasy but the addiction is real|agency=USA Today|date=May 12, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hobby had spread to football as well.&lt;ref name="USAT2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Football's in the air via fantasy leagues|agency=USA Today|date=August 12, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and early participants===

In the few years after Okrent helped popularize fantasy baseball, a host of experts and businesses emerged to service the growing hobby. Okrent, based on discussions with colleagues at USA Today, credits Rotisserie league baseball with much of USA Today's early success,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} since the paper provided much more detailed box scores than most competitors and eventually even created a special paper, ''[[Sports Weekly|Baseball Weekly]]'', that almost exclusively contained statistics and box scores.

The first experts on record as having written fantasy baseball articles for USA Today were John Benson, Alex Patton, and Ron Shandler.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Perhaps the most well-known fantasy baseball expert in the late 1980s and early 1990s was Benson, who published his first fantasy baseball book in 1989. Later that year Benson developed the first draft-simulation program, software that he still sells today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fantasyland |last=Walker |first=Sam |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=110|isbn= 0143038435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patton published his first book ("Patton's 1989 Fantasy Baseball League Price Guide") in 1989 and his dollar values were included in USA Today Baseball Weekly's fantasy annual throughout the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
[[Ron Shandler]] published his "Baseball SuperSTATS" book in November 1986. At first the book wasn't meant for fantasy 
baseball fans, but rather as a book of Sabermetric analysis.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Fantasy football also saw new businesses and growth. Fantasy Football Index became the first annual fantasy football guide in 1987. Fantasy Sports Magazine debuted in 1989 as the first regular publication covering more than one fantasy sport. Fantasy Football Weekly was launched in 1992 (later becoming [[Fanball|Fanball.com]]) and had $2 million in revenue by 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jim | last=Martyka | coauthors= | title=Fantasy fans get new outlet | date= 2000-02-28 | publisher=American City Business Journals | url =http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/1999/09/13/story3.html | work =Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of companies emerged to calculate the stats for fantasy leagues and primarily send results via fax.

In 1993, USA Today included a weekly columnist on fantasy baseball, John Hunt, and he became perhaps the most visible writer in the industry before the rise of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netshrine.com/jhunt.html |title=NetShrine was privileged to interview USA Today Baseball Weekly Fantasy Insider columnist John Hunt |accessdate=2007-07-28 |date=2000-06-25 |work=NetShrine |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024943/http://www.netshrine.com/jhunt.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt started the first high-profile experts league, the [[LABR|League of Alternate Baseball Reality]] which first included notables as [[Peter Gammons]], [[Keith Olbermann]] and [[Bill James]].&lt;ref name="LABR"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hobby continued to grow with 1 million to 3 million playing from 1991 to 1994.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Modern times===

====Internet boom====

A large factor in the growth of fantasy sports was the rise of the Internet and personal computers in the mid-1990s. The new technology lowered the barrier to entry to the hobby as stats could quickly be compiled online and news and information became readily available.

In 1991 2 guys from Dallas, TX created what was known as the first computerized Fantasy Sports Application.  AutoStat was launched in the spring of 1991 by the company Fantasy Sports, Inc. for Baseball.  The software was a huge success, but the public was not quite ready to deal with comm ports, serial cables and 1200 Baud modems.   After 4 years, sadly Fantasy Sports, Inc. closed its doors.  

In early October 1995, what would become a popular fantasy hockey website was released by [[Molson|Molson Breweries]].&lt;ref name="fantasy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strategyonline.ca/1995/10/16/11295-19951016/|title=Hockey Net in Canada: Molson scores with fantasy league|last=Summerfield|first=Patti|publisher=strategy (Brunico Communications)|date=16 October 1995| accessdate=2003-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the company's "I am Online" strategy and centred on its "[[I am Canadian]]" 
advertising campaign; it would focus on music, entertainment and hockey.&lt;ref name="iamonline"&gt;{{cite news|title=Molson uncaps Internet site aimed at young adults|last=McHutchion|first=John|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers| date=20 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website allowed visitors to register accounts and participate in hockey leagues of nine teams in which the visitor would be the general manager for one of those teams.&lt;ref name="fantasy" /&gt; The general manager would draft a team from a pool of NHL players, and could later negotiate trades with other teams in the league.&lt;ref name="fantasy" /&gt; Disputes would be arbitrated by a commissioner by [[email]].&lt;ref name="fantasy" /&gt; The site included daily updates of NHL statistics, and also featured content from the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="fantasy" /&gt; On 24 May 1996, Molson Breweries won the International Digital Media Award for best website of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playbackonline.ca/1996/06/03/5401-19960603/|title=Int’l. Digital Media Awards|others=Playback Staff|publisher=Playback (Brunico Communications)|date=3 June 1996|accessdate=2003-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasy businesses began to migrate to the internet in the mid-1990s.  In 1997, two such sites that debuted were Commissioner.com and [[Rotowire|RotoNews.com]].

Commissioner.com launched on January 1, 1997 and first offered a fantasy baseball commissioner service that offered real-time statistics, league message boards, daily updated box scores and other features. Commissioner.com was sold to [[CBS SportsLine.com|SportsLine]] late in 1999 for $31 million in cash and stock.&lt;ref name="sportsbusinessjournal.com"&gt;{{cite news | first=Russell | last=Adams | coauthors= | title=Peter Pezaris | date= | publisher=Street &amp; Smiths | url =http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.feature&amp;featureId=710 | work =SportsBusiness Journal | pages = 
| accessdate = 2007-07-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale proved fantasy sports had grown from a mere hobby to big business. By 2003, Commissioner.com helped [[CBS SportsLine.com|SportsLine]] generate $11 million from fantasy revenue.&lt;ref name="sportsbusinessjournal.com"/&gt; Commissioner.com is now the fantasy sports engine behind the [[CBSSports.com]] fantasy area 
(after SportsLine was sold to CBS in 2004).

[[Rotowire|RotoNews.com]] also launched in January 1997 and published its first player note on February 16, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rotowire.com/blog/20-years-ago-today/ |title=It was 20 years ago today |last=Schoenke |first=Peter |publisher=RotoWire.com |date=2017-02-17 |accessdate=2017-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  RotoNews added additional value to fantasy sports players by creating player notes, which were snippets of information every time a player got hurt, traded, benched or had a news event that impacted his fantasy value - all search-able in a real-time database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Sean | last=Nolan | coauthors= | title=Access Magazine | date=1999-08-16 | publisher= | url =http://www.presstelegram.com/ | work =Long Beach Press-Telegram | page =15 | accessdate = 2007-07-24 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most sites today follow how RotoNews had a "news" and "analysis" element to each player update. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Within two years RotoNews had become one of the top ten most trafficked sports sites on the web, according to Media Metrix, ranking higher than such sites as NBA.com&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schoenke. (n.d.). Retrieved May 31, 2018, from https://fsta.site-ym.com/page/schoenke&lt;/ref&gt;.RotoNews.com was sold to [[Broadband Sports]] in 1999 and later survived as [[RotoWire.com]].

The growth in fantasy sports revenue attracted larger media players. [[Yahoo|Yahoo.com]] added fantasy sports in 1999 and offered most 
of its games for free - a largely new business model for fantasy sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=173646 |title=Yahoo! Sports Hits Home Run With Free Fantasy Baseball |accessdate=2007-10-28 |date=1999-02-23 |work=Yahoo! |publisher=Yahoo! }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A trade group for the industry, the [[Fantasy Sports Trade Association]] was formed in 1998.

Other entries to the market during this era included Fanball.com, launched in 1999 by the parent company of Fantasy Football Weekly.&lt;ref name="urlwire.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urlwire.com/newsarchive/083199.html |title=Fanball.com, Inc. Announces the Launch of Fanball.com |accessdate=2007-10-28 |date=1999-08-31 |publisher=Fanball }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early survey of the fantasy sports market in the U.S. in 1999 showed 29.6 million people age 18 and older played fantasy 
games.  However, that figure was reduced in later years when it was determined the survey also included people who play NCAA bracket pools, which are not fantasy sports, since they involved picking teams, not individual players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jeff | last=Zillgitt | coauthors= | title=We certainly live in a fantasy world | date=2000-02-28 | publisher= | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/comment/jzcol53.htm | work =USA Today | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internet era====

While fantasy sports were fueled by the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com]] boom of the Internet, there was a turbulent period when many of the high-flying Internet companies of the era crashed in 2001.  Fanball.com went bankrupt in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Tellijohn | coauthors= | title=Fanball stays in play | date= 2002-05-05| publisher=American City Business Journals | url =http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2002/05/06/story8.html | work =Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (later to re-emerge in 2001). RotoNews.com's parent company, [[Broadband Sports]], went out of business in 2001. The company would re-emerge as [[RotoWire.com]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

There were also different business models. [[RotoWire|RotoNews.com]] launched the Web's first free commissioner service in 1998, quickly becoming the largest league management service.&lt;ref name="urlwire.com"/&gt; [[Yahoo! Fantasy Sports|Yahoo.com]] became the first major media company to offer games for free in 1999. Due to the rising competition, Commissioner.com, which had charged as much as $300, offered its commissioner services for free starting with football in 2000.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Two years later the trend reversed. Sportsline moved back to a pay model for commissioner services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=John | last=Hunt | coauthors= | title=You might have to pay to help you play | date=2002-03-12 | publisher=Gannett | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/bbw/2002-03-13/getting-started.htm | work =USA Today | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which it largely still has today).  TheHuddle.com, a free site since 1997, started to charge for information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Smaller Fantasy Football Web Sites Prove Popular for Information | date=2005-08-28 | publisher= | url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/222525/smaller_fantasy_football_web_sites_prove_popular_for_information/ | work =RedOrbit | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RotoWire.com]] moved from a free model to a pay model in 2001 as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=JOE | last=SALKOWSKI | coauthors= | title=Subscription Model Creeps Into More Gash-Needy Sites | date=2001-05-01 | publisher=Tribune Company | url =http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Subscription+Model+Creeps+Into+More+Gash-Needy+Sites-a079916132 | work =Chicago Tribune | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the economic instability, fantasy sports started to become a mainstream hobby. In 2002, the [[NFL]] found that the average male surveyed spent 6.6 hours a week watching the NFL on TV; fantasy players surveyed said they watched 8.4 hours of NFL per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Terry | last=Lefton | coauthors= | title=Survey results push nfl.com to increase fantasy content | date=2002-09-09 | publisher=Street &amp; Smith's Sports Group | url =http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.show_article&amp;articleId=24518&amp;keyword=fantasy%20sports%20chris%20russo%20NFL | work =Sports Business Journal | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "This is the first time we've been able to demonstrate specifically that fantasy play drives TV viewing," said Chris Russo, the NFL's senior vice president. The NFL began running promotional television ads for fantasy football featuring current players for the first time. Previously fantasy sports had largely been seen in a negative light by the major sports leagues.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Fantasy sports continued to grow with a 2003 [[Fantasy Sports Trade Association]] survey showing 15 million people playing fantasy football and spending about $150 a year on average, making it a $1.5 billion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Fantasy Sports Industry Now over 15 Million |date=2003-08-14 |publisher= |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2003_August_14/ai_106587252 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711150417/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2003_August_14/ai_106587252 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-11 |work=Business Wire |pages= |accessdate=2007-10-28 |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently a 2013 article by Forbes.com shows 32 million Americans spend $467 per person or about $15 billion in total playing. https://www.forbes.com/sites/briangoff/2013/08/20/the-70-billion-fantasy-football-market/#30a3709d755c

In autumn 2008, the [[Montana Lottery]], one of only four U.S. states to legalize [[sports betting]] at the time, began offering fantasy 
sports wagering for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.montanalottery.com/history |title=How it all started|publisher=montanalottery.com|accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012 there has been a boom of apps being built for fantasy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greg Greenhalgh Brendan Dwyer Brian Biggio|title=There's An App For That|journal=Journal of Applied Sport Management|date=Winter 2014|volume=Vol. 6|issue=No. 4|pages=23|url=js.sagamorepub.com/jasm/article/download/6093/4851|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These apps, and the nature of play within them, are changing the fantasy sports landscape and how users consume them.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

====Daily fantasy sports====
{{main|Daily fantasy sports}}


Daily fantasy sports (or DFS) contests are played across shorter periods of time, such as a single week of a season, rather than an entire season. Daily fantasy games are typically played as "contests" subject to an entry fee, which funds an advertised prize pool and an administrative fee is partially collected as revenue for the service.&lt;ref name="nv-memo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legality of Daily Fantasy Sports Under Nevada Law|url=http://gaming.nv.gov/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=10487|publisher=State of Nevada|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily fantasy sports began to emerge in 2007 with the launch of Fantasy Sports Live&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rotogrinders.com/static/daily-fantasy-sports-timeline |title=The evolution of the daily fantasy sports industry |accessdate=2017-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2008, NBC launched SnapDraft; and FanDuel quickly became the prominent DFS site shortly after it launched in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rotogrinders.com/static/daily-fantasy-sports-timeline |title=The evolution of the daily fantasy sports industry |accessdate=2017-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. DFS experienced a major increase in prominence in 2014 and 2015 with the dramatic growth of two competing services: [[DraftKings]] and [[FanDuel]]. Both received venture capital investments from various firms, including sports teams and broadcasters, and became known for running aggressive marketing campaigns with an emphasis on large cash prizes.&lt;ref name=wp-dfs1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kilgore|first1=Adam|title=Daily fantasy sports Web sites find riches in Internet gaming law loophole|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/daily-fantasy-sports-web-sites-find-riches-in-internet-gaming-law-loophole/2015/03/27/92988444-d172-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html|work=The Washington Post|date=March 27, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-dfs1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chernova|first1=Yuliya|title=FanDuel Raises $70 Million as Daily Fantasy Sports Battle Heats Up|date=September 2, 2014|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/09/02/fanduel-raises-70-million-as-daily-fantasy-sports-battle-heats-up/|accessdate=October 15, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fantasy-sports-create-billion-dollar-startups-1436846402|title=Fantasy Sports Create Billion-Dollar Startups|author=Lora Kolodny|date=July 14, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sbj-pushes&gt;{{cite news|title=Daily fantasy pushes to continue growth streak|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/03/16/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/Daily-fantasy.aspx|accessdate=October 8, 2015|work=Sports Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legality of daily fantasy games has been challenged, with critics, as well as the state of Nevada, arguing that they closer-resemble [[proposition bet|proposition]] [[sports betting|wagering]] on athlete performance than a traditional fantasy sports game, while DraftKings' CEO has referred to its games as being similar to [[online poker]].&lt;ref name="nv-memo"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wp-dfs1/&gt;&lt;ref name=lvrj-dkceo&gt;{{cite news|title=AG: DraftKings CEO called daily fantasy sports 'a casino'|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/gambling/ag-draftkings-ceo-called-daily-fantasy-sports-casino|accessdate=19 October 2015|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; DFS providers have cited the UIGEA's exemptions of fantasy sports as being a general exception for their legality; their legality is subject to how individual states classify a game of chance.&lt;ref name=bloomberg-sheerchutzpah&gt;{{cite news|title=How Will the Government Change the Game for Daily Fantasy Sports?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-15/how-will-the-government-change-the-game-for-daily-fantasy-sports-|accessdate=20 October 2015|work=Bloomberg News|date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily Fantasy Sports have not historically offered in 5 states [Iowa, Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Washington] that have laws stating a game that involves any chance is gambling. In addition several other states have murky legal environments for paid fantasy sports contests with negative AG opinions or in the case of Nevada, requiring a gambling license. As a result, Draftkings and Fanduel are active in only 39 states. Neither is currently accepting customers in Washington, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana, Alabama or Nevada. Additionally, Fanduel is not accepting customers from Texas. In his final remarks at the January 2016 FTSA conference in Dallas, Fantasy Sports Trade Association President Paul Charchian said "We need to formally legalize fantasy play in 50 states."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/14799449/daily-fantasy-dfs-legal-your-state-state-state-look|title=Daily fantasy sports state-by-state tracker|last=Rodenberg|first=Ryan|date=July 26, 2017|website=ESPN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since initial legal challenges, 19 states have since enacted laws confirming that DFS contests are legal games of skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gouker |first=Dustin |url=https://www.legalsportsreport.com/16802/ohio-sends-fantasy-sports-bill-governor/ |title=Ohio Sends Fantasy Sports Bill To Governor; Would Be 18th State With Law |work=Legal Sports Report |date=2017-12-05 |accessdate=2017-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry overview==

===Size of the industry===

In May 2015, Australian research company research firm IBISWorld reported that fantasy sport was a $2B industry, experiencing 10.7% annual growth, and employing 4,386 people in 292 businesses.&lt;ref name=IBISWorld&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/fantasy-sports-services.html |title=Fantasy Sports Services in the US: Market Research Report|publisher=IBISWorld.com|accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, Fantasy sports is a $7.22 billion industry with 59.3 million fantasy sports players in the United States and Canada as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://fsta.org/press-release-fantasy-sports-now-a-7-billion-industry/ |title=antasy Sports Now a $7 Billion Industry&lt;!lang&gt; |language={$lang}&lt;/!lang&gt; |publisher=FSTA |date=2017-06-23 |accessdate=2017-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth of the market===

A prior study conducted by the FSTA in 2013, showed 33.5 million people age 12 and above in the U.S. with the 2011 FSTA Study showing 3.1 million people in Canada played fantasy sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fantasy Sports Conference Demographic Survey Shows Continued Growth | date=2007-08-02 | publisher=PR Web | url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/8/prweb543818.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-09 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 
2006 study showed 22 percent of U.S. adult males 18 to 49 years old, with Internet access, play fantasy sports. Fantasy Sports 
is estimated to have a $3–$4 Billion annual economic impact across the sports industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Stephen |

====International growth of fantasy sports====

The fantasy sports hobby has also moved beyond the U.S. Fantasy leagues for soccer, cricket and other sports have come up. For example, according to a 2008 study by Paris, France research company Ipsos, the number of British fantasy sports players aged 16–64 is estimated to range between 5.5 and 7.5 million.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Of those, 80 percent of these players participate in fantasy soccer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2009/09/Issue-6/Sponsorships-Advertising-Marketing/Fantasy-Players-Seen-As-Big-Spenders-In-Key-Consumer-Categories.aspx | title = Fantasy Players Seen As Big Spenders In Key Consumer Categories | accessdate = 2011-02-17 | last = Fisher | first = Eric | date = September 21, 2009 | work = Sports Business Daily | publisher = Street &amp; Smith's | quote = Twenty-two percent of the U.K. survey respondents said they play fantasy sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current leading fantasy sports provider in the UK is the English Premier League, which tallied more than 4 million users for the 2016/17 season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fantasy.premierleague.com/ Fantasy Premier League Official site]&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to the United States, the UK has roughly 5% of the population participating, whereas the U.S. has about 10% of its population playing fantasy sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = European Daily Fantasy Sports On Verge Of Huge Growth|url = http://www.legalsportsreport.com/1966/european-daily-fantasy-sports-growth/|website = Legal Sports Report|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===

The FSTA industry group collected and presented statistics showing the percentage of fantasy sports players compared to the 
general population in the United States and Canada (Age 12+).&lt;ref name=fstastats&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fsta.org/research/industry-demographics/ |title=Industry demographics|publisher=fsta.org|accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In regards to the consumption habits of fantasy managers, demographic and psychographic research has found the average participant is: male (80%), Caucasian (91%), holds a bachelor's degree or higher (70%), has more than five years of internet experience (84%), earns an average of $94,000, and spends approximately $200 on entry fees and other fantasy related costs. Fantasy players were also stronger consumers of the following products compared to the general population: beer/alcohol, fast food, airline travel, video games, sports periodicals, athletic shoes, cell phones, and credit card usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.kent.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=sport|title=The Journal of Sport|last=Burton|first=Rick|last2=Hall|first2=Kevin|date=2013|website=Digital Commons Kent State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Paul|first3=Rodney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projections for the market===

In September 2015, Forbes reported that Eilers Research was projecting that daily fantasy games will generate around $2.6 billion in entry fees this year and grow 41% annually, reaching $14.4 billion in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2015/09/16/the-hyper-growth-of-daily-fantasy-sports-is-going-to-change-our-culture-and-our-laws/ |title=The Hyper Growth Of Daily Fantasy Sports Is Going To Change Our Culture And Our Laws|publisher=forbes.com|date=2015-09-16|accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade associations===

The [[Fantasy Sports Trade Association]] was formed in 1997 to represent the growing industry.  Beginning in 2000, the FSTA has honored past members and contributors to fantasy sports with induction into its Hall of Fame.

The [[Fantasy Sports Writers Association]] was formed in 2004 to represent the growing numbers of journalists covering fantasy 
sports exclusively.&lt;ref name="bizj"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2007/05/28/focus4.html| title=Growing fantasy sports scene is big business | work=[[The Business Review]] | date=May 28, 2007 | 
accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Fantasy Sports Association]] was formed in 2006 as a rival trade group, but folded in 2010.

==Legal issues in the United States==

===Federal law related to fantasy gaming===

The [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]] (UIGEA), was enacted as part of the "American Values Agenda" of 2006 and was added as an amendment to the unrelated [[SAFE PORT ACT]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/28/mg.thu/ |title=House GOP promotes its "American Values Agenda" | publisher=cnn.com| date=2006-06-28| accessdate=2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UIGEA generally prohibits funds transfers to businesses engaged in unlawful internet wagering.&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5361 | title= 31 U.S. Code § 5361 - Congressional findings and purpose}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However the UIGEA does not itself define unlawful internet wagering, and expressly refrains from altering the legality of any underlying conduct other than funds transfers.&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5361 | title= 31 U.S. Code § 5361(b)- No modification of existing law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the act doesn't alter the legality of any particular activity permitted or prohibited under other laws, it does contain some express exemptions to its funds transfer prohibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5362 | title= 31 U.S. Code § 5362- Definitions - Bet or Wager}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these exemptions from the UIGEA prohibitions is for fantasy sports that meet certain criterial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5362 | title= 31 U.S. Code § 5362(1)(E)(vii)- Definitions - Bet or Wager - Fantasy excluded from definition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, fantasy sports that are based on teams of real multiple athletes from multiple real world teams, that have prizes established before the event starts, that use the skill of participants to determine the outcome, are exempted from the definition of a bet or wager that is the basis for requiring banks to identify and block funds transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5364 | title= 31 U.S. Code § 5364 - Policies and procedures to identify and prevent restricted transactions}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Congressman Leach, an author of the UIGEA, exemptions, particularly one for fantasy sports, were included to relieve the burden of enforcement on banks and the UIGEA does not make fantasy sports legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2015/10/12/former-congressman-says-dfs-is-cauldron-of-daily-betting |title=Author of anti-gambling law says "sheer chutzpah" for daily fantasy sites to claim legitimacy |publisher=usnews.com |date=2015-10-12 |accessdate=2015-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024332/http://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2015/10/12/former-congressman-says-dfs-is-cauldron-of-daily-betting |archivedate=2015-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the UIGEA exempted fantasy sports from its definition of a bet or wager, there is a misconception that fantasy sports were made legal by the UIGEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/06/fantasy-sports-vs-illegal-gambling-wheres-the-line-commentary.html | title=Fantasy Sports vs Illegal Gambling Where is the Line | publisher=cnbc.com | date=2015-04-06 | accessdate=2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However the UIGEA is not a criminal gambling statute, and it specifically does not alter any criminal gambling laws and thus does not make fantasy sports legal.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt; Federal criminal gambling statutes are found in Title 18 of U.S. Code, such as the Federal Wire Act 18 U.S. Code § 1084 (which prohibits interstate sports wagering) and the Illegal Gambling Business Act 18 U.S. Code § 1955 (which prohibits the interstate conduct of wagering activity prohibited under state law).&lt;ref name="cornell1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1084 | title= 18 U.S. Code § 1084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1955 | title= 18 U.S. Code § 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the UIGEA is found in Title 31 with other anti-money laundering and financial crimes statutes.&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"/&gt;

===State laws related to fantasy gaming===

Whether state laws can regulate fantasy sports depends on whether fantasy sports are a form of sports wagering under federal law.  This is because the Federal Wire Act preempts state law and prohibits the conduct of sports wagering in interstate or foreign commerce.&lt;ref name="cornell1"/&gt;  Additionally, with regard to intrastate commerce, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection act prohibits states from authorizing and regulating any wagering, lottery, betting, sweepstakes or other wagering scheme that is based directly or indirectly on games in which professional or amateur athletes participate or on the performance of any athletes in such games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/3702 | title= 28 U.S. Code § 3702 - Unlawful sports gambling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event that fantasy sports are not deemed to be a form of sports wagering, then states may have a role in determining their legality.  Under most state laws, lotteries are illegal only if they involve three elements: an entry fee (known as "consideration"), a prize (a "reward", in legal terms) and chance.  Whether fantasy sports are a lottery varies from state to state and hinges on the definition of "chance" that the state interprets.  For some states, if skill dominates the outcome of the event, then the contest is legal, and passes what's called the "dominant factor test".  Other states with a stricter definition of chance, called "any chance test", have made fantasy football illegal.&lt;ref name=forbes1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcedelman/2013/09/03/is-it-legal-to-play-fantasy-football-for-money/ |title=Is It Legal To Play Fantasy Football For Money? |publisher=forbes.com |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states have clarified that paid fantasy sports contests are games of skill and exempt from gambling laws, beginning with Maryland in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gouker |first=Dustin |url=https://www.legalsportsreport.com/12544/maryland-comptroller-dfs-reguation/ |title=Maryland Comptroller Officially Implements Fantasy Sports Regulations |work=Legal Sports Report |date=2017-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

One exception is the state of Nevada, which has an exemption in PASPA to allow for sports betting. The Nevada attorney general issued an opinion that found Daily Fantasy Sports to be a form of sports wagering, similar to the current wagering offered by Nevada Sports Books.&lt;ref name="gaming.nv.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaming.nv.gov/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=10487 | title=Legality of Daily Fantasy Sports Under Nevada Law | date=2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opinions states that Daily Fantasy Sports are not illegal in Nevada; however, a sports pool license is required to conduct the activity in Nevada.&lt;ref name="gaming.nv.gov"/&gt;

Several Attorneys General have also issued opinions that Daily Fantasy Sports are a form of sports wagering. A Florida state attorney general's opinion in 1991 called into doubt the legality of fantasy football contests, but companies have operated in the state without any legal action. Since then nine other AGs have issued options, statements or formal opinions that equate DFS with gambling.

However, several other  Attorneys General have issued opinions that DFS are legal games of skill. In August 2015 in Kansas, due to uncertainty with the state’s Racing and Gaming Commission position,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article1318033.html#/tabPane=tabs-2e561a63-1 |title=Fantasy sports betting always has been illegal in Kansas, gaming commission counsel says |publisher=The Wichita Eagle |date=2014-08-28 |accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the state’s attorney general issued an opinion that daily fantasy sports was a skill game and thus permitted under state law.  Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback signed legislation a month later authorizing fantasy gaming.&lt;ref name=calvinayre&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calvinayre.com/2015/09/02/business/michigan-gaming-regulator-says-fantasy-sports-illegal/|title=Michigan gaming regulator says fantasy sports are illegal |publisher=calvinayre.com |date=2015-09-02 |accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorneys General of West Virginia and Rhode Island have also issued opinions that clarified the legality of DFS and paid fantasy sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gouker |first=Dustin |url=https://www.legalsportsreport.com/10703/fantasy-sports-west-virginia-legality/ |title=West Virginia Attorney General On Fantasy Sports: State ‘Does Not Prohibit’ Contests |work=Legal Sports Report |date=2017-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2017, 18 states have followed Maryland to clarify that DFS and paid fantasy sports are legal contests of skill. These states include Kansas (2015), Indiana, Virginia, Missouri, Massachusetts, Colorado, Tennessee, New York, Mississippi (2016), Arkansas, New Jersey, Vermont, New Hampshire, Ohio, Maine, Vermont, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Connecticut (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gouker |first=Dustin |url=https://www.legalsportsreport.com/16802/ohio-sends-fantasy-sports-bill-governor/ |title=Ohio Sends Fantasy Sports Bill To Governor; Would Be 18th State With Law |work=Legal Sports Report |date=2017-12-05 |accessdate=2017-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In September 2015, New Jersey Congressman Frank Pallone, who has championed legal sports betting in his state, requested a hearing from the House Energy and Commerce Committee to examine the relationship between the professional sports leagues and the fantasy sports companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/i-team/congressman-gambling-fantasy-sports-article-1.2369123 |title=N.J. congressman Frank Pallone slams pro leagues for opposing gambling while profiting off fantasy sports  |publisher=nydailynews.com |date=2015-09-21 |accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing was held in May 2015 and resulted in no proposed legislation, changes or regulations of fantasy sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gouker |first=Dustin |url=https://www.legalsportsreport.com/9985/congress-and-action-on-daily-fantasy-sports/ |title=After Hearing, Don’t Expect Congress To Get Involved With Daily Fantasy Sports |work=Legal Sports Report |date=2016-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cases related to use of player statistics===

There have been other legal cases involving fantasy sports and the use of professional athletes' statistics for purposes of scoring.

====STATS, Inc. vs. NBA====

In 1996, [[STATS, Inc.]], a major statistical provider to fantasy sports companies, won a court case, along with [[Motorola]], 
on appeal against the [[NBA]] in which the NBA was trying to stop [[STATS, Inc.|STATS]] from distributing in game score 
information via a special wireless device created by Motorola.  The victory played a large part in defending other cases where 
sports leagues have tried to suppress live in-game information from their events being distributed by other outlets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.web.aol.com/decisions/dldecen/nba.html NBA Lawsuit - AOL.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702231859/http://legal.web.aol.com/decisions/dldecen/nba.html |date=July 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The victory also accelerated the market for 
real-time statistics which were largely fueled by the growth of the fantasy sports industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Schwarz]]: ''The 
Numbers Game : Baseball's Lifelong Fascination with Statistics'' [[Thomas Dunne Books]] p. 192, {{ISBN|0-312-32222-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CDM vs. MLBAM====

The development of fantasy sports produced tension between fantasy sports companies and professional leagues and players 
associations over the rights to player profiles and statistics. The players associations of the major sports leagues believed that fantasy games using player names were subject to licensing due to the right of publicity of the players involved. Since the player names were being used as a group, the players had assigned their publicity rights to the players association who then signed licensing deals. During the 1980s and 1990s many companies signed licensing deals with the player associations, but some companies did not. The issue came to a head with the lawsuit of [[MLBAM|Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM)]], [[Major League Baseball|MLB's]] Internet company, vs. St. Louis-based CBC Distribution and Marketing Inc., the parent company of [[Fanball|CDM Sports]]. When CBC was denied a new licensing agreement with MLBAM (they had acquired the rights from the baseball players' association) for its fantasy baseball game, CBC filed suit.

CBC argued that intellectual property laws and so-called "right of publicity" laws don't apply to the statistics used in fantasy sports.&lt;ref name="sports.espn.go.com"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fantasy leagues permitted to use MLB names, stats | date=2006-08-08 | publisher= | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2543720 | work =ESPN | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fantasy Sports Trade Association|FSTA]] filed an [[amicus curiae]] in support of CBC, also arguing that if MLBAM won the lawsuit it would have a dramatic impact on the industry, which was largely ignored by the major sports leagues for years while a number of smaller entrepreneurs grew it into a multibillion-dollar industry, and a ruling could allow the MLBAM to have a monopoly over the industry.

"This will be a defining moment in the fantasy sports industry," said Charlie Wiegert, executive vice president of CBC. "The other leagues are all watching this case. If MLB prevailed, it just would have been a matter of time before they followed up. Their player unions are just waiting for the opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=McCarthy | coauthors= | title=Fantasy leagues can use baseball stats | date=2006-08-08 | publisher= | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2006-08-08-fantasy-statistics_x.htm | work =USA Today | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBC won the lawsuit as U.S. District Court Judge Mary Ann Medler ruled that statistics are part of the public domain and can be used at no cost by fantasy companies.  "The names and playing records of major-league baseball players as used in CBC's fantasy games are not copyrightable," Medler wrote. "Therefore, federal copyright law does not pre-empt the players' claimed right of publicity."&lt;ref name="sports.espn.go.com"/&gt;

The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision in October 2007.  "It would be strange law that a person would not have a First Amendment right to use information that is available to everyone," a three-judge panel said in its ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fantasy Sports Win Right to Player Names, Statistics | date=2007-10-16 | publisher= | url =https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&amp;sid=aVMAY0beLSoA&amp;refer=home | work =Bloomerberg| pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the 8th Circuit Court's decision by declining to hear the case in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Greg | last=Stohr | coauthors= | title=Baseball Rebuffed by U.S. Supreme Court on Fantasy Rights | date=2008-06-02 | publisher= | url =https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&amp;sid=a.5jCrvS31Uo&amp;refer=home | work =Bloomberg | pages = | accessdate = 2008-06-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics.jpg|thumb|right|alt=wheelchair basketball|Wheelchair basketball teams playing in the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]]]]
The concept of '''international sport''' refers to [[sport]] when the participants represent at least two countries. The most well-known international sports event is the [[Olympic Games]]. Other examples include the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[Paralympic Games]].

Modern international sports events are big business for as well as influencing the political, economical, and other cultural aspects of countries around the world. Especially with [[politics and sports]], sports can affect countries, their identities, and in consequence, the world.

==History==
The ancient [[Olympic Games]] were a series of competitions held between representatives of several [[city-states]] and kingdoms from [[Ancient Greece]], which featured mainly athletic but also combat and chariot racing events. During the Olympic games, all struggles between the participating city-states were postponed until the games were finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swaddling|first=Judith|title=The Ancient Olympic Games|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|year=2000|edition=2|page=54|isbn=0-292-70373-2|oclc=10759486|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-HQMnDiLqIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA54,M1|accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend.&lt;ref&gt;Young (2004), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the Olympic Games became a popular global event.

==Economics==
While some economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasizing that such "mega-events" often have large costs, hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = A. K. | last2 = Spiegel | first2 = M. M. | year = 2011 | title = The Olympic Effect*. | url = | journal = The Economic Journal | volume = 121 | issue = 553| pages = 652–677 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02407.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the [[Philanthropy#Modern vernacular uses of the word|philanthropic contributions of corporations]] headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028982 Tilcsik, A. and Marquis, C. 2013. "Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities." ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 58(1): 111–148.].&lt;/ref&gt; The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glynn | first1 = M. A. | year = 2008 | title = Configuring the field of play: how hosting the Olympic Games impacts civic community | url = | journal = Journal of Management Studies | volume = 45 | issue = 6| pages = 1117–1146 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6486.2008.00785.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Globalization]] has continually increased international competition in sports. The [[FIFA World Cup]], for example, is the world's most widely viewed sporting event; an estimated 700 million people watched the final match of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] held in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=700 million to watch World Cup Final |work=The Spy Report |publisher=Media Spy |date=12 July 2010 |url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/12/700-million-to-watch-world-cup-final/ |accessdate=12 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715052728/https://trendonwords.com |archivedate=15 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2011 A.T. Kearney study of sports teams, leagues and federations, the global sports industry is worth between €350 billion and €450 billion ([[US$]]480-$620 billion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atkearney.com/paper/-/asset_publisher/dVxv4Hz2h8bS/content/the-sports-market/10192  ''The Sports Market'' (2011). A.T. Kearney.]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes infrastructure construction, sporting goods, licensed products and live sports events.

== Olympic Games factor of the globalization of sports ==

=== An international retransmission ===

The Olympics are a major factor in the globalization of sport.
The Olympic symbol is the most recognized symbol, and the Olympic Games are broadcast around the world. This represents 4.5 billion of people for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/IOC_Marketing/Broadcasting/Beijing_2008_Global_Broadcast_Overview.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olympic Games globalization===

The Olympic Games have also undergone globalization.
The first Olympic Games of the modern era were held in 1896, only 9 disciplines were present and 241 athletes but only men. The place of women is representative of the position of women in society, and from the first Olympiad 1900 women participated but unofficially. It is in 1920 that the first women were officially part of the Olympic Games.

The number of athletes present at each Olympiad hast been increasing significantly since the first Olympiad:

* In 1896 at the first Olympic games 14 countries were represented by 241 athletes for 43 events;
* 1960 Rome Olympic games have grouped 83 countries for a total of 5338 athletes who competed in 150 different events;
* London 2012, 204 countries were present representing 10,568 athletes for a total of 302 events.

==Association football==
{{Main|Association football}}
{{See also| National Football League|American Football League|Canadian Football League}}

[[Rugby football]] in Canada had its origins in the early 1860s, and over time, a unique code of football known as [[Canadian football]] developed. Both the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and [[Football Canada]], the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1882 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union (later reorganized as the Canadian Rugby Union). In 1909, the [[Grey Cup]] was donated by the then [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey]], to recognize the top amateur rugby football team in Canada. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the two senior leagues of the CRU (the [[Canadian Football League East Division|Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] and the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Interprovincial Football Union]]) gradually evolved from amateur to professional leagues, and found they had less and less in common with the amateur leagues, and consequently in 1956 formed a new umbrella organization, the Canadian Football Council. In 1958, the CFC left the CRU altogether and was renamed the Canadian Football League. By this time, teams from the amateur [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] had stopped challenging for the Grey Cup, and ever since, it has been exclusively awarded to CFL teams. Since 1965, [[CIS football|university teams]] have competed for the [[Vanier Cup]].&lt;ref name="Football Canada timeline"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footballcanada.com/history_timeline.asp |title=Canadian Football Timelines (1860 – present) |accessdate=2006-12-23 |publisher=[[Football Canada]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228064050/http://www.footballcanada.com/history_timeline.asp |archivedate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian rules football==

{{Main|Australian rules football}}


Unlike other sports, Australian rules football has not resisted becoming a professional sport.

Although the sport began as amateur competition, the [[Australian Football League]] is an elite professional league and has been for nearly 80 years since its initial formation as the Victorian Football Association and then the Victorian Football League in 1897. The league changed its name to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) in 1990 amid the increasing professionalism and national expansion of the game.

The game was invented in the [[United States]] in the 1890s, in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. The first professional basketball leagues emerged in the 1920s in the [[United States]].  Prominent among these were the [[American Basketball League (1925-1955)|American Basketball League]], which formed in 1925, and the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]], which was launched in 1937 by General Electric, Firestone and Goodyear as a way to improve their national profile.&lt;ref name="Steve Dimitry"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/6925/abl1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+07:07:30 "Steve Dimitry's Extinct Sports Leagues."]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946 the [[Basketball Association of America]] was founded by the owners of major sports arenas, particularly the [[Madison Square Garden]]. The BAA later merged with the NBL in 1949 to become the [[National Basketball Association]], the preeminent league in the world with 29 teams in the United States and one in Canada.  The [[American Basketball Association]], founded in 1967, subsequently joined the NBA in the 1976 [[ABA-NBA merger]].

The second-oldest professional basketball league in the world is the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. The PBA was long considered to be the best league in [[Asia]], but the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] has grown tremendously in recent years. The league was born on April 9, 1975 at the [[Araneta Coliseum]], [[Cubao]], [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]].

Outside of the NBA, the top professional leagues in the world are those of [[FIBA Europe]]. According to the [[European national basketball league rankings|official league rankings]] produced by [[Euroleague Basketball (company)|Euroleague Basketball]], the body that conducts the continent-wide [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]], the top five national domestic leagues on the continent (from 1 to 5) are those [[Liga ACB]] (Spain), the [[Russian Professional Basketball League]], the [[Greek Basket League]], [[Lega Basket Serie A]] (Italy), and the [[Turkish Basketball League]].

European basketball is also characterized by its long established and well-developed transnational club competitions, most notably the Euroleague, which features top clubs from as many as 18 different domestic leagues. Two other continental club competitions, the [[ULEB Eurocup]] and [[EuroChallenge]], are also conducted annually. Europe also has transnational regional leagues, such as the [[Liga ABA]] (Adriatic League, formerly [[Yugoslavian Basketball League|Yugoslavian League]]), and [[Baltic Basketball League]] (originally limited to the Baltic states, now also including Kazakhstan).

==Cricket==
{{Main|History of English amateur cricket}}
{{See also|World Series Cricket|County cricket}}

Cricket at the highest level has developed into a fully professional international sport from which leading players can earn a large income. However professionalism has a long history in English cricket. The first professionals had appeared by the first half of the eighteenth century, when heavy gambling on the game encouraged wealthy patrons to draft the best players into their teams. They would often offer these players full-time employment as gardeners or gamekeepers on their estates. In the second half of the century, the famous Hambledon Club paid its players match fees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In the middle of the nineteenth century William Clarke's All-England Eleven was a highly successful all-professional venture which did much to popularise the game. The earliest overseas tours were also all-professional affairs.

In the early 21st century cricket is as lucrative as some other sports, and domestic cricketers typically earn several times the average salary in their country. Regular members of the [[England cricket team|English cricket team]] earn several hundred thousand [[pound sterling|pounds]] a year. However, the highest paid cricketers in the world are the star members of the [[Australia national cricket team|Australian cricket team]] or the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] who make most of their income from endorsement contracts.

==Ice hockey==
{{Main|Professional ice hockey}}
It is played with two teams, while 5 skaters and 1 goalie are allowed on the ice at a time. In NHL rules, the periods are 20 minutes long. There are three periods.

The 64-member governing body is the International Ice Hockey Federation, (IIHF). Ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924, and was in the 1920 Summer Olympics. North America's [[National Hockey League]] is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic hockey.

Ice hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can curve either way as to help a left- or right-handed player gain an advantage.

There are early representations and reports of hockey-type games being played on ice in the Netherlands, and reports from Canada from the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the modern game was initially organized by students at McGill University, Montreal in 1875 and, by two years later, codified the first set of ice hockey rules and organized the first teams.

==Lacrosse==
{{Main|Lacrosse}}
Lacrosse is played mainly in [[North America]], however, countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have small lacrosse leagues. It has also expanded into both Europe and Asia, with the latter forming the Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union (APLU) in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://filacrosse.com/fil-welcomes-the-aplu/|title=Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union|accessdate=2016-02-26|publisher=[[Federation of International Lacrosse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States currently has two top-level professional lacrosse leagues in operation, [[Major League Lacrosse]] and the [[National Lacrosse League]].

==Rugby league==
{{See also|History of rugby league|Football}}

Rugby league came into existence due to the very issue of professionalism. Rugby football split into 'union' and 'league' over the issue of payment to player. Rugby league favoured payments and has thus been a professional sport since its [[1895–96 Northern Rugby Football Union season|beginnings in 1895]], when 22 clubs based in northern England [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|split]] from the more amateur-minded [[Rugby Football Union]]. The officially amateur RFU had previously brought charges of professionalism against some clubs for their use of "broken time" payments to compensate players for missing work due to matches or injuries received whilst playing. On August 29, 1895 in a meeting at the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield]], the clubs decided to break away and form the Northern Rugby Union, which later would become the [[Rugby Football League]]. The rules of rugby league were gradually changed so that now it and rugby union are distinctly different games, however rugby union has since turned professional as well. On 17 December 1967 the first professional Sunday matches of rugby league were played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Rugby union ==

{{See also|History of rugby union|Football}}

Rugby union continued with its amateur ideals past the schism between union and league and throughout much of the 20th century. This position changed in 1995. The threat of big payments from professional rugby league clubs in countries where rugby league had a significant following was becoming too great. A committee conclusion decided that the only way to end this threat, the hypocrisy of [[Shamateurism]] and keep control of rugby union was to make the sport professional. On August 26, 1995 the International Rugby Board declared rugby union an "open" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game.

==Rodeo/bull riding==
{{Main|Rodeo}}
{{See also| Bull riding|Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|Professional Bull Riders}}

The PBR is different from the classic rodeo as it consists of only bull riding. It was founded in 1992 because a group of bull riders decided that their sport should be separated from the classic rodeo and could, as it was easily the most popular event. Riders and bulls are judged on a 50-point scale. Riders are only given a score if they stay on for the mandatory 8 seconds, while bull scores are given regardless of what the rider does.

'''Mixed-sex sports''', also known as '''mixed-gender''' or '''coed sports''', are [[sport]]s where the participants are not of a single [[sex]]. This can take the form of [[individual sports|individual]] or [[team sports]] involving people of different sexes. In organised sports settings, rules usually dictate the number of people required of each sex in a team (for example teams of one man and one woman). Such rules account for the [[sex differences in human physiology]], with males being larger and stronger than females on average. In informal settings, mixed-sex sports typically involves groups of friends and/or family engaging in sport without regard to the sex of the participants.

Sports which are mixed-sex as standard are typically ones where the differences between the sexes do not greatly affect the ability of the competitor, for example [[equestrian sports]]. There are also disciplines where there has always been a tradition of multi sex participation like pairs in [[dancesport]]. There are also mainly single-sex sports with a variant sub-competition between mixed-sex teams, for example [[mixed doubles tennis]].

Mixed-sex sports have been encouraged as a way of boosting female sports participation and improving social harmony between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07303084.1987.10609637?journalCode=ujrd20 Playing Together—Values and Arrangements of Coed Sports]. T&amp;F Online. Retrieved 2018-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed-sex play and sports is common among young children, among whom differences are less pronounced.

It is uncommon in most organised sports to find individuals of different genders competing head-to-head at elite level, principally due to the differences between the sexes. In sports where these differences are less linked to performance, it is standard practice for men and women to compete in mixed-sex fields. These open-class sports prove accommodating to [[intersex]] athletes, who challenge the sex-defined rules of both single-sex sport and mixed-sex sports with defined male and female roles.

In [[equestrian sports]], male and female riders compete against each other in [[eventing]], [[dressage]] and [[show jumping]] disciplines. Female [[jockey]]s compete alongside male ones in [[horse racing]], though the former constitute a minority of jockeys overall. Beyond the athletes, the horses used for racing are a mixed of male and female, with a roughly 60/40 split at the top level between [[colt (horse)|colt]]s and [[fillies]].&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, Sheen (2013-06-28). [https://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/28/sport/horse-racing-male-female/index.html Racing's battle of the sexes -- on four legs]. CCN. Retrieved 2018-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

During an [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]] game, teams of 7 players (4 men and 3 women, or 4 women and 3 men) play in direct competition with each other, and while most often people of the same gender mark each other, it is not uncommon to see match ups between people of different gender.

==Mixed doubles or pairs==
[[File:Lillehammer 2016 - Figure Skating Pairs Short Program - Alina Ustimkina and Nikita Volodin 6.jpg|thumb|Pair figure skaters]]
A common form of mixed-sex sports involves pairs with one male and one female team member.

Sports based on [[dancing]] often have male/female pairings, such as [[pair figure skating]], [[ice dancing]], [[ballroom dancing]] and [[synchronised swimming]] duets. In these sports the male and female participants physically work together to produce an artistic and athletic performance.

Mixed doubles involves two mixed-sex pairs competing against each other with all four competitors in open play. This is particularly prominent in [[racket sports]], including [[tennis]], [[table tennis]], [[badminton]], [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[racquetball]].

Mixed pairs and mixed teams events are occasionally organised in [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#mixed|contract bridge]].

Pairs may also compete in [[turn-based games]], where men and women take turns alternately. This is found in more strategy-based sports, including [[mixed curling]], mixed [[golf]], mixed [[bowling]] and mixed team [[darts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmixed.com/YNWOZ/ Storm Open Festival of Bowling featuring the National Mixed Tournament]. National Mixed. Retrieved 2018-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Separate male and female performances may also be combined to produce mixed team results in such sports as [[diving (sport)|diving]]. [[Synchronised diving]] is also found in mixed-sex format. [[Mixed tag team match]]es are also found in [[professional wrestling]], where wrestlers are not explicitly competing in a turn-based manner, but are usually obliged to only face their opponent of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nick (2017-12-13).

==Mixed relay==
[[File:ShabasovNasretdinovaNikolaevKashinskaya-0087.jpg|thumb|A mixed relay swimming team receiving medals]]
In non-vehicular [[racing sports]] the physiological differences between the sexes often preclude head-to-head competition between people of different sexes at the elite level. As a result, mixed-sex events are most often held with a [[relay race]] format.

In [[running]], a 4 × 400 metres mixed relay race was introduced at the [[2017 IAAF World Relays]], and will be added to the [[2019 World Championships in Athletics]] and [[2020 Summer Olympics]].

In [[cross-country running]], a 4 × 2&amp;nbsp;km mixed relay race was added at the [[2017 IAAF World Cross Country Championships]].

In [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], mixed relay races were introduced at the [[2014 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)]] (4 × 50 m freestyle and medley) and the [[2015 World Aquatics Championships]] (4 × 100 m freestyle and medley). The event will debut at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] (4 × 100 m medley).

In [[triathlon]], the [[ITU Triathlon Mixed Relay World Championships]] mixed relay race has been held since 2009. Also, the [[triathlon at the Youth Olympic Games]] has a mixed relay race since 2010. As in standard triathlons, each triathlon competitor must do a segment of swimming, cycling and running.

In [[biathlon]], a mixed relay race was first held at the [[Biathlon World Championships 2005]] in Khanty-Mansiysk (4 × 6&amp;nbsp;km), and it was added to the [[Biathlon at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Mixed relay|2014 Winter Olympics]] (4 × 6&amp;nbsp;km / 7.5&amp;nbsp;km).

==Ultimate==
The mixed division is a staple of [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]], and it is the only division that was showcased at both the [[2013 World Games]] and the [[2017 World Games]].

==Mixed team ball sports== 
Mixed-sex forms of [[ball sports]] involve set numbers of each sex per team, and sometimes pre-defined roles in the team which people of that gender can play. Examples include [[korfball]], coed [[softball]], and [[wheelchair rugby]].

==Olympics==

'''Motorsport''' or '''motor sport''' is a global term used to encompass the group of competitive [[Sports|sporting]] events which primarily involve the use of [[motor vehicles|motorised vehicles]], whether for racing or non-racing competition.  The [[terminology]] can also be used to describe forms of competition of two-wheeled motorised vehicles under the banner of [[motorcycle racing]], and includes off-road racing such as [[motocross]].

Four- (or more) wheeled motorsport competition is globally governed by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA); and the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme]] (FIM) governs two-wheeled competition.

==History==
In 1894, a French newspaper organised a race from [[Paris–Rouen (motor race)|Paris to Rouen]] and back, starting city to city racing.{{sfn|Gifford|page=7}}  In 1900, the [[Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)|Gordon Bennett Cup]] was established.  Closed [[circuit racing]] arose as open road racing, on public roads, was banned.  [[Brooklands]] was the first dedicated motor racing track in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Gifford|page=9}}

Following [[World War I]], European countries organised [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix races]] over closed courses.  In the United States, dirt track racing became popular.{{sfn|Gifford|page=10}}

After World War II, the Grand Prix circuit became more formally organised.  In the United States, [[stock car racing]] and [[drag racing]] became firmly established.{{sfn|Gifford|page=11}}

Motorsports ultimately became divided by types of [[motor vehicles]] into racing events, and their appropriate organisations.

===Open wheel racing===
====Formula racing====
[[File:Nico Rosberg 2015 Malaysia FP1.jpg|thumb|The [[Mercedes F1 W06 Hybrid]], the 2015 Formula One World Championship winning car]]
{{main|Formula racing}}
[[Formula racing]] is a set of classes of motor vehicles, with their wheels outside, and not contained by, any bodywork of their vehicle.  These have been globally classified as specific 'Formula' series - the most common being [[Formula One]], and many others include the likes of [[Formula 3]], [[Formula Ford]], [[Formula Renault]] and [[Formula Palmer Audi]].  However, in North America, the [[IndyCar]] series is their pinnacle open-wheeled racing series.  More recently, new open-wheeled series have been created, originating in Europe, which omit the 'Formula' moniker, such as [[GP2 Series|GP2]] and [[GP3 Series|GP3]].  Former 'Formula' series include [[Formula 5000]] and [[Formula Two]].

=====Formula One=====
{{main|Formula One}}
[[Formula One]] is a class of single-seat and [[Open-wheel car|open-wheel]] grand prix closed course racing, governed by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), and currently organized by the privately owned company [[Formula One Group]]. The formula regulations contain a very strict set of rules which govern vehicle power, weight and size.&lt;ref name="f1fd"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Noble|author2=Mark Hughes|title=Formula One Racing For Dummies|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/discovering-what-makes-formula-one-formula-one.html|chapter=Discovering What Makes Formula One, Formula One}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Formula E=====
{{main|Formula E}}
[[Formula E]] is a class of open-wheel auto racing that uses only electric-powered cars. The series was conceived in 2012, and the inaugural championship started in [[Beijing]] on 13 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]|author=Telegraph Sport|date=13 September 2014|title=Formula E opens with spectacular crash involving Nick Heidfeld and Nicolas Prost as Lucas di Grassi claims win|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/11094128/Formula-E-opens-with-spectacular-crash-involving-Nick-Heidfeld-and-Nicolas-Prost-as-Lucas-di-Grassi-claims-win.html|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is also sanctioned by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] and races a spec chassis/battery combination with manufacturers allowed to develop their own electric power-trains. The series has gained significant traction in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Formula E|date=31 July 2017|title=Agag: This has been our take-off season|url=http://www.fiaformulae.com/en/news/2017/july/agag-this-has-been-our-take-off-season/|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====IndyCar Series=====
{{main|IndyCar Series}}
A series originated on June 12th, 1909 in [[Portland, Oregon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openwheelworld.net/indycar/series.php?id=37|title=OpenWheelWorld.Net &gt;&gt; Indy Car historie|first=Haiko Benthem, Patrick|last=Straver|website=www.openwheelworld.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its first race. Shortly after, [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway ]] opened in 1909 and held races that ranged from 50-200 miles.  Its premier race is the [[Indianapolis 500]] which began on May 11th, 1911 and a tradition was born. Today, [[Indycar]] operates a full schedule with over 20 teams and 40 different drivers. The current schedule includes 14 tracks over the course of 17 races per season &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indycar.com/Schedule|title=Schedule - Verizon IndyCar Series, Indy Lights, Pro Mazda &amp; Cooper Tires USF2000|website=IndyCar.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Josef Newgarden]] was crowned current champion of the [[Indycar]] Series at [[Sonoma Raceway]] on September 17th, 2017 in Sonoma, California.



===Enclosed wheel racing===
[[File:Neste Oil Rally 2010 - Jari-Matti Latvala in shakedown.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Ford Focus WRC]] rally racing car during [[2010 Rally Finland]]]]
Enclosed wheel racing is a set of classes of vehicles, where the wheels are primarily enclosed inside the bodywork of the vehicle, similar to a North American 'stock car'.

====Sports car racing====
{{main|Sports car racing}}
[[Sports car racing]] is a set of classes of vehicles, over a closed course track, including sports cars, and specialised racing types.  The premiere race is the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] which takes place annually in [[France]] during the month of June.  Sports car racing rules and specifications differentiate in North America from established international sanctioning bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Regulations|url=http://www.fia.com/regulations|website=Federation Internationale de l'Automobile|accessdate=2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;


====Stock car racing====
{{main|Stock car racing}}
[[Stock car racing]] is a set of vehicles, that race over a speedway track, organized by [[NASCAR]]. While once stock cars, the vehicles are now purpose built, but resemble the body design and shape of production cars. Bootleggers throughout the Carolinas are often credited for the origins of [[NASCAR]] due to the resistance during the prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/how-prohibition-gave-birth-to-nascar|title=How Prohibition Gave Birth to NASCAR|website=history.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the vehicles were modified to increase top speed and handling, to provide the bootleggers with an advantage toward the vehicles local law enforcement would use in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/how-moonshine-bootlegging-gave-rise-nascar-180962014/|title=How Moonshine Bootlegging Gave Rise to NASCAR|first=Jennifer|last=Billock|website=smithsonianmag.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important part to the modifications of stock cars, was to increase the performance of the vehicle while also maintaining the same exterior look giving it the name [[Stock car racing]]. Many legends in [[NASCAR]] originated as bootleggers in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of [[North Carolina]] like [[Junior Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/past-times/article93694277.html|title=Racing legend outran the law|website=newsobserver.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organized oval racing began on Daytona Beach in [[Florida]] as a hobby but quickly gained interest from all over the country. As oval racing became larger and larger, a group gathered in hopes to form a sanctioning body for the sport.&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nascar-founded|title=NASCAR founded - Feb 21, 1948 - HISTORY.com|website=history.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[NASCAR]] was organized in 1947, to combine flat track oval racing of production cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Layford|first1=Bob|title=Built for Speed|publisher=Courage Books|isbn=0762404418|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daytona Beach and Road Course]] was founded where land speed records were set on the beach, and including part of [[A1A]]. The highlight of the stock car calendar is the season-opening [[Daytona 500]], also nicknamed 'The Great American Race' which is held at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in Daytona Beach, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/sports/nascar/2013/02/14/history-of-the-daytona-500/1913949/|title=History of the Daytona 500|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASCAR]] has now held over 2,500 sanctioned events over the course of 70 seasons&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt;. [[Richard Petty]] is known as the king of NASCAR with over 200 recorded wins in the series and has competed in 1,184 races in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/driver/Richard_Petty|title=Driver Richard Petty Career Statistics - Racing-Reference.info|website=racing-reference.info|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Touring car racing====
{{main|Touring car racing}}
[[Touring car racing]] is a set of vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Car Facts {{!}} Pirelli World Challenge|url=http://www.world-challenge.com/pirelli-world-challenge-car-facts.html|website=www.World-Challenge.com|accessdate=2015-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010020949/http://www.world-challenge.com/pirelli-world-challenge-car-facts.html|archive-date=2015-10-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; modified street cars, that race over closed purpose built race tracks and street courses.


====Off-Road Racing====
{{main|Off-Road Racing}}
Off-Road Racing is a group of vehicles that specialize in off-road racing and are modified street cars that can race on close purpose built off-road tracks and courses.  Off-Road racing is popular in areas like [[California]] and [[Arizona]].  Premier off-road events in the United States include the [[Baja 1000]] which takes place in the [[Baja California Peninsula]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.race-dezert.com/home/off-road-racer-grandfather-off-road-racing-baja-1000-117707.html|title=Off-Road Racer: The Grandfather of Off-Road Racing: BAJA 1000 - race-deZert.com|date=21 December 2014|website=race-dezert.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and endures nearly 1000 miles of racing on a closed and pre-designed Baja Truck course. Series like the [[National Off-Road Racing Association]] (NORRA) utilize off-road vehicles which was founded in 1967 to sanction events through the [[Baja Desert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.norra.com/norra.php|title=NORRA: National Off-Road Racing Association, Home of the Mexican 1000 Rally|website=www.norra.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first event sanctioned by the organization was the 1967 Mexican 1000 rally that began in [[Tijuana]] and ended in [[La Paz]].

A '''mountain sport''' or '''Alpine sport''' is one of several types of [[sport]] that take place in [[hill]]y or [[mountain]]ous terrain.

All these sports require special equipment, carry a higher level of [[risk]] and require specialised [[training]] before they can be undertaken safely.

Because mountain [[sportsmen]] deliberately go into terrain that is not easily accessible where there are higher risks – dangers such as [[avalanche]]s, bad [[weather]], [[mudflow]]s, [[rockfall]]s and [[icefall]]s - special measures must be taken to mitigate these risks. This is generally known as [[risk management]].
Mountain sports include the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpenverein.de/Bergsport/aktiv-sein/ ''Bergsport für alle ...Seien Sie aktiv'']. Zusammenfassung der Bergsportarten, online auf alpenverein.de, retrieved 1 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mountaineering]]
*[[Climbing]]
*[[Klettersteig]] or [[via ferrata]] climbing
*[[Ski touring]], [[ski mountaineering]] and its [[freeriding]]
*[[Snowshoe]]ing
*[[Hiking]], especially [[Hillwalking]]
*[[Mountain biking]] (partly)
*[[Trekking]]
*[[Canyoning]]

The usual [[skiing]] on [[piste]]s is not generally counted as a mountain sport, because the use of prepared slopes and the corresponding legal standards reduce risks to a minimum, so that the skier or snowboarder does not have to take account of any significant risks.

== Mountain sport tourism ==
Many mountain schools offer the various mountain sports as guided tours. These enable beginners to try out the various activities under supervision. The leaders of these tours know the likely risks on their tour routes and accompany the party. Some of these tours are targeted at specific groups, such as guided Alpine crossings for beginners, intermediates, older people or singles.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Merhi: [http://blog.guiders.de/bergwanderung/erfahrungsbericht-einer-alpenuberquerung/#more-3979 ''Erfahrungsbericht einer Alpenüberquerung'']. Report dated 26 August 2013. Online at guiders.de, retrieved 1 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

These tours have adapted to the changes in travel behaviour of tourists observed in recent years. For example, studies by the University of Berne have found that travellers expect increasingly individualized and flexible travel deals. They are mainly looking for deals that provide varied and intense experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Hansruedi Müller: [http://www.fif.unibe.ch/unibe/wiso/fif/content/e6012/e6025/e6037/e6184/Alpentourismus_Montagna_ger.pdf ''Der Alpentourismus vor großen Herausforderungen''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150655/http://www.fif.unibe.ch/unibe/wiso/fif/content/e6012/e6025/e6037/e6184/Alpentourismus_Montagna_ger.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }} (PDF, 26 kB). Online at fif.unibe.ch, retrieved 1 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mountain sports and conservation ==
Because mountain sports usually take place in area of relatively unspoilt nature, it is important that participants ensure their activities are carried out in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly way. For this reason guidelines have been prepared by the various mountaineering and alpine clubs. These say, for example, that plants may be photographed but not picked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpenverein.de/natur-umwelt/bergsport-und-umwelt/bergsteigen-wandern-natur_aid_10289.html ''Naturverträglich unterwegs'']. Maßnahmen zum Naturschutz im Bergsport. Online at alpenverein.de, retrieved 1 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these measures the [[Alpine countries]] and the [[EU]] have agreed a framework programme for pan-Alpine policy. The agreement is also known as the [[Alpine Convention]] and, in addition to conservation, also covers planning, sustainable development, mountain farming, countryside conservation, mountain forests, tourism, soil protextion, energy and transport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/ius/alpen/ ''Alpenkonvention''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130901130357/http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/ius/alpen/ |date=2013-09-01 }}.

[[Image:Triathlon, swimming.jpeg|thumb|Triathletes begin the swimming stage of the 12th World Military Triathlon.]]
A '''multisport competition''' is a family of [[sport|athletic]] competitions in which athletes race in a continuous series of stages or "legs", and rapidly switch from one athletic discipline to another in order to achieve the best overall time.   Most multisport events are [[endurance]] races, consisting of [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] activities such as [[bicycle racing|cycling]],
[[running]], [[kayaking]] and [[cross-country skiing]].

Familiar events from the [[Olympic Games]] such as the [[pentathlon]], [[heptathlon]], [[octathlon]], [[decathlon]], and [[modern pentathlon]] are not usually considered to fall in this category because their individual components are not held back-to-back.

==Standard multisport events==
The world of multisport competitions has grown from the older and more traditional [[triathlon]] and [[duathlon]] competitions, and today includes a large number of variations.   There is quite a bit of variation in the naming of these events; the more common and most standardized names are listed here.

[[Adventure racing]] includes races which comprise a number of different stages of different types.  In many adventure races, the competitors do not know some or all of the stages before the race, and must handle unexpected challenges. A team normally consists of 4 people with at least 1 female. All team members must stay together at all times.

== Related events ==
[[Biathlon]], which consists of alternating stages of [[cross-country skiing]] and [[shooting]] is often confused with duathlon because of the similarity in names.  Some consider biathlon to be a form of multisport event, while others exclude it from the category because the athlete's score includes shooting accuracy in addition to total race time.

[[Coast to Coast (race)|Coast to Coast]], a multisport race held in New Zealand's South Island. Starting at Kumara Beach on the Tasman Sea and finishing at [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] Beach on the Pacific Ocean, the {{convert|243|km|mi|abbr=on}} race involves a 3&amp;nbsp;km run, a 55&amp;nbsp;km cycle, a 33&amp;nbsp;km mountain run, a 15&amp;nbsp;km cycle, a 67&amp;nbsp;km kayak, and a 70&amp;nbsp;km cycle.  The ''Longest Day'' is considered the ''World Champion'' for this type of non-standard multisport race.

There are also three military multisports, mainly participated in by militaries at the [[World Military Games]] and world championships: [[Aeronautical pentathlon]], [[Military pentathlon]], and [[Naval pentathlon]].

A '''net sport''' is a [[sports|sport]] where a [[net (device)|net]] is a standard part of the game, especially where the net separates the opponents. The basic goal in these sports is to hit the [[ball]] or [[Badminton#Shuttlecock|bird]] over the net back to the opponent. Players score points whenever the opponent fails to return the ball or bird back over the net. The criteria on what is considered a valid return varies between each sport (such as the number of times the ball may be touched or bounced on a player's side before it must go back over the net).

Net sports usually include:&lt;ref name=spokesman-review&gt;{{cite news

* [[racquet sports]] such as [[tennis]], [[badminton]], [[pickleball]] and [[table tennis]] (but not [[Squash (sport)|squash]] or [[racquetball]], where players must hit the ball towards a wall).
* [[volleyball]], [[footvolley]], [[headis]] or [[sepak takraw]], where players must hit the ball with body.

Although [[basketball]], [[hockey]], [[water polo]] and other sports have netting around the [[Goal (sport)|goal]] area designed to more clearly indicate when goals are scored, they are not usually considered "net sports". Similarly, [[lacrosse stick]]s have a loose netting that is used to catch and fling the ball, but again [[lacrosse]] is not usually considered a "net sport".

The [[Los Angeles Daily Times]] reports: "Net sports are unique in that the equipment is light, portable and affordable, and partners and opponents are easy to find. The sports are easy to learn, and the social aspect of the game[s] appeals to those who find the health club to be an isolationist palace of mirrors."&lt;ref name=spokesman-review/&gt;

The three "favorite" net sports (tennis, badminton, and volleyball) usually involve arching of the [[human back|back]] when [[Serve (tennis)|serving]] or [[Volleyball#Attack|spiking]]/[[Smash (tennis)|smashing]] the ball or bird.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;

'''Sport''' ([[British English]]) or '''sports''' ([[American English]]) includes all forms of [[Competition|competitive]] [[physical activity]] or [[game]]s which,&lt;ref name=sportaccord&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idIndex=32&amp;idContent=14881 |title=Definition of sport |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028112912/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idIndex=32&amp;idContent=14881 |archivedate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, [[entertainment]] for spectators.&lt;ref name=council&gt;{{cite web |last=Council of Europe |title=The European sport charter |url=https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=206451 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in [[team]]s or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as [[racing]], many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a ''match'') is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide [[tie-breaking methods]] to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a [[tournament]] producing a [[champion]]. Many [[sports league]]s make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular [[sports season]], followed in some cases by [[playoffs]].

Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical [[athleticism]] or physical [[dexterity]], with the largest major competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]] admitting only sports meeting this definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/sports |title=List of Summer and Winter Olympic Sports and Events |publisher=The Olympic Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organisations such as the [[Council of Europe]] using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.&lt;ref name=council/&gt; However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as [[mind sport]]s. The International Olympic Committee (through [[Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations|ARISF]]) recognises both [[chess]] and [[Contract bridge|bridge]] as ''bona fide'' sports, and [[SportAccord]], the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, [[draughts]] (checkers), [[Go (game)|Go]] and [[xiangqi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=World Mind Games |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&amp;idContent=658 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508021848/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&amp;idContent=658 |archivedate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=Members |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&amp;idIndex=32 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507073823/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&amp;idIndex=32 |archivedate=7 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

Sport is usually governed by a set of [[regulation of sport|rules]] or [[tradition|customs]], which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring [[goal (sport)|goals]] or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.

Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in [[sports journalism|sport news]]. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with [[spectator sport]] drawing large crowds to [[sport venue]]s, and reaching wider audiences through [[broadcasting of sports events|broadcasting]]. [[Sport betting]] is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.

According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21585012-sportswomen-are-beginning-score-more-commercial-goalsbut-they-still-have-lot-ground |title=Women in sport: Game, sex and match |work=The Economist |date=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's most accessible and practised sport is [[running]], while [[association football]] is its most popular spectator sport.&lt;ref name=wa/&gt;

==Meaning and usage==
===Etymology===
The word "sport" comes from the [[Old French]] ''desport'' meaning "[[leisure]]", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being "anything humans find amusing or entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sport&amp;searchmode=none |title=sport (n.) |accessdate=20 April 2008 |first=Douglas |last=Harper |work=Online Etymological Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged |publisher=G&amp;C Merriam Company |location=Springfield, MA |page=2206 |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roget's defines the noun sport as an "activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms including diversion and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Roget's II: The New Thesaurus, Third Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/sport |year=1995 |isbn=0-618-25414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomenclature===
The singular term "sport" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. "children taking part in sport"), with "sports" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. "football and rugby are the most popular sports in England"). American English uses "sports" for both terms.

===Definition===
{{see also|Game#Definitions}}
[[File:ChessStartingPosition.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The International Olympic Committee recognises some board games as sports including [[chess]].]]
[[File:Showjumping white horse.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Show jumping]], an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport]]
The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by [[SportAccord]], which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including [[association football]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[cycling]], [[tennis]], [[equestrianism|equestrian sports]], and more), and is therefore the ''de facto'' representative of international sport.

SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;
*have an element of competition
*be in no way harmful to any living creature
*not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as [[arena football]])
*not rely on any "luck" element specifically designed into the sport.

They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as [[rugby union|rugby]] or [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]]), primarily mind (such as [[chess]] or [[Go (game)|Go]]), predominantly motorised (such as [[Formula 1]] or [[powerboating]]), primarily co-ordination (such as [[cue sports|billiard sports]]), or primarily animal-supported (such as [[equestrian sport]]).&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Judicial review of 'sport' or 'game' decision begins |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34320201 |date=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.

There has been an increase in the application of the term "sport" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as [[video game]]s, also called [[esports]], especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations. According to [[Council of Europe]], European Sports Charter, article 2.i, {{"'}}Sport' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, [https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016804c9dbb Revised European Sports Charter] (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
There are opposing views on the necessity of [[competition]] as a defining element of a sport, with almost all [[professional sport]] involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or SportAccord.&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity. For instance, the [[Council of Europe]] include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.

In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school [[sports day]]s, although moves like this are often controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Front |first=Rebecca |work=The Guardian |title=A little competition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/school-sport-competitive-children-achievement-ambition |date=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=ParentDish |title=Why parents hate school sports day |last=Scrimgeour |first=Heidi |date=17 June 2011 |url=http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2011/06/17/why-parents-hate-school-sports-day/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their "result" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with "handicaps" or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement. In [[gymnastics]] or [[diving (sport)|diving]] the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.

Artifacts and structures suggest [[sport in China]] as early as 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa032301a.htm |title=Sports History in China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient past. Monuments to the [[Pharaoh]]s indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ioa.leeds.ac.uk/1980s/84085.htm |title=Mr Ahmed D.

[[Ancient Persia]]n sports such as the traditional [[Iran]]ian martial art of [[Zourkhaneh]] had a close connection to warfare skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kuwait-info.com/newsnew/NewsDetails1.asp?id=78319&amp;dt=10/13/2006&amp;ntype=World |title=Persian warriors |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326081959/http://www.kuwait-info.com/newsnew/NewsDetails1.asp?id=78319&amp;dt=10%2F13%2F2006&amp;ntype=World |archivedate=26 March 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are [[polo]] and [[jousting]].

[[File:Goście Intel Extreme Masters (8465481816).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Electronic sports]] are a recent development.]]
A wide range of sports were already established by the time of [[Ancient Greece]] and the military culture and the development of sport in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp |title=Ancient Olympic Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought increased [[leisure time]], letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent of [[mass media]] and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes&amp;nbsp;– all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the turn of the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, there has been increasing debate about whether [[transgender]] sportspersons should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Sport and the Law: Historical and Cultural Intersections, p 111, Sarah K. Fields - 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair play==
===Sportsmanship===
{{Main article|Sportsmanship}}
{{See also|Gamesmanship|Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing}}

Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=sportsmanship |publisher=Merriam-Webster |title=Sportsmanship}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fish |first1=Joel |last2=Magee |first2=Susan |year=2003 |title=101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent |publisher=Fireside |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lacey |first=David |date=10 November 2007 |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html |title=It takes a bad loser to become a good winner |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist [[Grantland Rice]], that it's "not that you won or lost but how you played the game", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]]: "The most important thing... is not winning but taking part" are typical expressions of this sentiment.

===Cheating===
{{see also|Match fixing|cheating}}
Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win. Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.

Participants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains. The widespread existence of [[gambling]] on the results of sports fixtures creates a motivation for [[match fixing]], where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win.

===Doping and drugs===
{{main article|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport}}
The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as [[Blood doping|increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means]].

All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.

===Violence===
[[Violence in sports]] involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. [[Rioting]] or [[hooliganism]] by fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests.

==Participation==
===Gender participation===

{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{see also|Women's sports|Women's professional sports|Women's sports in the United States}}
Female participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for [[child development]] and [[physical fitness]]. Despite gains during the last three decades, a gap persists in the enrollment figures between male and female players. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics. Gender balance has been accelerating from a 32% increase in 1973–74 to a 63% increase in 1994–95. Hessel (2000).{{Full citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Youth participation===
{{expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{See also|College sport}}
Youth sport presents children with opportunities for fun, socialisation, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and [[athletic scholarship]]s. Activists for [[education]] and the [[war on drugs]] encourage youth sport as a means to increase [[Participation inequality|educational participation]] and to fight the [[illegal drug trade]]. According to the [[Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus)#Research and education|Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital]], the biggest risk for youth sport is death or serious injury including [[concussion]]. These risks come from running, basketball, association football, volleyball, gridiron, gymnastics, and ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2009/08/04/why-are-more-kids-getting-hurt-in-gym-class/ "Gym class injuries up 150% between 1997 and 2007"], ''Time'', 4 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Youth sport in the US is a $15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gregory |first1=Sean |title=How Kids' Sports Became a $15 Billion Industry |url=http://time.com/4913687/how-kids-sports-became-15-billion-industry/ |accessdate=24 August 2017 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disabled participation===
[[File:David Bizet - Marathon de Paris 2014.jpg|thumb|right|A runner gives a friendly tap on the shoulder to a wheelchair racer during the [[Paris Marathon|''Marathon International de Paris'' (Paris Marathon)]] in 2014.]]
{{see also|Disabled sports}}
'''Disabled sports''' also '''adaptive sports''' or '''parasports''', are sports played by persons with a [[disability]], including [[physical disability|physical]] and [[intellectual disabilities]]. As many of these are based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as ''adapted sports''. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.

===Spectator involvement===
[[File:1906 Athens stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Spectators at the 1906 unofficial Olympic Games]]
{{Main article|Spectator sport}}
The competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of [[spectator sport]].

Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast media including [[radio broadcasting|radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcast. Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or [[pay-per-view]] television broadcast.

It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures. The football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] attracts a global [[television]] audience of hundreds of millions; the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup Finals|final]] alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700&amp;nbsp;million and the [[2011 Cricket World Cup Final]]  attracted an estimated audience of 135&amp;nbsp;million in India alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=135 mn saw World Cup final: TAM |date=10 April 2011 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |newspaper=Hindustan Times |accessdate=1 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803013151/http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |archivedate=3 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the championship game of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the [[Super Bowl]], has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year.&lt;ref name="SB15"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/super-bowl-sets-viewership-record-161138960.html |title=Super Bowl XLIX was the most-viewed television program in U.S. history |publisher=Yahoo Sports |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cbc8df2a-aafd-11e4-81bc-00144feab7de.html |title=Super Bowl most watched television show in US history |work=Financial Times |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and considerations==
===Amateur and professional===
[[File:OHL-Hockey-Plymouth-Whalers-vs-Saginaw-Spirit.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Modern sports have complex [[Regulation of sport|rules]] and are highly organised.]]
{{See also|professional sport|amateur sport}}
Sport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a [[wage]] or [[salary]]). Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called "grassroots sport".&lt;ref name="council"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White Paper"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=European Commission |title=The White Paper on Sport |url=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/white-paper/index_en.htm |accessdate=11 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916202200/http://ec.europa.eu/sport/white-paper/index_en.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of [[spectator sport]] as a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised a high paying [[professional sport]] culture, where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run into millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Sports Illustrated |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/specials/fortunate50-2011/index.html |title=Fortunate 50 2011 |last=Freedman |first=Jonah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of allowing only [[amateur sport]]. The [[Olympic Games]] started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.&lt;ref name=OIdeology&gt;{{cite book |last=Eassom |first=Simon |title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology |year=1994 |location=Ontario |publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies |pages=120–123 |isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1971, Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship,&lt;ref name="InfoPlease"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/olympic-athletes.html |title=Olympic Athletes |publisher=Info Please |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1986, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics,&lt;ref name="InfoPlease"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/22/opinion/greene-olympics-amateurs/ |title=What changed the Olympics forever |publisher=CNN |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exceptions of [[boxing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/13894/olympic-boxing-must-remain-amateur-despite-moves-to-turn-it-professional-states-warren- |title=Olympic boxing must remain amateur despite moves to turn it professional states Warren |publisher=Inside the Games |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njefAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400&amp;dq=only+amateur+boxers+at+olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0jbCDYw8R1&amp;sig=6_-OvLg15u_iGOSTCS6lxm8dedw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwATgKahUKEwi6xNfgiI3GAhVRBNsKHf_HAJ0#v=onepage&amp;q=only%20amateur%20boxers%20at%20olympics&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Boxing |last1=Grasso |first1=John |date=2013 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1529280-olympic-wrestling-is-important-for-pro-wrestlers-and-its-fans |title=Olympic Wrestling Is Important for Pro Wrestling and Its Fans |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=only+amateur+wrestlers+at+olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7VnB9vii1&amp;sig=E0kjCilT-UbvD94prBgV1LIgmSE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwB2oVChMI9NP2pomNxgIVoQrbCh2kbQC_#v=onepage&amp;q=only%20amateur%20wrestlers%20at%20olympics&amp;f=false |title=Boys' Life |date=August 1988 |page=24 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
Technology plays an important part in modern sport. With it being a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport), it is used in others to improve performance. Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.
 
[[Sports science]] is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved [[running shoe]]s or [[competitive swimwear]]. [[Sports engineering]] emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big data to [[wearable technology]].&lt;ref name="Gaining Steam in Sports Technology"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gaining Steam in Sports Technology |url=https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/06/17/mit-steam-sports-technology/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150052/https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/06/17/mit-steam-sports-technology/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2014 |website=Slice of MIT |accessdate=3 January 2015 |ref=Slice of MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants. For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits were banned by [[FINA]], as they were enhancing swimmers' performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/swimming/8161867.stm |title=Hi-tech suits banned from January |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-body-swimsuit-now-banned-professional-swimmers/story?id=9437780 |title=Full Body Swimsuit Now Banned for Professional Swimmers |publisher=ABC News |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official using instant replays to make decisions. In some sports, players can now challenge decisions made by officials. In [[Association football]], [[goal-line technology]] makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=FIFA |title=Testing Manual |journal=FIFA Quality Programme for Goal Line Technology |year=2012 |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifaqualityprogramme/goal-linetechnology/01/66/02/89/glt_testing_manual_2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is not compulsory,&lt;ref name=IFABofficial&gt;{{cite web |title=IFAB makes three unanimous historic decisions |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2012/m=7/news=ifab-makes-three-unanimous-historic-decisions-1660541.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was used in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=4/news=goal-line-technology-set-ahead-fifa-world-cup-2311481.html |title=Goal-line technology set up ahead of FIFA World Cup |date=1 April 2014 |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]] in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/news/y=2015/m=3/news=hawk-eye-confirmed-as-goal-line-technology-provider-for-canada-2015-2580727.html |title=Hawk-Eye confirmed as goal-line technology provider for Canada 2015 |date=31 March 2015 |publisher=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the [[Premier League]] from [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14]],&lt;ref name="BBC_Premier"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22107409 |title=Goal-line technology: Premier League votes in favour for 2013-14 |publisher=BBC |date=11 April 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bundesliga]] from [[2015–16 Bundesliga|2015–16]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carlyleobserver.com/sports/bundesliga-approves-hawk-eye-goal-line-technology-for-new-season-1.1650074 |title=Bundesliga approves Hawk-Eye goal-line technology for new season |work=Carlyle Observer |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[NFL]], a referee can ask for a review from the replay booth, or a head coach can issue a [[Challenge (NFL)|challenge]] to review the play using replays.

[[Benito Mussolini]] used the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], which was held in [[Italy]], to showcase [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWj7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |title=Soccer Vs. the State: Tackling Football and Radical Politics |last1=Kuhn |first1=Gabriel |date=2011 |page=28 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Fascism"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=PA630 |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |last1=Blamires |first1=Cyprian |date=2006 |pages=630–632 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] also used the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Berlin]], and the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], to promote the [[Nazi ideology]] of the superiority of the [[Aryan race]], and inferiority of the Jews and other "[[Untermensch|undesirables]]".&lt;ref name="World Fascism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sociology Sport"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKarC6oX3P8C&amp;pg=PT32&amp;dq=hitler+used+1936+olympics+to+promote+ideology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x6N1Va3pJ-Sa7gaVoICoBA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hitler%20used%201936%20olympics%20to%20promote%20ideology&amp;f=false |title=The Sociology of Sport and Physical Education |last1=Saxena |first1=Anurag |year=2001 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany used the Olympics to give of itself a peaceful image while it was very actively preparing the war.&lt;ref&gt;Kulttuurivihkot 1 2009 Berliinin olympialaiset 1936 Poliittisen viattomuuden menetys Jouko Jokisalo 28-29{{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[apartheid]] was the official policy in [[South Africa]], many sports people, particularly in [[rugby union]], adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00165.x |title=Sport and apartheid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of [[Ireland]], Gaelic sports were connected with [[cultural nationalism]]. Until the mid-20th&amp;nbsp;century a person could have been banned from playing [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], or other sports administered by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) if she/he played or supported [[Association football]], or other games seen to be of [[Great Britain|British]] origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and [[rugby union]] at Gaelic venues. This ban, also known as Rule 42,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fulton |first=Gareth |last2=Bairner |first2=Alan |year=2007 |title=Sport, Space and National Identity in Ireland: The GAA, Croke Park and Rule&amp;nbsp;42. |url= |journal=Space &amp; policy |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=55–74 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in [[Croke Park]] while [[Lansdowne Road]] was redeveloped into [[Aviva Stadium]]. Until recently, under Rule&amp;nbsp;21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.

[[Nationalism]] is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the [[Football War]]. These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.

A very famous case when sport and politics collided was the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli olympic team and killed many of their men. This was known as the [[Munich massacre]].

A study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results. A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5&amp;nbsp;percent. A loss had the opposite effect, and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Ohio State's Football Team Decide Who Wins the White House? |author1=Tyler Cowen |author2=Kevin Grier |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=24 October 2012 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/how_the_presidential_race_between_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_could_be.html |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when [[Washington Redskins]] win their final game before an election, then the incumbent President is more likely to win, and if the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win; this has become known as the [[Redskins Rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2012/11/03/will-redskins-rule-again-determine-outcome-of-presidential-election/ |title=Will Redskins Rule again determine outcome of presidential election? |author=Mike Jones |date=3 November 2012 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2012/10/redskins-rule-mnfs-hirdt-on-intersection-of-football-politics/ |title='Redskins Rule': MNF's Hirdt on intersection of football &amp; politics |work=ESPN Front Row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sports as a means of controlling and subduing populations====
[[Étienne de La Boétie]], in his essay ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their subjects by distracting them.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Do not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy, nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait, than are all these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest feather passed, so to speak, before their mouths. Truly it is a marvelous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy. Plays, farces, spectacles, gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny. By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples, fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes, learned subservience as naïvely, but not so creditably, as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books.&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne de La Boétie]], ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' (1549), Part 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religious views on sports===
The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of [[idolatry]], in which "human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves."&lt;ref name=Watson1&gt;''Sports and Christianity: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives'', Nick J. Watson, ed. (Routledge: 2013), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of "collective pride" and "national self-deification" in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worship.&lt;ref name=Watson1/&gt;

[[Tertullian]] condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting "the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''[[De spectaculis]]'', Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
God has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness. ... Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that. Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them&amp;nbsp;– the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De spectaculis]]'' Chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
