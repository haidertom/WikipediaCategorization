'''Contemporary society''', according to social and political scientists, is characterised by at least three fundamental directions:
* '''increasing human interconnection''' through a network of relationships that is progressively covering the whole planet;
* '''the pace and depth of the evolution of human ways of life''' determined by technological innovation represent an absolute novelty in human history;
* the scale of '''anthropological and ecological transformation''' due to the interaction between [[evolutionary factor]]s (social, cultural, economic, and technological) has no historical precedent.

These presentations are the result of a number of fundamental changes that are irreversibly transforming our daily lives, our way of thinking and perceiving the world and our way of living together. Among these fundamental changes are: improvements in life conditions, life expectancy, literacy and gender equality; changes in domestic and international political institutions; and the breakdown of natural equilibria.

==Improvement of life conditions==
The UN estimates that, at the beginning of the 20th century, about 60% of the world population lived in conditions of extreme poverty. In 1981, 40% of the world population lived extreme poverty. In 2001, the percentage had been halved to 20%.
Several developing countries, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, still suffer from social and economic backwardness, but life conditions have significantly improved in most regions of the world, in particular in Asia. 
The overall improvement in life conditions and the role of technologies now available have contributed to increase [[gross domestic product]] per capita by one and a half times in less than half a century (1960–2005), with peaks of over eight times in Eastern Asia. Only in a few countries, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, growth of per capita income has been very slow.

==Life expectancy==
In 1960, the average [[life expectancy]] of the world population was 50 years. Forty-five years later, in 2004, life expectancy had improved by over 30% to 67 years. Improvements in health care and the reduction in child mortality have led to a jump forward in middle-income countries, where life expectancy is now over 70 years. In high-income countries life expectancy is now over 80 years, extending well beyond the traditional length of working life, causing social and economic problems. It has led to people having an extra 4 hours of free-time during working days.&lt;ref&gt;television{{clarify|date=July 2016|reason="television" is ambiguous; be more specific.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literacy and gender equality==
The ability to read and write is next to universal: in 2004, 80% of adult men and 73% of adult women had basic literacy skills. Of great social importance is the rapid growth of female school enrolment and the increasing presence of women in the labour market. These deep changes constitute a primary driver of economic growth in developing countries.
Female literacy has great consequences in terms of fertility. When female school enrollment and employment rates increase, fertility rates decline rapidly and tend to stabilise around the natural rate of reproduction of 2.1 children per women (see E. Todd, "After the Empire"). Several demographers believe that, as a consequence, world population will stabilise over the next few decades, at a level compatible with the resources of the planet [reference].

==Spread of communication technologies==
The world population has a number of "passive" (broadcasting) communication technologies (radio, television) that cover the whole globe. Moreover, a large portion of the population uses "active" communication technologies (telephone, internet). Internet connections are expanding rapidly: in 2004 there were 140 Internet users every 1000 inhabitants (according to data from the "International Communication Union"). The spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) is remodelling the material fundamentals of society. The sociologist [[Manuel Castells|Castells]] believes that these technologies have started a revolution of the productive structures of society and of daily life.

The new communication technologies represent a critical instrument to obtain consensus and as a result they are transforming the organisational models of the State and of politics. The power system becomes less visible but more pervasive in the way it can influence choices and ways of thinking [[Manuel Castells|M. Castells]], "Galassia Internet", Feltrinelli, 2002).

==Economic growth and evolution of political institutions==
The economic success of authoritarian regimes, mainly in Asia, suggests that (at least in the short term) economic growth is independent from the democratisation of political institutions. However, economic development favours the development of democratic institutions&amp;mdash;but only if economic growth leads to substantial changes in cultural and social structures. ([[Ronald Inglehart|R. Inglehart]], "La società postmoderna").
The "[[World Values Survey]]", which captures political values in 43 countries, shows that no country with a per capita income below the poverty line has democratic or free institutions. Almost the totality of nations with high per capita income are classified as democratic.

==Globalization==
Over the last fifty years, world gross domestic product has increased by about five times, while trade has increased tenfold over the same period. These data suggests that the intensity of the commercial exchange between countries has developed faster than the overall economy. However, globalisation has gone beyond the exchange of physical commodities and it is progressively modelling also the lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals and societies. The Swiss think-tank KOF has developed a number of globalisation indicators that show the increasing development of global individual, social and commercial networks.

==Social tension and opposition to change==
New international flows have diminished the role of traditional political institutions&amp;mdash;sometimes with negative consequences for social stability. In many societies, stability (or slow evolution) has been substituted by unstoppable and irreversible transformations.
As a result, individuals and communities perceive a high degree of insecurity&amp;mdash;insecurity that touches every aspect of their lives. Growing masses of people feel threatened by the changes that affect their material (work, income, house), psychological (personal relationships), and cultural life (with the need to continuously update knowledge and professional skills).

The social improvement of the masses—resulting from increasing literacy and income, universal means of communication and a new social role of women—has eroded the traditional role of the elites and have weakened the traditional regulatory role of the state.
As the speed of social and cultural evolution sweeps away old life habits, religious beliefs, ancestral moral convictions and radicated political opinions, the anxiety towards a future that is mutating and unknown causes a cultural opposition that is at the root of fundamentalism. Opposition against new life conditions is justified also by increasing economic inequality: "the gap between the wealth of the North and that of the South of the world has increased by a multiple of five since the beginning of the 20th century" ([[:fr:Daniel Cohen (économiste)|Daniel Cohen]] {{fr icon}}, "Trois leçons sur la société postindustrielle").

==Breakdown of natural equilibria==
When demographic growth is multiplied by the growth of per capita income and consumption, one can have a measure of the global impact on environmental sustainability. Demographic and economic development is endangering our current forms of civilization and social co-living and our future ability to inhabit our planet.
Alternative scenarios developed by international organizations suggest the possibility of a serious breakdown of natural equilibrium unless political, scientific and economic tools are directed to a correction towards an acceptable equilibrium between humankind and with nature.

[[industrialization|Industrial]] societies use external energy sources, such as [[fossil fuels]], to increase the rate and scale of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/98/04717398/0471739898.pdf |title=Chapter 1: Energy Fundamentals, Energy Use in an Industrial Society |website= |accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of food is shifted to large commercial farms where the products of industry, such as [[combine harvesters]] and fossil fuel based [[fertilizers]], are used to decrease required human labor while increasing production. No longer needed for the production of food, excess labor is moved into these [[factories]] where [[mechanization]] is utilized to further increase efficiency. As populations grow, and [[mechanization]] is further refined, often to the level of [[automation]], many workers shift to expanding [[service industries]].

Industrial society makes [[urbanization]] desirable, in part so that workers can be closer to centers of production, and the [[service industry]] can provide labor to workers and those that benefit financially from them, in exchange for a piece of production profits with which they can buy goods. This leads to the rise of very large cities and surrounding [[suburb]]an areas with a high rate of [[economic activity]].

These [[urban area|urban centers]] require the input of external energy sources in order to overcome the [[diminishing returns]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arthur |first=Brian |title=Positive Feedbacks in the Economy |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=262 |pages=92–99 |date=February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; of agricultural consolidation, due partially to the lack of nearby [[arable land]], associated transportation and storage costs, and are otherwise unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McGranahan |first=Gordon |authorlink= |date=November 2003 |title=URBAN CENTERS: An Assessment of Sustainability |journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources |volume=28 |issue= |pages=243–274 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.28.050302.105541 |last2=Satterthwaite |first2=David }}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the reliable availability of the needed energy resources high priority in industrial government policies.

Some theoreticians (namely [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Anthony Giddens]], and [[Manuel Castells]]) argue that we are located in the middle of a transformation or transition from industrial societies to [[post-industrial society|post-industrial societies]]. The triggering technology for the change from an agricultural to an industrial organisation was [[steam power]], allowing [[mass production]] and reducing the agricultural work necessary. Thus, many industrial cities have been built around rivers. Identified as catalyst or trigger for the transition to post-modern or [[informational society]] is global [[information technology]].

Some, such as Theodore Kaczynski, have argued that an industrialized society leads to [[psychological pain]] and that citizens must actively work to return to a more primitive society. His essay, ''[[Industrial Society and Its Future]]'', describes different political factions and laments the direction of technology and the [[modern world]].

In the majority of nations, including all industrialised nations except the United States, advances in [[Labour law|employee relations]] have seen the introduction of statutory agreements for minimum [[Annual leave|employee leave from work]]—that is the amount of entitlement to paid vacation and public holidays. Several companies will offer contractually more time, depending on the sector. Companies and the law may also differ as to whether [[Lists of holidays|public holidays]] are counted as part of the minimum leave. Disparities in national minimums are still subject of debate regarding [[work-life balance]] and perceived differences between nations. These numbers usually refer to full-time employment, part-time workers may get a reduced number of days. In most countries, public holidays are paid and usually not considered part of the annual leave. Also, in most countries there are additional paid leave benefits such as [[parental leave]] and [[sick leave]] that are not listed here.

== Methodology ==
For the purpose of comparison, the paid vacation column has been normalised to a five-day workweek. For instance, a calendar day is divided by seven and multiplied by five, while a six-day workweek day is divided by six and multiplied by five. The paid vacation column gives the minimum mandatory vacation days for an employee who has one year of service with the same employer.

In some countries, the public holidays are strictly bound to the calendar dates, so if they happen on Saturday or Sunday, they are "lost" for the particular year. As a result, the average number of paid extra free days can be lower than the table specifies. For example, in the Czech Republic, where the official number of paid public holidays is 13, the average number of public holidays during working days in the years 2000–2016 was only 8.9 days. In other countries, the public holidays which happen on Saturday or Sunday are moved to the nearest Monday or Friday such as in the United Kingdom or the United States.

== Social origins in nature ==

=== Origin of social groups ===
==== Hobbes ====
[[Image:Leviathan_by_Thomas_Hobbes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frontispiece of "Leviathan," by [[Abraham Bosse]], with input from Hobbes]]
Arguably the most influential theory of human social origins is that of [[Thomas Hobbes]], who in his ''Leviathan''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes. Leviathan: Or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civill, ed. by Ian Shapiro (Yale University Press; 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; argued that without strong government, society would collapse into ''[[Bellum omnium contra omnes]]'' — "the war of all against all":
{{quotation|In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.|{{Citation|title=Leviathan|chapter=Chapter XIII: Of the Natural Condition of Mankind As Concerning Their Felicity, and Misery.}}}} Hobbes' innovation was to attribute the establishment of society to a founding '[[social contract]]', in which the Crown's subjects surrender some part of their freedom in return for security.

If Hobbes' idea is accepted, it follows that society could not have emerged prior to the state. This school of thought has remained influential to this day.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Runciman (ed.), ''The Origin of Human Social Institutions.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent in this respect is British archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] (Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn), who points out that the state did not emerge until long after the evolution of ''Homo sapiens''. The earliest representatives of our species, according to Renfrew, may well have been ''anatomically'' modern, but they were not yet ''cognitively'' or ''behaviourally'' modern. For example, they lacked political leadership, large-scale cooperation, food production, organised religion, law or symbolic artefacts. Humans were simply hunter-gatherers, who — much like extant apes — ate whatever food they could find in the vicinity. Renfrew controversially suggests that hunter-gatherers to this day think and socialise along lines not radically different from those of their nonhuman primate counterparts. In particular, he says that they do not "ascribe symbolic meaning to material objects" and for that reason "lack fully developed 'mind.'"{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, hunter-gatherer ethnographers emphasise that extant foraging peoples certainly do have social institutions — notably institutionalised rights and duties codified in formal systems of kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi Strauss, C. 1969. ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship''. London: Eyre and Spottiswoode.&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate rituals such as initiation ceremonies serve to cement contracts and commitments, quite independently of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gennep, A. 1960 [1909] ''The Rites of Passage.'' London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars would add that insofar as we can speak of "human revolutions" — "major transitions" in human evolution&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, J. and E. Szathmáry 1995. ''The Major Transitions in Evolution.'' Oxford: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; — the first was not the Neolithic Revolution but the rise of symbolic culture that occurred toward the end of the Middle Stone Age.&lt;ref&gt;Mellars, P. A., K. Boyle, O. Bar-Yosef and C. Stringer (eds), 2007. ''Rethinking the Human Revolution: new behavioural and biological perspectives on the origin and dispersal of modern humans.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C., C. Power and I. Watts 1995. The human symbolic revolution: A Darwinian account. ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal.'' 5(1): 75–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing the exact opposite of Hobbes's position, anarchist anthropologist [[Pierre Clastres]] views the state and society as mutually incompatible: genuine society is always struggling to survive ''against'' the state.&lt;ref&gt;Clastres, P. 1977. ''[[Society Against the State]].'' Trans. R. Hurley in collaboration with A. Stein. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ====
[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|Rousseau in 1753]]
Like Hobbes, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued that society was born in a social contract. In Rousseau's case, however, sovereignty is vested in the entire populace, who enter into the contract directly with one another. "The problem", he explained, "is to find a form of association which will defend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain as free as before." This is the fundamental problem of which the Social Contract provides the solution. The contract's clauses, Rousseau continued, may be reduced to one — "the total alienation of each associate, together with all his rights, to the whole community. Each man, in giving himself to all, gives himself to nobody; and as there is no associate over whom he does not acquire the same right as he yields others over himself, he gains an equivalent for everything he loses, and an increase of force for the preservation of what he has". In other words: "Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will, and, in our corporate capacity, we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole." At once, in place of the individual personality of each contracting party, this act of association creates a moral and collective body, composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes, and receiving from this act its unity, its common identity, its life and its will.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, J.-J. 1973 [1762]. The social contract. In Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''The Social Contract and Discourses.'' ''Trans. G. D. H. Cole. New edition. London &amp; Melbourne: Dent. Book I, Ch. 6.''&lt;/ref&gt; By this means, each member of the community acquires not only the capacities of the whole but also, for the first time, rational mentality:

{{quotation|The passage from the state of nature to the civil state produces a very remarkable change in man, by substituting justice for instinct in his conduct, and giving his actions the morality they had formerly lacked. Then only, when the voice of duty takes the place of physical impulses and right of appetite, does man, who so far had considered only himself, find that he is forced to act on different principles, and to consult his reason before listening to his inclinations.|{{Citation|title= ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau,'' The Social Contract and Discourses. ''Trans. G. D. H. Cole. New edition. London &amp; Melbourne: Dent. Book I Ch. 8.''}}}}

====Sir Henry Sumner Maine====
In his influential book, ''Ancient Law'' (1861), Maine argued that in early times, the basic unit of human social organisation was the patriarchal family:

[[Image:Maine by Dickinson.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sir Henry James Sumner Maine]]{{quotation|The effect of the evidence derived from comparative jurisprudence is to establish the view of the primeval condition of the human race which is known as the Patriarchal Theory.|{{Citation|title= ''Maine, H. S. 1861. ''Ancient Law.'' London: John Murray. p. 122.''}}}}

Hostile to French revolutionary and other radical social ideas, Maine's motives were partly political. He sought to undermine the legacy of Rousseau and other advocates of man’s natural rights by asserting that originally, no one had any rights at all – ‘every man, living during the greater part of his life under the patriarchal despotism, was practically controlled in all his actions by a regimen not of law but of caprice’.&lt;ref&gt;Maine, H. S. 1861. ''Ancient Law.'' London: John Murray. p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only were the patriarch’s children subject to what Maine calls his ‘despotism’: his wife and his slaves were equally affected. The very notion of kinship, according to Maine, was simply a way of categorizing those who were forcibly subjected to the despot’s arbitrary rule. Maine later added a Darwinian strand to this argument. In his ''The Descent of Man,'' Darwin had cited reports that a wild-living male gorilla would monopolise for itself as large a harem of females as it could violently defend. Maine endorsed Darwin’s speculation that ‘primeval man’ probably 'lived in small communities, each with as many wives as he could support and obtain, whom he would have jealously guarded against all other men’.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1871. ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,'' 2 vols. London: Murray. Vol. 2, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure to spell out exactly what he meant by the term 'patriarchy', Maine clarified that ‘sexual jealousy, indulged through power, might serve as a definition of the Patriarchal Family’.&lt;ref&gt;Maine, H. S. 1883. ''Early Law and Custom.'' London: John Murray, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lewis Henry Morgan ====
[[File:Lewishenrymorgan.jpg|200px|thumb|Lewis H. Morgan]]
In his influential book, ''Ancient Society'' (1877), its title echoing Maine's ''Ancient Law,'' [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] proposed a very different theory. Morgan insisted that throughout the earlier periods of human history, neither the state nor the family existed.

{{quotation| It may be here premised that all forms of government are reducible to two general plans, using the word plan in its scientific sense. In their bases the two are fundamentally distinct. The first, in the order of time, is founded upon persons, and upon relations purely personal, and may be distinguished as a society ''(societas)''. The gens is the unit of this organization; giving as the successive stages of integration, in the archaic period, the gens, the phratry, the tribe, and the confederacy of tribes, which constituted a people or nation (''populus''). At a later period a coalescence of tribes in the same area into a nation took the place of a confederacy of tribes occupying independent areas. Such, through prolonged ages, after the gens appeared, was the substantially universal organization of ancient society; and it remained among the Greeks and Romans after civilization supervened. The second is founded upon territory and upon property, and may be distinguished as a state ''(civitas).''|{{Citation|title= ''Morgan, L. H. 1877.'' Ancient Society. ''Chicago: Charles H. Kerr, p. 6.''}}}} In place of both family and state, according to Morgan, was the ''gens'' — nowadays termed the 'clan' — based initially on matrilocal residence and matrilineal descent. This aspect of Morgan's theory, later endorsed by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, is nowadays widely considered discredited (but for a critical survey of the current consensus, see Knight 2008, 'Early Human Kinship Was Matrilineal'&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2008. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/class_text_105.pdf Early human kinship was matrilineal]. In N. J. Allen, H. Callan, R. Dunbar and W. James (eds.), ''Early Human Kinship''. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 61–82.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== Frederick Engels ====
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|200px|Frederick Engels]]

[[Frederick Engels]] built on Morgan's ideas in his 1884 essay, ''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State in the light of the researches of Lewis Henry Morgan.'' His primary interest was the position of women in early society, and — in particular — Morgan's insistence that the matrilineal clan preceded the family as society's fundamental unit. 'The mother-right gens', wrote Engels in his survey of contemporary historical materialist scholarship, 'has become the pivot around which the entire science turns...' Engels argued that the matrilineal clan represented a principle of self-organization so vibrant and effective that it allowed no room for patriarchal dominance or the territorial state.{{quotation|The first class antagonism which appears in human history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamian marriage, and the first class oppression with that of the female sex by the male.|{{Citation|title= ''Engels, F. 1940 [1884]'' The origin of the family, private property and the state. ''London: Lawrence and Wishart.''}}}}

====Emile Durkheim====
{{Infobox scientist
|name = Émile Durkheim
|image = Emile_Durkheim.jpg
|image_size = 200px}}

[[Emile Durkheim]] considered that in order to exist, any human social system must counteract the natural tendency for the sexes to promiscuously conjoin. He argued that social order presupposes sexual morality, which is expressed in prohibitions against sex with certain people or during certain periods — in traditional societies particularly during menstruation.

{{quotation|One first fact is certain: that is, that the entire system of prohibitions must strictly conform to the ideas that primitive man had about menstruation and about menstrual blood. For all these taboos start only with the onset of puberty: and it is only when the first signs of blood appear that they reach their maximum rigour.|{{Citation|title= ''Durkheim, E. 1963 [1898]. La prohibition de l'inceste et ses origines.'' L'Année Sociologique ''1: 1–70. Reprinted as'' Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo, ''trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart, p. 81.''}}}}

The incest taboo, wrote Durkheim in 1898, is no more than a particular example of something more basic and universal - the ritualistic setting apart of 'the sacred' from 'the profane'. This begins as the segregation of the sexes, each of which - at least on important occasions - is 'sacred' or 'set apart' from the other. 'The two sexes', as Durkheim explains, 'must avoid each other with the same care as the profane flees from the sacred and the sacred from the profane.' Women as sisters act out the role of 'sacred' beings invested 'with an isolating power of some sort, a power which holds the masculine population at a distance.' Their menstrual blood in particular sets them in a category apart, exercising a 'type of repulsing action which keeps the other sex far from them'. In this way, the earliest ritual structure emerges — establishing morally regulated 'society' for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1963. [1898] La prohibition de l’inceste et ses origines. ''L’Année Sociologique'' 1: 1–70. Reprinted as ''Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo,'' trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sigmund Freud====
[[Charles Darwin]] pictured early human society as resembling that of apes, with one or more dominant males jealously guarding a harem of females.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1871. ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,'' 2 vols. London: Murray. Vol. 2, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; In his myth of the 'Primal Horde', [[Sigmund Freud]] later took all this as his starting point but then postulated an insurrection mounted by the tyrant's own sons:{{quotation|All that we find there is a violent and jealous father who keeps all the females for himself and drives away his sons as they grow up…. One day the brothers who had been driven out came together, killed and devoured their father and so made an end of the patriarchal horde.|{{Citation|title= ''Freud, S. 1965 [1913].'' Totem and Taboo. ''London: Routledge, p. 141.''}}}} Following this, the band of brothers were about to take sexual possession of their mothers and sisters when suddenly they were overcome with remorse. In their contradictory emotional state, their dead father now became stronger than the living one had been. In memory of him, the brothers revoked their deed by forbidding the killing and eating of the 'totem' (as their father had now become) and renouncing their claim to the women who had just been set free. In this way, the two fundamental taboos of primitive society – not to eat the totem and not to marry one's sisters – were established for the first time.

====Marshall Sahlins====
A related but less dramatic version of Freud's 'sexual revolution' idea was proposed in 1960 by American social anthropologist [[Marshall Sahlins]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahlins, M. D. 1960. The origin of society. ''Scientific American'' 203(3): 76–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Somehow, he writes, the world of primate brute competition and sexual dominance was turned upside-down: {{quotation|The decisive battle between early culture and human nature must have been waged on the field of [[primate sexuality]]….  Among subhuman primates sex had organized society; the customs of hunters and gatherers testify eloquently that now society was to organize sex…. In selective adaptation to the perils of the Stone Age, human society overcame or subordinated such primate propensities as selfishness, indiscriminate sexuality, dominance and brute competition. It substituted kinship and co-operation for conflict, placed solidarity over sex, morality over might. In its earliest days it accomplished the greatest reform in history, the overthrow of human primate nature, and thereby secured the evolutionary future of the species.|{{Citation|title= ''Sahlins, M.

If we accept Rousseau's line of reasoning, no single dominant individual is needed to embody society, to guarantee security or to enforce social contracts. The people themselves can do these things, combining to enforce the general will. A modern origins theory along these lines is that of evolutionary anthropologist [[Christopher Boehm]]. Boehm argues that ape social organisation tends to be despotic, typically with one or more dominant males monopolising access to the locally available females. But wherever there is dominance, we can also expect resistance. In the human case, resistance to being personally dominated intensified as humans used their social intelligence to form coalitions. Eventually, a point was reached when the costs of attempting to impose dominance became so high that the strategy was no longer evolutionarily stable, whereupon social life tipped over into 'reverse dominance' — defined as a situation in which only the entire community, on guard against primate-style individual dominance, is permitted to use force to suppress deviant behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest. The evolution of egalitarian behavior.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ernest Gellner ====
Human beings, writes social anthropologist Ernest Gellner, are not genetically programmed to be members of this or that social order. You can take a human infant and place it into any kind of social order and it will function acceptably. What makes human society so distinctive is the fabulous range of quite different forms it takes across the world. Yet in any given society, the range of permitted behaviours is quite narrowly constrained. This is not owing to the existence of any externally imposed system of rewards and punishments. The constraints come from within — from certain compulsive moral concepts which members of the social order have internalised. The society installs these concepts in each individual's psyche in the manner first identified by Emile Durkheim, namely, by means of collective rituals such as initiation rites. Therefore, the problem of the origins of society boils down to the problem of the origins of collective ritual.

{{quotation|How is a  society established, and a series of societies diversified, whilst each of them is restrained from chaotically exploiting that wide diversity of possible human behaviour? A theory is available concerning how this may be done and it is one of the basic theories of social anthropology. The way in which you restrain people from doing a wide variety of things, not compatible with the social order of which they are members, is that you subject them to ritual. The process is simple: you make them dance around a totem pole until they are wild with excitement, and become jellies in the hysteria of collective frenzy; you enhance their emotional state by any device, by all the locally available audio-visual aids, drugs, music and so on; and once they are really high, you stamp upon their minds the type of concept or notion to which they subsequently become enslaved.|{{Citation|title=''Gellner, E. 1988. Origins of Society. In A. C. Fabian (ed.),'' Origins. The Darwin College Lectures. ''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.128–140; p. 130.''}}}}

===Gender and origins===
Feminist scholars — among them palaeoanthropologists Leslie Aiello and Camilla Power — take similar arguments a step further, arguing that any reform or revolution which overthrew male dominance must surely have been led by women. Evolving human females, Power and Aiello suggest, actively separated themselves from males on a periodic basis, using their own blood (and/or pigments such as red ochre) to mark themselves as fertile and defiant: {{quotation|The sexual division of labor entails differentiation of roles in food procurement, with logistic hunting of large game by males, co-operation and exchange of products. Our hypothesis is that symbolism arose in this context. To minimize energetic costs of travel, coalitions of women began to invest in home bases. To secure this strategy, women would have to use their attractive, collective signal of impending fertility in a wholly new way: by signalling refusal of sexual access except to males who returned "home" with provisions. Menstruation — real or artificial — while biologically the wrong time for fertile sex, is psychologically the right moment for focusing men's minds on imminent hunting, since it offers the prospect of fertile sex in the near future.|{{Citation|title= ''Power, C. and L. C. Aiello 1997. Female proto-symbolic strategies. In L. D. Hager (ed.),'' Women in Human Evolution. ''New York and London: Routledge, pp. 153–171; p. 159.''}}}} In similar vein, anthropologist Chris Knight argues that Boehm's idea of a 'coalition of everyone' is hard to envisage, unless — along the lines of a modern industrial picket line — it was formed to co-ordinate 'sex-strike' action against badly behaving males: {{quotation|....male dominance had to be overthrown because the unending prioritising of male short-term sexual interests could lead only to the permanence and institutionalisation of behavioural conflict between the sexes, between the generations and also between rival males. If the symbolic, cultural domain was to emerge, what was needed was a political collectivity — an alliance — capable of transcending such conflicts. ... Only the consistent defence and self-defence of mothers with their offspring could produce a collectivity embodying interests of a sufficiently broad, universalistic kind.|{{Citation|title=''Knight, C. 1991.''

''Women Like Meat. The folklore and foraging ideology of the Kalahari Ju/'hoan.'' Witwatersrand: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they determinedly use their collective bargaining power to motivate men to hunt for them and bring home their kills — on pain of exclusion from sex.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 1991.

=== Robert Trivers ===

{{quotation|I consider Trivers one of the great thinkers in the history of Western thought. It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that he has provided a scientific explanation for the human condition: the intricately complicated and endlessly fascinating relationships that bind us to one another.|[https://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/trivers04/trivers04_index.html ''Steven Pinker on Robert Trivers'']}}

In his 1985 book, ''Social Evolution'',&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution''. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Trivers]] outlines the theoretical framework used today by most evolutionary biologists to understand how and why societies are established. Trivers sets out from the fundamental fact that genes survive beyond the death of the bodies they inhabit, because copies of the same gene may be replicated in multiple different bodies. From this, it follows that a creature should behave altruistically to the extent that those benefiting carry the same genes — 'inclusive fitness', as this source of cooperation in nature is termed.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, W. D. 1964. The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I, II. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' 7: 1–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Where animals are unrelated, cooperation should be limited to 'reciprocal altruism' or 'tit-for-tat'.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1971. The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 46 (1): 35–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
Where previously, biologists took parent-offspring cooperation for granted, Trivers predicted on theoretical grounds both cooperation and conflict — as when a mother needs to wean an existing baby (even against its will) in order to make way for another.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1974. Parent-Offspring Conflict. ''American Zoologist'' 14 (1): 249–264.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, biologists had interpreted male infanticidal behaviour as aberrant and inexplicable or, alternatively, as a necessary strategy for culling excess population.&lt;ref&gt;Wynne-Edwards, V.C. 1962. ''Animal dispersion in relation to social behaviour.'' Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt; Trivers was able to show that such behaviour was a logical strategy by males to enhance their own reproductive success at the expense of conspecifics including rival males. Ape or monkey females whose babies are threatened have directly opposed interests, often forming coalitions to defend themselves and their offspring against infanticidal males.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution.'' Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings, pp 79–85.&lt;/ref&gt;
Human society, according to Trivers, is unusual in that it involves the male of the species investing parental care in his own offspring — a rare pattern for a primate. Where such cooperation occurs, it's not enough to take it for granted: in Trivers' view we need to ''explain'' it using an overarching theoretical framework applicable to humans and nonhumans alike.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1972. Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (ed.) ''Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871–1971''. Chicago, Aldine, pp. 136–179.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation|Everybody has a social life. All living creatures reproduce and reproduction is a social event, since at its bare minimum it involves the genetic and material construction of one individual by another. In turn, differences between individuals in the number of their surviving offspring (natural selection) is the driving force behind organic evolution. Life is intrinsically social and it evolves through a process of natural selection which is itself social. For these reasons social evolution refers not only to the evolution of social relationships between individuals but also to deeper themes of biological organization stretching from gene to community.|{{Citation|title=''Robert Trivers, 1985.''

=== Robin Dunbar ===

[[Image: Robin Dunbar (6293027302).jpg |thumb|right|200px|Robin Dunbar]][[Robin Dunbar]] originally studied gelada baboons in the wild in Ethiopia, and has done much to synthesise modern primatological knowledge with Darwinian theory into a comprehensive overall picture. The components of primate social systems 'are essentially alliances of a political nature aimed at enabling the animals concerned to achieve more effective solutions to particular problems of survival and reproduction'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Primate societies are in essence 'multi-layered sets of coalitions'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Although physical fights are ultimately decisive, the social mobilisation of allies usually decides matters and requires skills that go beyond mere fighting ability. The manipulation and use of coalitions demands sophisticated social — more precisely ''political'' — intelligence.
Usually but not always, males exercise dominance over females. Even where male despotism prevails, females typically gang up with one another to pursue agendas of their own. When a male gelada baboon attacks a previously dominant rival so as to take over his harem, the females concerned may insist on their own say in the outcome. At various stages during the fighting, the females may 'vote' among themselves on whether to accept the provisional outcome. Rejection is signalled by refusing to groom the challenger; acceptance is signalled by going up to him and grooming him. According to Dunbar, the ultimate outcome of an inter-male 'sexual fight' always depends on the female 'vote'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, pp. 166, 167, 243.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dunbar points out that in a primate social system, lower-ranking females will typically suffer the most intense harassment. Consequently, they will be the first to form coalitions in self-defence. But maintaining commitment from coalition allies involves much time-consuming manual grooming, putting pressure on time-budgets. In the case of evolving humans, who were living in increasingly large groups, the costs would soon have outweighed the benefits — unless some more efficient way of maintaining relationships could be found. Dunbar argues that 'vocal grooming' — using the voice to signal commitment — was the time-saving solution adopted, and that this led eventually to speech. Dunbar goes on to suggest (citing evolutionary anthropologist Chris Knight&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2011 [1989]. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/pub_origins_hs.pdf ''The origins of society.''] London: Radical Anthropology Group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 1991. ''Blood Relations. Menstruation and the origins of culture.'' New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) that ''distinctively human'' society may have been evolved under pressure from female ritual and 'gossiping' coalitions established to dissuade males from fighting one another and instead cooperate in hunting for the benefit of the whole camp: {{quotation| If females formed the core of these early groups, and language evolved to bond these groups, it naturally follows that the early human females were the first to speak. This reinforces the suggestion that language was first used to create a sense of emotional solidarity between allies. Chris Knight has argued a passionate case for the idea that language first evolved to allow the females in these early groups to band together to force males to invest in them and their offspring, principally by hunting for meat. This would be consistent with the fact that, among modern humans, women are generally better at verbal skills than men, as well as being more skilful in the social domain. |{{Citation|title=''Dunbar, R. I. M. 1996.'' Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language. ''London: Faber and Faber, p. 149.''}}}} Dunbar stresses that this is currently a minority theory among specialists in human origins — most still support the 'bison-down-at-the-lake' theory attributing early language and cooperation to the imperatives of men's activities such as hunting. Despite this, he argues that 'female bonding may have been a more powerful force in human evolution than is sometimes supposed'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, R. I. M. 1996. ''Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language.'' London: Faber and Faber, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Although still controversial, the idea that female coalitions may have played a decisive role has subsequently received strong support from a number of anthropologists including Sarah Hrdy,&lt;ref&gt;Hrdy,  S. B. 2009. ''Mothers and others. The evolutionary origins of mutual understanding.'' London and Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Camilla Power,&lt;ref&gt;Power, C. 1998. Old wives’ tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), ''Approaches to the Evolution of Language: Social and Cognitive Bases.''

Wild voices: Mimicry, Reversal, Metaphor, and the Emergence of Language. ''Current Anthropology'', Volume 58, Number 4, August 2017 435-453.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also consistent with recent studies by population geneticists (see Verdu et al. 2013 &lt;ref&gt;Verdu, P., Becker, N., Froment, A., Georges, M., Grugni, V., Quintana-Murci, L., Hombert, J-M., Van der Veen, L., Le Bomin, S., Bahuchet, S., Heyer, E. ,Austerlitz, F. 2013.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to society:

'''[[Society]]''' &amp;ndash; group of people sharing the same geographical or virtual territory and therefore subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. Such people share a distinctive [[culture]] and [[institutions]], which characterize the patterns of [[social relations]] between them. Large societies typically develop [[social stratification]] and [[dominance hierarchy|dominance patterns]] among its subgroups. A given society may be described as the sum total of social relationships among its members. The branch of science that studies society is [[sociology]].

'''Planetary consciousness''' is the idea that human beings are members of a planetary society of [[Earth]] as much as they are members of their nations, provinces, districts, islands, cities or villages.

== History ==
In his 1906 book ''American Character'', author [[Brander Matthews]] mentions the idea of a "league of nations" and a "planetary consciousness", believing it would be created by American politicians in the coming centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=UA2WY1GvV-oC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22League+of+Nations%22+%22planetary+consciousness%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22League%20of%20Nations%22%20%22planetary%20consciousness%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false | author=Matthews, Brander | authorlink=Brander Matthews | title=American Character | page=187 | publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co |date=September 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key planetary consciousness events of the 20th century include the creation of the [[League of Nations]], the signing of [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], the creation of the [[United Nations]], and the creation of the [[Bretton Woods system]].  [[Democratic globalization]] advocate [[Abhay Kumar]] points to the [[ICANN|International Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) board of directors election in 2000, which were conducted globally, as the first example of global democracy.&lt;ref name=abhay&gt;{{cite news | title=Birth of Global Democracy | author=K, Abhay | authorlink=Abhay Kumar | work=[[Times of India]] | date=21 January 2011 | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-21/edit-page/28367706_1_printing-press-number-of-mobile-phones-gutenberg | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2001, [[Ervin László]] and the [[Dalai Lama]] wrote an essay titled "Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness", which was adopted at a meeting at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in Budapest.&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite web | author1=László, Ervin | authorlink1=Ervin László | author2=[[Dalai Lama]] | title=Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness | publisher=WorldShift International | date=15 September 2001 | url=http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | accessdate=13 August 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828003626/http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | archivedate=28 August 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its introduction begins:

{{cquote|text=In the closing years of the twentieth century, we have reached a crucial juncture in our history. We are on the threshold of a new stage of social, spiritual, and cultural evolution, a stage that is as different from the stage of the earlier decades of this century as the grasslands were from the caves, and settled villages from life in nomadic tribes. We are evolving out of the nationally based industrial societies that were created at the dawn of the first industrial revolution, and heading toward an interconnected, information-based social, economic, and cultural system that straddles the globe.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

[[Andreas Bummel]], CEO of the Committee for a Democratic UN, says, "The first step into the direction of a world parliament would be the establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations".&lt;ref name=bummel/&gt;

==Concept==
Advocacy for the idea of planetary consciousness is based on the technological advancements made by the mankind in the fields of transport and telecommunications during the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; Kumar claims that these technological advancements have turned the whole planet into an interdependent economic, political and communication community.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He specifically cites the invention of the Internet and the mobile phones as key technological achievements of the 20th century which brought humans into more continuous interconnected communication.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He believes that these inventions will lead to a second [[Renaissance]] and global democracy, just as the [[Gutenberg press]] in 1439 led to the first Renaissance, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and [[Nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt;  Bummel describes planetary consciousness as integral, insofar as it does not conflict with other levels of [[Identity (social science)|social identity]], but instead is a holistic perspective on humanity and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref name=bummel&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Evolution, Global Governance and a World Parliament | author=Bummel, Andreas | journal=[[Cadmus (journal)|Cadmus]] | date=11 April 2012 |url=http://www.cadmusjournal.org/article/issue-4/social-evolution-global-governance-and-world-parliament#13 | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steven Kull writes that while nation states are reluctant to work cooperatively, individuals seem more willing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kull, Steven | title=Listening to the Voice of Humanity | journal= Kosmos Journal | issue=Spring/Summer | year= 2010 | pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire planetary consciousness and [[global citizenship]] among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">A '''power structure''' is an overall system of influence relationships between any individual and every other individual within any selected group of people. A description of a power structure would capture the way in which [[Power (social and political)|power]] or [[authority]] is distributed between people within groups such as a government, nation, institution, organization, or a society.&lt;ref&gt;G. William Domhoff, Thomas R. Dye, ''Power Elites and Organizations'' (1987), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Such structures are of interest to various fields, including [[sociology]], [[government]], [[economics]], and [[business]]. A power structure may be formal and intentionally constructed to maximize values like [[Social justice|fairness]] or [[efficiency]], as in a [[hierarchical organization]] wherein every entity, except one, is subordinate to a single other entity. Conversely, a power structure may be an informal set of roles, such as those found in a [[dominance hierarchy]] in which members of a social group interact, often aggressively, to create a ranking system. A culture that is organised in a dominance hierarchy is a [[dominator culture]], the opposite of an egalitarian culture of partnership. A visible, dominant group or elite that holds power or authority within a power structure is often referred to as being [[the Establishment]]. Power structures are fluid, with changes occurring constantly, either slowly or rapidly, evolving or revolutionary, peacefully or violently.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9029">'''Risk society''' is the manner in which modern [[society]] organizes in response to [[risk]]. The term is closely associated with several key writers on [[modernity]], in particular [[Ulrich Beck]] and [[Anthony Giddens]].&lt;ref name=BeckRiskSociety&gt;
{{cite book
|author=Ulrich Beck
|title=Risk Society, Towards a New Modernity
|location=London
|publisher=Sage Publications
|year=1992 
|pages=260
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in the 1980s and its popularity during the 1990s was both as a consequence of its links to trends in thinking about wider modernity, and also to its links to popular discourse, in particular the growing [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]] during the period.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to British sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]], a risk society is "a society increasingly preoccupied with the future (and also with safety), which generates the notion of risk,"&lt;ref&gt;Giddens and Pierson 1998, p.209.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the German sociologist [[Ulrich Beck]] defines it as "a systematic way of dealing with hazards and insecurities induced and introduced by [[modernisation]] itself (Beck 1992:21)".&lt;ref name=BeckRiskSociety /&gt;

Beck (1992:50)&lt;ref name=BeckRiskSociety /&gt; defined modernization as,

{{Quote box
|quote = "surges of technological rationalization and changes in work and organization, but beyond that includes much more: the change in societal characteristics and normal biographies, changes in lifestyle and forms of love, change in the structures of power and influence, in the forms of political repression and participation, in views of reality and in the norms of knowledge. In social science's understanding of modernity, the plough, the steam locomotive and the microchip are visible indicators of a much deeper process, which comprises and reshapes the entire social structure."
|width  = 75%
|align  = center
}}

==Background==

===Modernity and realism in science===
Beck and Giddens both approach the risk society firmly from the perspective of [[modernity]], "a shorthand term for modern society or industrial civilization...  modernity is vastly more dynamic than any previous type of social order. It is a society... which unlike any preceding culture lives in the future rather than the past." (Anthony Giddens)&lt;ref&gt;Giddens and Pierson p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; They also draw heavily on the concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]], the idea that as a society examines itself, it in turn changes itself in the process. In classical industrial society, the modernist view is based on assumption of realism in science creating a system in which scientists work in an exclusive, inaccessible environment.

==Implications==

===Environmental risks===
In 1986, right after the [[Chernobyl disaster]], Ulrich Beck, a sociology professor at the University of Munich, published the original German text, ''Risikogesellschaft'', of his highly influential and catalytic work (Suhrkamp, Frankfurt 1986). ''Risikogesellschaft'' was published in English as ''Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity'' in 1992. The ecological crisis is central to this social analysis of the contemporary period. Beck argued that environmental risks had become the predominant product, not just an unpleasant, manageable side-effect, of industrial society.

Giddens and Beck argued that whilst humans have always been subjected to a level of risk – such as [[natural disasters]] – these have usually been perceived as produced by non-human forces. Modern societies, however, are exposed to risks such as [[pollution]], newly discovered illnesses, crime, that are the result of the [[modernization]] process itself. Giddens defines these two types of risks as [[external risk]]s and [[manufactured risks]].&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manufactured risks]] are marked by a high level of [[human agency]] involved in both producing, and mitigating such risks.

As [[manufactured risks]] are the product of human activity, authors like Giddens and Beck argue that it is possible for societies to assess the level of risk that is being produced, or that is about to be produced. This sort of reflexive introspection can in turn alter the planned activities themselves. As an example, disasters such as [[Chernobyl]] and the [[Love Canal]] Crisis, public faith in the modern project has declined leaving public distrust in [[industry]], [[government]] and [[expert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social concerns led to increased regulation of the nuclear power industry and to the abandonment of some expansion plans, altering the course of modernization itself. This increased critique of modern industrial practices is said to have resulted in a state of [[reflexive modernization]], illustrated by concepts such as [[sustainability]] and the [[precautionary principle]] that focus on preventative measures to decrease levels of risk.

There are differing opinions as to how the concept of a risk society interacts with social hierarchies and class distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Most agree that social relations have altered with the introduction of manufactured risks and reflexive modernization. [[Risk]]s, much like [[wealth]], are distributed unevenly in a population and will influence quality of life.

[[Ulrich Beck|Beck]] has argued that older forms of class structure – based mainly on the accumulation of wealth – atrophy in a modern, risk society, in which people occupy [[social risk positions]] that are achieved through risk aversion. "In some of their dimensions these follow the inequalities of class and strata positions, but they bring a fundamentally different distribution logic into play".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; Beck contends that widespread risks contain a 'boomerang effect', in that individuals producing risks will also be exposed to them. This argument suggests that wealthy individuals whose [[Capital (economics)|capital]] is largely responsible for creating pollution will also have to suffer when, for example, the contaminants seep into the water supply. This argument may seem oversimplified, as wealthy people may have the ability to mitigate risk more easily by, for example, buying bottled water. [[Ulrich Beck|Beck]], however, has argued that the distribution of this sort of risk is the result of [[knowledge]], rather than wealth. Whilst the wealthy person may have access to [[factors of production|resources]] that enable him or her to avert risk, this would not even be an option were the person unaware that the risk even existed. However, Risks do not only affect those of a certain social class or place, risk is not bias and can affect everybody no matter your class, nobody is free from risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity|last=Beck|first=Ulrich|last2=Ritter|first2=Mark|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1992|isbn=978-0803983465|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] has argued that older forms of class structure maintain a somewhat stronger role in a risk society, now being partly defined "in terms of differential access to forms of self-actualization and empowerment".&lt;ref&gt;Giddens 1991, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] has also tended to approach the concept of a risk society more positively than [[Ulrich Beck|Beck]], suggesting that there "can be no question of merely taking a negative attitude towards risk. Risk needs to be disciplined, but active risk-taking is a core element of a dynamic economy and an innovative society."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Runaway World'', 1999, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23365">The '''societal marketing'''  is a marketing concept that holds that a company should make marketing decisions not only by considering consumers' wants, the company's requirements, but also  society's long-term interests.

The societal marketing concept holds that the organization's task is to determine the needs, wants, and interests of a [[target market]] and to deliver the desired satisfactions more effectively and efficiently than [[competitors]] in a way that preserves or enhances the well being of both the individual consumer and society in general. Therefore, marketers must endeavor to satisfy the needs and wants of their target markets in ways that preserve and enhance the well-being of consumers and society as a whole. {{ref|Kotler2000}} It is closely linked with the principles of [[corporate social responsibility]] and of [[sustainable development]].

==Definition==
Societal marketing can be defined as a "marketing with a social dimension or marketing that includes non-economic criteria". &lt;ref&gt; Handelman, Jay M. and Arnold, Stephen J., "The Role of Marketing Actions with a Social Dimension: Appeals to the Institutional Environment," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 63, No. 3, July, 1999, pp 33-48&lt;/ref&gt;  Societal marketing "concerns for society's long term interests".&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, G.R., "The Marketing Concept: Necessary but sufficient? An environmental view," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 24, No. 8, pp.23-30, https://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000000612&lt;/ref&gt; It is about "the direct benefits for the organization and secondary benefit for the community". &lt;ref&gt;McColl-Kennedy, J., Kiel, G., Lusch, R. and Lusch, V., ''Marketing: Concepts and Strategies,'' Nelson Australia, Melbourne, 2001, &lt;/ref&gt; Societal marketing distinguishes between the consumer's immediate satisfaction and longer term consumer and social benefits. Accordingly, [[Andreas Kaplan]] defines societal management as "management that takes into account society's overall welfare in addition to mere profitability considerations." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | issue=4 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534| year=2014 | last1=Kaplan | first1=Andreas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its a 3 dimensional concept of marketing ;Social welfare,Individual welfare,Company profits.

==Objectives== 
Various attempts to define the objectives of societal marketing have been noted,&lt;ref&gt;Gaski, J.F., "Dangerous Territory: The societal marketing concept revisited", ''Business Horizons,'' Vol. 28, No. 4, pp 42-47&lt;/ref&gt; such as:
* "[[Social responsibility]] implies that a business decision maker... is obliged to take actions that also protect and enhance society's interests.
* "Business has the responsibility to help [the consumer] ... It is the duty of business to promote proper consumption values."
* "Business leaders are mandated to adopt roles of leadership in  the advancement of our society to new levels of moral conduct."

==History==
The concept of societal marketing emerged in the early 1970s, promoting a more socially responsible, moral and ethical model of marketing in an effort to counter some of the more serious criticisms of marketing that had arisen out of the [[consumerism|consumerist]] movement around that time. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 36, No. 5/6, pp548-569, https://doi.org/10.1108/03090560210423014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Kotler]] is generally credited with introducing the societal marketing concept to the literature in a 1972 article "What Consumerism Means for Marketers" in the ''Harvard Business Review'' of 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell Reference, http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631233176_chunk_g978140510254422_ss1-48&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly Kotler believed that he had coined the term, "societal marketing" and was the first to codify it within the [[marketing literature]]. &lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 50, No. 3, May-June, 1972, pp. 48-57 &lt;/ref&gt; Some marketing historians, notably Wilkie and Moore, have argued that a societal perspective was not new, and that evidence for it could be found in marketing theory and in marketing texts, since the discipline's inception in the early 1900s. &lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., "Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp 224-232 DOI: 10.1177/0276146706291067; Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp 116–146 &lt;/ref&gt; Kotler introduced both the concept of [[social marketing]] (extending marketing technologies into non-business areas) and societal marketing, arguing that the marketing concept and its technologies must be tempered and ultimately revised by adopting a more explicit social orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' 2002,  Vol 36, No. 5/6, pp 48-569&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of Kotler's concept was the idea of "long-run consumer welfare", emphasizing that the short-term desires might not support the consumer's long term interests or be good for the society as a whole.

The societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Instead, marketing activities should strive to benefit society's overall well-being. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including: employees, customers, local communities, the wider public and government and consider the impact of their activities on all stakeholders. They ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society. Societal marketing developed into [[sustainable marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P and Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing,'' 9th ed., Prentice Hall, 2000; Griffin, R.W.  and Ebert, E.J., ''Business '' 5th edition, Prentice Hall, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Societal marketing requires businesses to include social, ethical and ecological considerations in product and market planning. &lt;ref&gt;Abratt, Russell and Sacks, Diane, "Perceptions of the Societal Marketing Concept", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 23, No. 6, 1989, pp. 25–33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
Kotler identified four categories of products, classified in terms of long term benefits and immediate satisfaction: &lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 50, May-June, pp. 54-56&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Papierosa 1 ubt 0069.jpeg|thumb|Cigarettes are typically classified as a '' pleasing products'' since they deliver immediate benefits with long-term social harm]]
#Deficient products, which bring neither long-run or short term benefits
#Pleasing products, which bring a high level of immediate [[Customer satisfaction|satisfaction]], but can cause harm to the society in the long run
#Salutary products, which bring low short term satisfaction, but benefit the society on the long run
#Desirable products, which combine long-run benefit and immediate satisfaction

Kotler's concept of societal marketing suggested that for the well-being of society, deficient products should be eliminated from the market, pleasing and salutary products should go through a product modification process to acquire desirable status, by incorporating missing short term benefits into salutary products and long term benefits into pleasing products, and the companies' ultimate goal should be to develop desirable products. Rather than focusing on selling a products, which can be good or bad for the consumers,  companies should focus on consumer and society's well-being.

==Examples==
Most companies recognize that socially responsible activities improve their image among customers, [[stockholders]], the [[financial community]], and other relevant publics. Ethical and socially responsible practices are simply good business, resulting not only in favorable image, but ultimately in increased sales.

*[[The Body Shop]]: The Body Shop International plc is the original, natural and ethical beauty brand. The company uses only plant based materials for its products. It is against [[Animal testing]], supports community trade, activate Self Esteem, Defend Human Rights, and overall protection of the planet. They have also their own charity, The Body Shop Foundation, to assist those working to achieve progress in the areas of human and civil rights, environmental and animal protection. Thus Body shop is really following the concept of Societal Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;The Body Shop, www.thebodyshop.com/_en/_ww/services/aboutus_company.aspx)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Avon Products|AVON]] Product inc. has started an initiative known as Avon [[breast cancer]] awareness crusade in 1993 in partnership with National Alliance of breast cancer Foundation (NABCO).They started selling pink ribbon pins which depicts the international symbol for breast cancer for$2 and donates $1 to NABCO. Through the crusade Avon sale representatives have raised billion of dollars for breast cancer education and access to early detection services for underserved woman. In addition, Avon's 45,000 US sales people have been trained to discuss breast cancer and importance of early detection with their customers and distributed 80 million flyers on breast cancer detection.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal marketing v social marketing==
Societal marketing should not be confused with [[social marketing]]. Societal marketing is a philosophy or mindset that informs marketing decisions whereas social marketing is a distinct branch within the marketing discipline. Societal marketing is concerned with the consideration of the social and ethical aspects of marketing planning. Social marketing is concerned with facilitating social change. A key difference is that the greater 'social good' is the ''principal'' consideration in social marketing while social benefits are one of a number of considerations in societal marketing.  

On the other hand, social marketing is a sub-branch of marketing that began in 1971, with the publication of an article by Kotler and Zaltman, emphasising a planned approach to achieving social change. It is primarily concerned with encouraging pro-social behaviours (e.g. recycling, sun-safety, safe driving practices) and discouraging anti-social behaviours (e.g. littering, drink-driving). &lt;ref&gt;Kotler P and Zaltman G., "Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change,"  ''Journal of Marketing, Vol. 35. No. 3, 1971, pp 3-12&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as an "adaptation of commercial marketing technologies to programs designed to influence the voluntary behavior of target audiences to improve their personal welfare and that of the society of which they are a part".&lt;ref&gt;Andreasen, A., ''Marketing Social Change: Changing Behavior to Promote Health, Social Development and the Environment,'' San Francisco: Jossey Bass, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social marketing uses more traditional commercial techniques and strategies, focusing on persuasion, to achieve goals for the greater social good. Its [[Advertising campaign|campaigns]] can either encourage [[merit good]]s, as for example fund raising for not-for-profit organizations or dissuade the use of [[demerit good]]s promoting society's well being, as non-smoking campaigns or promote the use of seat belts. Another characteristic of social marketing is that is planned to influence individual behaviour to improve well-being. It includes more than just [[advertising]] in traditional mass media, and may extend to educational programs and formal enforcement regimes in the case of road safety campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Belz, Frank Martin and Peattie, Ken, ''Sustainability Marketing,'' John Wiley and Sons, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It planned campaigns, implemented by governmental and non-governmental organisations. A clear example that differentiates societal from social marketing is a marketing campaign on non-smoking. A smoking cessation advertisement is an example of social marketing, but if the marketing strategies and techniques used in that campaign focus on increasing the well-being of society, that same campaign can be an example of societal marketing.

The societal marketing concept was a forerunner of sustainable marketing in integrating issues of social responsibility into commercial [[marketing strategies]]. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools and techniques to influence social change. Social marketing applies a "customer orientated" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like Anti-Smoking-Campaigns or fund raising for NGOs.

== Corporate social responsibility (CSR)==
Unlike societal marketing, CSR has existed for many years. Another difference is that CSR "focuses more in a [[corporate]] level and stakeholders", &lt;ref&gt; Belz, Frank Martin and Peattie, Ken, ''Sustainability Marketing,'' John Wiley and Sons, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; while societal marketing is more concerned about the consumer and their long term benefits. CSR social and environmental concerns are integrated into all business operations. CSR is mainly run by companies, while social marketing mainly by Government or Non profits organizations. One example of CSR among companies is what [[Häagen-Dazs]] is doing with their "microsite" to raise awareness to the general public about the preservation of the honeybee.

==Branding==
Corporations are the one who are striving during the whole time for improvements. They are turning to all kind of forms of [[corporate societal marketing]] programs to help build and repair their brand images.

Corporate Social Marketing, or CSM, usually refers to marketing efforts that have at least one social related objective, such as charity founding, among its goals. Typical examples are releasing a certain percentage of the final sale product to a charity related to the product, or sponsoring events that encourage social well-being such as the Olympic Games. Corporate Social Marketing benefits a company in many ways, but its main goal is to improve the image the public has of the company. A company that appears committed to improving the lives or others, the environment or other worthy causes is seen in a better light than one who doesn't, and more and more business are hoping to benefit from that.

So, it can be so, that CSM programs are becoming extremely popular because the leaders believe that it is a good business to be viewed as a socially responsible company.&lt;ref&gt;Business in the Community, "Businesses Use Marketing Muscle to Tackle Social Issues", in ''Cause-related Marketing Website,''&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though past research suggests that CSM may be effective in improving [[brand equity]] and increasing market share, there are limits to the effectiveness of these initiatives.

An example of his is how corporate social initiatives adversely affected purchase intentions if consumers perceived that the company would forgo product quality in order to be socially responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Sankar and Bhattacharya, C.B., "Does Doing Good Always Lead to Doing better, Consumer Reactions to Corporate Societal Responsibility," ''Journal of Marketing Research,'' Vol 38, May, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the nature of the CSM program, the intent of the corporation may not be as obvious to the consumers. This happens if the benefits to the corporation are not apparent or conflicts with what the consumer already believes about a specific firm or industry.

Since firms exist to make a profit, consumers may spend considerable energy in an attempt to infer motives related to the profit-oriented goals. As an example, a consumer may be suspicious of a tobacco company that undertakes a campaign to prevent underage smoking. If this is successful, the company would be affected and the cigarette sales will be lowered. So, in this situation, consumers' suspicions may lead them to infer motives that would actually protect the companies financial condition – as they are trying to improve their image to sell more cigarettes to adults. However, if a tobacco company undertook a CSM Campaign, that would sustain their business consumers may be able to infer profit motives more easily and then have a more favorable attitude toward the partnership. Therefore, it can be concluded that the attitude of the consumers could be better if they knew more about the motives of the companies and they were more obvious.

Another aspect that may cause suspicion with consumers is the amount of harm that a company has already done, either because of unsafe products or harmful production practices. It is logical that consumers are more suspicious to companies that sell harmful products. Again examples are the tobacco companies and alcohol companies as well. They will meet resistance from consumers when they undertake socially-oriented campaigns aimed at mitigating the effects of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeffler, Steve and Keller, Kevin Lane, "Building Brand Equity through Corporate Societal Marketing", ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 21, No. 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; That is why when different industries are separated, two very general dimensions are used – the harmful nature of the products and the harmful nature of the production methods.

This classification can briefly show how consumer are influenced by the various CSM efforts. Companies that work in this "dangerous" industries are not that successful always, because the consumers may be suspicious of any societal efforts the company attempts to undertake. Consumers will infer less society-serving motives and more self-serving motives for corporate societal marketing programs undertaken by firms that operate in mixed or sin industries.

Based on how easily consumers could infer profit-driven motives, are classified the types of CSM campaigns: Positively tied to product sales, positively tied to product sales, not directly tied to sales but aimed at sustaining the company's business, completely unrelated.

==Criticisms==
Societal marketing has been the subject of a number of criticisms: 

A key issue concerns the question of who decides what is in the public’s best interests. The moral agenda implicit in the societal marketing concept is underdeveloped and often implicit. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; Gaski argued that marketers should step away from their classic goal of [[customer satisfaction]] and [[profit maximization]] while respecting the minimum governmental standards imposed by law and enter this [[public policy]] area, since marketers themselves would have to decide what actions are consistent with public welfare. Marketers might have neither the competence nor the right to determine the "public interest." Instead, it should be the customers who decide what is good for them, or their political representatives and dictate that to the industry. &lt;ref&gt;Gaski, J.F., "Dangerous Territory: The societal marketing concept revisited", ''Business Horizons,'' Vol. 28, No. 4, 1985, 42-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have argued that societal marketing is not a distinct concept, but rather it is a mere extension of the marketing concept. Others have pointed out that the literature in the field is vague, poorly defined and underdeveloped. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; The societal marketing concept has become an excellent strategy for promotions with social dimensions and for exploring consumers' behavioural response to such corporate 'doing good'.

; Future development of the concept:
Societal marketing is gaining the marketers and consumer attention  and there is every reason to expect it to continue to evolve in practice. It focuses on providing win-win opportunities to companies, consumers and society. But achieving the compelling benefits for each party involved is very complicated. So much more research is needed. To achieve a win situation for organization involved, is dependent largely upon how the key constituents react. In this context, anticipating consumer reaction is really challenging which can be affected by number of factors that often vary across different segments. The several research questions remain to be answered like how different factors affects reaction to societal marketing and how do the various factors interact? How can societal initiatives be designed to leverage positive reaction and mitigate negative ones? &lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

For consumers to win, societal marketing must provide them with compelling benefits that increase their overall welfare. What benefits did societal marketing initiative actually provided to consumers? Are there direct benefits such as increased satisfaction with their interaction with commercial or nonprofit organization?
Determining whether there is a win situation for society by societal marketing initiative is the most difficult question to be answered. We turn to the two questions proposed by Bloom, Hussien and Szykmann (1995):  Is the society better off because of this program? Does corporate involvement result in better performance than if it would have been managed by NGOs or government agencies? 
Societal marketing is becoming globally popular but there exist a scarcity of research in this field. Therefore extensive future research is needed particularly investigating questions with respect to its impact on consumer attitudes to corporate image, product image and their purchase intention or brand choice as well as on positive impact on society.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
A '''society''' is a [[Social group|group]] of individuals involved in persistent [[Social relation|social interaction]], or a large [[social group]] sharing the same geographical or social territory, typically subject to the same [[Politics|political]] authority and dominant cultural expectations. Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships ([[social relation]]s) between individuals who share a distinctive [[culture]] and [[institutions]]; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent of members. In the [[social science]]s, a larger society often exhibits [[social stratification|stratification]] or [[dominance hierarchy|dominance]] patterns in subgroups.

Insofar as it is [[collaborative]], a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would not otherwise be possible on an individual basis; both individual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many cases found to overlap. A society can also consist of like-minded people governed by their own norms and values within a dominant, larger society. This is sometimes referred to as a [[subculture]], a term used extensively within [[criminology]].

More broadly, and especially within [[Structuralism|structuralist thought]], a society may be illustrated as an [[economic]], social, [[Industry|industrial]] or [[culture|cultural]] [[infrastructure]], made up of, yet distinct from, a varied collection of individuals. In this regard society can mean the objective relationships people have with the material world and with other people, rather than "other people" beyond the individual and their familiar social environment.

==Etymology and usage==

{{wide image|Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels 1.jpg|700px|A half-section of the 12th-century [[South Tang Dynasty]] version of ''Night Revels of Han Xizai'', original by [[Gu Hongzhong]]. The painting portrays servants, musicians, monks, children, guests, and hosts all in a single social environment. It serves as an in-depth look into the Chinese social structure of the time.}}

The term "society" came from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Wikt:societas|societas]]'', which in turn was derived from the noun ''socius'' ("[[comrade]], friend, ally"; adjectival form ''socialis'') used to describe a bond or interaction between parties that are friendly, or at least civil. Without an article, the term can refer to the entirety of humanity (also: "society in general", "society at large", etc.), although those who are unfriendly or uncivil to the remainder of society in this sense may be deemed to be "antisocial". However, the [[Scotland|Scottish]] economist, [[Adam Smith]] taught instead that a society "may subsist among different men, as among different merchants, from a sense of its [[utility]] without any mutual love or affection, if only they refrain from doing injury to each other."&lt;ref name=Briggs9/&gt;

Used in the sense of an [[Voluntary association|association]], a society is a body of individuals outlined by the bounds of functional [[interdependence]], possibly comprising characteristics such as [[national identity|national]] or [[cultural identity]], [[social solidarity]], [[language]], or [[hierarchy|hierarchical structure]].

==Conceptions==
Society, in general, addresses the fact that an individual has rather limited means as an [[autonomy|autonomous unit]]. The [[great apes]] have always been more (''[[Bonobo]]'', ''[[Human being|Homo]]'', ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'') or less (''[[Gorilla]]'', ''[[Orangutan|Pongo]]'') [[social animal]]s, so [[Robinson Crusoe]]-like situations are either fictions or unusual [[corner case]]s to the ubiquity of social context for humans, who fall between [[presocial]] and [[eusociality|eusocial]] in the spectrum of [[primate#Social systems|animal ethology]].

[[Cultural relativism]] as a widespread approach or ethic has largely replaced notions of "primitive", better/worse, or "progress" in relation to cultures (including their material culture/technology and social organization).

According to anthropologist [[Maurice Godelier]], one critical novelty in society, in contrast to humanity's closest biological relatives (chimpanzees and bonobos), is the parental role assumed by the males, which supposedly would be absent in our nearest relatives for whom paternity is not generally determinable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Godelier]], Métamorphoses de la parenté, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592|publisher=''New Left Review''|author=Jack Goody|title=The Labyrinth of Kinship|accessdate=24 July 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004209/http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In political science ===
Societies may also be structured [[politics|politically]]. In order of increasing size and complexity, there are [[band society|bands]], [[tribe]]s, [[chiefdom]]s, and [[State (polity)|state]] societies. These structures may have varying degrees of [[political power]], depending on the [[culture|cultural]], [[geography|geographical]], and [[history|historical]] environments that these societies must contend with. Thus, a more isolated society with the same level of technology and culture as other societies is more likely to survive than one in closer proximity to others that may encroach on their resources. A society that is unable to offer an effective response to other societies it competes with will usually be subsumed into the culture of the competing society.

=== In sociology ===
[[File:Ants' Social Ethology.jpg|thumb|right|The social group enables its members to benefit in ways that would not otherwise be possible on an individual basis. Both individual and social (common) goals can thus be distinguished and considered. Ant (formicidae) [[Ethology|social ethology]].]]
[[Sociology|Sociologist]] [[Peter L. Berger]] defines society as "...a human product, and nothing but a human product, that yet continuously acts upon its producers."  According to him, society was created by humans but this creation turns back and creates or molds humans every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Scared Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion|last = Berger|first = Peter L.|publisher = Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc.|year = 1967|isbn = |location = Garden City, NYC|page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|right|''Canis lupus'' [[Ethology|social ethology]]]]

Sociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]] differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy: (1) hunters and gatherers, (2) simple agricultural, (3) advanced agricultural, (4) industrial, and (5) special (e.g. fishing societies or maritime societies).&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, G. 1974. ''Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology.''&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the system earlier developed by anthropologists Morton H. Fried, a conflict theorist, and [[Elman Service]], an integration theorist, who have produced a system of classification for societies in all human cultures based on the evolution of [[social inequality]] and the role of the [[State (polity)|state]]. This system of classification contains four categories:
* [[Hunter-gatherer]] bands (categorization of duties and responsibilities).
* [[Tribe|Tribal]] societies in which there are some limited instances of [[social rank]] and prestige.
* [[Social stratification|Stratified]] structures led by [[tribal chief|chieftains]].
* [[Civilization]]s, with complex social hierarchies and organized, [[government|institutional governments]].

In addition to this there are:
* [[All humanity|Humanity]], humankind, upon which rest all the elements of society, including society's beliefs.
* [[Sociology of the Internet|Virtual society]], a society based on online identity, which is evolving in the information age.

Over time, some [[cultures]] have progressed toward more complex forms of [[organization]] and control. This [[cultural evolution]] has a profound effect on patterns of community. Hunter-gatherer tribes settled around seasonal food stocks to become [[Neolithic Revolution|agrarian villages]]. Villages grew to become towns and cities. Cities turned into [[city-state]]s and [[nation-state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Effland, R. 1998. [http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/anthro2003/glues/model_complex.html The Cultural Evolution of Civilizations] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515120848/http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/anthro2003/glues/model_complex.html |date=15 May 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many societies distribute largess at the behest of some individual or some larger group of people. This type of generosity can be seen in all known cultures; typically, prestige accrues to the generous individual or group. Conversely, members of a society may also shun or [[scapegoat]] members of the society who violate its [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. Mechanisms such as [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|gift-giving]], [[joking relationship]]s and [[scapegoating]], which may be seen in various types of human groupings, tend to be [[institution]]alized within a society. Social evolution as a phenomenon carries with it certain elements that could be detrimental to the population it serves.

Some societies bestow status on an individual or group of people when that individual or group performs an admired or desired action. This type of [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]] is bestowed in the form of a name, title, manner of dress, or monetary reward. In many societies, adult male or female status is subject to a ritual or process of this type. Altruistic action in the interests of the larger group is seen in virtually all societies. The phenomena of community action, shunning, scapegoating, generosity, shared risk, and reward are common to many forms of society.

==Types==
Societies are [[social groups]] that differ according to [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence strategies]], the ways that humans use technology to provide needs for themselves. Although humans have established many types of societies throughout history, anthropologists tend to classify different societies according to the degree to which different groups within a society have unequal access to advantages such as resources, prestige, or power. Virtually all societies have developed some degree of inequality among their people through the process of social stratification, the division of members of a society into levels with unequal wealth, prestige, or power. Sociologists place societies in three broad categories: [[pre-industrial]], [[industrial society|industrial]], and [[postindustrial]].

===Pre-industrial===
{{Main article|Pre-industrial society}}

In a pre-industrial society, food production, which is carried out through the use of human and animal [[Manual labour|labor]], is the main economic activity. These societies can be subdivided according to their level of technology and their method of producing food. These subdivisions are hunting and gathering, pastoral, horticultural, agricultural, and feudal.

==== Hunting and gathering ====
{{Main article|Hunter-gatherer society}}
[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|[[San people]] in Botswana start a fire by hand.]]
The main form of food production in such societies is the daily collection of wild plants and the hunting of wild animals. Hunter-gatherers move around constantly in search of food. As a result, they do not build permanent [[villages]] or create a wide variety of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], and usually only form small groups such as [[Band society|bands]] and [[tribe]]s. However, some hunting and gathering societies in areas with abundant resources (such as people of [[Tlingit people|tlingit]]) lived in larger groups and formed complex hierarchical social structures such as chiefdom. The need for mobility also limits the size of these societies. They generally consist of fewer than 60 people and rarely exceed 100. Statuses within the tribe are relatively equal, and decisions are reached through general agreement. The ties that bind the tribe are more complex than those of the bands. [[Leadership]] is personal—charismatic—and used for special purposes only in tribal society. There are no political offices containing real power, and a [[Tribal chief|chief]] is merely a person of influence, a sort of adviser; therefore, tribal consolidations for collective action are not governmental. The family forms the main [[social unit]], with most members being related by birth or marriage. This type of organization requires the family to carry out most social functions, including [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] and [[education]].

==== Pastoral ====
{{Main article|Pastoral society}}

[[Pastoralism]] is a slightly more efficient form of subsistence. Rather than searching for food on a daily basis, members of a pastoral society rely on domesticated herd animals to meet their food needs. Pastoralists live a nomadic life, moving their herds from one pasture to another. Because their food supply is far more reliable, pastoral societies can support larger populations. Since there are food surpluses, fewer people are needed to produce food. As a result, the division of labor (the specialization by individuals or groups in the performance of specific economic activities) becomes more complex. For example, some people become craftworkers, producing [[tools]], [[weapons]], and [[jewelry]]. The production of goods encourages trade. This trade helps to create inequality, as some families acquire more goods than others do. These families often gain power through their increased [[wealth]]. The passing on of property from one generation to another helps to centralize wealth and power. Over time emerge hereditary chieftainships, the typical form of [[government]] in pastoral societies.

==== Horticultural ====
{{Main article|Horticulturalist society}}

Fruits and vegetables grown in garden plots that have been cleared from the jungle or forest provide the main source of food in a horticultural society. These societies have a level of [[technology]] and complexity similar to pastoral societies. Some horticultural groups use the slash-and-burn method to raise crops. The wild vegetation is cut and burned, and ashes are used as fertilizers. Horticulturists use human labor and simple tools to cultivate the land for one or more seasons. When the land becomes barren, horticulturists clear a new plot and leave the old plot to revert to its natural state. They may return to the original land several years later and begin the process again. By rotating their garden plots, horticulturists can stay in one area for a fairly long period of time. This allows them to build semipermanent or permanent villages. The size of a village's population depends on the amount of land available for farming; thus villages can range from as few as 30 people to as many as 2000.

As with pastoral societies, surplus food leads to a more complex division of labor. Specialized roles in horticultural societies include craftspeople, [[shamans]] (religious leaders), and traders. This role specialization allows people to create a wide variety of artifacts. As in pastoral societies, surplus food can lead to inequalities in wealth and power within horticultural political systems, developed because of the settled nature of horticultural life.

==== Agrarian ====
{{Main article|Agrarian society}}
[[File:Detail of Les tres riches heures - March.jpg|thumb|Ploughing with oxen in the 15th century]]
Agrarian societies use agricultural [[technological]] advances to cultivate crops over a large area. Sociologists use the phrase [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]] to refer to the technological changes that occurred as long as 8,500 years ago that led to cultivating crops and raising farm animals. Increases in food supplies then led to larger populations than in earlier communities. This meant a greater surplus, which resulted in towns that became centers of trade supporting various rulers, educators, craftspeople, merchants, and religious leaders who did not have to worry about locating nourishment.

Greater degrees of social stratification appeared in agrarian societies. For example, women previously had higher social status because they shared labor more equally with men. In hunting and gathering societies, women even gathered more food than men. However, as food stores improved and women took on lesser roles in providing food for the family, they increasingly became subordinate to men. As villages and towns expanded into neighboring areas, conflicts with other communities inevitably occurred. Farmers provided warriors with food in [[Trade|exchange]] for protection against invasion by enemies. A system of rulers with high social status also appeared. This nobility organized warriors to protect the society from invasion. In this way, the nobility managed to extract goods from “lesser” members of society.

[[File:Cleric-Knight-Workman.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Cleric, knight and peasant; an example of feudal societies]]

==== Feudal ====
{{Main article|Feudal society}}

[[Feudalism]] was a form of society based on ownership of land. Unlike today's farmers, vassals under feudalism were bound to cultivating their lord's land. In exchange for military protection, the lords exploited the peasants into providing food, crops, crafts, homage, and other services to the landowner. The [[estates of the realm]] system of feudalism was often multigenerational; the families of peasants may have cultivated their lord's land for generations.

===Industrial===
{{main article|Industrial societies}}

Between the 15th and 16th centuries, a new economic system emerged that began to replace feudalism. [[Capitalism]] is marked by open competition in a free market, in which the means of production are privately owned. Europe's exploration of the Americas served as one impetus for the development of capitalism. The introduction of foreign metals, silks, and spices stimulated great commercial activity in European societies.

Industrial societies rely heavily on machines powered by fuels for the production of goods. This produced further dramatic increases in efficiency. The increased efficiency of production of the industrial revolution produced an even greater surplus than before. Now the surplus was not just agricultural goods, but also manufactured goods. This larger surplus caused all of the changes discussed earlier in the domestication revolution to become even more pronounced.

Once again, the population boomed. Increased productivity made more goods available to everyone. However, inequality became even greater than before. The breakup of agricultural-based feudal societies caused many people to leave the land and seek employment in cities. This created a great surplus of labor and gave capitalists plenty of laborers who could be hired for extremely low wages.

===Post-industrial===
{{main article|Post-industrial society}}
Post-industrial societies are societies dominated by information, services, and high technology more than the production of goods. Advanced industrial societies are now seeing a shift toward an increase in service sectors over manufacturing and production. The United States is the first country to have over half of its work force employed in service industries. Service industries include government, research, education, health, sales, law, and banking.

==Contemporary usage==
The term "society" is currently used to cover both a number of political and scientific connotations as well as a variety of associations.

===Western===
{{Main article|Western world}}
The development of the [[Western world]] has brought with it the emerging concepts of [[Western culture]], politics, and ideas, often referred to simply as "Western society". Geographically, it covers at the very least the countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. It sometimes also includes Eastern Europe, South America, and Israel.

The cultures and lifestyles of all of these stem from Western Europe. They all enjoy relatively strong economies and stable governments, allow freedom of religion, have chosen democracy as a form of governance, favor capitalism and international trade, are heavily influenced by [[Judeo-Christian values]], and have some form of political and military alliance or cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palgrave.com/Products/title.aspx?pid=355705 John P McKay, Bennett D Hill, John Buckler, Clare Haru Crowston and Merry E Wiesner-Hanks: ''Western Society: A Brief History''.

===Information===
[[File:ONU Geneva mainroom.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|World Summit on the Information Society, Geneva]]
{{Main article|Information society}}
Although the concept of [[information society]] has been under discussion since the 1930s, in the modern world it is almost always applied to the manner in which information technologies have impacted society and culture. It therefore covers the effects of computers and telecommunications on the home, the workplace, schools, government, and various communities and organizations, as well as the emergence of new social forms in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~tisj/ ''The Information Society''.

One of the [[European Union]]'s areas of interest is the information society. Here policies are directed towards promoting an open and competitive [[digital economy]], research into [[information and communication technologies]], as well as their application to improve [[social inclusion]], [[public services]], and [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/tl/policy/index_en.htm Information Society Policies at a Glance.

===Knowledge===
{{Main article|Knowledge society}}
[[File:Seoul-Cyworld control room.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Seoul [[Cyworld]] control room]]
As access to electronic information resources increased at the beginning of the 21st century, special attention was extended from the information society to the knowledge society. An analysis by the Irish government stated, "The capacity to manipulate, store and transmit large quantities of information cheaply has increased at a staggering rate over recent years. The digitisation of information and the associated pervasiveness of the Internet are facilitating a new intensity in the application of knowledge to economic activity, to the extent that it has become the predominant factor in the creation of wealth. As much as 70 to 80 percent of economic growth is now said to be due to new and better knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isc.ie/downloads/know.pdf ''Building the Knowledge Society.

People of many nations united by common political and cultural traditions, beliefs, or values are sometimes also said to form a society (such as Judeo-Christian, Eastern, and Western). When used in this context, the term is employed as a means of contrasting two or more "societies" whose members represent alternative conflicting and competing worldviews.

Some [[academic]], professional, and [[scientific societies|scientific]] [[Voluntary association|associations]] describe themselves as ''societies'' (for example, the [[American Mathematical Society]], the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]], or the [[Royal Society]]).

In some countries, e.g. the United States, France, and Latin America, the term "society' is used in [[commerce]] to denote a partnership between [[investor]]s or the start of a [[business]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], partnerships are not called societies, but [[cooperative|co-operatives]] or [[Mutual organization|mutuals]] are often known as societies (such as [[friendly society|friendly societies]] and [[building society|building societies]]).

A '''stateless society''' is a [[society]] that is not [[government|governed]] by a [[state (polity)|state]], or, especially in common [[American English]], has no government.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; In stateless societies, there is little [[centralization|concentration]] of [[authority]]; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in [[political power|power]] and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Stephen |title= The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of an African Civil War |publisher= NYU Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 978-0-8147-2219-0 |page= 198 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fLAWMGqKMb4C&amp;pg=PA198 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Béteille |first= André |authorlink= André Béteille |chapter= Inequality and Equality |editor-last= Ingold |editor-first= Tim |title= Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-415-28604-6 |pages= 1042–1043 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hKzSc02tbaMC&amp;pg=PA1042 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a [[sovereign state]]. In some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield [[failed state|little or no actual power]]. Over the course of history most stateless peoples have been [[cultural assimilation|integrated into the state-based societies around them]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Faulks |first= Keith |title= Political Sociology: A Critical Introduction |publisher= NYU Press |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-0-8147-2709-6 |page= 23 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_fjCczhvWj0C&amp;pg=PA23 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political philosophies, particularly [[anarchism]], consider the state an unwelcome institution and stateless societies the ideal.

==Prehistoric peoples==
In [[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]] and [[history]], a stateless society denotes a less complex human [[community]] without a state, such as a [[tribe]], a [[clan]], a [[band society]] or a [[chiefdom]]. The main criterion of "complexity" used is the extent to which a [[division of labor]] has occurred such that many people are permanently ''specialized'' in particular forms of production or other activity, and depend on others for goods and services through trade or sophisticated reciprocal obligations governed by [[Convention (norm)|custom]] and [[laws]]. An additional criterion is [[population size]]. The bigger the population, the more relationships have to be reckoned with.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Evidence of the earliest known city-states has been found in [[ancient Mesopotamia]] around 3700 BC, suggesting that the history of the state is less than 6,000 years old; thus, for most of human [[prehistory]] the state did not exist.

{{Quotation|For 99.8 percent of human history people lived exclusively in autonomous bands and villages. At the beginning of the Paleolithic [i.e. the stone age], the number of these autonomous political units must have been small, but by 1000 BC it had increased to some 600,000. Then supra-village aggregation began in earnest, and in barely three millennia the autonomous political units of the world dropped from 600,000 to 157.|Robert L. Carneiro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Robert L. |last= Carneiro |chapter= Political Expansion as an Expression of the Principle of Competitive Exclusion |page= 219 |editor1-first= Ronald |editor1-last= Cohen |editor2-first= Elman R. |editor2-last= Service |title= Origins of the State: The Anthropology of Political Evolution |location= Philadelphia |publisher= Institute for the Study of Human Issues |year= 1978 |lastauthoramp= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Generally speaking, the archaeological evidence suggests that the state emerged from stateless communities only when a fairly large population (at least tens of thousands of people) was more or less settled together in a particular territory, and practiced [[agriculture]]. Indeed, one of the typical functions of the state is the defense of territory. Nevertheless, there are exceptions: [[Lawrence Krader]] for example describes the case of the Tatar state, a political authority arising among confederations of clans of nomadic or semi-nomadic herdsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Krader |title= Formation of the State |location= Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher= Prentice-Hallm |year= 1968 |at= ch. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristically the state functionaries (royal dynasties, soldiers, scribes, servants, administrators, lawyers, tax collectors, religious authorities etc.) are mainly not self-supporting, but rather materially supported and financed by taxes and tributes contributed by the rest of the working population. This assumes a sufficient level of labor-productivity [[per capita]] which at least makes possible a ''permanent'' [[surplus product]] (principally foodstuffs) appropriated by the state authority to sustain the activities of state functionaries. Such permanent surpluses were generally not produced on a significant scale in smaller tribal or clan societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Henri J.M. |editor1-last= Claessen |editor2-first= Peter |editor2-last= Skalnik |lastauthoramp= yes |url= https://books.google.com/?id=sMoLhNQ9KRoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Henri+J.M.+Claessen#v=onepage&amp;q=Henri%20J.M.%20Claessen&amp;f=false |title= The Early State |location= The Hague |publisher= Mouton |year= 1978 |via= Google Books|isbn= 9789027979049 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologist [[Gregory Possehl]] has argued that there is no evidence that the relatively sophisticated, urbanized [[Harappan civilization]], which flourished from about 2,500 to 1,900 BC in the [[Indus]] region, featured anything like a centralized state apparatus. No evidence has yet been excavated locally of palaces, temples, a ruling sovereign or royal graves, a centralized administrative bureaucracy keeping records, or a state religion—all of which are elsewhere usually associated with the existence of a state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Gregory L. |last= Possehl |chapter= Sociocultural Complexity Without the State: The Indus civilization |editor1-first= Gary M. |editor1-last= Feinman |editor2-first= Joyce |editor2-last= Marcus |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Archaic States |location= Santa Fe |publisher= School of American Research Press |year= 1998 |pages= 261–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the earliest large-scale human settlements of the [[stone age]] which have been discovered, such as [[Çatal Höyük]] and [[Jericho]], no evidence was found of the existence of a state authority. The Çatal Höyük settlement of a farming community (7,300 BC to circa 6,200 BC) spanned circa 13 hectares (32 acres) and probably had about 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Chris |editor-last= Scarre |title= The Human Past |edition= 2nd |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson |year= 2009 |page= 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern state-based societies regularly pushed out stateless indigenous populations as their settlements expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Richards |first=  John F. |title= The Unending Frontier: An Environmental History of the Early Modern World |publisher= University of California Press |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-520-24678-2 |pages= 4–5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=i85noYD9C0EC&amp;pg=PA4 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uncontacted peoples]] may be considered remnants of prehistoric stateless societies. To varying extents they may be unaware of and unaffected by the states that have nominal authority over their territory.

==As a political ideal==
Some political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achieved.

A central tenet of [[anarchism]] is the advocacy of society without states.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Anarchism |title= The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year= 2005 |page= 14 |quote= Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sheehan |first= Sean |title= Anarchism |location= London |publisher= Reaktion Books |year= 2004 |page= 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of society sought for varies significantly between [[anarchist schools of thought]], ranging from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=slevin&gt;{{cite book |last= Slevin |first= Carl |chapter= Anarchism |title= The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics |editor1-first= Iain |editor1-last= McLean |editor2-first= Alistair |editor2-last= McMillan |lastauthoramp= yes |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marxism]], [[Marx's theory of the state]] considers that in a [[post-capitalist]] society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and [[Withering away of the state|wither away]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm |first= Frederick |last= Engels |title= Socialism: Utopian and Scientific |year= 1880 |chapter= Part III: Historical Materialism |quote= State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The State is not "abolished". It dies out...Socialized production upon a predetermined plan becomes henceforth possible. The development of production makes the existence of different classes of society thenceforth an anachronism. In proportion as anarchy in social production vanishes, the political authority of the State dies out. Man, at last the master of his own form of social organization, becomes at the same time the lord over Nature, his own master—free. |via= Marx/Engels Internet Archive (marxists.org)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is that of [[stateless communism]], a phrase sometimes used to describe Marx's anticipated post-capitalist society.

==Social and economic organization==
[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] have found that [[social stratification]] is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy writes, "Assumptions about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal, that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gowdy |first= John |year= 2006 |chapter= Hunter-Gatherers and the Mythology of the Market |editor1-link= Richard Borshay Lee |editor1-first= Richard B. |editor1-last= Lee |editor2-first= Richard H. |editor2-last= Daly |lastauthoramp= yes |title= The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers |page= 391 |location= New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-60919-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economies of stateless agricultural societies tend to focus and organize [[subsistence agriculture]] at the community level, and tend to diversify their production rather than specializing in a particular crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Chase |first1= Diane Z. |last2= Chase |first2= Arlen F. |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Mesoamerican Elites: An Archaeological Assessment |publisher= University of Oklahoma Press |year= 2003 |isbn= 978-0-8061-3542-7 |page= 23 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kwxl5jjQ-dUC&amp;pg=PA23 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many stateless societies, conflicts between families or individuals are resolved by appealing to the community. Each of the sides of the dispute will voice their concerns, and the community, often voicing its will through village elders, will reach a judgment on the situation. Even when there is no legal or coercive authority to enforce these community decisions, people tend to adhere to them, due to a desire to be held in esteem by the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fleming, Thomas|title=The Politics of Human Nature|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1993|isbn=978-1-56000-693-0|pages=165–166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saK1sFtSXuEC&amp;pg=PA165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''timeline of the American Old West''' is a chronology ordered list of events significant to the development of the American West as a region of the United States prior to 1912. The term "[[American Old West]]" refers to a vast geographical area and lengthy time period of imprecise boundaries, and historians' definitions vary. The events in this timeline occurred primarily in the contiguous portion of the modern United States west of the [[Mississippi River]], and mostly in the period between the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and the admission of the last [[contiguous United States|mainland states]] into the Union in 1912. A small section summarizing early exploration and settlement prior to 1803 is included to provide a foundation for later developments. Rarely, events significant to the history of the West but which occurred within the modern boundaries of Canada and Mexico are included as well.

Western North America was inhabited for millennia by various groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and later served as a [[frontier]] to European powers, beginning with [[Spain|Spanish]] colonization in the 16th century. [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], and [[Russia]]n claims followed in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the [[American Revolution]], the newly independent [[United States]] began securing [[American frontier|its own frontier]] from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] westward for settlement and economic investment by American citizens. The long [[territorial evolution of the United States|history of American expansion]] into these lands has played a central role in shaping American culture, iconography, and the modern national identity, and remains a popular topic for study by scholars and historians.

Events listed below are notable developments for the region as a whole, not just for a particular state or smaller subdivision of the region; as historians Hine and Faragher put it, they "tell the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the lands, the development of markets, and the formation of states.... It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Robert V.|last2=Faragher|first2=John Mack|title=The American West : a new interpretive history|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0300078358|page=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost three centuries after Columbus' voyages to the New World, much of western North America remained unsettled by European colonists, despite various territorial claims made by imperialist nations. Europeans interest in the vast territory was motivated by the search for precious metals, especially gold, and the fur trade, with miners, trappers, and hunters among the first people of European descent to permanently settle in the West.&lt;ref name=RMUtley/&gt;{{rp|150}} The early years were also a period of scientific exploration and survey, such that by 1830 the rough outline of the western half of the continent had been mapped to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=RMUtley&gt;Robert M.
