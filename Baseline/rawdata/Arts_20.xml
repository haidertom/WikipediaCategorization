      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4845">In the [[Creative Arts |creative arts]] and [[scientific literature]], an '''acknowledgement''' (also spelled '''acknowledgment''' in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]]&lt;ref name="gram"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://grammarist.com/spelling/acknowledgment-acknowledgement/ | title=Acknowledgement vs. Acknowledgment – Correct Spelling – Grammarist}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an expression of a gratitude for  assistance in creating an original work.

Receiving [[credit (creative arts) |credit]] by way of acknowledgement rather than authorship indicates that the person or organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in question, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or encouragement to the author(s). Various schemes exist for classifying acknowledgements; Cronin et al.&lt;ref name="Cronin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cronin |first=Blaise |last2=McKenzie |first2=Gail |last3=Stiffler |first3=Michael |title=Patterns of acknowledgement |journal=[[Journal of Documentation|J.

# [[moral support]]
# [[funding |financial support]]
# [[editing |editorial support]]
# [[presentation |presentational support]]
# [[technical support |instrumental/technical support]]
# conceptual support, or peer interactive communication (PIC)

Apart from [[citation]], which is not usually considered to be an acknowledgement, acknowledgement of conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for identifying intellectual debt. Some acknowledgements of financial support, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by the granting institution. Occasionally, bits of science humor can also be found in acknowledgements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2196">An '''adaptation''' is a transfer of a work of art from one medium to another.

Some common examples are:
* [[Film adaptation]], a story from another work, adapted into a [[film]] (it may be a novel, non-fiction like journalism, autobiography, comic books, scriptures, plays or historical sources)
* [[Literary adaptation]], a story from a literary source, adapted into another work{{cn|date=March 2018}}
* [[Theatrical adaptation]], a story from another work, adapted into a [[play (theatre)|play]]

There is, however, no end to potential media involved in adaptation. Adaptation is the practice of transcoding (changing the code or 'language' used in a medium) as well as the assimilation of a work of art to other cultural, linguistic, semiotic, aesthetic or other norms. Recent approaches to the expanding field Adaptation Studies reflect these expansion of our perspective. Adaptation occurs as a special case of intertextual and intermedial exchange and the copy-paste culture of digital technologies has produced "new intertextual forms engendered by emerging technologies—mashups, remixes, reboots, samplings, remodelings, transformations— " that "further develop the impulse to adapt and appropriate, and the ways in which they challenge the theory and practice of adaptation and appropriation."&lt;ref&gt;Voigts, Eckart.

'''Aesthetic relativism''' is the idea that [[points of view (philosophy)|views]] of [[beauty]] are [[relativism|relative]] to differences in perception and consideration, and [[intrinsic|intrinsically]], have no absolute [[truth]] or [[Validity (logic)|validity]] 

==Overview==
Aesthetic relativism might be regarded as a sub-set of an overall philosophical [[relativism]], which denies any absolute standards of [[truth]] or [[morality]] as well as of aesthetic judgement. (A frequently-cited source for philosophical relativism in [[postmodern]] theory is a fragment by [[Nietzsche]], entitled "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense.")

For example, in historical terms, the female form as depicted in the [[Venus of Willendorf]] and the women in the paintings of [[Rubens]] would today be regarded as over-weight, while the slim models on the covers of contemporary fashion magazines would no doubt be regarded in a negative light by our predecessors. In contemporary (cross-cultural) terms, [[body modification]] among "[[primitive culture|primitive]]" peoples is sometimes regarded as [[grotesque]] by Western society. 

Aesthetic relativism is a variety of the philosophy known generally as relativism, which casts doubt on the possibility of direct epistemic access to the "external world", and which therefore rejects the positive claim that statements made about the external world can be known to be objectively true. Other varieties of relativism include cognitive relativism (the general claim that all truth and knowledge is relative) and Ethical Relativism (the claim that moral judgments are relative). Aesthetic and ethical relativism are sub-categories of Cognitive Relativism. Philosophers who have been influential in relativist thinking include David Hume, particularly his "radical scepticism" as set out in A Treatise of Human Nature; Thomas Kuhn, with regard to the history and philosophy of science, and particularly his work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions; Friedrich Nietzsche, in moral philosophy and epistemology; and Richard Rorty, on the contingency of language.

Philosophers who have given influential objectivist accounts include Plato, and in particular his Theory of the Forms; Immanuel Kant, who argued that the judgment of beauty, despite being subjective, is a universally practiced function of the mind; Noam Chomsky, whose "nativist" theory of linguistics argues for a universal grammar (i.e., that language is not as contingent as relativists have argued that it is).

The most prominent philosophical opponent of aesthetic relativism was Immanuel [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], who argued that the judgment of beauty, while subjective, is universal.

'''Anthropotechnic''' is a term used in [[art]], [[science]] and [[literature]] to denote something with aspects of both man and machine.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Charwat, Hans Jürgen: Lexikon der Mensch-Maschine-Kommunikation. Oldenbourg, 1994, {{ISBN|3-486-22618-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Painting]]s such as [[Max Ernst]]'s "Oedipus Rex" are early examples of the use of this quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famous-painters.org/Max-Ernst/Oedipus-Rex.shtm |title=Oedipus Rex - Max Ernst Painting Gallery |publisher=Famous-painters.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In technology, it is any field of science that attempts to make machines and automation more user-friendly. In sociology, it is used to describe the relationship between man and anything that is perceived as inflexible or inhumane such as slavery, religion or animals.

==Uses==
* In her book ''Education in Human Creative Existential Planning'', [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] uses the term Genetic Anthropotechnic as a means of ensuring that only the desired characters are inherited by future generations of human beings though the usage of genetics and hence, avoidance of the "fatalism" of inheritance.&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka|title=Education in Human Creative Existential Planning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sG8NuWEIuIC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=26 February 2012|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-6301-5|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in her ''Phenomenology of Life from the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: In search of experience '', she uses the term Anthropotechnic with reference to the ability of human being to turn animals from being dangerous to "human-friendly".&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka|title=Phenomenology of Life from the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: In search of experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3l8yyvfH5AQC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=3 June 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-5191-3|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In their book ''In Medias Res: Peter Sloterdijk's Spherological Poetics of Being'', Willem Schinkel uses the term Anthropotechnic to define cultural forms of automated mental and physical exercises that we humans exhibit in the face of ambiguous risk.&lt;ref name="SchinkelNoordegraaf-Eelens2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Willem Schinkel|author2=Liesbeth Noordegraaf-Eelens|title=In Medias Res: Peter Sloterdijk's Spherological Poetics of Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCHqEP1r4FcC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=15 February 2012|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-8964-329-2|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In their paper ''Anthropotechnics in vehicle control - Dynamic systems control and guidance by man in light of anthropotechnics, treating approaches to man machine systems optimization'', Bernotat uses the term to describe methods of adapting machine to men.&lt;ref name="berno"&gt;{{cite journal | author= R- K.

* In her book ''Bronze and iron: old Latin poetry from its beginnings to 100 B.C.'', Janet Lembke uses the Anthropotechnic to describe the "monstrous" connection between machine and man, as compared to social and intimate connections.&lt;ref name="Lembke1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Lembke|title=Bronze and iron: old Latin poetry from its beginnings to 100 B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pg5sESEkOqAC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=26 February 2012|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02164-8|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his book ''Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau: interactive art research'', Gerfried Stocker uses the term with reference to Web 2.0 and Search engines and describes it as "a technique for the humanization of humans".&lt;ref name="StockerSommerer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerfried Stocker|author2=Christa Sommerer|author3=Laurent Mignonneau|title=Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau: interactive art research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmcaVRcvJoEC&amp;pg=PT17|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=4 October 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-99015-5|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art''' is a diverse range of [[human behavior|human activities]] in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts ([[artworks]]), expressing the author's [[imagination|imaginative]], [[Concept|conceptual]] [[idea]], or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/art |title=Art: definition |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/art |title=art |publisher=Merriam-Websters Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. 

The three classical branches of art are [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=q8rvdsxGokwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vasari+lives+of+painters,+sculptors+and+painters&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTta2zrLreAhUGbBoKHdSoDUIQ6AEIKDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Music, theatre, film, dance, and other [[performing arts]], as well as literature and other media such as [[interactive media]], are included in a broader definition  of [[the arts]].&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Art, n. 1". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com. (Accessed 26 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 17th century, ''art'' referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from [[craft]]s or [[sciences]]. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or [[applied arts]].

==Creative art and fine art==

In the perspective of the history of art,&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]]; however, some theories restrict the concept of "artistic works" to modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James "Art History and Images That Are Not Art", ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (December 1995), with previous bibliography. "Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value". 553&lt;/ref&gt; One early sense of the definition of ''art'' is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft," as associated with words such as "artisan." English words derived from this meaning include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', ''medical arts'', and ''military arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].
[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|upright|20th-century Rwandan bottle. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]

Over time, [[Philosopher|philosophers]] like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]] and [[Kant]], among others, questioned the meaning of art.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 73-96&lt;/ref&gt; Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a–c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 40-72&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|mimetic]] or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, and more recent, sense of the word ''art'' as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' emerged in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;120&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or ''finer'' work of art.

Within this latter sense, the word ''art'' may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as [[Kant]], the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 287-326&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

The nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p. 1, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-29706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Levinson5/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.&lt;ref name="Levinson5"&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R.G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp. 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Kant]], and was developed in the early twentieth century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], "The Origin of the Work of Art", in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001). See also [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], "Cézanne's Doubt" in ''The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader'', Galen Johnson and Michael Smith (eds), (Northwestern University Press, 1994) and [[John Russon]], ''Bearing Witness to Epiphany'', (State University of New York Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] has offered an [[institutional theory of art]] that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the [[art world]]" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation".&lt;ref&gt;Kennick, William ed, and W. E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy: readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, p. 89. {{ISBN|0-312-05391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Shiner has described fine art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old."&lt;ref&gt;Shiner 2003. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]''Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 3. {{ISBN|978-0-226-75342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art may be characterized in terms of [[mimesis]] (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gombrich, Ernst. |url=http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |title=Press statement on The Story of Art |accessdate=18 November 2008 |year=2005 |website=The Gombrich Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006212330/http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |archivedate=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Olmec]]. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.83, pp.75-115 pp.132-141, pp.147-155, p.163, p.627.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.86-89, pp.135-141, p.143, p.179, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.&lt;ref name="Nichols2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Nichols|title=Renaissance Art: A Beginner's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzMRpHo0QHUC|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-178-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan Panorama - Grande Mosquée de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, also called the Mosque of Uqba, is one of the finest, most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques.

In the east, [[Islamic art]]'s rejection of [[iconography]] led to emphasis on [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 634-635&lt;/ref&gt;), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, [[Tang dynasty]] paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but [[Ming dynasty]] paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition.&lt;ref name="Watson1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Watson|title=The Arts of China 900-1620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-v5jUKaCxYC|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09835-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. [[Woodblock printing]] became important in Japan after the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.155, p.530.&lt;/ref&gt;

The western [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as [[William Blake|Blake]]'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer,&lt;ref name="Moore2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Moore|title=Propaganda Prints: A History of Art in the Service of Social and Political Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0KAlsQ2Yj4C|date=6 August 2010|publisher=A&amp;amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-0591-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s propagandistic paintings. This led to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of [[Goethe]]. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as [[academic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[fauvism]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.394-395, pp.519-527, pp. 573-575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of Enlightenment An Anthology Prepared for the Enlightenment Book Club|url=http://www.rosenfels.org/The_Age_Of_Enlightenment_Anthology.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2018|pages=1–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of twentieth-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of [[impressionism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, [[African art|African sculptures]] were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New York Times Book Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwEjAQAAMAAJ|volume=1, 84|year=1979|publisher=New York Times Company|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism]], the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. [[Theodor W. Adorno]] said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with [[skepticism]] and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.&lt;ref name="Sangeeta2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Sangeeta|title=Development of Modern Art Criticism in India after Independence: Post Independence Indian Art Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqs4DwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=6 October 2017|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-947697-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]'', [[Martin Heidegger]], a German philosopher and a seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which "that which is" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed.

==Forms, genres, media, and styles==
[[File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]]'' by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] (French, 1806), oil on canvas]]
{{Main|The arts}}
The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as [[List of art mediums|media]], genre, [[Art movement|styles]], and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walton |first1=Kendall L. |title=Categories of Art |journal=The Philosophical Review |date=1 January 1970 |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=334–67 |doi=10.2307/2183933 |jstor=2183933}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Art form''''' refers to the [[elements of art]] that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., [[figurae]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monelle |first1=Raymond |title=Linguistics and Semiotics in Music |date=3 January 1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-3718652099 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMtQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;pg=PA202#q=figurae |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Color theory|color]], [[Contour drawing|contour]], [[Fourth dimension in art|dimension]], [[List of art mediums|medium]], [[melody]], [[Negative space|space]], [[Texture (painting)|texture]], and [[Lightness|value]]. Form may also include [[Visual design elements and principles#Principles of design|visual design principles]], such as arrangement, [[Formal balance|balance]], [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], [[harmony]], [[Hierarchical proportion|proportion]], [[Principles of grouping|proximity]], and rhythm.&lt;ref name="Belton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Belton |first1=Dr. Robert J. |title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook |chapter=The Elements of Art |date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Extreme [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Min |last2=Deng |first2=Guifang |title=Against Zangwill's Extreme Formalism About Inorganic Nature |journal=Philosophia |date=2 December 2014 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=249–57 |doi=10.1007/s11406-014-9575-1 |url=http://xy.cmsproxy.sysu.edu.cn/pub/hkmacc/docs/2014-12/20141215194213014875.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content – i.e., [[denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s – while others prefer terms like [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[Importance|significance]].&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Extreme Intentionalism holds that [[authorial intent]] plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1=Paisley |title=Intentionalism in Aesthetics |journal=New Literary History |date=1998 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=831–46 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1998.0042 |url=http://works.bepress.com/paisley_livingston/67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munk |first1=Eduard |last2=Beck |first2=Charles |last3=Felton |first3=Cornelius Conway |title=The Metres of the Greeks and Romans |date=1844 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxRgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content as the artist's experience of that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tolstoy |first1=Leo |title=What is Art? |date=1899 |publisher=Crowell |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the composition of [[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]] is partly borrowed from the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. As evidenced by the title, the subject is [[Napoleon]], and the content is [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s representation of Napoleon as "Emperor-God beyond time and space".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is "socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Finally, the developing theory of [[post-structuralism]] studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Melahat Küçükarslan |last1=Emiroğlu |first2=Fitnat Cimşit |last2=Koş |title=Design Semiotics and Post-Structuralism |conference=12th World Congress of Semiotics |date=16–20 September 2014 |location=New Bulgarian University |url=http://semio2014.org/en/design-semiotics-and-post-structuralism |access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. [[Art criticism]] continues to grow and develop alongside art.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.&lt;ref&gt;Breskin, Vladimir, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110901145415/http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf "Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art"], ''Signs – International Journal of Semiotics'' 3, pp. 1–28, 2010. {{ISSN|1902-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the [[Wikt:epithet|epithet]] "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for [[Leonardo da Vinci]], art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated London News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oc-AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=July 1872|publisher=Illustrated London News &amp; Sketch Limited|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt]]'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.&lt;ref name="NewtonNeil1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Newton|author2=William Neil|title=2000 Years of Christian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsSfAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of [[John Singer Sargent]] were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency,&lt;ref name="RichardsGjertson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kirk Richards|author2=Stephen Gjertson|title=For glory and for beauty: practical perspectives on Christianity and the visual arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaBGAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Classical Realism|isbn=978-0-9636180-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, [[Pablo Picasso]], was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.&lt;ref name="Leslie2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Leslie|title=Pablo Picasso: A Modern Master|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE8Es-9j3e0C|date=30 December 2005|publisher=New Line Books|isbn=978-1-59764-094-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DillenbergerHandley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Dillenberger|author2=John Handley|title=The Religious Art of Pablo Picasso|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uglDQAAQBAJ|date=17 April 2014|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27629-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art]] occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred S. Kleiner|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK_jTggtYl8C|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57364-7|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'', or [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Luke|title=Damien Hirst's Shark: Nature, Capitalism and the Sublime|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/luke-white-damien-hirsts-shark-nature-capitalism-and-the-sublime-r1136828|publisher=Tate|accessdate=26 May 2018|language=en|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects.

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss).&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Schiuma|title=The Value of Arts for Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wyboE8aWDcC|date=19 May 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49665-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-motivated functions ===
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;
# '''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].''' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. - Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Experience of the mysterious.''' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. – Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. "The World as I See It". http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Expression of the imagination.''' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else—something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. - Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.''' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. - Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Motivated functions ===
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephanidis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constantine Stephanidis|title=HCI International 2011 Posters' Extended Abstracts: International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9-14, 2011,Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qble3WYcH0cC|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-22094-4|pages=529–533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Communication.''' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. – Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. ''The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science''. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as entertainment'''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.&lt;ref name="Resources2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Digital Arts and Entertainment: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BaXBQAAQBAJ|date=30 June 2014|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6115-8|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.''' One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others—are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. – André Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;André Breton, ''Surrealist Manifesto'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as a "free zone"''', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as "a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.": see {{Cite book |title=Postdigitale |url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm |year=2008 |author=Maurizio Bolognini |publisher=Carocci |location=Rome |isbn=978-88-430-4739-0}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.''' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|upright=3.2|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
# '''Art for social causes.''' Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of [[autism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Trotter |first=Jeramia |title=RiverKings raising autism awareness with art |url=http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WMC tv |date=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053732/http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |archivedate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Art exhibit aims to raise awareness of autism |url=http://www.newsminer.com/article_1a9b7e33-6ca0-56a5-89f3-c9c0798815a2.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Daily News-Miner |date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anchorage art exhibit to raise awareness about autism |url=http://dhss.alaska.gov/News/Documents/press/2011/Anchorage_art_exhibit_autism_PR033111.pdf |publisher=Alaska Department of Health and Social Services |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ruhl |first=Ashleigh |title=Photographer Seeks Subjects To Help Raise Cancer Awareness |url=http://www.gazettes.com/lifestyle/arts_and_entertainment/photographer-seeks-subjects-to-help-raise-cancer-awareness/article_10291db8-7614-11e2-be53-0019bb2963f4.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Gazettes |date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bra art raising awareness for breast cancer |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/videos/news/national/bra-art-raising-awareness-for-breast-cancer/vgBSm/ |accessdate=22 January 2015 |newspaper=The Palm Beach Post |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flynn |first=Marella |title=October art walk aims to raise money, awareness for breast cancer |url=http://gargoyle.flagler.edu/2007/10/october-art-walk-aims-to-raise-money-awareness-for-breast-cancer/ |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Flagler College Gargoyle |date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[human trafficking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Students get creative in the fight against human trafficking |url=http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness#.USb6vFeIqAg |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WDTN Channel 2 News |date=26 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630141018/http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness%23.UdA8P33LfK5 |archivedate=June 30, 2013}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Looking to raise awareness at ArtPrize |url=http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WWMT, Newschannel 3 |date=10 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006075346/http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |archivedate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SciCafe – Art/Sci Collision: Raising Ocean Conservation Awareness |url=http://www.amnh.org/calendar/scicafe-art-sci-collision-raising-ocean-conservation-awareness |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; human rights in [[Darfur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SMU students raise awareness with 'Art for Darfur' |url=http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |accessdate=21 February 2003 |newspaper=SMU News Release |date=4 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130403085335/http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |archivedate=3 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; murdered and missing Aboriginal women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Donnelly |first=Greg |title=Red dress art project to raise awareness of murdered and missing Aboriginal women |url=http://www.globaltvedmonton.com/red+dress+art+project+to+raise+awareness+of+murdered+and+missing+aboriginal+women/6442594504/story.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Global Edmonton |date=3 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; elder abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raising elder abuse awareness through intergenerational art |url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |publisher=Human Resources and Skills Development Canada |accessdate=21 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122162638/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mathema |first=Paavan |title=Trash to treasure: Turning Mt.

# '''Art for psychological and healing purposes.''' Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.&lt;ref name="Hogan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Hogan|title=Healing Arts: The History of Art Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzUuna6LPBIC|year=2001|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-799-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.''' Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art as a fitness indicator.''' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. "Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology" in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 161-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the [[ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a [[social elite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceramics of the Indigenous Peoples of South America: Studies of Production and Exchange using INAA|url=https://core.tdar.org/collection/58128/ceramics-of-the-indigenous-peoples-of-south-america-studies-of-production-and-exchange-using-inaa|website=core.tdar.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as [[Molding (process)|moulds]] made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality [[Ancient Roman pottery]] and Greek [[Tanagra figurine]]s to a very wide market. [[Cylinder seal]]s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref name="Kipfer2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Ann Kipfer|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C|date=30 April 2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-46158-3|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[coin]]s were widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Coins as Works of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34jbjgEACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1960|publisher=Museum Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when [[printmaking]] began with small [[woodcut]]s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by [[peasant]]s who glued them to the walls of their homes.

[[Public art|Public buildings and monuments]], secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. [[Egyptian temple]]s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.&lt;ref name="Vörös2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Győző Vörös|title=Egyptian Temple Architecture: 100 Years of Hungarian Excavations in Egypt, 1907-2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StEyE9jkMHEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-963-662-084-4|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the [[Palace of Versailles]], where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.&lt;ref name="Waldie1839"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Waldie|title=The Select Circulating Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBs7AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1839|publisher=A.

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the [[Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris|Orleans Collection]] mostly housed in a wing of the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="MeyerSavoy2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Meyer|author2=Benedicte Savoy|title=The Museum Is Open: Towards a Transnational History of Museums 1750-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhroBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=1 January 2014|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-029882-6|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British [[Royal Collection]] remains distinct, but large donations such as the [[Old Royal Library]] were made from it to the [[British Museum]], established in 1753. The [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before.&lt;ref name="Fossi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gloria Fossi|title=The Uffizi: The Official Guide : All of the Works|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYUh_6F-hc8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1999|publisher=Giunti Editore|isbn=978-88-09-01487-9|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building now occupied by the [[Prado]] in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in [[Vienna]], Munich and other capitals. The opening of the [[Musée du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Access to Art in Paris: A Documentary History from the Middle Ages to 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpD9NgeQozEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04434-7|pages=281–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. ([[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, for example, was created by [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.&lt;ref name="Findlay2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Findlay|title=The Value of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6jJ5FvdLjcC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2012|publisher=Prestel Verlag|isbn=978-3-641-08342-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Performance by [[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Everyone an artist – On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism'']]

There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys |journal=ArtForum |date=December 1969 |first=Willoughby |last=Sharp |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=45 |id= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as [[performance art]], [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object."&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, Anne: ''New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality'', p. 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mia |last=Fineman |title=YouTube for Artists The best places to find video art online. |date=21 March 2007 |publisher= |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2162382/ |work=Slate |pages= |accessdate=3 August 2007 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. "With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: ''Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980'', p. 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:JEAN LOUIS THÉODORE GÉRICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'', ''circa'' 1820]]

Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. [[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public. The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The ''Last Judgment'']] by [[Michelangelo]] was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of [[decorum]] through nudity and the [[Apollo]]-like pose of Christ.&lt;ref name="McCue2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maureen McCue|title=British Romanticism and the Reception of Italian Old Master Art, 1793-1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW43DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-17148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickerson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela K.

The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of [[Romanticism]], and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the [[nude]] woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world.&lt;ref name="RuprechtTaiana1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvina Ruprecht|author2=Cecilia Taiana|title=Reordering of Culture: Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada in the Hood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onoI0AI-JJYC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 November 1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-88629-269-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stout2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C.

The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) used arresting [[cubism|cubist]] techniques and stark [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic oils]], to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. [[Leon Golub]]'s ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.&lt;ref name="ChapmanCiment2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Chapman|author2=James Ciment|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints and Voices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XO9nBwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=17 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47351-0|page=594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Arthur Brown|title=Noah's Other Son: Bridging the Gap Between the Bible and the Qur'an|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjbUAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 October 2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2996-4|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of [[Realism (arts)|realism or truth to nature]] and the [[Idealism|ideal]]; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries.  This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art.  The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth". [[John Ruskin|Ruskin, John]]. ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, ''Essay VI''. pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Modernism===
[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1930 - Mondrian Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow.jpg|thumb|''Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow'' (1930) by [[Piet Mondrian]] (Dutch, 1872–1944)]]
The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; New York, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-06700-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]]. [[Clement Greenberg]]'s 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself".&lt;ref name = "Frascina"&gt;''Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology''. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:
{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting—the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment—were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.&lt;ref name = "Frascina" /&gt;}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as [[Michael Fried]], [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Clark]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Linda Nochlin]] and [[Griselda Pollock]] among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref name="Harris2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan P. Harris|title=Writing Back to Modern Art: After Greenberg, Fried, and Clark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TzAIu3LziIC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-32429-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kenneth Holt|title=The Search for Aesthetic Meaning in the Visual Arts: The Need for the Aesthetic Tradition in Contemporary Art Theory and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWedB7SA-KMC|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-89789-773-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pop art]]ists like [[Andy Warhol]] became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the [[art world]]. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.&lt;ref name="Gemünden1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerd Gemünden|title=Framed Visions: Popular Culture, Americanization, and the Contemporary German and Austrian Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mpfn_pue34C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08560-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Yorker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BcnAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2004|publisher=F-R Publishing Corporation|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.&lt;ref name="Duchamp Interview Clip"&gt;{{YouTube|haon2DXWvLk|Duchamp Two Statements}}{{Dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. Fine Art. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, [[horsemanship]], [[geometry]], [[carpentry]], [[prophecy]], and farming etc.&lt;ref name="BurgueteLam2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maria Burguete|author2=Lui Lam|title=Arts: A Science Matter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKmND2ImrGUC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4324-93-9|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Criticism and the "intentional fallacy"===
Following Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.&lt;ref name="Waugh2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Waugh|title=Literary Theory and Criticism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LXMA_7Ko9YC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929133-5|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colebrook1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Colebrook|title=New Literary Histories: New Historicism and Contemporary Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT-8AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4987-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.&lt;ref name="Roholt2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tiger C. Roholt|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6aAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=10 October 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3246-8|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hick2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Darren Hudson Hick|title=Introducing Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_S4DgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=24 August 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-350-00691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;Gaut and Livingston, ''The Creation of Art'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==="Linguistic turn" and its debate===
The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the "innocent eye debate", and generally referred to as the structuralism-[[poststructuralism]] debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled "The Innocent Eye" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 [[John Locke lectures]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist [[Roger Sperry]] who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, "Feasible Aesthetic Formalism", ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included [[cubist]] and [[impressionist]] paintings, [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', the movies, superlative imitations of [[J. S. G. Boggs|banknotes]], [[conceptual art]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deborah Solomon |title=2003: the 3rd Annual Year in Ideas: Video Game Art |newspaper=The New York Times Magazine |date=14 December 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-video-game-art.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin. ''Contemporary Art and the Home''. Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-85973-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Arthur Danto]], suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis [http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm "Tribal Art"] in ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]], edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur.

Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the [[decorative arts]], or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glancey |first1=Jonathan |title=Is advertising art? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/is-advertising-art-1593252.html |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=The Independent |date=26 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value judgment===
[[File:Aboriginal hollow log tomb.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aboriginal hollow log tombs. National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia]]

Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist),&lt;ref name="Potts2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Potts|title=The Kahuna Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uu6lPR6EPQC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=8 August 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-8689-2|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd&amp;nbsp;of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.&lt;ref name="AddisonBurgess2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Addison|author2=Lesley Burgess|title=Debates in Art and Design Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOY10gcBeP8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=28 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-61887-8|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FergusonMansbach2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yale H. Ferguson|authorlink2=Richard W. Mansbach|author2=Richard W. Mansbach|title=A World of Polities: Essays on Global Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=adOTAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=20 March 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-98149-5|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Gordon |title=Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mona lisa crowd.jpg|thumb|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' is the most popular attraction of [[the Louvre]]]]


The '''art world''' comprises everyone involved in producing, commissioning, presenting, [[Historic preservation|preserving]], promoting, chronicling, [[Art criticism|criticizing]], and selling [[fine art]].  

==Descriptions==
''Art world'' is indeed a wider term than [[art market]], though that is a large part of it.  [[Howard S. Becker]] describes it as "the network of people whose cooperative activity, organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produce(s) the kind of art works that art world is noted for" (Becker, 1982). In her book, ''Seven Days in the Art World'', Sarah Thornton describes it as "a loose network of overlapping subcultures held together by a belief in art. They span the globe but [[Art cluster|cluster]] in art capitals like New York, London, Los Angeles, and Berlin."&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;Thornton 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities sometimes called "art capitals" include Beijing, Brussels, Hong Kong, Miami, Paris, Rome and Tokyo; due to their large art festivals, followings, and being the centers of art production.{{citation needed (lead)|date=August 2016}}

The notion of the singular ''art world'' is problematic, since Becker &lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;[[Howard S. Becker|Becker, Howard S.]] ''Art Worlds''. [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]: [[University of California]] Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-520-05218-8}}. Cited in Sanjeck (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and others show art worlds are, instead, independent multiplicities scattered worldwide that are always in flux: there is no "center" to the art world any more. In her analysis of the "net art world" (referring to network-aided art or [[net art]]), Amy Alexander states "net.art had a movement, at the very least it had coherence, and although it aimed to subvert the art world, eventually its own sort of art world formed around it. It developed a culture, hype and mystique through lists and texts; it had a centre, insiders, outsiders, even nodes.  This is of course not a failure; this is unavoidable: groups form; even anarchism is an institution." &lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;Alexander, Amy. ''net art history'' (2001) [http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0102/msg00223.html Nettime.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
Art worlds exist at local and regional levels, as hidden or obscured subcultures, via primary and secondary art markets, through gallery circuits, around design movements, and, esoterically, as shared or perceived experiences. 

The one globalized, all-encompassing art world exists only as myth; rather, there are multiplicities of intersecting, overlapping, self-similar art worlds, each expressing different views of the world as they see it.

''[[Whitehot Magazine]]'' artist/publisher [[Noah Becker]] has published over 3500 articles about the Art World."&lt;ref&gt; Becker, Noah. [http://Whitehotmagazine.com His art magazine called Whitehot Magazine has taken the top spot as one of the only art magazines left in the world. &lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Magazine]]'' art critic [[Jerry Saltz]] has referred to [[William Powhida]]'s and Jade Townsend's drawing ''Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville'' as "a great big art-world stinkbomb."&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Jerry. [http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/03/saltz_william_powhida_is_makin.html "William Powhida Is Making Fun of Me, And I Love It"]. ''New York Magazine''. 9 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--  This is misleading nonsense as written
==Theory==
The term "art world" is  a product of the Institutional [[theory of art]]. It originates with the [[theorн of American art|theories of American art]] critic and [[philosopher]] [[Arthur Danto]]. In 1964 Danto published an essay "The Artworld," in which the term "artworld" was coined, meaning cultural context or "an atmosphere of art theory".&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/art-definition/&lt;/ref&gt; It has had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and, according to professor of philosophy Stephen David Ross, "especially upon [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]'s institutional theory of art." Dickie defines an art work as an artefact "which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld)" (p. 43.)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vDdZNwTmEqUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=danto&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The central core of Danto’s "The Artworld" is "artistic theory", which elevates things to the world of art (or art world). 

Danto writes: "these days one might not be aware he was on artistic terrain without an artistic theory to tell him so. And part of the reason for this lies in the fact that terrain is constituted artistic in virtue of artistic theories, so that one use of theories, in addition to helping us discriminate art from the rest, consists in making art possible" (Danto, The Artworld, p. 3).--&gt;

[[Image:Maciejowski Tower of Babel.jpg|thumb|right|A high medieval construction site from the [[Maciejowski Bible]].]]
'''''Artes Mechanicae''''' or '''mechanical arts''', are a medieval concept of ordered practices or skills, often juxtaposed to the traditional seven liberal arts [[Artes liberales]]. Also called "servile" and "vulgar",&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Cicero's''De Officiis'', Book I, xxlii.&lt;/ref&gt; from antiquity they had been deemed unbecoming for a free man, as ministering to baser needs.

==Overview==
[[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (9th century) divides them somewhat arbitrarily into seven parts: 
*''vestiaria'' ([[tailor]]ing, [[weaving]])
*''agricultura'' ([[agriculture]])
*''architectura'' ([[architecture]], [[masonry]])
*''militia''  and ''venatoria'' ([[war]]fare and [[hunting]], Military education, "[[martial arts]]")
*''mercatura'' ([[trade]])
*''coquinaria'' ([[cooking]])
*''metallaria'' ([[blacksmithing]], [[metallurgy]])&lt;ref&gt;In his commentary on Martianus Capella's early fifth century work, ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'', one of the main sources for medieval reflection on the liberal arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Didascalicon]]'', [[Hugh of St Victor]] (12th century) includes [[navigation]], [[medicine]] and [[theatre|theatrical arts]] instead of commerce, agriculture and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Hugues de Saint-Victor, ''Libri septem eruditiones didascaliae'', ch.26 (PL 176, col.760): lanificium, armaturum, navigationem, agriculturem, venationem, medicinam, theatricam&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh's treatment somewhat elevates the mechanical arts as ordained to the improvement of humanity, a promotion which was to represent a growing trend among late medievals.&lt;ref&gt;See Georges Legoff, ''Time, Work and Culture in the Middle Ages'', (Chicago, University of Chicago Press) 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention of Art"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiner | first = Dr. Larry | year = 2003 | pages = 28–30 |title=[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]] |publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of the ''Artes Mechanicae'' as applied [[geometry]] was introduced to Western Europe by [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] (12th century) under the influence of his readings in Arabic scholarship.

In the 19th century "mechanic arts" referred to fields of which some are now known as [[engineering]].  Use of the term was apparently an attempt to distinguish these fields from creative and artistic endeavors like the [[performing arts]] and the [[fine arts]] which were for the upper class of the time, and the [[intelligentsia]].  The mechanic arts were also considered practical fields for those that did not come from good families.

Related phrases, "[[useful arts]]," or "applied arts" probably encompass the mechanic arts as well as craftsmanship in general.

The most famous usage of the term "mechanic arts" (and the one in which it is most commonly encountered today) is in the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]].

An '''artist's impression''' or '''artist's interpretation''' is the representation of an object or a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available. It could be an image, a sound, a video or a model. Artist's impressions are often created to represent concepts and objects that cannot be seen by the naked eye; that are very big, very small, in the past, in the future, fictional, or otherwise abstract in other ways. For example, in architecture, artists' impressions are used to showcase the design of planned buildings and associated landscape.&lt;ref name="BobMargaret2004"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Bob Giddings | author2=Margaret Horne | title=Artists' Impressions in Architectural Design | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekhXDjNF2bkC&amp;pg=PA1 | accessdate=24 May 2013 | date=9 March 2004 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn=978-0-203-36246-4 | pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists' impressions are particularly prominent in [[space art]].&lt;ref name="NASA's Space Art Program"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newatlas.com/how-are-planets-painted/42763/ |title=Artist's Impression: How to Paint a Planet |last=Powell |first=Dominic |date=2016-04-16 |website=New Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''artist's portfolio''' is an edited collection of their best artwork intended to showcase an artist's style or method of work. A portfolio is used by artists to show employers their versatility by showing different samples of current work. Typically, the work reflects an artist's best work or a depth in one specific area of work.

Historically, portfolios were printed out and placed into a book. With the increased use of the internet and email, however, there are now websites that host [[online portfolio]]s that are available to a wider audience. Sometimes an artist's portfolio can be referred to as a [[lookbook]].

== Photography ==
A [[photography]] portfolio can focus on a single subject. It can be a collection of photographs taken with a certain type of camera, in one geographic area, of one person or a group of people, only black &amp; white or sepia photos, a special event, etc.

Many photographers use portfolios to show their best work when looking for jobs in the photography industry. For example, wedding photographers may put together a book of their best wedding photos to show to engaged couples who are looking for a wedding photographer. [[Photojournalists]] may take a collection of their best freelance work with them when looking for a job.

==Artist design book ==
An artist design book is a collection of photographs meant to show off a model, photographer, style, or clothing line.  Sometimes they are made to compile the looks of other people such as a celebrity, politician or socialite. This is an especially popular term with fashion bloggers.

Artist design books, or ADBs, in their online form, can be described as "fashion diaries" because bloggers are constantly updating them on a daily or weekly basis. 

It is common for stores or clothing designers to use an ADB to show off products.&lt;ref&gt;Fasanella, Kathleen. [http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive/what_are_look_books/ "What are Look books?], ''Fashion-Incubator'', 2005-26-08. Retrieved on 2010-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; They may include photos of multiple types of clothes, shoes and other accessories from a season or line.

'''Artistic license''' (also known as '''art license''', '''historical license''', '''dramatic license''', '''poetic license''', '''narrative license''', '''licentia poetica''', '''creative license''', or simply '''license''') is a colloquial term, sometimes a [[euphemism]], used to denote the distortion of fact, alteration of the conventions of [[grammar]] or language, or rewording of pre-existing text made by an [[artist]] in the name of [[art]].

==History==
The artistic license may also refer to the ability of an artist to apply smaller distortions, such as a poet ignoring some of the minor requirements of grammar for poetic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harvey, Thomas Wadleigh |year=2008 |title=A Practical Grammar of the English Language |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC. |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mark Antony]]'s "Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears" from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' would technically require the word "and" before "countrymen", but the conjunction "and" is omitted to preserve the rhythm of [[iambic pentameter]] (the resulting conjunction is called an [[Asyndeton|asyndetic]] [[tricolon]]). Conversely, on the next line, the end of "I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him" has an extra syllable because omitting the word "him" would make the sentence unclear, but adding a syllable at the end would not disrupt the meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herzberg, Max John |year=1933 |title=Off to Arcady: adventures in poetry |publisher=American book co. |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are examples of artistic license. 

Another example of artistic license is the way in which stylized images of an object (for instance in a [[stylized painting|painting]] or an [[stylized animation|animated movie]]) are different from their real life counterparts, but are still intended to be interpreted by the viewer as representing the same thing. This can mean the omission of details, or the simplification of shapes and color shades, even to the point that the image is nothing more than a [[pictogram]]. It can also mean the addition of non-existing details, or exaggeration of shapes and colours, as in [[fantasy art]] or a [[caricature]].

Certain stylizations have become fixed conventions in art; an agreement between artist and viewer that is understood and undebatable. A striking example is how in simple cartoon drawings' monochromatic white parts on a dark colored surface are immediately recognized by most viewers to represent the reflection of light on a smooth or wet surface.

In summary, artistic license is:

* Entirely at the artist's discretion
* Intended to be tolerated by the viewer (cf. "willing [[suspension of disbelief]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis, Tracy C. |year=2005 |title=Do you believe in fairies? The hiss of dramatic license |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=57&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Useful for filling in gaps, whether they be factual, compositional, historical or other gaps&lt;ref&gt;Goodsell, David S.; Johnson, Graham T. (2007). "Filling in the Gaps: Artistic License in Education and Outreach". ''PLoS Biol'' '''5''' (12). {{doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.0050308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Used consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally or in tandem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Esaak, Shelley |url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/artspeak_faqs/f/artisticlicense.htm |title=What is artistic license? |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic license==
Artistic license is often referred to as dramatic license when it involves the glamorization of real-world occupations for the sake of exciting television or cinematic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'sa, Benicia |year=2005 |title=Social Studies in the Dark: Using Docudramas to Teach History |journal=The Social Studies |volume=96 |number=1 |pages=9&amp;ndash;13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and other [[police procedural]] programs typically omit completely the more mundane aspects of the occupation such as paperwork, reports, administrative duties and other daily "business-oriented" aspects which in reality often constitute the majority of police work. They will also present other duties with much more action, suspense or drama than would be experienced in reality. The same is also true for many military-oriented adventure stories which often show high-ranking characters being allowed to continuously enter dangerous situations when in reality, they would usually be restricted to command-oriented and administrative duties.

==Controversy and criticism==
Artistic license often provokes [[controversy]] by offending those who resent the reinterpretation of cherished beliefs or previous works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Toplin, Robert Brent |year=2002 |title=Reel history: in defense of Hollywood |publisher=University Press of Kansas |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists often respond to these criticisms by pointing out that their work was not intended to be a [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] portrayal of something previous and should be judged only on [[artistic merit]]. Artistic license is a generally accepted practice, particularly when the result is widely acclaimed. [[William Shakespeare]]'s historical plays, for example, are gross distortions of historical fact but are nevertheless lauded as outstanding literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barroll, J. Leeds |year=1975 |title=Shakespeare Studies: An Annual Gathering of Research, Criticism, Reviews |publisher=Ayer Publishing |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical voices are sometimes raised when artistic license is applied to cinematic and other depictions of real historical events. While slight manipulation for dramatic effect of chronology and character traits are generally accepted, some critics feel that depictions that present a significantly altered reality are irresponsible, particularly because many viewers and readers do not know the actual events and may thus take the dramatized depiction to be true to reality. Examples of films and television series criticized for excessive use of dramatic license include Disney's ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', Oliver Stone's ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', the HBO series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', 20th Century Fox's ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'' and Showtime's ''[[The Tudors]]''. 

Writers adapting a work for another medium (e.g., a film screenplay from a book) often make significant changes, additions to, or omissions from the original plot in the book, on the grounds that these changes were necessary to make a good film.&lt;ref&gt;''Film review'' (1999). Issues 14-16. Orpheus Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are sometimes to the dismay of fans of the original work.

'''Arts and letters''' is a traditional term for the [[fine arts]] and [[literature]] considered together. The category defined as "arts and letters" may also include the [[performing arts]], [[visual arts]], or [[liberal arts]].

==History==
By the late 19th century the term was used to name a few arts-related institutions in the [[United States]]. A [[subscription]]-based Theatre of Arts and Letters opened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1892, but closed within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last =Atherton | first =Gertrude | authorlink =Gertrude Atherton
 | title =The Theatre of Arts and Letters
 | journal =The Californian
 | volume = 5 | issue = 4
 | pages = 580–585
 | date = March 1893
 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g2gCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA580
 | accessdate = 11 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
| last=Hatlen | first=Theodore

| date=May 1963
| pages=136–142
| jstor=3204417
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] was founded in 1904.

The term has also figured in [[higher education]]. For example, by 1889 students at [[Swarthmore College]] were sorted into two categories of study: "Arts and Letters" or "Science and Engineering."&lt;ref&gt;''Twenty-first Annual Catalogue of Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa., 1889-90''. Philadelphia: Press of Friends' Book Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, course requirements at the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences have included a "sector" (category) called "Arts and Letters." The college defines the sector as including "visual arts, literature and music, together with the criticism surrounding them."&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences, ''The College Curriculum''  http://www.college.upenn.edu/curriculum/2010/sectors.php, accessed 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of the arts can be broadly divided into two types. There is [[academia|academic]] criticism such as that found in scholarly works and specialist journals, then there is criticism of a more journalistic nature (often called 'a [[review]]') which is seen by a wider public through newspapers, television and radio. The academic criticism will be of a more vigorous and analytical nature than the journalistic, the journalistic may even focus on entertaining the reader at the expense of detail about the art under discussion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

'''Carving''' is the act of using [[tool]]s to shape something from a material by scraping away portions of that material. The technique can be applied to any material that is solid enough to hold a form even when pieces have been removed from it, and yet soft enough for portions to be scraped away with available tools. Carving, as a means for making [[sculpture]], is distinct from methods using soft and malleable materials like [[clay]], [[fruit]], and melted [[glass]], which may be shaped into the desired forms while soft and then harden into that form. Carving tends to require much more work than methods using malleable materials.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Marcus Mendelowitz, ''Children Are Artists: An Introduction to Children's Art for Teachers and Parents'' (1953), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinds of carving include:
* [[Bone carving]]
* [[Chip carving]]
* [[Fruit carving]]
* Gourd carving or [[gourd art]]
* Ice carving or [[ice sculpture]]
* [[Ivory carving]]
* [[Stone carving]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14318">'''Cheriyal Scroll Painting''' is a stylized version of [[Nakashi art]], rich in the local motifs peculiar to the [[Telangana]]. They are at present made only in [[Hyderabad]], [[Telangana]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff Reporter|title=Sankranthi Saahitya Sangeetha Festival|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/17/stories/2007011719050200.htm|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[scroll]]s are painted in a narrative format, much like a film roll or a comic strip, depicting stories from Indian mythology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rajan|first=Anjana|title=Retelling the Ramayana|url=http://www.hindu.com/ms/2008/12/16/stories/2008121650010100.htm|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and intimately tied to the shorter stories from the Puranas and Epics. Earlier, these paintings were prevalent across Andhra, as also various other parts of the country, albeit flavoured with their distinct styles and other local peculiarities dictated by the local customs and traditions. In the same way, [[Cheriyal]] scrolls must have been popular across [[Telangana]] in earlier times, though with the advent of television, cinemas and computers it has been fenced into its last outpost, the [[Cheriyal]] town.

[[File:Cherial 1.jpg|thumbnail|A contemporary Cheriyal Scroll painting]]

==History==
Scroll paintings have a rich history and play an important role in the Asian artistic tradition. In China, scroll paintings were part of the sophisticated traditions of the nobility and the courts. In India however, the scroll painting was the prerogative of the itinerant bard and the village artist, in essence a folk tradition of the villages.

In India, each region and village developed its own scroll painting traditions, marked by characteristic content, form and technique depending on the local ethos, patronage and socio-economic conditions. Rajasthan is known for its ''Pabuji ki Pad'', ''Devenarayana katha'' as also stories from the legend of ''Dhola and Maru''. Goa evolved the ''Dasavathara'', as Maharashtra did ''Pinguli'' and the ''Chitra Katha'' traditions. Maharashtra and Gujarat are also known for a sophisticated scroll painting tradition called the ''Prasasti Patra''. Orissa and Bengal are famous for their ''Patachitra'' traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Scroll Paintings of Bengal: Art in the Village By Amitabh Sengupta published by AuthorHouse&lt;/ref&gt;

While the above-mentioned traditions could have significantly influenced the Cheriyal scroll paintings and artists, the [[Cheriyal]] paintings were and continue to be a distinctly local invention, peculiar to the [[Telangana]] region, drawing mainly on local traditions. It can safely be said that the local temple art traditions and the [[Kalamkari]] tradition across [[Telangana]] in particular, and the graphic art traditions of the Deccan and South India in general were the major influences that shaped and guided the art of scroll paintings. However, it should also be remembered that the sphere of activity, subject and artistic idiom of every scroll painting including that of Cheriyal is peculiar and confined to the village or habitment.

To quote from A. L. Dallaiccola's South Indian Paintings- A catalogue of the British Museum collection - ''Although in the past the majority of Indian people might have been illiterate, they were not uneducated. They were taught the principles ruling their religious and social life through the recitation of stories drawn from the epics, the puranas and other religious texts... In the past, the retelling of these stories provided the education of the unlettered, and the discourses were accompanied by visual aids: scrolls, painted cloth hangings, sets of paintings, and wooden boxes with folding, concertina-like doors painted with scenes from the 'career' of a deity, such as the portable shrine from [[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] that is now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]... The earliest known reference to the picture showmen is found in [[Patanjali]]'s ''Mahabhashya'' (2nd century BC). Commenting on the passage on the historic present in [[A. R. Raja Raja Varma|Panini]]'s grammar, the ''Ashtadhyayi'' (c. 5th century BC), [[Patanjali]] takes as an example some picture showmen who are discussing the killing of Kamsa at the hands of Krishna... There is also a specific mention of a picture showing Kamsa being dragged by the hair and beaten by Krishna. Numerous references to picture showmen and painted scrolls occur in literary sources. The scrolls showing the torments of hell, ''yamapattaka'', seem to have been particularly popular.''&lt;ref name="MuseumDallapiccola2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=British Museum|author2=Anna Libera Dallapiccola|title=South Indian Paintings: A Catalogue of the British Museum Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIzWapiacQcC&amp;pg=PA78|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-7141-2424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandhets were the itinerant bards and performers of Andhra Pradesh while the Nakashis were the artists. The Nakashis of [[Telangana]] also made dolls, much like the [[Kinnal]] dolls of Karnataka, in addition to the painted scrolls. These scrolls were a very important part of the sociological and cultural setting of [[Telangana]]. As these paintings are now confined to [[Cheriyal]] village, they are called [[Cheriyal]] scrolls. In earlier times, the scrolls were a colourful backdrop to the equally interesting oral traditions of the common people, - the village hajjam-barber, toddy tapper, dhobhi-washerman, chamar-leatherworker, fisherman, weaver and farmer: (''Madiga, Goud, Mudiraju, Malas, Padmashali, Chakala and Mangali''&lt;ref&gt;Folk Painting Traditions of India by Sarita Chauhan Booklet series - 52 published by Institute for Social Democracy http://www.isd.net.in/Publication/Booklet/2012/Booklet_52.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) the seven working and marginalised castes and communities of the village. The scrolls set out the adventures and exploits of local folk heroes who performed on the fringes of the epics, Puranas, etc. of the Hindu 'Greater Tradition'. Each community had its peculiarities and its favourite heroes and heroines as also selection of stories from local Mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://jigyasa0.tripod.com/folk.html Jagdish and Kamla Mittal Museum of Indian Art&lt;/ref&gt; It was also customary to sacrifice a goat after the recitation of the story from the scroll in some communities.

==Present times==
At present, Cheriyal painting work is continuing  by
the families of D. Vaikuntam, D.Nageshar, D.Venkataramana,
D.Pavan Kumar.
Dhanalokota Vaikuntam started learning work
from his father Venkataramiah and elder brother Chandraiah at
the age of 12. He studied intermediate and at present he is
living at Hyderabad. He got married with vanaja at the age of
20. After the marriage with Vaikuntam, vanaja also started
doing Cherial painting. He trained to his children Sarika,
Rakesh and Vinay Kumar. He received many awards and
certificates for his excellency in Cherial painting.

Today the long stories from the local mythologies have been cut short, as the traditional patrons for the long scrolls no longer exist. The artists have been forced to adapt and nowadays they paint smaller versions of the scrolls, depicting a single episode or character from the traditional stories. These are amenable to framing and can be hung on walls in modern homes. Further, the colours are no longer prepared in the traditional manner. While earlier, they used natural white extracted from sea shells, black from lampsoot and yellow from turmeric. However, the traditional art continues to linger and survive and even has been a source of inspiration to contemporary artists like Laxman Aelay&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/2013-10-06/Painting-a-new--narrative-73269&lt;/ref&gt; of Kadirengudam village of Andhra Pradesh.

==The Tradition==
[[File:Cherial 5.jpg|thumbnail|left|Contemporary Cheriyal Dolls]]
The traditional art form became an inseparable part of the profession of the story-telling, balladeer community known as ''Kaki Padagollu''. They displayed the scrolls and accompanied by music and dance went from village to village narrating and singing their ballads based from their rich folklore which was rooted in the [[Puranas]] and Indian Epics, enlivening many a lazy village evening.

In a typical recitation, the storyteller-balladeer would  wander from village to village in a team of usually five people, with two to narrate the story while the others would provide a simple but hectic musical accompaniment with the harmonium, tabala and castanets. The stage would also be a simple affair (many times even to the extent of being a rough and ready fixture), erected on four poles with a horizontal bar on which the scrolls could be displayed.
 
[[File:Cheriyal painting - toddy tappers.jpg|thumb|A traditional Cheriyal scroll painting depicting the legends of the toddy tapper community. Circa 18th - 19th century.]]

The scroll would flow like a film roll. It was generally about 
three feet in width and went up to 40 – 45 feet in length, depending upon the story. The traditional scrolls are normally in vertical format, illustrating stories in a series of horizontal panels. A floral border in the middle separates the two panels, while the linear narrative is demonstrated by holding in both hands or suspending it from a tree or a building and continually rolling it. Like large sized comic strips, each panel of the scroll depicted one part of the story. Hence, a scroll would easily have around 50 panels. As the bard would narrate the story, the panel depicting that particular part of the story would be displayed. The choice of episodes and iconography of each deity was painted, keeping in mind the caste for which the scroll was made.

[[File:Cherial 3.jpg|thumbnail|left|A modern Cheriyal painting in making]]

By virtue of its distinct traditional style and characteristics [[Cheriyal]] Paintings were recently given a Geographical Indications (GI) tag. There are very few artists remaining who continue to paint using this unique technique. A recent innovation has been the painting of single pictures (as opposed to a continuous scroll) meant for wall decorations.

== Process ==
The making of the canvas is a very elaborate procedure. The [[Khadi]] cotton is treated with a mixture of starch (from rice), suddha matti (white mud), a paste of boiled tamarind seeds and gum water thrice. It has to be ensured that every coating is thoroughly dried before the next one is applied.
Once the canvas is ready, the artists sketch the outline directly onto the canvas using a brush. The outlines are very well defined and sharply reflecting the quality and experience of the craftsman.
The colors are made by the artists from natural sources. Brushes are made with hair of squirrels tied to a stick.
Dolls and masks are made of wood, saw dust and tamarind paste. Masks are made even with coconut shells.

[[File:Cherial 4.jpg|thumbnail|Contemporary Cheriyal Dolls]]

== Characteristics ==
Cheriyal Paintings can be easily recognised by the following peculiarities and unique characteristics:

• Painted in vivid hues, mostly primary colors, with a predominance of red in the background, the paintings are characterised by the unbridled imagination of the local artisans who were not constrained by the academic rigour that characterised the more classical [[Tanjore painting]] and [[Mysore painting]]. For example, the artist hardly bothers about perspective in Cheriyal paintings and sets out the narrative by placing the relevant figures in appropriate order and position in the relevant background. The iconography of even the major deities like Shiva, Vishnu, etc. has a strong local idiom.

•The subjects of these scroll paintings are easy to relate to – as the themes and stories are familiar – drawn from ancient literary, mythological and folk traditions. The common themes are from the Krishna Leela, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Shiva Puranam, Markandeya Puranam interspersed with the ballads and folk-stories of communities like Gauda, Madiga and so on.

• The main narrative is spiced up with scenes from simple rural life - Women doing chores in the kitchen, men working in the paddy fields or boozing away in merry abandon, festival scenes, etc. are endearingly depicted.

• The costumes and settings in which the figures are depicted are typical and  reflect the culture of Andhra, where these paintings originated.

• Within the narrow panels, proportion is created by depicting trees, or a building, a pillar with drawn curtains, etc. However more often than not, the proportion of individual characters is determined by their relative importance in that particular scene, with the most important character being the largest and most detailed and the lesser characters being smaller and less detailed.

==GI rights==
Cheriyal scroll painting received  Intellectual Property Rights Protection or [[Geographical Indication]] (GI) status in 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59973">'''Indian art''' consists of a variety of art forms, including plastic arts (e.g., [[pottery]], [[sculpture in the Indian subcontinent|sculpture]]), [[visual arts]] (e.g., [[Indian painting|paintings]]), performing arts and [[textile arts]] (e.g. [[Silk in the Indian subcontinent#Origin|woven silk]]). Geographically, it spans the entire [[Indian subcontinent]], including what is now [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]] and eastern [[Afghanistan]]. A strong sense of design is characteristic of Indian art and can be observed in its modern and traditional forms.

The origin of Indian art can be traced to [[Prehistoric Sweden|pre-historic]] settlements in the 3rd millennium BC. On its way to modern times, Indian art has had cultural influences, as well as religious influences such as [[Hindu art|Hinduism]], [[Buddhist art|Buddhism]], [[Jain art|Jainism]], [[Sikh art and culture|Sikhism]] and [[Islam in India#Indo-Islamic art and architecture|Islam]]. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups.

In historic art, sculpture in stone and metal, mainly religious, has survived the Indian climate better than other media and provides most of the best remains. Many of the most important ancient finds that are not in carved stone come from the surrounding, drier regions rather than India itself. [[Indian funeral]] and philosophic traditions exclude [[grave goods]], which is the main source of ancient art in other cultures.

====Indus Valley Civilization ({{circa|lk=no|5000 BCE|1500 BCE}})====
{{main|Indus Valley Civilization}}
Despite its widespread and sophistication, the Indus Valley civilization seems to have taken no interest in public large-scale art, unlike many other early civilizations. A number of gold, [[terracotta]] and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some forms of [[dance]]. Additionally, the terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultist significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols.&lt;ref name=" Keay, John 2000"&gt;Keay, John, India, a History.  New York: Grove Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous piece is the bronze ''Dancing Girl'' of [[Mohenjo-Daro]], which shows remarkably advanced modelling of the human figure for this early date.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Seals have been found at Mohenjo-Daro depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a [[yoga]]-like pose. This figure, sometimes known as a ''Pashupati'', has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Sir John. Mohenjo-Daro and the Indus Civilisation, 3 vols, London: Arthur Probsthain, 1931&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the Indus Valley Civilization, there is a surprising absence of art of any great degree of sophistication until the Buddhist era.  It is thought that this partly reflects the use of perishable organic materials such as wood.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mauryan art ({{circa|lk=no|322 BCE|185 BCE}})====
{{main|Mauryan art}}
[[File:Pataliputra capital front.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pataliputra capital]], an early example of Mauryan stone sculpture, displaying [[Persian art|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] influences.]]
[[File:Ashoka pillar at Vaishali, Bihar, India 2007-01-29.jpg|thumb|right|200 PX|Single Lion capital at [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]].]]
The north Indian [[Maurya Empire]] flourished from 322 BCE to 185 BCE, and at its maximum extent controlled all of the sub-continent except the extreme south as well as influences from [[Ancient Persia|Indian ancient traditions, and Ancient Persia]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22-28&lt;/ref&gt; as shown by the [[Pataliputra capital]].

The emperor [[Ashoka]], who died in 232 BCE, adopted [[Buddhism]] about half-way through his 40-year reign, and patronized several large [[stupa]]s at key sites from the life of the [[Buddha]], although very little decoration from the Mauryan period survives, and there may not have been much in the first place.  There is more from various early sites of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]]. The most famous survivals are the large animals surmounting several of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], which showed a confident and boldly mature style and craft and first of its kind iron casting without rust until date, which was in use by vedic people in rural areas of the country, though we have very few remains showing its development.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22-26&lt;/ref&gt; The famous detached [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]], with four animals, was adopted as the official [[Emblem of India]] after [[Partition of India|Indian independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=9 State Emblem] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511134823/http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=9 |date=May 11, 2012 }}, Know India india.gov.in&lt;/ref&gt; Many small popular [[terracotta]] figurines are recovered in archaeology, in a range of often vigorous if somewhat crude styles.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 39-42&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhist art ({{circa|lk=no|1 CE|500 CE}})====
{{See also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Karla caves Chaitya.jpg|thumb|A monumental rock-cut cave, the Great Chaitya at [[Karla caves]], built circa 120 CE.]]
The major survivals of Buddhist art begin in the period after the Mauryans, from which good quantities of sculpture survives after many Hindu, buddhist and jain temples destroyed by mughal rulers time to time. some key sites such as [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]] and [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]], some of which remain ''in situ'', with others in museums in India or around the world. Stupas were surrounded by ceremonial fences with four profusely carved [[torana]]s or ornamental gateways facing the cardinal directions. These are in stone, though clearly adopting forms developed in wood. They and the walls of the stupa itself can be heavily decorated with reliefs, mostly illustrating the lives of the Buddha. Gradually life-size figures were sculpted, initially in deep relief, but then free-standing.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 105-117, 26-47&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Mathura]] was the most important centre in this development, which applied to Hindu and Jain art as well as Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 59-70&lt;/ref&gt;  The facades and interiors of rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' prayer halls and monastic ''[[vihara]]s'' have survived better than similar free-standing structures elsewhere, which were for long mostly in wood. The caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Karla Caves|Karle]], [[Bhaja Caves|Bhaja]] and elsewhere contain early sculpture, often outnumbered by later works such as iconic figures of the Buddha and [[bodhisattva]]s, which are not found before 100 CE at the least.

Buddhism developed an increasing emphasis on statues of the Buddha, which was greatly influenced by Hindu and Jain religious figurative art, The figures of this period which were also influenced by the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the centuries after the defeat of [[Alexander the Great]].  This fusion developed in the far north-west of India, especially [[Gandhara]] in modern [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 105-117, 71-84 on Gandhara&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian [[Kushan Empire]] spread from [[Central Asia]] to include northern India in the early centuries CE, and briefly commissioned large statues that were portraits of the royal dynasty, [[Mughal miniature]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 68-70 (but see p. 253 for another exception)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 BCE - 72 BCE) =====
''Main article:'' [[Shunga Empire]]

With the fall of the Maurya Empire, control of India was returned to the older custom of regional dynasties, one of the most significant of which was the Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 BCE - 72 BCE) of central India. During this period, as well as during the Satavahana Dynasty which occurred concurrently with the Shunga Dynasty in south India, some of the most significant early Buddhist architecture was created. Arguably, the most significant architecture of this dynasty is the stupa, a religious monument which usually holds a sacred relic of Buddhism. These relics were often, but not always, in some way directly connected to the Buddha. Due to the fact that these stupas contained remains of the Buddha himself, each stupa was venerated as being an extension of the Buddha's body, his enlightenment, and of his achievement of nirvana. The way in which Buddhists venerate the stupa is by walking around it in a clockwise manner.   

One of the most notable examples of the Buddhist stupa from the Shunga Dynasty is The Great Stupa at Sanchi, which was thought to be founded by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka c. 273 BCE - 232 BCE during the Maurya Empire.     

===== [[Satavahana dynasty]] (c. 1st/3rd century BCE  – c. 3rd century CE) =====
Satavahana dynasty was originally under the rule in central India, and after 1st century CE, in the south region. During Satavahana dynasty, a great number of significant Buddhist artworks were produced during this period. [[Stupa|Stupas]] and temples are the most typical Buddhist architectures in this period. Stupas are religious monuments built on burial mounds, which contain relics beneath a solid dome. Stupas in different areas of India may vary in structure, size, and design; however, their representational meanings are quite similar. They are designed based on [[mandala]], a graph of cosmos specific to Buddhism. A traditional stupa has a railing that provides a sacred path for Buddhist followers to practice devotional [[circumambulation]] in ritual settings. 

===== Kushan Empire (c. 30 CE - c. 375 CE) =====
''Main article: [[Kushan Empire]]''

Officially established by [[Kujula Kadphises]], the first Kushan emperor who united the [[Yuezhi]] tribes, Kushan empire was a syncretic empire in central Asia. In this period, the depictions of Buddha himself first appeared in art.

====Gupta art ({{circa|lk=no|320 CE|550 CE}})====
{{main|Gupta_Empire#Art}}
The Gupta period is generally regarded as a classic peak of north Indian art for all the major religious groups. Although painting was evidently widespread, the surviving works are almost all religious sculpture. The period saw the emergence of the iconic carved stone deity in Hindu art, as well as the Buddha-figure and [[Jain]] ''[[tirthankara]]'' figures, these last often on a very large scale.  The two great centers of sculpture were [[Mathura]] and [[Gandhara]], the latter the center of [[Greco-Buddhist art]].

Although the Gupta period marked the "golden age" of classical Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hinduism: Past and Present|last = Michaels|first = Axel|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-691-08953-9|location = |pages = 40|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PD-flQMc1ocC&amp;pg=PR4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the early architectural style of Hindu temples were sophisticated and scientific in nature, consisting large courtyards, garbh grah, siting area, prayer area a large complex and well planned architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1062933|title = A Fitting Approach to God: On Entering the Western Temples at Khajurāho|last = Alles|first = Gregory D.|date = November 1993|journal = History of Religions|doi = 10.1086/463362|pmid = |volume = 33|issue = 2|pages = 161–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in stark contrast to the complex plans with multiple ''shikaras'' (towers) and ''mandapas'' (halls) of various utility as stated in veda outlining building of temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://www.academia.edu/2408684|title = The Representation of Women in the Erotic Sculptures of Khajuraho|date = 29 December 2012|accessdate = 8 November 2014|website = academia.edu|publisher = School of Arts and Aesthetics, Jawaharlal Nehru University|last = Saini|first = Shilpi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Modern and Colonial Era ({{circa|lk=no|1400 CE|1800 CE}}){{Anchor|EarlyModernAndColonialEra}}===

==== Mughal art ====
{{Main|Mughal painting}}
Although [[Islam in India|Islamic footholds in India]] were made as early as the first half of the 10th century, it wasn't until the [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal Empire]] that one observes emperors with a patronage for the fine arts. [[Humayun|Emperor Humayun]], during his reestablishment of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1555, brought with him [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] and [[Abd al-Samad]], two of the finest painters from [[Tahmasp I|Persian Shah Tahmasp]]'s renowned atelier.

During the reign of [[Akbar]] (1556—1605), the number of painters grew from around 30 during the creation of the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' in the mid-1560s, to around 130 by the mid 1590s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Journal|title = Scribal Notes on Mughal Manuscript Illustrations|last = Seyller|first = John|date = 1987|journal = Artibus Asiae|doi = |pmid = |volume = 48|issue = 3/4|pages = 247–277|jstor = 3249873}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court historian [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazal]], Akbar was hands-on in his interest of the arts, inspecting his painters regularly and rewarding the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ain-i Akbari|last = Fazl|first = Abu'l|publisher = Asiatic Society of Bengal|year = 1927|isbn = |location = |pages = |others = Translated by H Blochmann.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is during this time that Persian artists were attracted to bringing their unique style to the empire. Indian elements were present in their works from the beginning, with the incorporation of local Indian flora and fauna that were otherwise absent from the traditional Persian style. The paintings of this time reflected the vibrancy and inclusion of Akbar's kingdom, with production of [[Persian miniature]]s, the [[Rajput painting]]s (including the [[Kangra painting|Kangra school]]) and the [[Pahari painting|Pahari style]] of Northern India. They also influenced the [[Company style]] watercolor paintings created during the British rule many years later.{{Gallery

With the death of Akbar, his son [[Jahangir]] (1605–1627) took the throne. He preferred each painter work on a single piece rather than the collaboration fostered during Akbar's time. This period marks the emergence of distinct individual styles, notably [[Bishandas|Bishan Das]], [[Manohar Das]], [[Abu al-Hasan (Mughal painter)|Abu al-Hasan]], [[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]], and Daulat.&lt;ref name="daulat"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Daulat |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152389/Daulat |accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Razmnama]]'' (Persian translation of the Hindu epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'') and an illustrated memoir of Jahangir, named ''Tuzuk-i Jahangiri'', were created under his rule. Jahangir was succeeded by [[Shah Jahan]] (1628–1658), whose most notable architectural contribution is the [[Taj Mahal]]. Paintings under his rule were more formal, featuring court scenes, in contrast to the personal styles from his predecessor's time. [[Aurangzeb]] (1658–1707), who held increasingly orthodox Sunni beliefs, forcibly took the throne from his father Shah Jahan. With a ban of music and painting in 1680, his reign saw the decline of Mughal patronage of the arts.

==== Other medieval Indian Kingdoms ====
[[Mughal painting|Mughal art]] influenced the [[Rajput painting|Rajput]], [[Pahari painting|Pahari]], [[Deccan painting|Deccan]], [[Kangra painting|Kangra]] and various other local styles of art. 

In South-Central India, during the late fifteenth century after the Middle kingdoms, the [[Bahmani sultanate]] disintegrated into the [[Deccan sultanates]] centered at [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], [[Golconda Sultanate|Golconda]], [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmadnagar]], [[Barid Shahi Dynasty|Bidar]], and [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]]. They used vedic techniques of metal casting, stone carving, and painting, as well as a distinctive architectural style with the addition of citadels and tombs from Mughal architecture. For instance, the Baridi dynasty (1504–1619) of Bidar saw the invention of [[Bidriware|''bidri'' ware]], which was adopted from Vedic and Maurya period ashoka pillars of zinc mixed with copper, tin, and lead and inlaid with silver or brass, then covered with a mud paste containing sal ammoniac, which turned the base metal black, highlighting the color and sheen of the inlaid metal. Only after the Mughal conquest of Ahmadnagar in 1600 did the Persian influence patronized by the Turco-Mongol Mughals begin to affect Deccan art.

====British period (1841–1947)====
British colonial rule had a great impact on Indian art. Old patrons of art became less wealthy and influential, and Western art more ubiquitous as the British Empire established schools of art in major cities, e.g. the [[Bombay Art Society]] in 1888. The [[Company style]] of paintings became common, created by Indian artists working for European patrons of the [[East India Company]]. The style was mainly [[Romanticism|Romanticized]], with watercolor the primary medium used to convey soft textures and tones.&lt;ref name="MichellLampert1982"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Michell|author2=Catherine Lampert|author3=Tristram Holland|title=In the Image of Man: The Indian Perception of the Universe Through 2000 Years of Painting and Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evtIAQAAIAAJ|year=1982|publisher=Alpine Fine Arts Collection|isbn=978-0-933516-52-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[Government of India Act 1858|1858]], the British government took over the task of administration of India under the [[British Raj]].

With the [[Swadeshi Movement]] gaining momentum by 1905, Indian artists attempted to resuscitate the cultural identities suppressed by the British, rejecting the Romanticized style of the Company paintings and the mannered work of Raja Ravi Varma and his followers. Thus was created what is known today as the [[Bengal School of Art]], led by the reworked Asian styles (with an emphasis on Indian nationalism) of [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871—1951), who has been referred to as the father of Modern Indian art.&lt;ref name="India2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hachette India|title=Indiapedia: The All-India Factfinder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCEYAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT130|date=25 October 2013|publisher=Hachette India|isbn=978-93-5009-766-3|pages=130–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists of the Tagore family, such as [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (1861–1941) and [[Gaganendranath Tagore]] (1867–1938) as well as new artists of the early 20th century such as [[Amrita Sher-Gil]] (1913–1941) were responsible for introducing [[Avant-garde]] western styles into Indian Art. Many other artists like [[Jamini Roy]] and later [[S.H. Raza]] took inspiration from [[folk traditions]]. In 1944, [[K.C.S. Paniker]] founded the Progressive Painters' Association (PPA) thus giving rise to the "madras movement" in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=For art's sake  |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/02/12/stories/2009021251330400.htm |date= February 12, 2009|publisher= [[The Hindu]]|page=|accessdate=Nov 23, 2014|newspaper=The Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, India became independent of British rule. A group of six artists - [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza]] - founded the [[Progressive Artists' Group|Bombay Progressive Artists' Group]] in the year 1952, to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, [[Manishi Dey]], V. S. Gaitonde, [[Krishen Khanna]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[K. G. Subramanyan]], [[A. Ramachandran]], [[Devender Singh]], Akbar Padamsee, [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], Himmat Shah and [[Manjit Bawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-pag.asp |title=Showcase – Artists Collectives |publisher=National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2014-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day Indian art is varied as it had been never before.  Among the best-known artists of the newer generation include [[Bose Krishnamachari]] and [[Bikash Bhattacharya]]. Another prominent Pakistani modernist was [[Ismail Gulgee]], who after about 1960 adopted an abstract idiom that combines aspects of [[Islamic calligraphy]] with an [[abstract expressionist]] (or [[gestural abstraction]]ist) sensibility.

Painting and sculpture remained important in the later half of the twentieth century, though in the work of leading artists such as [[Nalini Malani]], [[Subodh Gupta]], [[Narayanan Ramachandran]], [[Vivan Sundaram]], [[Jitish Kallat]], they often found radical new directions. Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila painting in most contemporary way and created her own style through the exercises of her own imagination, they appear fresh and unusual.

The increase in discourse about Indian art, in English as well as vernacular Indian languages, changed the way art was perceived in the art schools. Critical approach became rigorous; critics like [[Geeta Kapur]], [[R. Siva Kumar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/benodebehari_late.asp | title=National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asiasociety.org/arts/asia-society-museum/past-exhibitions/rabindranath-tagore-last-harvest | title=Rabindranath Tagore: The Last Harvest}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Shivaji K. Panikkar]], [[Ranjit Hoskote]], amongst others, contributed to re-thinking contemporary art practice in India.

===Contextual Modernism===
{{main|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}

The year 1997 bore witness to two parallel gestures of canon formation. On the one hand, the influential Baroda Group, a coalition whose original members included [[Vivan Sundaram]], [[Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh]], [[Bhupen Khakhar]], and [[Nalini Malani]]—and which had left its mark on history in the form of the 1981 exhibition “Place for People”—was definitively historicized in 1997 with the publication of Contemporary Art in Baroda, an anthology of essays edited by Sheikh. On the other hand, the art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s benchmark exhibition and related publication, A [[Contextual Modernism]], restored the [[Santiniketan]] artists—[[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]—to their proper place as the originators of an indigenously achieved yet transcultural modernism in the 1930s, well before the Progressives composed their manifesto in the late 1940s. Of the Santiniketan artists, Siva Kumar observed that they “reviewed traditional antecedents in relation to the new avenues opened up by cross-cultural contacts. They also saw it as a historical imperative. Cultural insularity, they realized, had to give way to eclecticism and cultural impurity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/publications/AbbyGreyAndIndianModernism_GreyNYU_20150116.pdf | title=Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Professor R. Siva Kumar.jpg|thumb|art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]]]
The idea of [[Contextual Modernism]] emerged in 1997 from [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]] as a [[postcolonial]] critical tool in the understanding of an alternative [[modernism]] in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists.

Several terms including [[Paul Gilroy]]'s ''counter culture of modernity'' and [[Tani Barlow]]'s ''Colonial modernity'' have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that 'Contextual Modernism' is a more suited term because “the colonial in ''colonial modernity'' does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan's artist teachers' refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming-polarized-modernities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[R. Siva Kumar]] "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/ | title=Humanities underground » All the Shared Experiences of the Lived World II}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. ''This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice''.&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"/&gt;

''Contextual Modernism'' in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in [[Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711 | title="Contextual modernism" – is it possible?

==Material history of Indian art==
===Sculpture===
{{main|sculpture in the Indian subcontinent}}
[[File:Nataraja01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chola art|Chola bronze]] statue of ''Nataraja'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City]]
The first known sculpture in the Indian subcontinent is from the [[Indus Valley civilization]] (3300–1700 BC), found in sites at [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]] in modern-day [[Pakistan]]. These include the famous small bronze male dancer. However such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted.  After the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization there is little record of sculpture until the Buddhist era, apart from a hoard of copper figures of (somewhat controversially) c. 1500 BCE from [[Daimabad]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the great tradition of Indian monumental sculpture in stone appears to begin relatively late, with the reign of [[Ashoka]] from 270 to 232 BCE, and the [[Pillars of Ashoka]] he erected around India, carrying his edicts and topped by famous sculptures of animals, mostly lions, of which six survive.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;  Large amounts of figurative sculpture, mostly in relief, survive from Early Buddhist pilgrimage stupas, above all [[Sanchi]]; these probably developed out of a tradition using wood.&lt;ref name="Harle, 26–38"&gt;Harle, 26–38&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, wood continued to be the main sculptural and architectural medium in [[Kerala]] throughout all historic periods until recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 342-350&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern [[India]], in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]] from what is now southern [[Afghanistan]] and northern [[Pakistan]], sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because [[Gandhara]]n Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Persia]]n artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.

The pink sandstone Hindu, [[Jain]] and Buddhist sculptures of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE reflected both native Indian traditions and the Western influences received through the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and effectively established the basis for subsequent Indian religious sculpture.&lt;ref name="Harle, 26–38"/&gt; The style was developed and diffused through most of India under the [[Gupta Empire]] (c. 320-550) which remains a "classical" period for Indian sculpture, covering the earlier [[Ellora Caves]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 87; his Part 2 covers the period&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[Elephanta Caves]] are probably slightly later.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 124&lt;/ref&gt;  Later large scale sculpture remains almost exclusively religious, and generally rather conservative, often reverting to simple frontal standing poses for deities, though the attendant spirits such as apsaras and [[yakshi]] often have sensuously curving poses.  Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief.  The celebrated [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax]] bronzes of the [[Chola]] dynasty (c. 850–1250) from [[south India]], many designed to be carried in processions, include the iconic form of [[Shiva]] as [[Nataraja]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 301-310, 325-327&lt;/ref&gt; with the massive granite carvings of [[Mahabalipuram]] dating from the previous [[Pallava]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 276–284&lt;/ref&gt;
The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra. ''et al.'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the existing specimens in the various [[museums]] of the world and in the temples of South India may be seen many fine figures of Siva in various forms, [[Vishnu]] and his wife [[Lakshmi]], Siva saints and many more.&lt;ref name="tri479"&gt;Tri. ''[Title needed]''. p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wall painting===
[[File:Ajanta Padmapani.jpg|thumb|Fresco from the [[Ajanta Caves]], c. 450-500]]
{{details|Cave paintings in India}}

The tradition and methods of Indian cliff painting gradually evolved throughout many thousands of years - there are multiple locations found with prehistoric art. The early caves included overhanging rock decorated with [[Petroglyph|rock-cut art]] and the use of natural caves during the [[Mesolithic]] period (6000 BCE). Their use has continued in some areas into historic times.&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2006-10-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]] are on the edge of the [[Deccan Plateau]] where deep erosion has left huge [[sandstone]] outcrops. The many caves and [[grotto]]s found there contain primitive [[tool]]s and decorative rock paintings that reflect the ancient tradition of human interaction with their landscape, an interaction that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving frescoes of the historical period have been preserved in the [[Ajanta Caves]] with Cave 10 having some from the 1st century CE, though the larger and more famous groups are from the 5th century. Despite climatic conditions that tend to work against the survival of older paintings, in total there are known more than 20 locations in India with paintings and traces of former paintings of ancient and early medieval times (up to the 8th to 10th centuries CE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Best/As/IndMedCavePaint.htm |title=Ancient and medieval Indian cave paintings - Internet encyclopedia |accessdate=2010-06-04 |date=2010-06-10 |work=Wondermondo }}&lt;/ref&gt; although these are just a tiny fraction of what would have once existed. The most significant frescoes of the ancient and early medieval period are found in the Ajanta, [[Bagh Caves|Bagh]], [[Ellora]], and [[Sittanavasal Cave|Sittanavasal]] caves, the last being [[Jain]] of the 7th-10th centuries. Although many show evidence of being by artists mainly used to decorating palaces, no early secular wall-paintings survive.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 355&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1561-Akbar riding the elephant Hawa'I pursuing another elephant across a collapsing bridge of boats (right).jpg|right|thumb|[[Akbar]] riding the elephant Hawa'I pursuing another elephant]]

The [[Chola]] fresco paintings were discovered in 1931 within the circumambulatory passage of the [[Brihadisvara Temple]] at [[Thanjavur]], [[Tamil Nadu]], and are the first Chola specimens discovered. Researchers have discovered the technique used in these frescoes. A smooth batter of limestone mixture is applied over the stones, which took two to three days to set. Within that short span, such large paintings were painted with natural organic pigments. During the [[Thanjavur Nayak|Nayak]] period the Chola paintings were painted over. The Chola frescoes lying underneath have an ardent spirit of [[saivism]] is expressed in them. They probably synchronised with the completion of the temple by Rajaraja Cholan the Great.

[[Kerala mural painting]] has well-preserved [[fresco]] or [[mural]] or [[wall painting]] in temple walls in Pundarikapuram, [[Ettumanoor]] and [[Aymanam]] and elsewhere.

===Miniature painting===
Although few Indian miniatures survive from before about 1000 CE, and some from the next few centuries, there was probably a considerable tradition. Those that survive are initially illustrations for Buddhist texts, later followed by Jain and Hindu equivalents, and the decline of Buddhist as well as the vulnerable support material of the [[palm-leaf manuscript]] probably explain the rarity of early examples.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 361-366&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mughal painting]] in miniatures on paper developed very quickly in the late 16th century from the combined influence of the existing miniature tradition and artists trained in the [[Persian miniature]] tradition imported by the [[Mughal Emperor]]'s court.  New ingredients in the style were much greater realism, especially in portraits, and an interest in animals, plants and other aspects of the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 372-382&lt;/ref&gt;

Miniatures either illustrated books or were single works for [[muraqqa]]s or albums of painting and [[Islamic calligraphy]].  The style gradually spread in the next two centuries to influence painting on paper in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts, developing into a number of regional styles often called "sub-Mughal", including [[Kangra painting]] and [[Rajput painting]], and finally [[Company painting]], a hybrid [[watercolour]] style influenced by European art and largely patronized by the people of the [[British raj]].  From the 19th century Western-style [[easel painting]]s became increasingly painted by Indian artists trained in Government art schools.

===Jewellery===
[[File:Andhra Pradesh Royal earrings 1st Century BCE.jpg|left|thumb|Pair of gold earrings, 1st century BCE, [[Andhra Pradesh]].]]

The [[Indian subcontinent]] has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery-making, with a history of over 5,000 years.&lt;ref name="Untracht, Oppi p15"&gt;Untracht, Oppi. ''Traditional Jewelry of India''. New York: Abrams, 1997 {{ISBN|0-8109-3886-3}}. p15.&lt;/ref&gt; Using jewellery as a [[store of value|store of capital]] remains more common in India than in most modern societies, and gold appears always to have been strongly preferred for the metal. India and the surrounding areas were important sources of high-quality [[gemstone]]s, and the jewellery of the ruling class is typified by using them lavishly. One of the first to start jewellery-making were the people of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].  Early remains are few, as they were not buried with their owners.

===Other materials===
Wood was undoubtedly extremely important, but rarely survives long in the Indian climate. Organic animal materials such as [[ivory]] or bone were discouraged by the [[Dharmic religions]], although Buddhist examples exist, such as the [[Begram ivories]], many of Indian manufacture, but found in [[Afghanistan]], and some relatively modern [[Ivory carved tusk depicting Buddha life stories|carved tusks]]. In Muslim settings they are more common.

==Contextual history of Indian art==
===Temple art===
{{Main|Indian rock-cut architecture}}

Obscurity shrouds the period between the decline of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]] and the definite historic period starting with the [[Maurya]]s, and in the historical period, the earliest Indian religion to inspire major artistic monuments was [[Buddhism]]. Though there may have been earlier structures in wood that have been transformed into stone structures, there are no physical evidences for these except textual references.  Soon after the Buddhists initiated [[Indian rock-cut architecture|rock-cut caves]], [[Hindu]]s and [[Jain]]s started to imitate them at [[Badami]], [[Aihole]], [[Ellora]], [[Salsette]], [[Elephanta Caves|Elephanta]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] and [[Mamallapuram]] and [[Mughals]]. It appears to be a constant in Indian art that the different religions shared a very similar artistic style at any particular period and place, though naturally adapting the [[iconography]] to match the religion commissioning them.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 59&lt;/ref&gt;  Probably the same groups of artists worked for the different religions regardless of their own affiliations.

[[File:Statuetta indiana di Lakshmi, avorio, da pompei, 1-50 dc ca., 149425, 02.JPG|thumb|Indian art also found its way into Italy, within the context of [[Indo-Roman trade]]: in 1938 the [[Pompeii Lakshmi]] was found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] (destroyed in an eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in 79 CE).]] 
Buddhist art first developed during the [[Gandhara]] period and [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] Periods around the 1st century BCE. It flourished greatly during the [[Gupta]] Periods and [[Pala Empire|Pala]] Periods that comprise the Golden Age of India. Although the most glorious art of these Indian empires was mostly Buddhist in nature, subsequently Hindu Empires like the [[Pallava]], [[Chola]], [[Hoysala]] and [[Vijayanagara]] Empires developed their own styles of Hindu art as well.

There is no time line that divides the creation of rock-cut temples and free-standing temples built with cut stone as they developed in parallel. The building of free-standing structures began in the 5th century, while rock-cut temples continued to be excavated until the 12th century. An example of a free-standing structural temple is the [[Shore Temple]], a part of the [[Mahabalipuram]] World Heritage Site, with its slender tower, built on the shore of the [[Bay of Bengal]] with finely carved [[granite]] rocks cut like bricks and dating from the 8th century.&lt;ref name="binda"&gt;{{cite book

===Folk and tribal art===

Folk and tribal art in India takes on different manifestations through varied media such as pottery, painting, metalwork,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiansculptor.net/index.htm dhokra art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229115852/http://indiansculptor.net/index.htm |date=2010-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; paper-art, weaving and designing of objects such as jewellery and toys. These are not just aesthetic objects but in fact have an important significance in people's lives and are tied to their beliefs and rituals. The objects can range from sculpture, masks (used in rituals and ceremonies), paintings, textiles, baskets, kitchen objects, arms and weapons, and the human body itself (tattoos and piercings). There is a deep symbolic meaning that is attached to not only the objects themselves but also the materials and techniques used to produce them.

Often [[puranic]] gods and legends are transformed into contemporary forms and familiar images. Fairs, festivals, local heroes (mostly warriors) and local deities play a vital role in these arts (Example: [[Nakashi art]] from [[Telangana]] or [[Cherial scroll painting|Cherial Scroll Painting]]).

Folk art also includes the visual expressions of the wandering nomads. This is the art of people who are exposed to changing landscapes as they travel over the valleys and highlands of India. They carry with them the experiences and memories of different spaces and their art consists of the transient and dynamic pattern of life. The [[rural]], [[tribal]] and arts of the [[nomad]]s constitute the matrix of folk expression. Examples of folk arts are Warli, [[Madhubani art|Madhubani Art]], [[Manjusha Art]], [[Tikuli art|Tikuli Art]] and Gond etc.

While most tribes and traditional folk artist communities are assimilated into the familiar kind of civilised life, they still continue to practice their art. Unfortunately though, market and economic forces have ensured that the numbers of these artists are dwindling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Gramin Vikas Seva Sanshtha |last1=GVSS |title=Evaluation Study of Tribal/Folk Arts and Culture in West Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh and Bihar |url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/sereport/ser/ser_folk2211.pdf |website=Planning Commission |publisher=Socio-Economic Research (SER) Division, Planning Commission, Govt. of India New Delhi |date=12 June 2011 |page=53 |accessdate=2 March 2015 |quote="... globalization has triggered the emergence of a synthetic macro-culture...is gaining popularity day by day and silently engineering the gradual attrition of tribal/folk art and culture."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Decline of tribal and folk arts lamented|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Jul32008/district2008070276661.asp|accessdate=2 March 2015|work=Deccan Herald|date=3 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302045047/http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Jul32008/district2008070276661.asp|archivedate=2 March 2015|location=Gudibanda, Karnataka, India|quote="In the wave of electronic media, our ... ancient culture and tribal art have been declining, ..., said folklore researcher J Srinivasaiah."}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of effort is being made by various NGOs and the Government of India to preserve and protect these arts and to promote them. Several scholars in India and across the world have studied these arts and some valuable scholarship is available on them.

The folk spirit has a tremendous role to play in the development of art and in the overall consciousness of indigenous cultures.

[[File:Hans Rottenhammer - Allegory of the Arts - WGA20147.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Rottenhammer]], ''Allegory of the Arts'' (second half of the 16th century). [[Gemäldegalerie]], Berlin.]]

'''The arts''' refers to the [[Aesthetics|theory]] and [[Art|physical expression]] of [[creativity]] found in human [[Society|societies]] and [[culture]]s. Major constituents of the arts include [[literature]] (including [[drama]], [[poetry]], and [[prose]]), [[performing arts]] (among them [[dance]], [[music]], and [[theatre]]), and [[visual arts]] (including [[architecture]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[photography]], and [[sculpting]]). {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g., [[cinematography]]) or artwork with  the written word (e.g., [[comics]]). From prehistoric [[cave paintings]] to modern day [[films]], art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying humankind's relationship with the environment.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Definitions==
In its most basic abstract definition, art is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view, hear or experience it. The act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art, or as art in general. If this solidified expression, or the act of producing it, is "good" or has value depends on those who access and rate it and this public rating is dependent on various subjective factors. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines "the arts" as "painting, sculpture, music, theatre, literature, etc., considered as a group of activities done by people with skill and imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20arts|title=Definition of The Arts|work=Merriam-Webster|language=en|access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[United States Congress]], in the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, defined "the arts" as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.csulb.edu/~jvancamp/361_r8.html|title=Congressional definition of "the arts"|last=Van Camp|first=Julie|date=22 November 2006|website=PHIL 361I: Philosophy of Art|publisher=California State University, Long Beach|language=en|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The term 'the arts' includes, but is not limited to, music (instrumental and vocal), dance, drama, folk art, creative writing, architecture and allied fields, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic and craft arts, industrial design, costume and fashion design, motion pictures, television, radio, film, video, tape and sound recording, the arts related to the presentation, performance, execution, and exhibition of such major art forms, all those traditional arts practiced by the diverse peoples of this country. (sic) and the study and application of the arts to the human environment.}}

==History==
{{main article|History of art}}

In [[Ancient Greece]], all art and craft was referred to by the same word, ''[[techne]]''. Thus, there was no distinction among the arts. [[Ancient Greek]] art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g. [[Zeus]]' thunderbolt). In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Gothic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. [[Eastern art]] has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of [[Indian art|India]], [[Tibetan art|Tibet]] and [[Japanese art|Japan]]. Religious [[Islamic art|Islamic]] art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead.

In modern [[academia]], the arts are usually grouped with or as a subset of the [[humanities]]. Some subjects in the humanities are [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and [[logic]].

The arts have also been classified as seven: [[painting]], [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[performing]] and [[Film|cinema]].
Some view literature, painting, sculpture, and music as the main four arts, of which the others are derivative; [[drama]] is literature with [[acting]], [[dance]] is music expressed through [[Motion (physics)|motion]], and [[song]] is music with literature and [[Human voice|voice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/Esthetics_Main.html|title=Esthetics|last=Rowlands|first=Joseph|last2=Landauer|first2=Jeff|date=2001|website=Importance of Philosophy|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] on top of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], [[Athens]], [[Greece]]]]

Architecture is the [[art]] and [[science]] of [[design]]ing [[building]]s and [[structure]]s. The word ''architecture'' comes from the Greek ''arkhitekton'', "master builder, director of works," from ''αρχι-'' (arkhi) "chief" + ''τεκτων'' (tekton) "builder, carpenter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=architect&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=architect (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wider definition would include the design of the built environment, from the macrolevel of [[town planning]], [[urban design]], and [[landscape architecture]] to the microlevel of creating [[furniture]]. Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and [[cost]] for the [[Construction|builder]], as well as function and [[aesthetics]] for the [[Consumer|user]].

[[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]

In modern usage, architecture is the [[art]] and [[discipline]] of creating, or inferring an implied or apparent plan of, a complex object or [[system]]. The term can be used to connote the ''implied architecture'' of abstract things such as [[music]] or [[mathematics]], the ''apparent architecture'' of natural things, such as [[geology|geological]] formations or the [[structural biology|structure of biological cells]], or explicitly ''planned architectures'' of human-made things such as [[software]], [[computers]], [[Enterprise architecture|enterprises]], and [[database]]s, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a ''subjective [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]'' from a human perspective (that of the ''user'' in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] or components of some kind of [[structure]] or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements or components. Planned architecture manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing [[aesthetics]]. This distinguishes it from [[applied science]] or [[engineering]], which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures.

In the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, such as for a [[hospital]] or a [[stadium]], to the apparently simpler, such as planning [[residential]] houses. Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political [[symbol]]s, or works of art. The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the successful (and sometimes less than successful) design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live.

=== Ceramics ===
{{Main article|Ceramic art}}

Ceramic art is art made from [[ceramic]] materials (including [[clay]]), which may take forms such as [[pottery]], [[tile]], [[figurine]]s, [[sculpture]], and [[tableware]]. While some ceramic products are considered [[fine art]], some are considered to be [[Decorative arts|decorative]], [[Industrial design|industrial]], or [[Applied arts|applied]] art objects. Ceramics may also be considered [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] in [[archaeology]].Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery. Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as "art pottery." In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce [[studio pottery]]. In modern ceramic engineering usage, "ceramics" is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes [[glass]] and [[mosaic]] made from glass ''[[tessera]]e.''

===Conceptual art===
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}

Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea-based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/conceptual-art|title=Conceptual art|publisher=Tate|access-date=14 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practise the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].

===Drawing===
{{Main article|Drawing}}

Drawing is a means of making an [[image]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[Pen|pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil|colour pencils]], [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. An [[artist]] who excels in drawing is referred to as a ''drafter'', ''draftswoman'', or ''draughtsman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/draftsman|title=The definition of draftsman|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing can be used to create art used in cultural industries such as [[illustration]]s, [[comics]] and [[animation]].

===Painting===
{{Main article|Painting}}

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], is one of the most recognizable artistic paintings in the [[Western world]].]]

Painting is a mode of creative expression, and can be done in numerous forms. [[Drawing]], [[gesture]] (as in [[gestural painting]]), [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], [[narrative|narration]] (as in [[narrative art]]), or [[abstraction]] (as in [[abstract art]]), among other aesthetic modes, may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perry|first1=Lincoln|title=The Music of Painting|journal=The American Scholar|date=Summer 2014|volume=83|issue=3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a [[still life]] or [[landscape art|landscape painting]]), [[Photorealism|photographic]], abstract, narrative, [[symbol]]istic (as in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist art]]), [[emotion|emotive]] (as in [[Expressionism]]), or [[Politics|political]] in nature (as in [[Artivism]]).

Modern painters have extended the practice considerably to include, for example, [[collage]]. Collage is not painting in the strict sense since it includes other materials. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]], [[wood]] or strands of hair for their [[Texture (painting)|artwork texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Elito Circa]], [[Jean Dubuffet]] or [[Anselm Kiefer]].

===Photography===
{{Main article|Fine art photography}}

Photography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer. Art photography stands in contrast to [[photojournalism]], which provides a visual account for news events, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.

===Sculpture===
{{Main article|Sculpture}}

'''Sculpture''' is the branch of the [[visual arts]] that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the [[plastic arts]]. Durable sculptural processes originally used [[carving]] (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in [[stone]], [[metal]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wood]] and other materials; but since [[modernism]], shifts in sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by [[welding]] or modelling, or [[Molding (process)|moulded]], or [[Casting|cast]].

==Literary arts==
{{Main article|Language|Literature}}
{{Listen|filename=Sonnet18.ogg|title=Sonnet 18|description= '''''[[Sonnet 18]]''''' by [[William Shakespeare]] part of the Fair Youth [[Sonnet sequence|sequence]] of [[sonnet]]s.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Literature is literally "acquaintance with letters" as in the first sense given in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. The noun "literature" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''littera'' meaning "an individual written character ([[Letter (alphabet)|letter]])." The term has generally come to identify a collection of [[writing]]s, which in Western culture are mainly [[prose]] (both [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]]), [[drama]] and [[poetry]]. In much, if not all of the world, the artistic linguistic expression can be [[oral literature|oral]] as well, and include such [[genre]]s as [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[legend]], [[Mythology|myth]], [[ballad]], other forms of oral [[poetry]], and as [[Folklore|folktale]]. [[Comics]], the combination of drawings or other visual arts with narrating literature, are often called the "[[ninth art]]" (le neuvième art) in Francophone scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reading bande dessinée : critical approaches to French-language comic strip|last=Miller|first=Ann|year=2007|isbn=9781841501772|oclc=939254581|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing arts==
{{Main article|Performing arts}}

Performing arts comprise [[dance]], [[music]], [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[mime]], and other art forms in which a human performance is the principal product. Performing arts are distinguished by this performance element in contrast with disciplines such as visual and literary arts where the product is an object that does not require a performance to be observed and experienced. Each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature, meaning the product is performed over a period of time. Products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable (for example, by script or score) or improvised for each performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford companion to philosophy|last=Honderich|first=Ted|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|isbn=9780199264797|oclc=180031201|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called ''performers'', including [[actor]]s, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or essential workers, such as [[songwriting]] and [[stagecraft]]. Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;with tools such as [[costume]] and [[Theatrical makeup|stage makeup]].

===Music===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:MozartExcerptK331.svg|thumb|A musical score by [[Mozart]]. {{audio|MozartExcerptK331.mid|Play}}]]

Music is an art form whose [[Media (arts)|medium]] is sound and silence, occurring in time. Common elements of music are [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs melody and harmony), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts tempo, metre, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]]. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their reproduction in performance) through improvisational music to [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric pieces]]. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within "the arts," music may be classified as a [[performing art]], a [[fine art]], and [[auditory art]].

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}

Theatre or theater (from Greek ''theatron'' (''θέατρον)''; from ''theasthai'', "behold")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=theater&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=theater (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of the [[performing arts]] concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle – indeed, any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[kabuki]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[Chinese opera]] and [[Mummers Play|mummers' plays]].

===Dance===
[[File:Ballroom dance exhibition.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[ballroom]] dance exhibition]]
{{Main article|Dance}}

[[Dance]] (from [[Old French]] ''dancier'', of unknown origin)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dance&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=dance (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally refers to human [[Motion (physics)|movement]] either used as a form of expression or presented in a [[social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. ''Dance'' is also used to describe methods of [[non-verbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s (e.g. [[Bee Dance language|bee dance]], [[Courtship display|mating dance]]), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects (e.g. ''the leaves danced in the wind''), and certain [[dance (music)|musical forms]] or [[music|genres]]. [[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. In [[sport]]s, [[gymnastics]], [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are dance disciplines while [[Martial arts]] "[[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]" are often compared to dances.

==Multidisciplinary artistic works==
Areas exist in which artistic works incorporate multiple artistic fields, such as [[film]], [[opera]] and [[Performance Art|performance art]]. While opera is often categorized in the performing arts of music, the word itself is Italian for "works", because opera combines several artistic disciplines in a singular artistic experience. In a typical traditional [[opera]], the entire work utilizes the following: the sets (visual arts), costumes (fashion), acting (dramatic performing arts), the libretto, or the words/story (literature), and singers and an orchestra (music). [[File:Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute.png|thumb|left|Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute]]The composer [[Richard Wagner]] recognized the fusion of so many disciplines into a single work of opera, exemplified by his cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' ("The Ring of the Nibelung"). He did not use the term opera for his works, but instead [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] ("synthesis of the arts"), sometimes referred to as "Music Drama" in [[English language|English]], emphasizing the literary and theatrical components which were as important as the music. Classical [[ballet]] is another form which emerged in the 17th century in which orchestral music is combined with dance.

Other works in the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries have fused other disciplines in unique and creative ways, such as [[Performance Art|performance art]]. Performance art is a performance over time which combines any number of instruments, objects, and art within a predefined or less well-defined structure, some of which can be improvised. Performance art may be scripted, unscripted, random or carefully organized; even audience participation may occur. [[John Cage]] is regarded by many as a performance artist rather than a composer, although he preferred the latter term. He did not compose for traditional ensembles. Cage's composition ''[[Living Room Music]]'' composed in 1940 is a "quartet" for unspecified instruments, really non-melodic objects, which can be found in a living room of a typical house, hence the title.

==Other arts==
There is no clear line between art and [[culture]].  Cultural fields like [[gastronomy]] are sometimes considered as arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/new-face-french-gastronomy/ |title=The New Face of French Gastronomy - Knowledge@Wharton |publisher=Knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied arts===
{{Main article|Applied arts}}
The applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday, functional, objects to make them aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;"applied art" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art''. Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004. www.oxfordreference.com. Retrieved 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The applied arts includes fields such as industrial design, illustration, and commercial art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/applied-art |title=Applied art &amp;#124; Define Applied art at |publisher=Dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "applied art" is used in distinction to the fine arts, where the latter is defined as arts that aims to produce objects which are beautiful or provide intellectual stimulation but have no primary everyday function. In practice, the two often overlap.

===Video games===
{{See also|Video games as an art form}}
A debate exists in the fine arts and [[video game culture]]s over whether video games can be counted as an art form.&lt;ref name="an-art-world-for-artgames"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=12 December 2012|title=An Art World for Artgames|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading/article/viewArticle/119|last=Parker|first=Felan|journal=Loading...|language=en|volume=7|issue=11|issn=1923-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] professes that video games are a type of service, not an art form, because they are meant to entertain and attempt to entertain as many people as possible, rather than being a single artistic voice (despite Kojima himself being considered a gaming auteur, and the mixed opinions his games typically receive). However, he acknowledged that since video games are made up of artistic elements (for example, the visuals), game designers could be considered museum curators – not creating artistic pieces, but arranging them in a way that displays their artistry and sells tickets.

Within social sciences, cultural economists show how video games playing is conducive to the involvement in more traditional art forms and cultural practices, which suggests the complementarity between video games and the arts.&lt;ref name="video-games-and-arts"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015|title=Video Games Playing: A substitute for cultural consumptions?|last1=Borowiecki|first1=Karol J.|last2=Prieto-Rodriguez|first2=Juan|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=239–258|doi=10.1007/s10824-014-9229-y|citeseerx=10.1.1.676.2381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] included video games in its redefinition of what is considered a "work of art" when applying of a grant.{{fact|date=October 2018}} In 2012, the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] presented an exhibit, ''The Art of the Video Game''.&lt;ref name="an-art-world-for-artgames" /&gt; Reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.

As they respond to contemporaneous [[News|events]] and [[politics]], [[the arts]] take on political as well as social dimensions, becoming themselves a focus of controversy and even a force of political as well as [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;

A widespread observation is that a great [[skilled worker|talent]] has a free spirit. For instance [[Pushkin]], who some scholars regard as Russia's first great writer,&lt;ref name="Nab81Censors"&gt;[[Vladimir Nabokov]] (1981) ''[[Lectures on Russian Literature]]'', lecture on ''Russian Writers, Censors, and Readers'', pp.13-4&lt;/ref&gt; attracted the mad irritation of the Russian officialdom and particularly of the Tsar, since he "instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings (if write he must), composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification, in the audacity of his sensual fancy, and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants."&lt;ref name="Nab81Censors"/&gt;

==History of art and social and political change==
According to Groys, "[[Art]] has its own power in the world, and is as much a force in the power play of global politics today as it once was in the arena of cold war politics."&lt;ref name=Groys&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--deadlink&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;[[Cf.]] Silver 11, as qtd. in [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_n2_v55/ai_18533947/pg_3 book rev.] by Graham: "Power attracts artists and in turn promotes the artists who succeed within that power structure."  Silver's "specific goal [is] … to present works of art with a greater depth of treatment and a more historical and contextual view of their audiences and cultures than most survey volumes", and Graham focuses particularly on the way that Silver "chose and organized his topics [in this textbook] to investigate relations between art and power."&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Pertaining to such politically-intractable phenomena as the [[List of conflicts in the Middle East#Modern conflicts|Modern conflicts]] in the Middle East, however, some artists and social critics believe that "art is useless as a tool for political change."&lt;ref name=Slackman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, nevertheless, examples where artists employ art in the service of political change.

== The role of poetry ==

{{Quote|text=Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.|sign=[[Percy B. Shelley|Percy Bysshe Shelley]]|source=''[[A Defence of Poetry]]''}}

The Italian poet [[Ungaretti]], when interviewed on transgression by director [[Pasolini]] for the 1964 ''[[Love Meetings]]'' documentary, said that the foundation of [[poetry]] is to transgress all laws: "I am a poet and as such I begin transgressing all the laws by doing poetry".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pasolini]] (1964) ''[[Love Meetings]]'' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EerTTC-YO8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Situationist International===
The [[Situationist International]] (SI), a small group of international political and artistic agitators with roots in [[Marxism]], [[Lettrism]] and the early 20th-century European artistic and political [[avant-garde]]s formed in 1957, aspired to major social and political transformations; before disbanding in 1972 and splitting into a number of different groups, including the Situationist Bauhaus, the Antinational, and the [[Second Situationist International]], the first SI became active in Europe through the 1960s and elsewhere throughout the world and was characterized by an [[anti-capitalist]] and [[surrealist]] perspective on [[aesthetics]] and politics, according to Italian art historian [[Francesco Poli]].&lt;ref name=Poli&gt;{{cite book|last=Poli|first=Francesco|others=Trans. F. Scarpelli and A. Andreacchio|title=I situazionisti e la loro storia|editor=Guy Debord and Gianfranco Sanguinetti|publisher=Manifestolibri|location=Rome|year=2006|pages=63|isbn=978-88-7285-438-9 |quote=caratterizzato da un'ideologia dell'estetico e del politico di matrice marxista e surrealista.|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of the situationists, Italian scholar Mirella Bandini observes, there is no separation between art and politics; the two confront each other in [[revolutionary]] terms .&lt;ref name=Bandini&gt;{{cite book|last=Bandini|first=Mirella|title=L'estetico, il politico. Da Cobra all'Internazionale situazionista 1948-1957|publisher=Costa &amp; Nolan|year=1999|pages=408|isbn=978-88-7648-344-8|language=Italian|quote=Per la prima volta dopo il surrealismo, arte e politica vengono affrontate insieme in termini rivoluzionari.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, revolutionary ideas have emerged first among artists and intellectuals.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} That's why a precise mechanism to defuse the role of artists and intellectuals is to relegate them into specialized, compartmentalized disciplines, in order to impose unnatural [[dichotomies]] as the "separation of art from politics". Once artistic-intellectual works are separated from current events and from a comprehensive critique of society, they are sterilized and can be safely integrated into the [[official culture]] and the public discourse, where they can add new flavours to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of [[The Society of the Spectacle|the society of the spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Poster art===
"Not content with claiming [[Left-wing politics|leftwing]] music", posters for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the UK recycled iconic art styles of "[[Socialism|socialist]] revolution" to communicate its political message in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

===''Entropa''===
Czech [[sculptor]] [[David Černý]]'s ''[[Entropa]]'', a sculpture commissioned to mark the Czech presidency of the [[European Council|European Union Council]] during the first semester of 2009, illustrates how art can come into conflict with politics, creating various kinds of controversy in the process, both intentionally and unintentionally.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entropa'' attracted controversy both for its [[stereotype]]d depictions of the various [[European Union|EU]] member states and for having been a creation of Černý and two friends rather than, as Černý purported, a collaboration of 27 artists from each of the member states.&lt;ref name="CTK"/&gt;  Some [[European Union|EU]] members states reacted negatively to the depiction of their country, with [[Bulgaria]], for instance, deciding to summon the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Ambassador to [[Sofia]] in order to discuss the illustration of the [[Balkans|Balkan]] country as a collection of [[squat toilet]]s (ČTK).  This "Europe-wide [[hoax]] … reveals deeper truths" not only about the countries but "about art itself" (Gavrilova).

===Russian aesthetics===
According to Esti Sheinberg, a lecturer in music at the [[University of Edinburgh]], in her book ''Irony, Satire, Parody and the Grotesque in the Music of Shostakovich'', in "the traditional Russian perception of the arts", an "interrelationship between artistic technique and ideological content is the main aesthetic criterion" (ix; [[cf.]] Blois).

===Classical music===
[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] did not use the original title "Ode to Freedom" of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s [[lyric poem|lyric]], known in English as "[[Ode to Joy]]" (1785), in setting it to music in the final movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] (1824), which "[[Napoleon]]ic censors had forced the poet to change to 'Ode to Joy'."&lt;ref name=VanGelder&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], on 9 November 1989, that Christmas Day, when [[Leonard Bernstein]] conducted a performance of Beethoven's Ninth at the site of the former [[East Germany|East German]]&amp;ndash;[[West Germany|West German]] border in Berlin, a concert [[Public Broadcasting Service|telecast nationally]] in the United States, he substituted ''Freedom'' for ''Joy'' to reflect his own "personal message".&lt;ref&gt;

===Folk and protest music===

In February 1952, the [[United States Customs Service]] seized the passport of [[Paul Robeson]], preventing him from leaving the United States to travel to the Fourth Canadian Convention of the [[International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers]], in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada; but, after "The convention heard Robeson sing over the telephone", the union organized "a concert on the US-Canada border".&lt;ref name="Robeson"&gt;

|accessdate=2009-07-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the account of the "Paul Robeson Centennial Celebration": "Robeson sang and spoke for 45 minutes. He introduced his first song stating 'I stand here today under great stress because I dare, as do you—all of you, to fight for peace and for a decent life for all men, women and children' … [and, accompanied by Lawrence Brown on piano,] proceeded to sing spirituals, folk songs, labour songs, and a passionate version of [[Ol' Man River|Old Man River]], written for him in the [1920s], slowly enunciating 'show a little grit and you land in jail', underlining the fact that his government had turned the entire country into a prison for Robeson and many others."&lt;ref name="Robeson"/&gt;

In the 1960s the songs of [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Bob Dylan]], and others protested further [[racism]], war, and the [[military-industrial complex]], continuing an American artistic tradition of political protest founded during its [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial era]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Restrictions on live-music venues===
====In the United States====
In force from July 1985 until May 2002 and considered by its opponents a [[Draco (lawgiver)#"Draconian"|Draconian]] "anti-music law", the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] (TDO), imposing restrictions on clubs admitting those under the legal drinking age of 21 in [[Seattle]], Washington, was still the subject of protracted political and legal opposition in [[United States Federal Courts|U.S. Federal Court]] in early 2002, when a suit filed by the Joint Artists and Music Promotions Action Committee (JAMPAC) in 2000 was still being adjudicated.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2002, Judge Lasnik ruled for the City of Seattle on JAMPAC's suit, finding no Constitutional infringement of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and deciding that the matter is a political one for the [[Seattle City Council]] to decide, not the courts; during the course of the suit, Mayor Schell's successor, [[Greg Nickels]], a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Seattle City Council, and, on 12 August 2002, the new All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) replaced the TDO,&lt;ref&gt;

====In the United Kingdom====
{{See|Licensing Act 2003#Impact on live music}}
Following the implementation of the [[Licensing Act 2003]], the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]] cited "the interest of public order and the prevention of terrorism" as reasons for expecting promoters of [[live music]] events to complete the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]]'s [[Form 696]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the perceived "demand" for the information solicited on such "[[risk assessment]]" forms motivated [[Jon McClure]], lead singer with [[Reverend and The Makers]], to post an [[Internet petition|electronic petition]] in the "E-Petitions" section of the official website of [[Gordon Brown]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]], at  Number10.gov.uk, in order to facilitate protest against what McClure alleges is "[[Racism|racial discrimination]]" occasioned by such bureaucratic constraints,&lt;ref name="McClure"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It begins: "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to Scrap the unnecessary and draconian usage of the 696 Form from London music events".&lt;ref name="McClure"/&gt;  By 11 November 2008, according to Orlowski, "A dozen London boroughs [had] implemented a '[[risk assessment]]' [Form 696] policy for live music that permits the [[Metropolitan Police Service|police]] to ban any live music if they fail to receive personal details from the performers 14 days in advance."&lt;ref name="Orlowski"/&gt;  Orlowski points out: &lt;blockquote&gt;The demand explicitly singles out performances and musical styles favoured by the black community: [[Garage rock|garage]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], and [[Master of ceremonies|MCs]] and [[Disc jockey|DJs]]. ... However all musical performances – from one man playing a guitar on up – are subject to the demands once implemented by the council. And the threat is serious: failure to comply 'may jeopardise future events by the promoter or the venue'. ... UK Music chief [[Feargal Sharkey]] ... speaking to the [[Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee|Department of Culture Media and Sport]]'s hearing on venue licensing today [11 Nov. 2008] [concluded that] ... 'Live music is now a threat to the prevention of [[terrorism]]'. ... In response, Detective Superintendent Dave Eyles from the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Met]]'s clubs and vice office told us that 10,000 such [[Risk Assessment]]s would be processed this year. He said they weren't [[Wiktionary:compulsory|compulsory]]: ... 'We can't demand it – we recommend that you provide it as best practice. But you're bloody silly if you don't, because you're putting your venue at risk.'&lt;ref name="Orlowski"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  By early March 2009, over 16,000 British citizens or residents had signed McClure's E-Petition, which remained open to potential signatories until 1 December 2009.&lt;ref name="McClure"/&gt;

A '''work of art''', '''artwork''', '''art piece''', '''piece of art''' or '''art object''' is an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[Physical body|physical item]] or [[art]]istic creation. Apart from "work of art", which may be used of any work regarded as [[art]] in its widest sense, including works from [[literature]] and [[music]], these terms apply principally to tangible, portable forms of [[Visual arts|visual art]]: 
*An example of [[fine art]], such as a [[painting]] or [[sculpture]]
*An object that has been designed specifically for its aesthetic appeal, such as a piece of [[jewellery]]
*An object that has been designed for aesthetic appeal as well as functional purpose, as in [[interior design]] and much [[folk art]] 
*An object created for principally or entirely functional, religious or other non-aesthetic reasons which has come to be appreciated as art (often later, or by [[Culture|cultural]] outsiders)
*A non-ephemeral [[photograph]], [[film]] or visual [[computer program]], such as a [[video game]] or [[computer animation]]
*A work of [[installation art]] or [[conceptual art]].
Used more broadly, the term is less commonly applied to:
*A fine work of [[architecture]] or [[landscape design]]
*A production of live [[performance]], such as [[theater]], [[ballet]], [[opera]], [[performance art]], musical [[concert]] and other [[performing arts]], and other ephemeral, non-tangible creations.

This article is concerned with the terms and concept as used in and applied to the visual arts, although other fields such as [[aural]]-[[music]] and written word-[[literature]] have similar issues and philosophies.  The term ''[[objet d'art]]'' is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings, prints, drawings or large or medium-sized sculptures, or architecture (e.g. household goods, figurines, etc., some purely aesthetic, some also practical).  The term '''''oeuvre''''' is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oeuvre Oeuvre] Merriam Webster Dictionary, Accessed April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A ''work of art'' in the visual arts is a physical two- or three- dimensional object that is professionally determined or otherwise considered to fulfill a primarily independent [[aesthetic]] function.  A singular art object is often seen in the context of a larger [[art movement]] or artistic [[era]], such as: a [[genre]], aesthetic [[convention (norm)|convention]], [[culture]], or regional-national distinction.&lt;ref name=gell1998/&gt; It can also be seen as an item within an artist's "body of work" or ''[[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]]''. The term is commonly used by: [[museum]] and [[cultural heritage management|cultural heritage]] [[curator]]s, the interested public, the [[patronage|art patron]]-private [[art collector]] community, and [[art gallery|art galleries]].&lt;ref name=macdonald2006/&gt;

Physical objects that document immaterial or [[conceptual art]] works, but do not conform to artistic conventions can be redefined and reclassified as art objects. Some [[Dada]] and [[Neo-Dada]] conceptual and [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] works have received later inclusion. Also, some [[architectural rendering]]s and [[architectural model|model]]s of unbuilt projects, such as by [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and [[Frank Gehry]], are other examples.

The products of [[environmental design]], depending on intention and execution, can be "works of art" and include: [[land art]], [[site-specific art]], [[architecture]], [[garden]]s, [[landscape architecture]], [[installation art]], [[rock art]], and [[megalith|megalithic monuments]].

Legal definitions of "work of art" are used in [[copyright]] law; ''see {{slink|Visual arts|United States of America copyright definition of visual art}}''.

==Theories==
[[Marcel Duchamp]] critiqued the idea that the work of art should be a unique product of an artist's labour, representational of their technical skill or artistic caprice.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Theorists have argued that objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something.&lt;ref name=Hall1997&gt;Hall, S (ed.) 1997, ''Cultural Representations and Signifying Practice'', Open University Press, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Michael Craig-Martin]], creator of ''[[An Oak Tree]]'', said of his work – ''"It's not a symbol. I have changed the physical substance of the glass of water into that of an oak tree. I didn't change its appearance. The actual [[oak|oak tree]] is physically present, but in the form of a glass of water."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/theres-no-need-to-be-afraid-of-the-present-625001.html "There's No Need to be Afraid of the Present"], ''The Independent'', 25 Jun 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|upright|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at his [[291 (art gallery)|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit.]]
Some [[Art criticism|art theorist]]s and writers have long made a distinction between the [[physical art|physical qualities of an art object]] and its identity-status as an artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/08/gabos3.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804100009/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/08/gabos3.shtm |archivedate=August 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a painting by [[Rembrandt]] has a physical existence as an "oil painting on canvas" that is separate from its identity as a [[masterpiece]] "work of art" or the artist's ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rembrandtresearchproject.org/|title=Rembrandt Research Project - Home|work=rembrandtresearchproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many works of art are initially denied "museum quality" or artistic merit, and later become accepted and valued in museum and private collections. Works by the [[Impressionists]] and non-representational [[abstract art]]ists are examples. Some, such as the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|"Readymades" of Marcel Duchamp]] including his infamous urinal ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', are later reproduced as museum quality replicas.

There is an indefinite distinction, for current or historical aesthetic items: between "[[fine art]]" objects made by "[[artist]]s"; and  [[folk art]], [[handicraft|craft-work]], or "[[Applied arts|applied art]]" objects made by "first, second, or third-world" [[designer]]s, [[artisan]]s and [[Artisan|craftspeople]]. Contemporary and archeological [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous art]], [[industrial design]] items in limited or [[mass production]], and places created by [[environmental design]]ers and [[cultural landscape]]s, are some examples. The term has been consistently available for debate, reconsideration, and redefinition.
