The '''2009 Malagasy political crisis''' began on 26 January 2009 with the political opposition movement led by [[Antananarivo]] mayor [[Andry Rajoelina]], which sought to oust [[President of Madagascar|President]] [[Marc Ravalomanana]] from the presidency. The crisis reached its climax on 21 March 2009 when Andry Rajoelina was declared the president of the [[High Transitional Authority]] of Madagascar, five days after Ravalomanana transferred his power to a military council and fled to South Africa.

The international community immediately condemned the leader and his ascension as unconstitutional.  Financial support and foreign investments stopped, and the country fell into one of the worst economic crises in its history. The [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] and the [[African Union]] have been designated to supervise Madagascar's political reinstatement.

Though the objective of the transitional government was to run presidential elections as soon as possible to relieve the tensions (despite regular delays), its major challenge has been to establish an agreement among Madagascar's four key political factions (Rajoelina, Ravalomanana, [[Albert Zafy|Zafy]] and [[Didier Ratsiraka|Ratsiraka]]), some of which were and still are unfriendly to the transitional government. On 11 December 2010 a new constitution was formally approved, launching the Fourth Republic. On 28 October 2011 a consensus Prime Minister, [[Omer Beriziky]], was appointed. [[Malagasy general election, 2013|Presidential and parliamentary elections]] were scheduled for 8 May and 3 July 2013.

== Origins of the conflict ==
[[File:LocationMadagascar.svg|250px|thumb|Map of Madagascar in Africa]]
In December 2007, Andry Rajoelina was elected mayor of [[Antananarivo]]. Tensions quickly grew between president Ravalomanana and the young mayor over the course of 2008 as Rajoelina became a vocal critic of a series of unpopular policies enacted by the president.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; He condemned what he called the "restriction of freedom" on the island, and criticized the president's plans to lease large parts of land to the [[South Korea|Korean]] industrial company [[Daewoo]].&lt;ref name="first" /&gt;&lt;ref name="second" /&gt;

On 13 December 2008, the Ravalomanana administration decided to shutter Viva TV, a television channel belonging to Rajoelina&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; after broadcasting an interview with the former exiled president Didier Ratsiraka. Other television and radio stations that also aired the interview were not sanctioned.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt;

Andry Rajoelina organized a series of rallies in January 2009 that took aim at the Ravalomanana administration and gave voice to growing popular resentment toward the president's increasingly authoritarian policies and a widespread perception that national development had only benefitted an elite minority of which the president was the most visible figurehead.&lt;ref name="france24" /&gt; As anti-government frustration transformed into civil unrest, two state television stations were burned by anti-government protesters.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; At least 130 people were killed in Madagascar during the crisis.&lt;ref name="135killed" /&gt; The protests were seen as the gravest challenge faced by the Ravalomanana government since he came to office in 2002.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; President Ravalomanana vowed to restore order "whatever the cost", according to a government statement.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-2" /&gt;

== Protests ==
{{Politics of Madagascar}}
[[File:Madagascar-carte.png|thumb|left|160px|The protests took place in [[Antananarivo]], the capital and largest city in [[Madagascar]].]]
Rajoelina called a general strike during the weekend of 24–25 January 2009, in the capital city, [[Antananarivo]], against Ravalomanana, whom he has called a dictator.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt; Ravalomanana, who was in South Africa, cut short his trip to a regional summit in [[Pretoria]], and flew back to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt; In a statement Ravalomanana accused the mayor of attempting a coup saying, "The call for [[revolt]] and [[civil disobedience]]... corresponds to a coup d'état...tramples on the values of the constitution and the republic's institutions."&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt;

On 26 January 2009, the protests turned increasingly violent.&lt;ref name="france24" /&gt; Demonstrators set fire to the Madagascar state-owned radio building, attacked a private television station owned by Ravalomanana and looted shops and businesses throughout the city.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; That same day, armed government [[security agent]]s reportedly disabled the transmitter of Viva Radio, a private radio station owned by Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

Protesters ransacked two pro-government television stations in Antananarivo. Thousands of protesters raided and looted the headquarters of the [[Radio Nationale Malgache]] and [[Télévision Nationale Malgache]] building around 1&amp;nbsp;pm local time on 26 January 2009.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; About an hour later demonstrators burned down the [[Malagasy Broadcasting System]], a private station owned by President Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; A policeman and a fourteen-year-old protester were reportedly killed in the clashes at the Malagasy Broadcasting System attacks.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

Firefighters found the bodies of at least 25 people in the ruins of a burned out, looted [[department store]] in downtown Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="france24two" /&gt; The bodies were thought to be those of looters who became trapped in the burning shop when the roof caved in.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-4" /&gt; In total, 44 people died. Their bodies were taken to a morgue, and all but ten of them were found to be severely burned.

In a show of defiance against the government, Rajoelina called for all Antananarivo residents to stay home on 29 January 2009.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; This "ghost town" (''ville morte'') protest basically closed all stores and businesses in the capital city.&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt;

The [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Roman Catholic Cardinal]] [[emeritus]] of Antananarivo [[Armand Razafindratandra]] appealed for calm as the protests spread outside of the capital.&lt;ref name="cna" /&gt; All state and private radio stations in the country reportedly ceased broadcasting, with the exception of [[Radio Don Bosco]], which is run by the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] [[religious institute]].&lt;ref name=cna/&gt;

Rajoelina said on 31 January that he was taking control of the country due to the failure of Ravalomanana and the government to fulfil their responsibilities.&lt;ref name="bbcnews2" /&gt; He said that a request for Ravalomanana's "immediate resignation" would be submitted to [[Parliament of Madagascar|Parliament]] "in order to comply with the legal procedure". Furthermore, he asked that the [[central bank]] withhold money from the government, that all government ministries close, and that the security forces join him. Rajoelina said that he wanted the constitution to be respected and that it was Ravalomanana who had violated the constitution. According to Rajoelina, a new [[transitional government]] would soon be appointed under his leadership and a new presidential election would be held within two years. Speaking on the same day, Ravalomanana stated that he was "still the president of this country" and that he would "do what is necessary to develop this nation".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-5" /&gt;

The [[African Union]] (AU) immediately warned Rajoelina that it would not accept an unconstitutional power grab in Madagascar: "It's totally forbidden to take power by non-constitutional means."&lt;ref name="reuters2" /&gt;

Opposition leaders allied to Rajoelina filed a petition with the High Constitutional Court on 2 February, asking it to remove Ravalomanana from office. By that point, attendance at Rajoelina's rallies had reportedly decreased.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-6" /&gt; On 3 February, Rajoelina said at a rally that he would announce his new government on 7 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-7" /&gt; On the same day, the High Constitutional Court ruled that it had no power to remove the President from office, as that power belonged to Parliament.&lt;ref name="Fired" /&gt; Also on 3 February, Rajoelina was dismissed as Mayor and a special delegation, headed by [[Guy Randrianarisoa]], was appointed instead. Rajoelina denounced the decision, saying that there was "no valid reason" for it and that he was prepared to face arrest if necessary; he warned that the city would "not accept this decision".&lt;ref name="Fired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-8" /&gt;

Rajoelina held another rally on 4 February, with about 1,500 people in attendance. On that occasion he described the appointment of Randrianarisoa as "an insult to the people of Madagascar"; he instead designated [[Michele Ratsivalaka]] to succeed him as Mayor and gave her his mayoral scarf.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-9" /&gt;

=== Shooting at opposition rally ===
On 7 February, an opposition rally was held with twenty-thousand in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-10" /&gt; The demonstrators marched towards [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]] and crossed the "ligne rouge" (red line), the perimeter line around the palace gates that demarcates the zone off-limits to the public. The palace guards responded by firing live ammunition to disperse the crowd. Initial reports counted 83 wounded and 28 people killed, including a local reporter. Some looting was reported afterward.&lt;ref name="Three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-11" /&gt; Ambulances took the wounded to hospitals or private clinics, and bodies were seen piled up on the streets before they were taken to the morgue. The National Police warned that the death toll could rise, as many of the wounded were in critical condition. The following day it was reported that the death toll had increased to at least 50, with doctors estimating that 180 people had arrived at the city's main [[Ravoahangy Andrianavalona Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Madagascar protesters shot dead" /&gt; Antananarivo journalist [[Fanja Saholiarisoa]] said: "The mortuary is full and the hospital is full. On TV there is a special announcement calling on people who have cars to come and pick up the injured people from the hospitals".&lt;ref name="Madagascar protesters shot dead" /&gt; This brought the number of people killed since the start of the [[political violence]] to 130, with 80 people killed before the shooting of the demonstrators, including the people who died in the burned department store.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-12" /&gt;

Also on 7 February, Rajoelina said that [[Roindefo Monja]] would be prime minister under his transitional authority. According to Rajoelina, each of Madagascar's regions would have representation in the transitional authority. Regarding Ambohitsorohitra Palace, Rajoelina alluded to its history as a mayoral residence prior to 2002 and said that it "belongs to the people and to the city", while declaring that he had decided to give the palace to Monja for his use as prime minister. On the same day, Ravalomanana urged "calm and order", accusing Rajoelina of "cross[ing] all limits", while Prime Minister [[Charles Rabemananjara]] announced a one-week extension of the curfew.&lt;ref name=Three/&gt;

While visiting hospitalized victims of the shooting on 8 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle and argued that Ravalomanana's answer to the popular call for change was gunfire. He called for a national day of mourning on 9 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-13" /&gt;

On 9 February, Defence Minister [[Cécile Manorohanta]] announced her resignation, saying, "After all that has happened, I decide as of now to no longer remain part of this government."&lt;ref name="AutoRI-14" /&gt; Chief of military staff [[Mamy Ranaivoniarivo]] was appointed to replace Manorohanta on the same day.&lt;ref name="Defence" /&gt;

7 February shooting was thought to have reversed the opposition's declining momentum. Newspapers published on 9 February, strongly denounced the shooting.&lt;ref name=Defence/&gt; On 10 February, speaking before a rally of about 5,000 supporters, Rajoelina urged the people to observe a general strike on the next day; he asked that everyone stay indoors and that no one go to work or attend school. Roindefo announced the appointment of four ministers to serve in his transitional government, and he said that the remainder of them would be appointed by the end of the week. Meanwhile, both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina accepted dialogue in principle; Rajoelina said that dialogue would be conditional on the holding of a new presidential election or the formation of a transitional government.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-15" /&gt;

At a 35,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 14 February, Ravalomanana said that he would serve out his full term as president, that he was listening to the people, and that he regretted the deaths that had occurred during the protests. On the same day, Rajoelina held a rally nearby, with about 10,000 in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-16" /&gt;

At a rally on 17 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue the struggle, and later in the day several thousand of his supporters engaged in [[sit-in]]s near key ministries. Representing the government, Defense Minister Ranaivoniarivo invited Roindefo to participate in talks.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-17" /&gt; Rajoelina's supporters took over several important ministries on 19 February, changing the locks and installing Rajoelina's own ministers to work in them. Meanwhile, Ravalomanana appointed a new Minister of the Interior, [[Rabenja Sehenoarisoa]] (who had previously served as chief of police in the capital). His predecessor as Interior Minister, [[Gervais Rakotonirina]], was said to have departed the government due to poor health.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-18" /&gt; Only hours after the opposition took over the government ministries, they were removed from the ministries by security forces early on 20 February; about 50 of Rajoelina's supporters were arrested.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-19" /&gt;

Ravalomanana and Rajoelina met on 21 February; this meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes, was organized by the [[Council of Christian Churches in Madagascar]]. Both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina agreed to five points intended to calm the situation. This was intended as a prelude to more comprehensive dialogue.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-20" /&gt; On 23 February the two met again for about an hour,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-21" /&gt; and they held a third meeting, also lasting an hour, on 24 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-22" /&gt; However, Ravalomanana failed to appear for a planned meeting on 25 February, and Rajoelina then announced that he was withdrawing from the talks. Rajoelina criticized Ravalomanana for his absence and furthermore stated that the meetings he had held with Ravalomanana prior to that were disappointing. [[Odon Razanakolona]], who had been mediating the talks, abandoned his role shortly before Rajoelina withdrew from the talks; according to Razanakolona, the talks were fruitless and deadlocked.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-23" /&gt;

=== Post-talks ===
A protest in Antananarivo was broken up by the security forces on 26 February. Another protest in [[Fianarantsoa]] on 27 February, was also broken up; two deaths and 13 serious injuries were reported in the latter incident.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-24" /&gt; At a 10,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 28 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle "until we end this dictatorship". He said that, beginning on 2 March, protests would be held in the 13 May Plaza on a daily basis; he also called for the army to support him.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-25" /&gt;

A protest in [[Ambositra]] was broken up by police on 4 March, and two people were killed. Also on 4 March, President Ravalomanana declared his intention to "restore order" on [[Radio Mada]]. In Antananarivo, police blocked roads on 5 March to prevent protests in the 13 May Plaza.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-26" /&gt;

The security forces unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Rajoelina at his compound late on 5 March; they also raided his Viva media network. Initially they surrounded Viva, and after 30 minutes the staff attempted to evacuate equipment, at which point the security forces stormed the building and confiscated equipment. Rajoelina told [[Agence France-Presse]] on 7 March that he was "now hiding in a safe location where I cannot be attacked";&lt;ref name="AutoRI-27" /&gt; it was later acknowledged that he had gone to the residence of the French ambassador on 6 March.&lt;ref name="Res" /&gt;

=== Mutiny and military leadership change ===
{{main article|2009 Camp Capsat mutiny}}
Soldiers at a military base in Soanierana district, near Antananarivo, mutinied on 8 March; they objected to the use of force against the opposition.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-28" /&gt; United Nations envoy [[Tiebilé Dramé]] said on 9 March that the UN was placing Rajoelina "under its protection in a diplomatic residence".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-29" /&gt; The French Foreign Ministry said on 10 March that Rajoelina had left the French ambassador's residence.&lt;ref name="Res" /&gt;

On 10 March, the chief of staff of the Malagasy army, General [[Edmond Rasolomahandry]], gave political leaders 72 hours to solve the country's problems and return peace, threatening to take over if this did not occur.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-30" /&gt; The same day, Defence Minister Ranaivoniarivo announced his resignation shortly after a number of army officers visited his office to threaten a switch of allegiances to Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-31" /&gt; On 11 March, pro-opposition soldiers from the CAPSAT (Army Corps of Personnel and Administrative and Technical Services) stormed the army headquarters and forced Edmond Rasolomahandry to resign. Analysts stated that civil war seemed a distinct possibility.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-32" /&gt; Andre Andriarijaona replaced Rasolomahandry, apparently as a result of internal army deliberations and not a presidential appointment, and Andriarijaona said that the military would remain neutral and not seize power, thus revoking the 72-hour ultimatum.&lt;ref name="Lifts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-33" /&gt; A spokesman for Rajoelina said on 11 March that Rajoelina would not participate in talks planned to begin the next day;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-34" /&gt; subsequently the Christian Council of Churches announced that the talks would be delayed.&lt;ref name=Lifts/&gt;

On 12 March, the opposition took over the Ministry of Finance and Budget with the support of the armed forces&lt;ref name="AutoRI-35" /&gt; while the president's prime minister held a ten-minute meeting with the opposition-designated prime minister, who later stated that Rabemananjara had agreed to give up his job to him.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-36" /&gt; The next day, the chief of the military police stated he was taking orders from Andre Andriarijaona and not from the general appointed by Ravalomanana;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-37" /&gt; this was followed by the sending of army tanks against the [[Iavoloha Palace]] of the president, while some 3,000–5,000 civilian supporters of Ravalomanana surrounded the palace to counter opposition protests further away from the area. The Ravalomanana supporters, however, were told to clear the road in case the army neared the area.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-38" /&gt;

On 14 March, Monja occupied the prime minister's office while the opposition forces controlled the building.&lt;ref name="yn-2009-03-15" /&gt; Monja announced that the opposition forces, called the High Authority of Transition, "is presiding over the destiny of Madagascar".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-39" /&gt; Rajoelina gave the president four hours, until 6&amp;nbsp;pm (1500 GMT), to voluntarily resign, after which a mass civilian march would take place on the presidential palace to put Ravalomanana out of office;&lt;ref name=yn-2009-03-15/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-40" /&gt; he explicitly ruled out a violent overthrow through military means. However, Ravalomanana later emerged from the guarded palace after the deadline had passed, asserting that he was still the legal president and calling for a national conference.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-41" /&gt;

On 15 March, Ravalomanana offered to hold a referendum on whether he should stay in power or not, which was seen as a sign of the intense pressure placed on his presidency.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-42" /&gt; The following day, Rajoelina rejected this proposal and called on the security forces to arrest Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-43" /&gt;

== Capture of palace and Ravalomanana's resignation ==
{{wikinews|Coup in Madagascar; opposition leader backs army}}
On 16 March 2009, one of the palaces of President Ravalomanana, the [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]], was stormed and taken by soldiers of the Malagasy Army. Reports also indicate the capture of the country's [[central bank]]. The president was not in the stormed palace at the time. The [[African Union]] condemned the action, calling it an "attempted coup d'état". The actions followed an earlier call from opposition leader Andry Rajoelina for the President's arrest;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-44" /&gt; Rajoelina insisted that the palace seizure was not a coup,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; although he immediately installed himself in the presidential offices of the captured palace.

Hours later, the BBC stated that Ravalomanana was to resign and hand over the powers of both the president and prime minister to a military board headed by Vice Admiral [[Hyppolite Ramaroson]].&lt;ref name="AutoRI-45" /&gt; Ravalomanana later said, "I never resigned. I was forced to hand power over, at gun point, on March the 17th."&lt;ref name="so-2009-16-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-46" /&gt; At the time, Ravalomanana had already moved out of the Iavoloha Palace to an undisclosed location; as of 24 March, he was reportedly in [[Swaziland]].&lt;ref name="AutoRI-47" /&gt; The military junta, consisting of senior military personnel, would have been charged with organizing elections within 24 months and re-writing the constitution for the "Fourth Republic".&lt;ref name="lough1" /&gt; However, Vice Admiral Ramaroson announced on 18 March that it would transfer power directly to Rajoelina, making him president of the opposition-dominated [[High Transitional Authority (Madagascar)|High Transitional Authority]] that he had appointed weeks earlier.&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-18" /&gt; With the military's backing, the authority was charged with taking up the task previously accorded to Ravalomanana's proposed military directorate.&lt;ref name=bbc-2009-03-18/&gt; Madagascar's constitutional court deemed the transfer of power, from Ravalomanana to the military board and then to Rajoelina, to be legal.&lt;ref name="aj-2009-03-19" /&gt; The court's statement did not include any justifications for its decision.&lt;ref name="cbc-2009-03-21" /&gt;

Rajoelina said that Ravalomanana should be prosecuted for allegedly using lethal force against unarmed opposition demonstrators earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt; Rajoelina is prohibiting Ravalomanana's ministers from leaving the country.&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt;

On 19 March, Rajoelina suspended both chambers of [[Parliament of Madagascar|Parliament]].&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-48" /&gt; Roindefo responded to international criticism on 20 March, saying that the government will "explain the real situation. Maybe the way Madagascar acts is not very clear. Things can be a bit specific which may be difficult to follow in every detail."&lt;ref name="AutoRI-49" /&gt; According to Roindefo, the transfer of power was not a coup d'état but instead "the direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions".&lt;ref name="gn-2009-03-21" /&gt; Rajoelina was sworn in as President on 21 March before a crowd of 40,000 supporters.&lt;ref name=gn-2009-03-21/&gt; No foreign diplomats were in attendance;&lt;ref name=cbc-2009-03-21/&gt; Rajoelina's foreign minister said none were invited.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-50" /&gt;

On the same day, Malagasy navy troops called for Rajoelina's resignation by 25 March, threatening to use force otherwise to protect the constitution of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="pdo-2009-30-25" /&gt; According to their statement, the navy troops "condemn all violence against civilians" committed by the army corps in March and denounce Rajoelina for the "civil war occurring in Madagascar".&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt; The navy troops claimed that there was "irrefutable" evidence that Rajoelina had paid the army corps hundreds of millions of [[Malagasy ariary|ariaries]] and that they should face trials in accordance with military law.&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt; The navy troops called for other nations not to get involved in what they considered a purely domestic affair.&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt;

In a recorded message from Ravalomanana played to around 10,000 of supporters on 25 March, Ravalomanana encouraged people to "save the nation, defend the union and our national unity" because Rajoelina's government was "destroying our country with their coup."&lt;ref name="bbc-25-03-2009" /&gt;

Also on 25 March, Rajoelina invited Ravalomanana's political party to join other political parties, unions, and business leaders to discuss reconciliation on 2 and 3 April.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-51" /&gt; Rajoelina said the meeting would also include planning for the next elections.&lt;ref name="r-26-03-2009" /&gt; Rajoelina said he would appoint the members of the group who would organize the meeting.&lt;ref name="ap-26-03-2009" /&gt; Ravalomanana's political party, [[Tiako I Madagasikara]] (TIM), did not immediately comment on whether it would participate in those meetings.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-52" /&gt;

On 26 March, Rajoelina's justice minister said that Rajoelina had given a presidential [[pardon]] to 28 "[[political prisoner]]s" and that more would be pardoned in the future.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt; Members of TIM spoke to the crowd.&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; The names of the pardoned individuals were not made public.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;

About 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled in a park in downtown Antananarivo on 26 March,&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; the fourth consecutive of such protests.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt; Members of TIM spoke to the crowd.&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; Referring to the reconciliation meeting proposed by Rajoelina, the speakers said that Ravalomanana would be involved only if he were recognized at the meeting as Madagascar's elected president and only if the United Nations, Southern African Development Community, or another neutral, international body organized the meeting.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; The speakers urged Ravalomanana to leave Swaziland, return to Madagascar, and call the bicameral parliament back in session.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-53" /&gt; One speaker said that elections should only be held after Ravalomanana was reinstated as president.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-54" /&gt; Following the speeches, security forces fired tear gas and shot bullets into the air to disperse the crowd.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt;

The following day, about 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled again, the fifth such demonstration in five consecutive days.&lt;ref name="r-27-03-2009" /&gt; Police used tear gas on the assembled individuals at the end of the event, as they did at the end of the previous day's demonstration.&lt;ref name=r-27-03-2009/&gt;

On 28 March, between 15,000&lt;ref name="bbc-28-03-2009" /&gt; and 20,000&lt;ref name="AutoRI-55" /&gt; protesters assembled for the sixth consecutive day.&lt;ref name="aj-28-03-2009" /&gt; In a recorded message played to the assembled crowd, Ravalomanana encouraged his supporters to continue protesting and gave assurance that he would return to Madagascar soon.&lt;ref name=aj-28-03-2009/&gt; While marching towards the 13 May Plaza, the same location that Rajoelina's supporters had assembled earlier in the year, police fired their weapons into the air&lt;ref name="AutoRI-56" /&gt; and used tear gas&lt;ref name=bbc-28-03-2009/&gt; to disperse the crowds, resulting in a stampede that injured 34 people.&lt;ref name="ap-28-03-2009" /&gt; A young protester named "Razily", who was seen in a video of 28 March protests carrying the Malagasy flag at the head of the protests before being publicly beaten and carted off by police, became a [[cause célèbre]] when the video was distributed online; he has not been seen since his arrest. Police said they were trying to keep Ravalomanana's supporters from confronting Rajoelina's supporters.&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt; In response to the police actions, Ravalomanana's supporters encouraged a general strike on 30 March, saying, "Students should not go to school, office workers should stop their work and the private sector should stop paying taxes so as not to support an illegal regime."&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt; Protests continued nearly every day thereafter.&lt;ref name="bbc-20-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21" /&gt;

On 31 March, Rajoelina announced the individuals who would constitute the cabinet of his transitional administration for 24 months until elections are held.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina compared himself to Ravalomanana, saying that Ravalomanana was not immediately accepted by world leaders when he came to power in 2002.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina reiterated his previous statements that other countries should not "interfere" with his rise to the presidency of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina also announced a freeze of all mining contracts with foreign companies, saying that the foreign companies are not paying the fees and royalties that are legally due to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="afp-30-03-2009" /&gt;

Still asserting that he was the legitimate president, Ravalomanana announced from exile that he was appointing [[Manandafy Rakotonirina]] as Prime Minister on 16 April. Ravalomanana made this announcement by telephone at a rally of his supporters in Antananarivo, with Rakotonirina in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-57" /&gt;

On 20 April, people gathered in Antananarivo to listen to Ravalomanana speak by telephone and protest the closure of two radio stations, Radio Fahazavana and Radio Mada,&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; the latter of which is owned by Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; When the protesters began marching to a courthouse in the center of the city, police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and then fired their guns.&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; A [[BBC]] reporter witnessed a protester killed after being shot in the back at close range.&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; Another protester was also killed and twenty people went to the hospital for injuries sustained during the protests.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; The following day, thousands of people assembled to mourn the two deaths.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; [[List of heads of government of Madagascar|Prime Minister]] [[Roindefo Monja]] announced that "all demonstrations are banned, including those in support of Andry Rajoelina, in order to restore law and order."&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; Despite the ban, a demonstration was held the following day.&lt;ref name="afp-22-04-2009" /&gt; Over a thousand people assembled to protest, fewer in number and shorter in duration as compared in previous days.&lt;ref name=afp-22-04-2009/&gt;

Cars and trucks were set on fire and people were looting in Antananarivo on 23 April.&lt;ref name="ap-23-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-23-04-2009" /&gt; Police used tear gas, detonators, and gun fire to break up protests.&lt;ref name=bbc-23-04-2009/&gt; Six protesters were arrested.&lt;ref name="afp-23-04-2009" /&gt;

After Ravalomanana appointed him as Prime Minister, Rakotonirina began working out of the Carlton hotel in Antananarivo, and he appointed ministers to occupy the key government portfolios on 28 April. Soldiers with a warrant for Rakotonirina's arrest stormed the Carlton and arrested him on 29 April; they found him hiding in a bathroom after searching for about an hour. A spokesperson for Rajoelina described Rakotonirina as "the mastermind of last week's violence".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-58" /&gt; Also in late April, Rajoelina's government informed the AU that it was prepared to hold an election by the end of 2009, earlier than it had previously stated.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-59" /&gt;

=== Reconciliation meeting ===
At a reconciliation meeting that included four former presidents of Madagascar and United Nations negotiators, it was announced on 3 April that a [[Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2009|constitutional referendum]] would be held in September 2009, [[Malagasy parliamentary election, 2010|parliamentary elections]] in March 2010 and [[Malagasy presidential election, 2010|presidential elections]] in October 2010.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-61" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-62" /&gt;

On 11 April, Ravalomanana's supporters ended their participation in meetings with Rajoelina's supporters.&lt;ref name="bbc-11-04-2009" /&gt; Ravalomanana's supporters saying that the meetings were not worthwhile because their condition of the Ravalomanana's return to power was not met, nor was the United Nations' special envoy to Madagascar, [[Tiébilé Dramé]], acting as an impartial mediator.&lt;ref name="afp-11-04-2009" /&gt; In response, Dramé said he was "seeking a consensus" rather than an "imposed solution".&lt;ref name=afp-11-04-2009/&gt; On the same day, more than 10,000 people assembled in Antananarivo to protest Rajoelina's government.&lt;ref name=bbc-11-04-2009/&gt;

At a meeting on 23 May 2009 a breakthrough was reached; a transitional government and a [[truth and reconciliation commission]] was agreed to be formed, and all former presidents would be allowed to stand in the presidential elections; this last point was seen as controversial, as it might increase instability.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-63" /&gt; However, on 25 May 2009 the party of [[Didier Ratsiraka]] withdrew from the talks.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-64" /&gt;

=== Mediation crisis talks ===
Former exiled president of Madagascar [[Marc Ravalomanana]], [[President of Madagascar|President of the High Authority of Transition of Madagascar]] [[Andry Rajoelina]], former exiled Madagascar president [[Didier Ratsiraka]] and former president of the Malagasy Republic [[Albert Zafy]] met on Tuesday 4 August 2009 in Maputo, Mozambican capital, for four-day-long mediation crisis talks with the former Mozambican President [[Joaquim Chissano]] acting as mediator. Representatives came from the [[African Union]] (AU), United Nations (UN), the [[Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC). The mediation talks hoped to arrive at a way for Ravalomanana to return to Madagascar from his exile in South Africa. The talks were also a trade meeting to begin negotiations on the transition charter to seek new elections in Madagascar. Ratsiraka, who had been exiled in France, saw his amnesty issue resolved at the talks. The four leaders sought to again become a customs union (SADC), and representatives of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-65" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-66" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-68" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-70" /&gt;

== Unity government deal ==
On 7 November 2009, the leaders agreed to a power-sharing deal in which Rajoelina stays as president, creation of two co-presidents, [[Fetison Rakoto Andrianirina]], aide to former President Ravalomanana and [[Emmanuel Rakotovahiny]], aide to former President Zafy. Prime Minister [[Eugene Mangalaza]] who was appointed on 10 October will be retained heading the 31-member cabinet. The deal also creates a 65-member council of transitional advisers and a transitional parliament composed of 258 members.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-71" /&gt;

During the transition in the government, people have been illegally hunting and logging in [[Marojejy National Park]] and other conservation areas in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="ng" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; While the new Malagasy government is otherwise preoccupied and some park rangers have left their posts, armed groups are cutting down valuable [[rosewood]] trees.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Laws prohibiting the export of rosewood were repealed in January 2009, so the illegally acquired logs can be sold and exported for profit.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Thousands of local people were involved in cutting a documented 123,000 rosewood logs representing an estimated 45,000 rosewood trees from Marojejy, Masoala and Makira National Parks between January–October 2009, with at least 871 containers already exported to China between March–April 2009 alone from the [[Vohemar]] and [[Toamasina]] ports.&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Floating the rosewood logs down rivers also requires cutting of 4–5 lighter trees, and several [[rosewood]] species are endangered or occur at low densities below 1–5 trees per hectare.&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Numerous new access paths are created and some individuals built a 6-kilometer-long road into a remote northern park to transport the logs.&lt;ref name="gm-18-04-2009" /&gt; Some ships land directly on the coast to pick up the logs, rather than at government-controlled ports.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Bribery of customs officials has been reported.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Radio commercials have been aired seeking workers to help in the process.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Extracting resources from these conservation areas is likely to threaten already [[critically endangered]] species such as the [[silky sifaka]] [[lemur]],&lt;ref name=ng/&gt; one of the top 25 most endangered [[primate]]s in the world.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-72" /&gt; A statement jointly released by several [[non-governmental organizations]] criticized the logging and hunting occurring in national parks, illegal mining, and [[slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn farming]] occurring in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="fn-30-03-2009" /&gt; The joint statement said that "These deplorable acts will only further impoverish the country and deprive future generations of the Malagasy people from their unique natural heritage."&lt;ref name=fn-30-03-2009/&gt; The groups who issued the statement were [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Conservation International]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]], Institute for the Conservation of Tropical Environment, [[The Peregrine Fund]], ONG Fanamby, [[Madagascar Fauna Group]], L'Homme et l'Environnement, and Plant Resources for Tropical Africa.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-73" /&gt;

=== Contracts ===
In 2009, Rajoelina canceled a contract with South Korean company [[Daewoo]].&lt;ref name="ft-2009-03-19" /&gt; Under the contract, Daewoo would have leased {{convert|1300000|ha|km2}} of land, almost half of Madagascar's arable land,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-74" /&gt; for 99 years to grow corn and palm oil for export to South Korea, a project that might have created as many as 45,000 jobs.&lt;ref name=ft-2009-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-19" /&gt; On 10 April 2009, Madagascar's Minister of Land Reform confirmed that the contract with Daewoo had been canceled because its "approach was wrong", even though "the project by itself wasn't bad and such a project is welcome".&lt;ref name="bb-10-04-2009" /&gt; As of 10 April, Daewoo said it had not been informed of the contract's cancellation&lt;ref name=bb-10-04-2009/&gt; and would proceed with the project regardless.&lt;ref name=ft-2009-03-19/&gt;

On 17 March 2009, Canadian energy company [[Sherritt International]] said its 27-year $4.5-billion nickel-mining project would still begin in 2010 and reach full production in 2013, as scheduled.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-75" /&gt; On 19 March 2009, it said it was likely the project's start date would be delayed.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-76" /&gt;

=== Economic ===
Finance Minister Benja Razafimahaleo reported a decrease in government revenue of 15 to 20 percent.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Ravalomanana owns Tiko, the largest dairy farm in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-77" /&gt; After Rajoelina became president, Rajoelina's supporters looted Tiko dairy farms, resulting in a milk shortage in Madagascar.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Revenue from foreign tourists has decreased by 70 percent, in part because some foreign countries are cautioning their citizens against visiting the country&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; About 70 percent of hotels have closed due to the sharp drop in business.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; One large hotel that has remained open temporarily laid off 150 of its 400 employees and cut the hours and wages of its other 250 employees.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Strikes, wage shortages, and cuts in foreign aid are also causing economic problems for the country.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt;

=== Sports ===
On 28 January 2009, the [[Confederation of African Football]] canceled a match between Madagascar's [[Academie Ny Antsika]] and [[Réunion]]'s [[US Stade Tamponnaise|Union Sportive Stade Tamponnaise]], which was set to be played in Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-78" /&gt;

The African Union suspended Madagascar's membership in the organization. The [[Peace and Security Council]] of the African Union announced that it would impose sanctions on the Madagascar government if an "unconstitutional" transfer of power were to take place, including total expulsion from the African Union.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-95" /&gt; The African Union can enact sanctions if Madagascar does not restore constitutional order within six months.&lt;ref name="tg 2009-03-20" /&gt;

The African Union's stance was corroborated by Czech Foreign Minister [[Karel Schwarzenberg]], who stated that the European Union may impose sanctions on Madagascar and not recognize the transfer of power,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-96" /&gt; and the United States Department of State, which indicated a similar response to any "extra-constitutional" regime change.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-97" /&gt; The Southern African Development Community will meet in late March to consider sanctions.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-98" /&gt;

On 31 March, the [[European Union]] said it had not suspended its aid to Madagascar, which will continue for the next three years as previously agreed, but it also had no plans for new aid.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-99" /&gt;

US President Barack Obama decided to remove Madagascar from the beneficiary of the AGOA [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]. On 23 December of the year 2009, President Obama also terminated the program for Guinea, Niger and Madagascar because of their undemocratic changes of power.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-100" /&gt; The AGOA program has helped created ten of thousands of jobs for middle class Malagasy especially in apparel manufacturing factories, it is feared that most of these jobs will be lost in the near future. Considering the important number of business affected by this decision, the economy of the capital city Antananarivo and [[Antsirabe]] will be deeply affected fearing further social tension.

=== Government response ===
Most of the government response has been channeled through opposition prime minister [[Monja Roindefo]], who denied that the events leading to Rajoelina's gaining of the presidency was a coup, but rather a "direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions",&lt;ref name="tg 2009-03-20" /&gt; and called on the European Union to reconsider its reaction to the events. Rajoelina dismissed the condemnations, stating that "if they haven't understood the process, they may well react. But if they stick to their line after we have spoken, it will be annoying".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-101" /&gt;

Rajoelina has promised that the high [[cost of living]] would decrease because merchants had agreed to decrease the price of bread and cooking oil as of 30 March, and the cost of rice soon thereafter.&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt;

In response to the [[Southern African Development Community]]'s view that Rajoelina's rise to power was unconstitutional and its urging for elections within six months, Rajoelina said that membership in the SADC is "not in the interests of Madagascar".&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt; He said he would confer with others to decide whether Madagascar would continue to be a member of the SADC.&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt; "The prospect of an SADC intervention is unacceptable. Other states cannot interfere with the decision of (Madagascar's) High Constitutional Court" that the transfer of power to Rajoelina was constitutional.&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt;

==Aims==
Al-Muhajiroun's proclaimed aims are to establish public awareness about Islam, to influence public opinion in favour of the [[sharia]], to convince members of society that Islam is inherently political and a viable ideological alternative, to unite Muslims on a global scale in the threats facing the [[Ummah]] and to resume the Islamic way of life by re-establishing the Islamic [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref name=ORIGIN/&gt; Members have carried out numerous murders and terrorist attacks.

* Need4Khilafah;
* the Shariah Project; and
* the Islamic Dawah Association

==History==
[[Omar Bakri Muhammad]] and [[Anjem Choudary]] are known to have led Al-Muhajiroun.&lt;ref name=DYNAMITE&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3110115.stm Police raid Islamic group]| BBC News |30 July 2003 |accessed 2 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakri founded Al-Muhajiroun in [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia on 3 March 1983 following "the 59th anniversary of the destruction of the [[Ottoman Caliphate]]," in [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia.  According to at least one scholar ([[Sadek Hamid]]), the group was a front for [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] in the Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamid|first=Sadek|title=Islamic Political Radicalism: A European Perspective|date=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-74863-086-4|pages=148|editor=Tahir Abbas|chapter=Islamic Political Radicalism in Britain: the case of Hizb-ut-Tahrir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hilBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145 |ref=IPRBcHT2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (where political parties are illegal). According to Bakri, the Hizb ut-Tahrir leadership did not accept the group. As such, Bakri established Al-Muhajiroun independently from Hizb ut-Tahrir.&lt;ref name=OTAIBI&gt;

Bakri claims that he studied at the universities of Umm ul-Qura' in Makkah and the [[Islamic University of Madinah]].&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Fiqh'', Bakri (London: The Islamic Book Company, 1996), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Bakri also studied with, and was assessed by, Dr. [[Abdur Rahman Dimishqia]].&lt;ref name="Hizb ut-Tahreer"&gt;''Hizb ut-Tahreer'', Dr. Abdur Rahman Dimishqia,  (Istanbul: Maktabah ul-Ghurabaa', 1417 AH/1997 CE)&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Saudi Arabia he worked for ''Eastern Electric'' owned by Shamsan and [[Abdul-Aziz as-Suhaybi]] in [[Riyadh]], and then Bakri moved to its Jeddah branch. Later he traveled to America to study English after which he went to the UK to assume the leadership of Hizb ut-Tahrir.&lt;ref name ="Hizb ut-Tahreer" /&gt;

The [[Saudi Arabian government]] banned Al-Muhajiroun in January 1986, prompting Bakri to leave. On 14 January 1986, he arrived in Britain, where he worked as part of Hizb ut-Tahrir.&lt;ref name=OTAIBI/&gt; Bakri's involvement in Hizb ut-Tahrir ended on 16 January 1996 when he was dismissed by the group's global leadership. Following the emergence of Al-Muhajiroun in early 1996, Bakri would later become the chief sponsor in Britain of the [[International Islamic Front]], an organization that trained and sent British Citizens to fight in [[Chechnya]] and the [[Balkans]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

===NUS ban===
In March 2001 Britain's [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] banned Al-Muhajiroun after they received complaints from Muslim and non-Muslim students about the group distributing [[hate literature]] and the organization training members in militant camps.  Al-Muhajiroun members put up posters and handed out leaflets in [[Manchester University]]'s campus where the police were called and at the [[University of Birmingham]] campus that called for the killing of Jews.  A spokesman for NUS said that if Al-Muhajiroun did not support violence against Jews then they should change their "highly militant and definitely not peaceful" literature.&lt;ref name=GENOCIDE&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011122202951/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPrint.asp?Page=%5CForeignBureaus%5Carchive%5C200109%5CFor20010921g.html UK Islamic Group, Banned from Campus, Claims Misrepresentation]| [[CNS News]]| Mike Wendling | September 21, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic Council of Britain===
[[Abu Hamza al-Masri]] created the [[Islamic Council of Britain]] to "implement sharia law in Britain," on 11 September 2002, the first anniversary of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], primarily through funding from Al-Muhajiroun. Masri celebrated the establishment of the ICB and the 9/11 attacks by holding a conference in [[Finsbury Park mosque]] in [[North London]] entitled "September the 11th 2001: A Towering Day in History." Bakri, who attended the conference, said, that attendees "look at September 11 like a battle, as a great achievement by the [[mujahideen]] against the evil superpower. I never praised September 11 after it happened but now I can see why they did it." Flyers distributed at the conference referred to the 9/11 hijackers as the "Magnificent 19." Bakri said he saw [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists as "sincere [and] devoted people who stood firm against the invasion of a Muslim country." [[Anjem Choudary]], British spokesman for Al Muhajiroun also attended.&lt;ref name=ORIGIN/&gt; Just days after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] the Oxford-based Malaysian jurist, [[Afifi al-Akiti|Shaykh Muhammad Afifi al-Akiti]], issued his landmark fatwa against suicide bombing and targeting innocent civilians, titled [http://www.livingislam.org/maa/dcmm_e.html ''Defending the Transgressed, by Censuring the Reckless against the Killing of Civilians''], which was written in response to this controversial "Magnificent 19" statement made by Al-Muhajiroun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warda.info/fatwa.pdf ''Defending the Transgressed'' (2005), p. 17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] Tony Blair announced the group would be banned as part of a series of measures against condoning or glorifying terrorism.&lt;ref name=DISBANDMENT/&gt;

[[Home Secretary]] [[Charles Clarke]] banned [[Omar Bakri Muhammad]] from the United Kingdom on 12 August 2005 on the grounds that his presence was "not conducive to the public good."&lt;ref name=ORIGIN&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20060424105053.htm Islamists Down Under]| Assyrian International News Agency| 2006-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jan/11/islam4uk-al-muhajiroun-ban-laws Extremist Islamist groups to be banned under new terror laws] Guardian Online | 2010 january 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CLARKE&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,22989-1733144,00.html 'Preacher of hate' is banned from Britain] Times Online&lt;/ref&gt; Two other offshoot organisations, [[The Saviour Sect]] and [[Al-Ghurabaa]] had previously been banned for the 'glorification' of terrorism under the [[Terrorism Act 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/legislation/current-legislation/terrorism-act-2000/proscribed-groups.html |title=Proscribed terrorist groups  |accessdate=14 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118084213/http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/legislation/current-legislation/terrorism-act-2000/proscribed-groups.html |archivedate=18 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statements===
Aside from declaring the [[Hijackers_in_the_September_11_attacks|9/11 hijackers]] "the Magnificent 19", controversial statements made by al-Muhajiroun include one warning the British government that it was "sitting on a box of dynamite and have only themselves to blame if after attacking the Islamic movements and the Islamic scholars, it all blows up in their face".&lt;ref name=DYNAMITE/&gt;

In 2004 [[BBC Newsnight]] quoted one Al-Muhajiroun leader, [[Sajeel Shahid|Abu Ibrahim]], as saying,
&lt;blockquote&gt;When they speak about 11 September, when the two planes magnificently run through those buildings, OK and people turn around and say, 'hang on a second, that is barbaric. Why did you have to do that?' You know why? Because of ignorance. ... For us it's retaliation. Islam is not the starter of wars. If you start the war we won't turn the other cheek. ... According to you it can't be right. According to Islam it's right. When you talk about innocent civilians, do you not kill innocent civilians in Iraq?&lt;ref name=IBRAHIM&gt;

===Attacks===
On 29 April 2003, Asif Hanif who attended some of Al-Muhajiroun's circles carried out a bombing of a café in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, that killed three people and injured 60 others.&lt;ref name=NetworkDoward&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doward|first1=Jamie|last2=Wander|first2=Andrew|title=The network|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/06/terrorism.jamiedoward|work=The Observer|date=6 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIVILDEATHS&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,249521,00.html New poll shows worry over Islamic terror threat, to be detailed in special FNC Report] Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, another individual connected with Al-Muhajiroun allegedly detonated a [[suicide bombing|bomb]] in India, killing himself and destroying an army barracks.&lt;ref name=ORIGIN/&gt;

In 2007, five young Muslims with Al-Muhajiroun connections  – [[Omar Khyam]], [[Waheed Mahmood]], Anthony Garcia, [[Jawad Akbar]] and [[Saladhuddin Amin]] – were convicted of a [[Operation Crevice|multiple bombing plot]] to use fertiliser bombs "which police say could have killed hundreds of British people. The men were caught after police and MI5 launched a massive surveillance operation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6153884.stm Fertiliser bomb plot: The story. By Chris Summers and Dominic Casciani. 30 April 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The surveillance culminated in a raid called [[Operation Crevice]]. The targets included "the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London and Britain's domestic gas network." According to Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Brunel Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fertiliser bomb trial has given us the smoking-gun evidence that groups like al-Muhajiroun have had an important part in radicalising young British Muslims, and that this can create terrorists.&lt;ref name=NetworkDoward/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 22 May 2013, the [[murder of Lee Rigby]] was carried out by two members of Al-Muhajiroun, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. From about 2003, Adebolajo was corrupted by Bakri and then by Choudary,&lt;ref name=dtlr/&gt; after Bakri left the country in August 2005.&lt;ref name=PUBLICGOOD&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4133150.stm|title=Cleric Bakri 'will return' to UK|publisher=BBC News|date=9 August 2005|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One former associate said Adebolajo that “locked himself in this room with this bloke for a few hours and when he came out he was a Muslim convert. He was spouting all kinds of stuff and said he had changed his name." Adebolajo insisted to be called during the Rigby trial "[[Mujahid]]".&lt;ref name=dtlr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10528365/Lee-Rigby-killers-from-quiet-Christians-to-Islamist-murderers.html |title=Lee Rigby killers: from quiet Christians to Islamist murderers |publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=15 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1144">The '''Australian Freedom League''' (AFL) was an anti-[[conscription]] organisation founded in Australia in 1912.  Growing out of an earlier organisation called the "Anti-Military Service League",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summy|first1=Hilary N.|title='Peace Angel' of World War I|date=2006|publisher=University of Queensland|location=Brisbane|isbn=0977506207}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was initially based in [[Adelaide]], although by 1914 there were branches in every state except [[Western Australia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19491">[[File:Bernard Law Montgomery.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] wearing his black beret]]
The '''black beret''' is a type of headgear commonly worn by armoured forces around the world including the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Tank Regiment]] (RTR), the [[Royal Canadian Armoured Corps]] (RCAC), and the [[Royal Australian Armoured Corps]] (RAAC). Notable non-armoured units to wear the black beret include the [[Russian Naval Infantry]] (and formerly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]) and [[Russia]]n [[OMON]] units, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[Tactical Air Control Party]] (TACP), [[Philippine National Police-Special Action Force]] (PNP-SAF) members, and the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] ("navy blue"). It was also worn by the United Kingdom's [[Royal Observer Corps]] (ROC) with their [[Royal air force|Royal Air Force]] (RAF) uniform, [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA).

Perhaps the most famous Commonwealth wearer of the black beret was [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] who wore a [[Royal Tank Regiment]] (RTR) beret complete with [[cap badge]], presented to him by the regiment, to which he added his own [[general]]'s (later [[field marshal]]'s) [[British Army officer rank insignia|rank insignia]].

==Original usage==
The black beret has its origins with the French 70th [[Chasseurs Alpins]] who influenced the British Royal Tank Corps beginning in 1918. General Sir [[Hugh Jamieson Elles]], together with Colonel Fuller came up with the idea of a black beret for the Royal Tank Corps. Black was selected as the colour because it was least likely to show oil stains, something which tank crewmen of that time (and now) could appreciate. It was approved for wear with the [[Royal Tank Corps]] by HM [[King George V]] on 5 March 1924.

The Black Beret remained the exclusive distinctive headdress of the Royal Tank Corps  in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australian-armour.com/Black%20Beret.html,&lt;/ref&gt;

When uniforms were issued to the [[Royal Observer Corps]] there was a surplus of Royal Armoured Corps black berets that were given to the unit.

==United States military usage==
In the United States military, the beret was unofficially worn by a variety of special operations units during and following World War II. In the spring of 1951, the 10th and 11th Ranger Companies wore black berets during their training at [[Camp Carson]], Colorado, before their deployment to Japan.
===Black berets in the U.S. Air Force===
[[File:Earning the black beret 150417-F-GO396-301.jpg|thumb|[[United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party|US Air Force's Tactical Air Control Party]] beret, flash, and crest]]
In 1979, the black beret was authorized for wear by enlisted personnel in the Tactical Air Control Party. In 1984, two airmen from Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina submitted the current flash and badge design. It was approved for all TACP airmen in 1985. Tactical Air Control Party specialists (AFSC 1C4X1) are currently the only United States Air Force specialty allowed to wear the coveted black beret as part of their daily duty uniform wear.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Military Beret History (Page 2)". Usmilitary.about.com. 2001-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black berets in the U.S. Army===
[[File:YoungestBeret1stBattalion23rdInfantryRegiment.jpg|right|thumb|A soldier from 1st Bn, [[23rd Infantry Regiment|23rd Inf Reg]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd ID]] wearing the black beret (2001)]]
In 1973, permission was granted to local commanders to encourage distinctive, morale-enhancing uniform items and the black beret was adopted by armor and armored cavalry units in the United States.

A black beret was authorized for wear by female soldiers in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;p.223 Stanton, Shelby ''U.S. Army Uniforms of the Cold War 1948–1973'' 1994 Stackpole Books&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 1975, it was officially assigned as part of the newly created battalions of [[United States Army Rangers]] who had worn it unofficially during the Vietnam War.

In 1979, the army chief of staff ruled that the black beret was restricted to just ranger and airborne units (the latter receiving their distinctive maroon berets on November 28, 1980). However, since June 14, 2001, the black beret is worn by all [[United States Army]] troops unless the soldier is approved to wear a different distinctive beret. The Rangers now wear [[tan beret]]s in reverence to the buckskins worn by [[Rogers' Rangers]] during the [[French and Indian War]].

The black beret is worn as part of the [[Army Service Uniform]] (ASU), the U.S. Army's dress uniform. It also became the official garrison headgear to be worn with the [[Battle Dress Uniform]] (BDUs) in 2001, and from 2005 the [[Army Combat Uniform]] (ACU). The change was implemented by General [[Eric Shinseki]], the Army Chief of Staff at the time, who stated that it was about promoting "...our values as an institution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Defense Leaders Uphold Army's Black Beret Decision (Corrected Copy) |url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45776 |website=archive.defense.gov |accessdate=June 16, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the beginning, the beret was unpopular with soldiers, because the headgear required two hands to put it on, could not be carried in the pocket when not worn (as the patrol cap could), and provided no shade from the sun when worn.

Despite years of negative feedback, the beret remained part of the ACU until 2011, when incoming Sergeant Major of the Army [[Raymond F. Chandler]] made it his first order of business to address the wishes "thousands of soldiers" who wanted the army to end the wear of the beret with the ACU, and the army subsequently did just that.&lt;ref name="Army Dumps Beret"&gt;{{cite web|title=Army dumps beret as official ACU headgear|url=http://www.armytimes.com/article/20110613/NEWS/106130309/Army-dumps-beret-official-ACU-headgear|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140220043908/http://www.armytimes.com/article/20110613/NEWS/106130309/Army-dumps-beret-official-ACU-headgear|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Pierce-Lunderman | first1=Cursha | title=Bye-Bye, Beret: Switch to Patrol Cap Brings Mixed Feelings | url=https://www.army.mil/article/60276/Bye_bye__beret__Switch_to_patrol_cap_brings_mixed_feelings | date=June 23, 2011 | publisher=U.S. Army| accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Shaughnessy | first1=Larry | title=Army Backtracks on Black Berets After More than a Decade of Debate | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/13/army.beret/ | date=June 14, 2011 | publisher=CNN | accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black beret remained the headgear for the ASU, but was replaced as the default headgear with the ACU patrol cap.&lt;ref name="Beret replacement"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lopez|first1=C.

During the [[Vietnam War]] the U.S. Navy personnel assigned to [[Patrol Boat, River|patrol boats]] wore the [[Republic of Vietnam Navy|South Vietnamese navy]] black beret with badge. Unit tradition had the back ribbon cut into two pennants after first contact with the enemy with the ends of the pennant notched in a "V" to signify he had made an enemy "kill".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas J. Cutler|Cutler, Thomas J.]] (2000) ''Brown Water, Black Berets''. Naval Institute Press, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; 
====Female black beret====
Until October 2016, a black beret was authorized to be worn,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/uniforms/uniformregulations/Documents/01NOVSOC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070521043303/http://buperscd.technology.navy.mil/bup_updt/508/unireg/chapter3/3500_seriesArticles/3501_3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; albeit solely by female U.S. Navy sailors of all ranks.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110831052528/http://timemilitary.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/unif-navy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Female commissioned officers wore the U.S. Navy officer crest on the beret above the left eyebrow, female petty officers and seamen wore the combination cover's device, and female chief petty officers wore their rate insignia instead. The female black beret's usage was discontinued along with the officer's tiara by the navy in 2016 as part of a naval effort to reduce the number of uniform items, make them appear more unisex, and also due to a lack of widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=NAVADMIN 208/15|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2015/NAV15208.txt|date=September 2015|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Bratislava]] Declaration''' was the result of the conference held on 3 August 1968 for the representatives of the Communist parties and Worker's parties of [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[East Germany]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]], and [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="bratislava declaration august 3rd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C001155/documents/doc41.htm|accessdate=4 April 2014|title=The Bratislava Declaration, August 3, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration was a response to the [[Prague Spring]]. It affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism–Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and declared an implacable struggle against "bourgeois" ideology and all "anti-socialist" forces. The Soviet Union also expressed its intention to intervene in any [[Warsaw Pact]] country if a "bourgeois" system – a pluralist system of several political parties – was ever established.&lt;ref name="ussr czechoslovakia intervention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/cite/czechoslovak1968.htm|accessdate=12 October 2014|title=USSR Czechoslovakia Intervention 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bratislava Declaration and Roadmap]] is an unrelated document that was the outcome of an informal meeting of the 27 heads of state or government on September 16, 2016, chaired by [[Donald Tusk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/09/16-bratislava-declaration-and-roadmap/ "...devoted to diagnose together the present state of the European Union and discuss our common future..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cabinet crisis''' or '''government crisis''' is a situation when the [[government]] is challenged before the [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] period expires, because it threatens to resign over a proposal, or it is at risk at being dismissed after a [[motion of no confidence]], a conflict between the parties in a [[coalition government]] or a [[coup d'état]]. It may also be the result of there being no clear majority willing to work together to form a government.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} During this period a [[caretaker government]] with a limited mandate may take care of the day-to-day affairs of the state, while waiting for a [[snap election]].

"'''Corngate'''" was a political [[scandal]] which took place in [[New Zealand]] in 2002 and involved the suspected release of [[genetically modified maize]] (corn) seed in 2000. 

==Background==
The possibility of the presence of a small percentage of GE corn in a seed shipment from the [[United States|U.S.]] was raised publicly by [[Nicky Hager]] in his book ''[[Seeds of Distrust]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hager|first=Nicky|title=Seeds of Distrust|publisher=Craig Potton Publishing|location=Nelson, N.Z. |year=2002|isbn=0-908802-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage was found well after sowing to be above "allowable limits" of contamination - the allowable limit being zero as the question of the accidental presence of GE content or the unreliability of low level testing had not been considered. The results showing GE contamination were later seen as being a PCR artifact, likely being due to contamination of the samples rather than the corn.

It became politically important due to the [[New Zealand Green Party]] stance on [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] crops. The ruling [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] policy regarding GE research was brought into the argument allowing Corngate to become an election issue as the book, ''Seeds of Distrust'' was released a few months prior to the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 Parliamentary elections]].

A [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]], including members of the Green Party, was formed to investigate the matter. Green Party statements claim the committee was "obstructed" by [[Syngenta]] refusing to release test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Notes on the select committee's "Corngate" report| work =| publisher =| date =2007-10-19| url =http://www.greens.org.nz/factsheets/notes-select-committees-corngate-report?rnd=3346| doi =| accessdate =2007-11-27| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120612063851/http://www.greens.org.nz/factsheets/notes-select-committees-corngate-report?rnd=3346| archivedate =2012-06-12| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final report, released in late 2004, was inconclusive due to a lack of clear evidence, poor reporting in the original incident and the deletion of raw data critical for a full re-evaluation. Scientific assessment highlighted a lack of rigor in the testing procedures at that time and noted failures in the administration and interpretation of the results by the regulatory body, the [[Environmental Risk Management Authority]] (ERMA).

The incident also highlighted the problems of testing for the presence of GMOs down to a regulatory level of zero when all available detection methods have a relatively high base threshold before results become unreliable.   

The scandal was further intensified when news anchor [[John Campbell (broadcaster)|John Campbell]] interviewed Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] about the issue.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dET78Z5b5s Campbell Live video interview with Prime Minister Helen Clark on GE]&lt;/ref&gt; It ended with Clark labelling Campbell a "sanctimonious little creep" due to what she considered the ambush style of the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ME1vBrTXNFwC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22John+Campbell%22+%22Little+creep%22|title=Voters' Veto: The 2002 Election in New Zealand and the Consolidation of Minority Government|isbn=1-86940-309-6|pages=36|first=Jack|last=Vowles|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) later ruled that the infamous "Corngate" interview was unbalanced, unfair and lacked impartiality and objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Authority Releases Decision On 3 News Special|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0307/S00032.htm|work=Scoop: Politics, 4 July 2003|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Corngate is one of many [[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|scandals suffixed with "-gate"]], ultimately originating from the [[Watergate scandal]] in U.S. politics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63481">An '''extrajudicial killing''' (also known as '''extrajudicial execution''') is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any [[Judiciary|judicial proceeding]] or legal process. [[Extrajudicial punishment]]s are mostly seen by humanity to be unethical, since they bypass the [[due process]] of the legal jurisdiction in which they occur.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade union, dissident, religious, and social figures and are only those carried out by the [[State (polity)|state]] government or other state authorities like the armed forces or police, as extra-legal fulfillment of their prescribed role.

Section 3(a) of the [[United States]] [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] contains a definition of extrajudicial killing:

{{quote|a deliberate killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regular constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.

In 1999 [[Belarus]]ian opposition leaders [[Yury Zacharanka]] and [[Viktar Hanchar]] together with his business associate [[Anatol Krasouski]] disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on “opposition scum”. Although the [[State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus]] (KGB) had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The disappearance of journalist [[Dzmitry Zavadski]] in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=16 Years of Silence: Enforced Disappearances in Belarus Must Be Investigated |url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/europe/16-years-of-silence-enforced-disappearances-in-belarus-must-be-investigated/  | newspaper=[[Amnesty International]]|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] claims that Zacharanka, Hanchar, Krasouski and Zavadski likely became victims of extrajudicial executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Report: Belarus:

These included Manuel Contreras, the former head of Chile's [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|National Intelligence Directorate]] (DINA), which served as Pinochet's [[Secret police|secret police.]] He was behind numerous assassinations and human rights abuses such as the 1974 abduction and [[forced disappearance]] of Socialist Party leader [[Victor Olea Alegria]]. Some of the killings were also coordinated with other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone in the so-called [[Operation Condor]]. There were reports of United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement, particularly within its activities in Central and South America that promoted anti-Communist coups.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Ops: The Rise of Special Forces in the CIA, the SAS, and Mossad|last=Geraghty|first=Tony|publisher=Pegasus Books|year=2012|isbn=9781605987613|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While CIA's complicity was not proven, American dollars supported the regimes that carried out extrajudicial killings such as the Pinochet administration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; CIA, for instance, helped create DINA and the agency admitted that Contreras was one of its assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America|last=McSherry|first=Patrice|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=9780742536876|location=Lanham, MD|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== El Salvador ==
During the [[El Salvador Civil War|Salvadoran civil war]], death squads achieved notoriety when far-right vigilantes assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] for his social activism in March 1980. In December 1980, [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|four Americans—three nuns and a lay worker—were raped and murdered]] by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of peasants and activists, including such notable priests as [[Rutilio Grande]]. Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and training from American advisors during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, these events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} although death squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well.

== Honduras ==
Honduras also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was [[Battalion 316]].  Hundreds of people, including teachers, politicians and union bosses, were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-negroponte1a-story.html|title=When a wave of torture and murder staggered a small U.S. ally, truth was a casualty.|first=Gary Cohn and Ginger|last=Thompson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran ==
{{See also|Chain Murders of Iran}}

In 1953 a regime was installed through the efforts of the American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the British [[MI6]] in which the Shah (hereditary monarch) [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] used [[SAVAK]] death squads (also trained by the CIA) to imprison, torture and/or kill hundreds of dissidents.  After the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] death squads were used to an even greater extent by the new Islamic government. In 1983, the CIA gave the Supreme Leader of Iran—[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]—information on [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was probably used. The Iranian government later used death squads occasionally throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; however by the 2000s it seems to have almost entirely, if not completely, ceased using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/the-chain-murders-1988-1998.html|title=The Chain Murders|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=October 29, 2018|website=Tehran Bureau|publisher=PBS|last=Sahim|first=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iraq ==
[[Iraq]] was formed by the partition and domination of various tribal lands by the British in the early 20th century. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. [[King Ghazi]] of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), for fear that the government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the [[Axis powers]]. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from [[Baghdad]] made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad-hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/9/13/14133/1410/|title=History of Iraq: 1933 - 1939|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has since become increasingly partitioned following the [[Iraq War]] into three zones: a [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish ethnic zone]] to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] ethnic zone to the south. The [[Secularism|secular]] [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] [[Ba'ath Party|Baathist]] leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia (Prime Minister) and Kurdish (President of the Republic) peoples of the nation. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish ([[Peshmerga]]).

There were [[death squad]]s formed by members of every ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. cracks down on Iraq death squads |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/24/iraq.main/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now-Shia police department and army (and militia members posing as members of police or armed forces) formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long-tolerated death squads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1869439,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=US patrols to weed out militias posing as Iraqi police |first=Peter |last=Beaumont |date=September 11, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They possibly had links to the Interior Ministry and were popularly known as the 'black crows'.

The victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni [[insurgency]]. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. These killings are not limited to men; women and children have also been arrested and/or killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='25,000 civilians' killed in Iraq |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4692589.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2005-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these killings have also been part of simple robberies or other criminal activities.

A feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of the ''New York Times'' claimed that the U.S. military had modelled the "Wolf Brigade", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads used in the 1980s to crush the left-wing insurgency in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=Nytimes050501&gt;{{cite news |title=The Way of the Commandos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ARMY.html?ei=5088&amp;en=f0604488a64924cd&amp;ex=1272686400&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-05-01 |first=Peter |last=Maass |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western news organizations such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and [[People (magazine)|''People'']] disassembled this by focusing on aspects such as probable [[militia]] membership, religious ethnicity, as well as uniforms worn by these squads rather than stating the [[United States]]-backed Iraqi government had death squads active in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4719252.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Iraq 'death squad caught in act' |date=February 16, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soviet Union and Russia ==
In [[Bolshevist Russia|Soviet Russia]] since 1918 [[Cheka]] was authorized to execute "counterevolutionaries" without trial. Hostages were also executed by Cheka during the [[Red Terror]] in 1918–1920.

The [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|successors of Cheka]] also had the authority for extrajudicial executions. In 1937–38 hundreds of thousands where executed extrajudicially during the [[Great Purge]] under the lists approved by [[NKVD troika]]s. In some cases the Soviet special services did not arrest and then execute their victims but just secretly killed them without any arrest. For example, [[Solomon Mikhoels]] was murdered in 1948 and his body was run over to create the impression of a traffic accident. The Soviet special services also conducted extrajudicial killings abroad, most notably of [[Leon Trotskiy]] in 1940 in [[Mexico]], [[Stepan Bandera]] in 1959 in Germany, [[Georgi Markov]] in 1978 in London.

In the [[Russian Federation]], a number of journalist murders were attributed to public administration figures, usually where the publications would reveal their involvement in large corruption scandals.

It has been regarded that the [[Alexander Litvinenko assassination theories|Alexander Litvinenko]] murder was linked to Russian special forces.

USA and UK intelligence agents reportedly claim that Russian assassins, some possibly at orders of the government, are behind at least fourteen [[targeted killing]]s on British soil that police called non-suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-police-evidence-russian-assassins-behind-14-suspicious-deaths-british-soil-boris-berezovsky-scot-a7793151.html|title=UK authorities 'overlooked' evidence linking Russia to deaths on British soil|date=16 June 2017|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Israel ==
In a report, [[Amnesty International]] documented incidents that "appear to have been extrajudicial executions" against Palestinian civilians.&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/israeli-forces-must-end-pattern-of-unlawful-killings-in-west-bank/|title=Israeli forces in Occupied Palestinian Territories must end pattern of unlawful killings|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those incidents occurred after Palestinians attempted to attack, and murder, Israelis, but even though the attackers did not pose a serious threat due to soldiers' armor, they were shot without ensuring that the threat was real and without attempt to arrest suspects before resorting to the use of lethal force.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;

Reportedly thousands of [[Human rights in Thailand#Deaths relating to the 2003 war on drugs|extrajudicial killings occurred during the 2003 anti-drug effort]] of [[Thailand]]'s prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].

'''Kirunapartiet''' (The Kiruna Party) is a local [[political party]] in [[Kiruna Municipality]], Sweden. It was founded in 1994 as a splinter group of the local branch of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and was led by [[Lars Törnman]] from 1994 until 2010, when Törnman left the party for the Social Democrats. After Törnman's leaving the party, Henry Emmoth was selected as its new leader.

In the municipal elections in 1994, Kirunapartiet got 33% of the total vote, which meant that the party was the largest of the parties in the municipal government, and got the right to appoint the [[municipal commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kuriren.nu/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleId=4156420 Kirunapartiet: En historisk tillbakablick] ''[[Norrbottens-Kuriren]]'' 12 September 2008, retrieved 14 November 2010 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It held this right until 2006, when the Social Democrats received more votes in the municipal elections of that year. Following Törnman's realignment and a (failed) internal attempt to dissolve the party in favor of a stronger Social Democratic party, the municipal election of 2010 resulted in poor figures for the party.

The Kiruna Party attempted to reach [[Riksdag|parliament]] in 2002 (as a part of the [[Norrbotten Party]] ticket) and [[Norrbotten County]] [[County council|council]] in 2002 and 2006, respectively. In 2006, the party failed by a mere 137 votes to gain representation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8793">{{About|the concept of liberal paternalism, which is sometimes described as a form of soft paternalism|other uses of "soft paternalism"|paternalism}}

'''Libertarian paternalism''' is the idea that it is both possible and legitimate for private and public institutions to affect behavior while also respecting freedom of choice, as well as the implementation of that idea. The term was coined by behavioral economist [[Richard Thaler]] and legal scholar [[Cass Sunstein]] in a 2003 article in the ''American Economic Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, Richard and Sunstein, Cass. 2003. "Libertarian[sic!] Paternalism". ''The American Economic Review'' 93: 175–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors further elaborated upon their ideas in a more in-depth article published in the ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, Cass; Thaler, Richard. 2003. "Libertarian Paternalism is Not an Oxymoron". ''University of Chicago Law Review'' 70(4): 1159–202.&lt;/ref&gt; They propose that libertarian paternalism is [[paternalism]] in the sense that "it tries to influence choices in a way that will make choosers better off, as judged by themselves" (p. 5); note and consider, the concept paternalism specifically requires a restriction of choice. It is [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in the sense that it aims to ensure that "people should be free to opt out of specified arrangements if they choose to do so" (p. 1161). The possibility to opt-out is said to "preserve freedom of choice" (p. 1182). Thaler and Sunstein published ''Nudge'', a book-length defense of this political doctrine, in 2008 (new edition 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, R.H. and Sunstein, C.R. 2009. ''[[Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness]]''. 2d edition. New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Libertarian paternalism is similar to asymmetric paternalism, which refers to policies designed to help people who behave irrationally and so are not advancing their own interests, while interfering only minimally with people who behave rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Camerer, Samuel Issacharoff, George Loewenstein, Ted O’Donoghue &amp; Matthew Rabin. 2003. "Regulation for Conservatives: Behavioral Economics and the Case for “Asymmetric Paternalism”. 151 ''University of Pennsylvania Law Review'' 101: 1211–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such policies are also asymmetric in the sense that they should be acceptable both to those who believe that people behave rationally and to those who believe that people often behave irrationally.

==Examples of policies==
Setting the default in order to exploit the [[default effect]] is a typical example of a soft paternalist policy. Countries that have an "opt-out" system for voluntary [[Organ donation#Opt-in vs. opt-out|organ donation]] (anyone who did not explicitly refuse to donate their organs in the case of accident is considered a donor) experience dramatically higher levels of organ donation consent, than countries with an opt-in system. [[Austria]], with an opt-out system, has a consent rate of 99.98%, while [[Germany]], with a very similar culture and economic situation, but an opt-in system, has a consent rate of only 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thaler |first=Richard H. |title=Opting In vs. Opting Out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/economy/27view.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=4 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68tvQex6c?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/economy/27view.html?_r=1 |archivedate= 4 July 2012 |date=September 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cab drivers in [[New York City]] have seen an increase in tips from 10% to 22% after passengers had the ability to pay using credit cards on a device installed in the cab whose screen presented them with three default tip options, ranging from 15% to 30%.&lt;ref name="NYCcabs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/nyregion/08taxi.html|title=New York’s Cabbies Like Credit Cards? Go Figure|author=Michael M. Grynbaum|date=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, the default contribution rate for most tax-deferred retirement savings plans in the [[United States]] was zero, and despite the enormous tax advantages, many people took years to start contributing if they ever did. [[Behavioral economics|Behavioral economists]] attribute this to the "[[status quo bias]]", the common human resistance to changing one's behavior, combined with another common problem: the tendency to [[procrastination|procrastinate]].  Research by behavioral economists demonstrated, moreover, that firms which raised the default rate instantly and dramatically raised the contribution rates of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, R.H. and Benartzi, S. 2004. "Save More Tomorrow: Using Behavioral Economics to Increase Employee Saving". ''Journal of Political Economy'' 112:164–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raising default contribution rates is also an example of asymmetric paternalism. Those who are making an informed deliberate choice to put aside zero percent of their income in tax deferred savings still have this option, but those who were not saving simply out of inertia or due to procrastination are helped by higher default contribution rates.  It is also asymmetric in the second sense: If you do not believe that defaults matter, because you believe that people will make rational decisions about something as important as retirement saving, then you should not care about the default rate. If you believe that defaults matter, on the other hand, you should want to set defaults at the level that you believe will be best for the largest number of people.

==Criticism of the choice of term==
There has been much criticism of the ideology behind the term, ''libertarian paternalism''. For example, it has been argued that it fails to appreciate the traditional libertarian concern with [[coercion]] in particular, and instead focuses on freedom of choice in a wider sense.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Daniel B. 2004. "Statist Quo Bias" ''Economic Journal Watch'' 1: 260–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that, while libertarian paternalism aims to promote wellbeing, there may be more libertarian aims that could be promoted, such as maximizing future liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Gregory. 2004–2005. "Libertarian Paternalism Is an Oxymoron" ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 99: 1245–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{War}}

This '''list of wars by death toll''' includes death toll estimates of all deaths that are either directly or indirectly caused by war. These numbers usually include the deaths of military personnel which are the direct results of battle or other military wartime actions, as well as the wartime/war-related deaths of soldiers, which are the results of war-induced epidemics, famines, atrocities, genocide, etc.

"An 2 April 2012 New York Times article, "New Estimate Raises Civil War Death Toll," reports that a new study ratchets up the death toll from an estimated 650,000 to a staggering 850,000 people. As horrific as this new number is, it fails to reflect the mortality of former slaves during the war. If former slaves were included in this figure, the Civil War death toll would likely be over a million casualties... the rough 19th century estimate was that 60,000 former slaves died from [war-related diseases and starvation], but doctors treating black patients often claimed that they were unable to keep accurate records due to demands on their time and the lack of manpower and resources... tens of thousands of other slaves who died had no contact with army doctors, leaving no records of their deaths".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perfectionist liberalism''' has been defined by [[Charles Larmore]] (1987) as the "family of views that base political principles on 'ideals claiming to shape our overall conception of the good life, and not just our role as citizens.'"&lt;ref name="MN"&gt;Nussbaum, M. C. (2011), "Perfectionist Liberalism and Political Liberalism." ''Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs'', 39: 3–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CL87"&gt;Larmore, Charles (1987), ''Patterns of Moral Complexity'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larmore, Charles (1996), ''The Morals of Modernity'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Raz]] popularised those ideas. Other important contemporary theorists of liberal perfectionism are [[George Sher]] and [[Steven Wall]]. One can also find liberal perfectionist strands of thought in the writings of early liberals like [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Thomas Hill Green|T.H.Green]].

Perfectionist liberalism (or liberal perfectionism - most, though not all authors use these terms synonymously) is the combination of two ideas: [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|Perfectionism]] and [[Liberalism]]. What makes perfectionist liberalism perfectionist is its embracement of an objective theory of the good life (or of human [[Well-being|well-being]]) and the belief that it is the business of the state to (sometimes) promote the good life of its citizens or (if a cosmopolitanist theory of [[Justice|justice]] is correct) to promote the good life of all human beings. What makes perfectionist liberalism liberal is that it either holds a theory of the good life that gives pride of place to the value of [[Autonomy|autonomy]] or that it holds a theory of the good life from which classical liberal rights and/or the principle of state neutrality can be derived (contingently, yet over a wide range of "close" [[Possible world|possible worlds]]), or both.

Often perfectionism is associated with [[Paternalism|paternalism]]. If the state is to promote the well-being of its citizens, so the reasoning, it also has to intervene with citizen's actions that are not conducive to their well-being. Most perfectionist liberals try to avoid this implication by showing that paternalist state action is self-defeating, i.e. they try to show that the best way for the state to promote the well-being of its citizens is to restraint itself and let each individual to strive for her good by herself. Others bite the bullet and hold that liberalism is compatible with some amount of paternalism.

Among political philosophers it is commonplace that perfectionist liberals derive political principles (that guide political action and the design of political institutions) from a theory of the good life. What is often missed is that a theory of political action is not derivable from a theory of the good life alone. Principles can only be derived from other principles. It is therefore of critical importance that liberal perfectionists commit themselves not only to a theory of the good life but also to a theory of [[Distributive justice|distributive justice]]. [[Utilitarianism]], [[Egalitarianism]], [[Sufficientarianism]] and [[Prioritarianism]] are the standard candidates when it comes to principles of distribution.
 
For Raz, at the centre of his perfectionist liberalism are ''autonomy'' and ''moral pluralism'' and the approach can be contrasted with ''political liberalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, Joseph (1987), "Autonomy, Toleration, and the Harm Principle", in ''Issues in Contemporary Legal Philosophy'', edited by Ruth Gavison, Oxford University Press, pp. 313–33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum]] (2011) notes that elsewhere Larmore (1997) argues that "these views involve controversial ideals of the good life, or views about 'the ultimate nature of the human good.'"

For Nussbaum, ''perfectionist liberalism'' "is a species of a genus of liberal views that might be called “comprehensive liberalisms”" as opposed to "political" or "[[Public reason|public]]" liberalisms. All perfectionist liberalisms are therefore comprehensive while not all comprehensive liberalisms are perfectionist. An eminent case of a comprehensive, yet non-perfectionist liberal theory is lockean [[Libertarianism|libertarianism]], which is build on the ideal of self-ownership rather than on a conception of the good life. For Nussbaum "liberalisms that base political principles on some comprehensive doctrine about human life" cover "not only the political domain but also the domain of human conduct generally."&lt;ref name="MN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CL87"/&gt;. Furthermore, they depart from non-comprehensive (i.e. political or public reason) liberalism in grounding their political principles in a theory of the good (life), while the latter takes an allegedly "neutral" stance which is supposed to be compatible with all kinds of (reasonable) theories of the good (life).

The political history of the [[world]] is the history of the various [[Politics|political entities]] created by the [[human race]] throughout their existence and the way these states define their borders. Throughout history, political entities have expanded from basic systems of [[self-governance]] and [[monarchy]] to the complex [[democracy|democratic]] and totalitarian systems that exist today. In parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type  [[Border|boundaries]], to the national definite boundaries existing today.

==Ancient history==
&lt;!-- Reference, may be useful later on &lt;ref name="ancienttimeline"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baigent |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Baigent |title=Ancient Traces: Mysteries in Ancient and Early History |date=1998 |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=0-670-87454-X |pages=117–119 |chapter=Where Did Our Civilization Come From?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;In ancient history, [[Ancient civilizations|civilizations]] did not have definite boundaries as states have today, and their borders could be more accurately described as [[frontier]]s. [[Sumer#Early Dynastic Period|Early dynastic Sumer]], and [[Ancient Egypt#Early Dynastic Period|early dynastic Egypt]] were the [[first civilization]]s to define their [[border]]s. Moreover, for the past 200,000 years and up to the twentieth century, many people have lived in non-state societies. These range from relatively egalitarian [[Band society|bands]] and [[tribe]]s to complex and highly stratified [[chiefdom]]s.

The first states of sorts were those of early dynastic Sumer and early dynastic Egypt, which arose from the [[Uruk period]] and [[Predynastic Egypt]] respectively at approximately 3000BCE.&lt;ref name="ancientlocations"&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniel |first=Glyn |authorlink=Glyn Daniel |title=The First Civilizations: The Archaeology of their Origins |origyear=1968 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx9FAAAAMAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=New York |isbn=1-84212-500-1 |pages=xiii |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early dynastic [[Egypt]] was based around the [[Nile River]] in the north-east of [[Africa]], the kingdom's boundaries being based around the Nile and stretching to areas where [[oasis|oases]] existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniel |first=Glyn |authorlink=Glyn Daniel |title=The First Civilizations: The Archaeology of their Origins |origyear=1968 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx9FAAAAMAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=New York |isbn=1-84212-500-1 |pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early dynastic [[Sumer]] was located in southern [[Mesopotamia]] with its borders extending from the [[Persian Gulf]] to parts of the [[Euphrates River|Euphrates]] and [[Tigris River|Tigris]] [[river]]s.&lt;ref name="ancientlocations"/&gt;

By 2500 BCE the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], located in modern-day India, Pakistan and Afghanistan had formed. The civilization's boundaries extended 600&amp;nbsp;km inland from the [[Arabian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Patrica S |author2=Stephen G Hyslop |author3=[[Douglas Brinkley]] |author4=Esther Ferington |author5=Lee Hassig |author6=Dale-Marie Herring |editor=Toni Eugene |title=Almanac of World History |year=2003 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |isbn=0-7922-5092-3 |pages=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5gPAQAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

336 BCE saw the rise of [[Alexander the Great]], who forged an empire from various vassal states stretching from modern [[Greece]] to the Indian subcontinent, bringing Mediterranean nations into contact with those of central and southern Asia, much as the Persian Empire had before him.

The Roman Empire (27 BCE - 476 CE) was the first western civilization known to accurately define their borders, although these borders could be more accurately described as frontiers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wrt-intertext.syr.edu/IX/arras.html |title=A World Defined By Boundaries |accessdate=2008-11-21 |work=Intertext |publisher=Syracuse University |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the Empire defining its borders with precision, the borders were allowed to trail off and were, in many cases, part of territory indirectly ruled by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=David H |author2=Jouni Häkli |title=Boundaries and Place: European Borderlands in Geographical Context |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edb-7VL6H0cC |year=2002 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0-8476-9883-1 |pages=19 |chapter=The 'Civilisational' Roots of European National Boundaries |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=edb-7VL6H0cC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman and Greek ideals of nationhood can be seen to have strongly influenced Western views on the subject, with the basis of many governmental systems being on authority or ideas borrowed from Rome or the Greek city-states. Notably, the European states of the Dark Ages and Middle Ages gained their authority from the Roman Catholic religion, and modern democracies are based in part on the example of Ancient Athens.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

After the death of Prophet [[Muhammad]] in 632, the [[Quran]] and the teachings of [[Islam]] inspired the genesis of a new civilization. In less than a century, the Islamic [[Caliphate]] rapidly extended its reach from the Atlantic Ocean and Andalusia in the west to Central Asia in the east. The subsequent [[Muslim]] empires of the [[Umayyads]], [[Abbasids]], [[Fatimids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Seljuqs]], [[Safavids]], [[Mughals]], and [[Ottomans]] were among the most influential and distinguished powers in the world during Middle Ages. The period between the 8th and 13th century saw a flourishing of trade, as well as several advances in science, engineering, medicine and mathematics.
In Western Europe, briefly mostly united into a single state under [[Charlemagne]] around 800CE, a few countries, including [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]], had already effectively become [[nation state]]s by 1,000CE, with a kingdom ([[Icelandic Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] in Iceland's case) largely co-terminus with a people mostly sharing a language and culture.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Over most of the continent, the peoples were emerging around ethnic, linguistic and geographical groups, but this was not reflected in political entities. In particular, [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]], though recognised by other nations as countries where the [[French people|French]], [[Italian people|Italians]] and [[German people|Germans]] lived, did not exist as states largely matching the countries for centuries, and struggles to form them, and define their borders, as states were a major cause of wars in Europe until the 20th century. In the course of this process, some countries, such as [[Poland]] under the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]] and [[France]] in the [[High Middle Ages]], almost ceased to exist as states for periods. The [[Low Countries]], in the Middle Ages as distinct a country as France, became permanently divided, today into [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]. [[Spain]] was formed as a nation state by the dynastic union of small Christian kingdoms, augmented by the final campaigns of the [[Reconquista]] against [[Al-Andaluz]], the vanished country of Islamic [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Exploiting opportunities left open by the Mongolian advance and recession as well as the spread of Islam, Russians took control of their homeland around 1613, after many years being dominated by the Tartars (Mongols). After gaining independence, the Russian princes began to expand their borders under the leadership of many [[tsars]].&lt;ref name="almanac"/&gt; Notably, [[Catherine the Great]] seized the vast western part of [[Ukraine]] from the [[Poles]], expanding Russia's size massively.

In the 15th and 16th centuries three major [[Muslim]] empires formed: the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empire in the Middle East, the Balkans and Northern Africa; the [[Safavid Empire]] in Greater Iran; and the [[Mughul]] Empire in South Asia. These imperial powers were made possible by the discovery and exploitation of [[gunpowder]] and more efficient administration. By the end of the 19th century, all three had declined, and by the early 20th century, with the Ottomans' defeat in [[World War I]], the last Muslim empire collapsed.

In 1700, [[Charles II of Spain]] died, naming [[Phillip of Anjou]], [[Louis XIV]]'s grandson, his heir. Charles' decision was not well met by the British, who believed that Louis would use the opportunity to ally [[France]] and [[Spain]] and attempt to take over Europe. Britain formed the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] with [[Holland]], [[Austria]] and a majority of the [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]] and declared war against Spain in 1702. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] lasted 11 years, and ended when the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] was signed in 1714.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frey|first=Marsha|author2=Linda Frey|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1995|edition=illustrated|isbn=0-313-27884-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrJmCvFY6ocC|accessdate=2009-01-29|title=The Treaties of the War of the Spanish Succession}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than 50 years later, in 1740, war broke out again, sparked by the invasion of [[Silesia]], part of [[Austria]], by King [[Frederick II of Prussia]].

[[File:Luis Guillermo Solís, elecciones abril 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Luis Guillermo Solís]],  then-[[President of Costa Rica]], votes behind a privacy screen]]
The '''secret ballot''', also known as '''Australian ballot'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Australian-ballot]&lt;/ref&gt;, is a voting method in which a [[voter]]'s choices in an [[election]] or a [[referendum]] are anonymous, forestalling attempts to influence the voter by [[intimidation]], blackmailing, and potential [[vote buying]]. The system is one means of achieving the goal of political privacy.

Secret [[ballot]]s are used in conjunction with various [[voting system]]s. The most basic form of secret ballot utilizes blank pieces of paper, upon which each voter writes his or her choice. Without revealing the votes to anyone, the voter would fold the ballot paper and place it in a sealed box, which is emptied later for counting. An aspect of secret voting is the provision of a [[voting booth]] to enable the voter to write on the ballot paper without others being able to see what is being written. Today, printed ballot papers are usually provided, with the names of the candidates or questions and respective check boxes. Provisions are made at the [[polling place]] for the voters to record their preferences in secret, and the ballots are designed to eliminate bias and to prevent anyone from linking voter to ballot.

A problem of privacy arises with moves to improve efficiency of voting by the introduction of [[postal voting]] and [[electronic voting]]. Some countries permit [[proxy voting]], which some argue is inconsistent with voting privacy.

==History==
In [[ancient Greece]], secret ballots were used in several situations,&lt;ref&gt;Saalfeld, Thomas. 1995. On Dogs and Whips: Recorded Votes. In: Herbert Döring. Parliaments and Majority Rule in Western Europe. New York : St. Martin's Press, 1995. Page 531&lt;/ref&gt; like [[ostracism]], and also to remain hidden from people seeking favors.

In [[ancient Rome]], the laws regulating elections were collectively known as ''[[Tabellariae Leges]]'', the first of which was introduced in 139 BC (''[[lex Gabinia tabellaria]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Tabellariae_Leges.html Tabellariae Leges]. [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], D.C.L., LL.D.: [[A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]], John Murray, London, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the practice of casting secret ballots is so commonplace that most voters would not consider that any other method might be used. Other methods which had been used and which are still used in some places and contexts include "oral votes" as well as [[Open ballot system]]s involving the public display of votes or roll calls. Other public voting methods include raising a hand to indicate a vote, or the use of coloured marbles or cards to indicate a voting choice.

Article 31 of the Constitution of the Year III of the revolution (1795)&lt;ref&gt;[[File:wikisource-logo.svg|15px]] [[s:fr:Constitution du 22 août 1795|Full text]] of the Constitution of the Year III on [[Wikisource]] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that "All elections are to be held by secret ballot". The same goes with the [[French Constitution of 1848|constitution of 1848]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Article 24. — Le suffrage est direct et universel. Le scrutin est secret''. [[:s:fr:Constitution du 4 novembre 1848]]&lt;/ref&gt; voters could hand-write the name of their preferred candidate on their ballot at home (the only condition was to write on white paper&lt;ref&gt;''Pour être recevable, chaque vote doit être inscrit sur un papier blanc'' : [[:fr:Élection présidentielle française de 1848]]&lt;/ref&gt;) or receive one distributed on the street.&lt;ref&gt;See the picture captioned '' Distribution des bulletins d'élections dans les rues. L'Illustration du 23 septembre 1848 on [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/suffrage_universel/suffrage-1848.asp Assemblée Nationale website]&lt;/ref&gt; The ballot was folded in order to prevent other people from reading its contents.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] attempted to abolish the secret ballot for the 1851 [[plebiscite]] with an electoral [[decree]] requesting electors to write down "yes" or "no" (in French: "oui" or "non") under the eyes of everyone. But he faced strong opposition and finally changed his mind, allowing secret ballot to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]] [[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]] : ''For the bourgeois and the shopkeeper had learned that in one of his decrees of December 2 Bonaparte had abolished the secret ballot and had ordered them to put a "yes" or "no" after their names on the official registers. The resistance of December 4 intimidated Bonaparte. During the night he had placards posted on all the street corners of Paris announcing the restoration of the secret ballot. '' [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch07.htm Full text (chapter VII)]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the official web site of the ''[[Assemblée nationale]]'' (the lower house of the French parliament), the [[voting booth]] was permanently adopted only in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/suffrage_universel/suffrage-1870.asp#gauche|title=Le suffrage universel - Histoire - Assemblée nationale|first=Assemblée|last=Nationale|website=www.assemblee-nationale.fr|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:William Hogarth 031.jpg|thumb|''[[Humours of an Election|The Polling]]'' by [[William Hogarth]] (1755). Before the secret ballot was introduced, voter intimidation was commonplace.]]
[[File:Cardiganshire Election ballot paper 1880.jpg|thumb|A British ballot paper from 1880]]

The demand for a secret ballot was one of the six points of [[Chartism]].&lt;ref&gt;In the words of the [[petition]] that was published in 1838:

: [http://www.chartists.net/The-six-points.htm ''"The suffrage, to be exempt from the corruption of the wealthy and the violence of the powerful, must be secret."'']&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] of the time refused even to consider the Chartist demands, but it is notable that [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]], in his speech of 1842, while rejecting Chartism's six points as a whole, admitted that the secret ballot was one of the two points he could support.

The [[London School Board]] election of 1870 was the first large-scale election by secret ballot in Britain.

After several failed attempts (several of them spearheaded by [[George Grote]]&lt;ref&gt;Kinzer, Bruce (2004), "George Grote, the Philosophical Radical and Politician", Brill's Companion to George Grote and the Classical Tradition, London: Brill, pp. 16–45&lt;/ref&gt;), the secret ballot was eventually extended generally in the [[Ballot Act 1872]], substantially reducing the cost of campaigning (as [[treating]] was no longer realistically possible) and was first used on [[Pontefract by-election, 1872|15 August 1872]] to re-elect [[Hugh Childers]] as MP for [[Pontefract (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontefract]] in a [[ministerial by-election (UK)|ministerial by-election]] following his appointment as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. The original [[ballot box]], sealed in wax with a liquorice stamp, is held at Pontefract museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/WryVwsknTr-aa4IQ-ID9iQ|title=BBC - A History of the World - Object : Pontefract's secret ballot box, 1872|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[#Secrecy vs. reliability|use of numbered ballots]] makes it possible in theory if given access to the relevant documents, to identify which candidate voters voted for. Meaning voting in the UK is not physically secret only in so much as the law says the information should not be accessed.

===Australia and New Zealand===

In Australia, secret balloting appears to have been first implemented in [[Tasmania]] on 7 February 1856.

Until the original Tasmanian ''Electoral Act 1856'' was "re-discovered" recently, credit for the first implementation of the secret ballot often went to Victoria, where it was pioneered by the former mayor of Melbourne, [[William Nicholson (Australian politician)|William Nicholson]],&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, G 2016, ‘’The story of Australia’s people: the rise and rise of a new Australia’’, Viking, Penguin Random House, Ringwood, Victoria, Australia, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; and simultaneously [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Terry Newman, {{cite web|url= http://www.mumble.com.au/enrollingthepeople/tasmania/newman_tasmania_and_secret_ballot.pdf |title=Tasmania and the Secret Ballot }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(144&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} (2003), 49(1) ''Aust J Pol &amp; Hist 93'', accessed May 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria enacted [[Electoral Act 1856|legislation]] for secret ballots on 19 March 1856,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-21.html|title=Documenting Democracy|website=foundingdocs.gov.au|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South Australian Electoral Commissioner [[William Boothby]] generally gets credit for creating the system finally enacted into law in South Australia on 2 April of that same year (a fortnight later). The other Australian colonies followed: [[New South Wales]] (1858), [[Queensland]] (1859), and [[Western Australia]] (1877). [[New Zealand]] implemented secret voting in 1870.

State electoral laws, including the secret ballot, applied for the first election of the Australian Parliament in 1901, and the system has continued to be a feature of federal elections and referenda. 
The [[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]] does not explicitly set out the secret ballot but a reading of sections  206, 207, 325, 327 of the Act would imply its assumption. Sections 323 and 226(4) do however, apply the principle of a secret ballot to polling staff and would also support the assumption.

===United States===
[[File:1900 New York polling place.jpg|thumb|[[New York (state)|New York]] polling place circa 1900, showing [[voting booth]]s on the left.]]
Before 1890, partisan newspapers printed filled-out ballots which party workers distributed on election day so voters could drop them directly into the boxes. All of the states replaced these with secret ballots around 1890, popularly called "Australian ballots." They were printed by the local government and listed all the candidates impartially.&lt;ref&gt;Eldon Cobb Evans, ''A History of the Australian Ballot System in the United States#'' (1917) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=K0KIAAAAMAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=Australian+ballot+1890&amp;ots=5LDOICQPgf&amp;sig=dHpus3EMSE4SWa6sJpHb5a9GHJI#v=onepage&amp;q=Australian%20ballot%201890&amp;f=false online].&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Australian ballot" is defined as having four parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's Seventh New Colligiate Dictionary |url=https://archive.org/stream/webstersseventhn00unse#page/59/mode/1up |publisher=G&amp;C Merriam Company |year=1967 |location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]] |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# an official ballot being printed at public expense,
# on which the names of the nominated candidates of all parties and all proposals appear,
# being distributed only at the polling place and
# being marked in secret.

In the United States, most states had moved to secret ballots soon after the [[United States presidential election, 1884|presidential election of 1884]].  [[Kentucky]] was the last state to do so in 1891, when it quit using an [[oral ballot]]. But seven states did not have government-printed ballots until the 20th century; South Carolina created them in 1950
and Georgia in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;See 1922 Georgia session laws, chapter 530, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first city to start using the Australian ballot in the United States was [[Louisville, Kentucky]], using a ballot drafted by [[Lewis Naphtali Dembitz]], the uncle of and inspiration for future [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court associate justice]] [[Louis Brandeis]], and the first state to adopt the Australian ballot was [[Massachusetts]]. For this reason it is also known as the "[[Massachusetts Ballot Act|Massachusetts ballot]]". In the U.S., voting by secret ballot was universal by 1892 but criminal prohibitions against paying people to vote were only instituted in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/597|title=18 U.S. Code § 597 - Expenditures to influence voting|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections in the United States are mostly held by secret ballot,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Political party|party]] nominating [[caucus]]es in some [[U.S. state]]s (most significantly the leadoff Presidential nominating state of [[Iowa]]) still require an open casting of ballots.&lt;/ref&gt; although some states use mail ballots instead, which violate requirements 3 and 4 of the "Australian ballot", as it is distributed to the home, and potentially marked in the presence of other people. The states of [[Colorado (state)|Colorado]], [[Oregon (state)|Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] conduct all elections by mailed ballots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Washington Secretary of State|title=Vote by Mail in Washington State|url=https://wei.sos.wa.gov/agency/osos/en/voters/Pages/vote_by_mail.aspx|publisher=State of Washington|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution for the state of [[West Virginia]] still allows voters to cast "open ballots".&lt;ref&gt;''See'' W. Va. Const. Art. IV, §2, "In all elections by the people, the mode of voting shall be by ballot; but the voter shall be left free to vote by either open, sealed or secret ballot, as he may elect.".&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
The right to hold elections by secret ballot is included in
numerous [[treaties]] and international agreements that obligate their signatory states:
* Article 21.3 of the ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]'' states, "The will of the people...shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which...shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Article 23 of the ''[[American Convention on Human Rights]] (the Pact of San Jose, Costa Rica)'' grants to every citizen of member states of the [[Organization of American States]] the right and opportunity "to vote and to be elected in genuine periodic elections, which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and by secret ballot that guarantees the free expression of the will of the voters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?docid=3ae6b36510 American Convention on Human Rights, "Pact of San Jose", Costa Rica], Organization of American States, Nov. 22, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paragraph 7.4 of the ''Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE'', obligates the member states of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] to "ensure that votes are cast by secret ballot or by equivalent free voting procedure, and that they are counted and reported honestly with the official results made public."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/14304?download=true Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE], Copenhagen, June 29, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Article 5 of the ''Convention on the Standards of Democratic Elections, Electoral Rights and Freedoms in the Member States of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]'' obligates electoral bodies not to perform "any action violating the principle of voter's secret will expression."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eos.cartercenter.org/uploads/document_file/path/405/Convention_on_Electoral_Standards.pdf Convention on the Stnadards of Democratic Elections, Electoral Rights and Freedoms in the Member States of the Commonwealth of Independent States], Oct. 7, 2002, Chisinau. Unofficial English translation provided by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission), Jan. 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disabled people==
[[File:topvoter2.jpg|thumb|ISG TopVoter, a voting machine which assures secret ballot for voters with disabilities.]]
Ballot design and polling place architecture often denies the [[disabled]] the possibility to cast a vote in secret. In many democracies{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} disabled persons may vote by appointing another person who is allowed to join them in the voting booth and fill the ballot in their name&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mercurio|first=Bryan|date=2003|title=Discrimination in Electoral Law|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/alterlj28&amp;i=284|journal=Alternative Law Journal|volume=28|pages=272-276|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This does not assure secrecy of the ballot.

The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] which entered into force in 2008 assures secret ballot for disabled voters. Article 29 of the Convention requires that all Contracting States protect "the right of the person with [[disabilities]] to vote by secret ballot in [[elections]] and public [[referendums]]". According to this provision, each Contracting State should provide for voting equipment which would enable disabled voters to vote independently and secretly. Some democracies, e.g. the [[United States]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Slovenia]], [[Albania]] or [[India]] allow disabled voters to use electronic [[voting machines]]. In others, among them [[Azerbaijan]], [[Canada]], [[Ghana]], the [[United Kingdom]], and most [[Africa]]n and [[Asia]]n countries, visually impaired voters can use ballots in [[Braille]] or paper ballot templates. Article 29 also requires that Contracting States ensure "that voting procedures, facilities and materials are appropriate, accessible and easy to understand and use." In some democracies, e.g. [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United States]], all the polling places already are fully accessible for disabled voters.

==Secrecy vs. reliability==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
The [[United Kingdom]] secret ballot arrangements are sometimes criticised because it is possible to link a ballot paper to the voter who cast it. Each ballot paper is individually numbered and each elector also has a number. When an elector is given a ballot paper, their number is noted down on the counterfoil of the ballot paper (which also carries the ballot paper number). This means, of course, that the secrecy of the ballot is not guaranteed, if anyone can gain access to the counterfoils, which are locked away securely before the ballot boxes are opened at the count. Polling station officials colluding with election scrutineers may therefore determine how individual electors have voted.

This measure is thought to be justified as a security arrangement so that if there was an allegation of fraud, false ballot papers could be identified. The process of matching ballot papers to voters is formally permissible only if an [[Election Court]] requires it; in fact the Election Court has never made such an order since the secret ballot was introduced in 1872, although reportedly prisoners in a UK prison were observed identifying voters' ballot votes on a list in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-1051,00.html|title=What happens to the voting slips used in British elections after they have been counted? - The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal authority for this system is set out in the Parliamentary Elections Rules in Schedule 1 of the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/electoral_commission_pdf_file/0020/13259/Ballot-Secrecy-2006-12_23827-6127__E__N__S__W__.pdf |title= Factsheet: Ballot secrecy |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081209142843/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/electoral_commission_pdf_file/0020/13259/Ballot-Secrecy-2006-12_23827-6127__E__N__S__W__.pdf |archivedate= 2008-12-09 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(48 [[KiB]])}} (2006), [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission of the United Kingdom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], sometimes the number on the ballot is printed on a perforated stub which is torn off and placed on a ring (like a [[shower curtain]] ring) before the ballot is cast into the ballot box. The stubs prove that an elector has voted and ensure that they can only vote once, but the ballots themselves are both secret and anonymous. At the end of voting day, the number of ballots inside the box should match the number of stubs on the ring, certifying that every ballot was cast by a registered elector, and that none of them were lost or fabricated. Sometimes the ballots themselves are numbered, making the vote trackable. In 2012, this procedure was ruled legal by Federal District Judge [[Christine Arguello]] in Colorado, who determined that the U.S. Constitution does not grant a right to a secret ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_21601455/federal-judge-says-no-constitutional-right-secret-ballot|title=Federal judge says no constitutional right to secret ballot in Boulder case|date=21 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Some people believe that the secret ballot enables election fraud and so should be eliminated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scrap the "secret" ballot - return to open voting|url=http://freepress.org/article/scrap-secret-ballot-return-open-voting|author=Lynne Landes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or supplemented with other ways of verifying voting, such as cryptographically secure receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolving Meaning of the Secret Ballot|url=http://voicevote.org/The_Evolving_Meaning_of_the_Secret_Ballot.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/~davies/secret-ballot.pdf|title=Consequences of the Secret Ballot|author=Todd Davies|publisher=Symbolic Systems Program, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Socialist Movement of the Senegalese Union''' (in [[French language|French]]: ''Mouvement Socialiste d'Union Sénégalaise'') was a splinter-group of [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) in [[Senegal]]. MSUS appeared in 1956 and merged into the [[Senegalese Popular Bloc]] (BPS).

[[File:bouchedefer.jpg|thumb|First issue of ''La Bouche de fer'' (''Mouth of Iron'')]]

The '''Society of the Friends of Truth''' ('''Amis de la Verité'''), also known as the '''Social Club''' (French: 
''Cercle social''), was a French revolutionary organization founded in 1790. It was "a mixture of revolutionary political club, the Masonic Lodge, and a literary salon".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Soboul, ''Historical Dictionary of the French Revolution'', PUF, 1989, page 196&lt;/ref&gt;  It also published an influential revolutionary newspaper, the ''Mouth of Iron''.

==The inception==
The Society of the Friends of Truth was established by [[Nicholas Bonneville]] and [[Claude Fauchet (revolutionist)|Claude Fauchet]], who announced its birth in the popular press on 21 February 1790. The original purpose of the club was to become a "clearing-house" for correspondence between and among scholars from all over Europe. In the spirit of its founders, the club wished to cultivate a "public mandate" under which its activities would be governed. Thus, its newsletter, ''Mouth of Iron'' (''La Bouche de fer''), solicited letters from readers to comment on political affairs and to issue denunciations of counter-revolutionary plots.

The club was actually launched in the month of October 1790, when the sessions "of the Universal Confederation of the Friends of Truth" at the [[Cirque du Palais-Royal]] started. Before an audience that ranged from five thousand to eight thousand people every week, Claude Fauchet, self-appointed "attorney of Truth", lectured on [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s 1762 work ''[[The Social Contract]]''. The club also formulated political theories on democratic government, ultimately dismissing direct democracy in favor of a system that resembled a popularly elected dictatorship that could be dismissed by the citizens whenever its actions became insupportable. The Social Club also advocated steps toward a more equitable distribution of wealth, always with an eye to Rousseau's ideals, but the club did ''not'' support land reform.

The meetings were described in detail in the "Mouth of Iron", which published the proceedings of the Fauchet lectures and discussions and the mail that arrived following them. This publication is important for understanding the genesis of democratic ideas during the [[French Revolution]]. The Social Club was also the first revolutionary group to identify itself clearly as a ''cosmopolitan organization'', meaning that its aims superseded national boundaries. It made appeals to scholars worldwide, and it produced a polyglot edition of the 1791 Constitution for distribution globally. Its goal was to create a universal republic led by scholars.

==Membership and adherents==
Key figures attending the Social Club included [[Nicholas Bonneville]] and [[Claude Fauchet (revolutionist)|Claude Fauchet]], as well as [[Sylvain Maréchal]], [[François-Noël Babeuf|"Gracchus" Babeuf]], [[:fr:Guillaume-François-Charles Goupil de Préfeln|Goupil de Préfeln]], [[Camille Desmoulins]], [[Bertrand Barère]], and the [[Marquis de Condorcet]]. About one-hundred-thirty persons were members and attended meetings regularly.

The meetings were public because the club wanted to show the widest possible audience what discourse in the atmosphere of a [[Salon (gathering)|literary or philosophical salon]] might accomplish. (This explains the choice of the [[Cirque du Palais-Royal]] as a meeting-place, rather than some smaller venue like a private home.) Spectators were invited to ask questions, and a resolution was passed at the end of each session.

In 1791, the membership of the Social Club openly declared themselves [[Republicanism#French and Swiss thought|republicans]]. It then became a meeting place for the [[Girondist]]s, who rivaled the [[Jacobins]] for primacy of republican ideology and action. The club's political orientation was liberal, and it promoted the ideal of a society composed of small and medium economic producers: craftsmen, farmers, merchants, and entrepreneurs.

The members of the Social Club also considered themselves contemporary feminists, and while no remarkable feminist change would come out of the club, the members of the club helped individually to develop the framework for what would become the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]''. [[Olympe de Gouges]], the author of the ''Declaration of the Rights of Woman'', was a member of the club and would often develop her ideas through the liberal conduit of the Social Club. While the members did proclaim themselves supporters of republican ideals publicly, their embrace of feminists ideals was regarded as much more treasonous (and as such, was quite under wraps).&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, Donna. ''Margaret Fuller: Writing a Woman's Life''. (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993). {{ISBN|0-312-09145-1}}, 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1791 on, the club's offices operated a publishing business. It became a center for the dissemination of revolutionary literature, including numerous newspapers, political pamphlets, theatrical works, poetry, posters, etc. A number of seminal authors, [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier#Political views|Louis-Sébastien Mercier]], [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif|Nicolas-Edme Rétif de la Bretonne]], [[Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[Condorcet]], [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]], and [[Jean-Marie Roland]], were published under the club's auspices.

After the fall of the Girondins, the club dissolved. Fauchet was arrested and executed on 31 October 1793. Bonneville, the printer, resumed activity after [[9 Thermidor]] (27 July 1794). His press tried to resurrect the Social Club, but it never regained its previous audience. In a fragmented state, it continued to exist until [[Brumaire]] of year VIII (November 1800). By then, ideologues like [[Pierre Claude François Daunou|Daunou]], [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Volney]], [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton|Daubenton]], and [[Claude Louis Berthollet|Berthollet]] held center stage.

The ''Amis de la Verité'' was fondly remembered, and it became a touchstone for the romantics of the nineteenth century, like [[Charles Nodier]] and [[Victor Hugo]], but it was also highly esteemed among politicians and social theorists such as [[Charles Fourier]], [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], and [[Karl Marx]].

==The ''Mouth of Iron''==

''La Bouche de fer'', the ''Mouth of Iron'', may have derived its name, sardonically, from [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]]'s observation about [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 96 BC)|the consul, Domitius]], "that it was no wonder that a man who had a beard of brass, also had a mouth of iron and a heart of lead."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' xviii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suet"&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Nero,'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], ix. 1. § 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' ii. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Others hold that the name comes from a mailbox in the shape of a lion's mouth, located at the headquarters of the club, at No. 4, rue du Théâtre-Français, where letters, petitions, proposals, denunciations, screeds, and other treatises could be deposited. A third theory is that this name, ''Mouth of Iron'', was the same name as a lodge of freemasons to which Bonneville and Fauchet had once belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Copin-Albancelli]], ''Le drame maçonnique. Le Pouvoir occulte contre la France'', 1908, p.334-335&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the ''Mouth of Iron'' was published in Paris between October 1790 and 28 July 1791, at first, three times per week, then daily, beginning on 22 June 1791. The newsletter contained comments on "The Social Contract" of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, essays by Claude Fauchet, transcripts of speeches by Condorcet, petitions from the ''Club of the [[Cordeliers]]'', etc. A subscription cost thirty-six pounds (livres) per year, and anyone who subscribed was automatically made a member of the Social Club; so, since casual readers and curiosity-seekers were counted as members, the size of the club's membership was probably somewhat overstated.

''La Bouche de fer'' was the origin{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} of the famous quote, often attributed to [[Denis Diderot]]: ''"Quand le dernier des rois sera pendu avec les boyaux du dernier prêtre célibataire, le genre humain pourra espérer être heureux."'' ("When the last king is hanged with the entrails of the last celibate priest, mankind may hope to be happy.")

The '''Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition''' ({{lang-es|Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisición|links=no}}), commonly known as the '''Spanish Inquisition''' (''Inquisición española''), was established in 1478 by [[Catholic Monarchs]] [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]]. It was intended to maintain [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] orthodoxy in their kingdoms and to replace the [[Medieval Inquisition]], which was under [[Pope|Papal control]]. It became the most substantive of the three different manifestations of the wider [[Inquisition|Catholic Inquisition]] along with the [[Roman Inquisition]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]. The "Spanish Inquisition" may be defined broadly, operating in Spain and in all Spanish colonies and territories, which included the Canary Islands, the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and all Spanish possessions in [[Spanish America|North, Central, and South America]]. According to modern estimates, around 150,000 were prosecuted for various offenses during the three centuries of duration of the Spanish Inquisition, out of which between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed.

The Inquisition was originally intended primarily to identify [[heretics]] among those who converted from Judaism and Islam to Catholicism. The regulation of the faith of newly converted Catholics was intensified after the [[Alhambra Decree|royal decrees]] issued in 1492 and 1502 ordering Jews and Muslims to convert to Catholicism or leave [[Crown of Castile|Castile]].&lt;ref name="Prien2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans-Jürgen Prien|title=Christianity in Latin America: Revised and Expanded Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSAbYoBGmxQC|date=21 November 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-22262-5|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Inquisition was not definitively abolished until 1834, during the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]], after a period of declining influence in the preceding century.

The Spanish Inquisition is often cited in popular literature and history as an example of religious intolerance and repression. However, some historians have come to conclude that many of the charges levied against the Inquisition are exaggerated, and are a result of the [[Black Legend#The Spanish Black Legend|Black Legend]] produced by political and religious enemies of Spain, especially England.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamen: The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Previous Inquisitions==
The [[Inquisition]] was created through [[papal bull]], ''[[Ad Abolendam]]'', issued at the end of the 12th century by [[Pope Lucius III]] to combat the [[Albigensian|Albigensian heresy]] in southern France. There were a large number of tribunals of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Papal Inquisition]] in various European kingdoms during the Middle Ages through different diplomatic and political means. In the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], a tribunal of the Papal Inquisition was established by the statute of ''Excommunicamus'' of Pope [[Gregory IX]], in 1232, during the era of the [[Albigensian]] heresy, as a condition for peace with Aragon. The Inquisition was ill-received by the Aragonese, which led to prohibitions against insults or attacks on it. Rome was particularly concerned about the 'heretical' influence of the Iberian peninsula's large Muslim and Jewish population on the Catholic. It pressed the kingdoms to accept the Papal Inquisition after Aragon. Navarra conceded in the 13th century and Portugal by the end of the 14th, however its 'Roman Inquisition' was famously inactive. Castile refused steadily, trusting on its prominent position in Europe and its military power to keep the Pope interventionism in check. By the end of the Middle Ages, [[England]], due to distance and voluntary compliance, and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (future part of Spain) due to resistance and power, were the only Western European kingdoms to successfully resist establishment of the Inquisition in their realms.

===Medieval Inquisition in Aragon===
Although [[Raymond of Penyafort]] was not an inquisitor, as a canon lawyer and the king's advisor, [[James I of Aragon]], had often consulted him on questions of law regarding the practices of the Inquisition in the king's domains.
"...[T]he lawyer's deep sense of justice and equity, combined with the worthy Dominican's sense of compassion, allowed him to steer clear of the excesses that were found elsewhere in the formative years of the inquisitions into heresy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BEfrDPxlraYC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=Raymond+of+Penyafort+%2B+inquisition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VZ5vbpyeWK&amp;sig=DNuuDEXkW1ypFlYVBrL5Ugb0P8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwxaWi7KPLAhXHw4MKHbH7Dx8Q6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Raymond%20of%20Penyafort%20%20%20inquisition&amp;f=false Smith, Damian J., ''Crusade, Heresy and Inquisition in the Lands of the Crown of Aragon'', Brill, 2010] {{ISBN|9789004182899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its early implantation, the Papal inquisition was greatly resisted within the crown of Aragon by both population and monarchs.
With time, its importance was diluted, and, by the middle of the fifteenth century, it was almost forgotten although still there according to the law.

Regarding the living conditions of minorities, the kings of Aragon and other monarchies imposed some discriminatory taxation of religious minorities, so false conversions were a way of tax evasion.

In addition to said discriminatory legislation, Aragon had laws specifically targeted at protecting minorities. For example, crusades attacking Jewish or Muslim subjects of the King of Aragon while on their way to fight in the reconquest were punished with death by hanging. Up to the 14th century, the census and weddings records show an absolute lack of concern with avoiding intermarriage or blood mixture so present in other areas. Both the Roman Inquisition and neighbouring Christian powers showed discomfort with these two aspects of Aragonese law and lack of concern with ethnicity, but to little effect.
High-ranking officials of Jewish religion were not as common as in Castile, but were not unheard of either.&lt;ref&gt;Parrilla, Gonzalo Fernández, Miguel Hernando De Larramendi, and José Sangrador Gil.

===Medieval Inquisition in Castile===

There was never a tribunal of the Papal Inquisition in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], nor any inquisition during the Middle Ages. Members of the [[episcopate]] were charged with surveillance of the faithful and punishment of transgressors, always under the direction of the king.

During the Middle Ages, in Castile, little to no attention was paid to heresy by the Catholic ruling class, or by the population. Castile didn´t see proliferation of anti Jew panflets like England and France did during the 13th and 14th century, and those who have been found had modified, somehow watered down versions form the original stories&lt;ref&gt;Hassán, Iacob; Izquierdo Benito, Ricardo (2001). Universidad de Castilla La Mancha, ed. Judíos en la literatura española(Jews in Spanish Literature). España&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2018}}. Jews and Muslims were tolerated and generally allowed to follow their traditional customs in domestic matters.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The legislation regarding Muslims and Jews in Castilian territory varied greatly, becoming more intolerant during the period of great instability and dynastic wars that occurred by the end of the 14th century. The Castilian law is particularly difficult to summarize since due to the model of the free [[Royal Villas]] mayors and the population of border areas had the right to create their own [[fueros]] (law) that varied from one villa to the next. In general, the Castilian model was parallel to the initial model of Islamic Spain. Non-Catholics were subject to discriminatory legislation regarding taxation and some other specific discriminatory legislation-such as prohibition of wearing silk or "flashy clothes" &lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"&gt;Suárez Fernández, Luis (2012). La expulsión de los judíos. Un problema europeo. Barcelona: Ariel.&lt;/ref&gt;- that varied from county to county, but were left alone besides that. Forced conversion of minorities was against the law, and so was the belief in the existence of witchcraft, oracles or similar superstitions. In general, all "people from the book" were permitted to practice their own customs and religions as far as they did not attempt proselytizing on the Christian population. Jews particularly had surprising freedoms and protections compared to other areas of Europe and were allowed to hold high public offices such as the counselor, treasurer or secretary for the crown.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

During most of the medieval period intermarriage with converts was allowed and encouraged. The intellectual cooperation between religions was the norm in Castile. Some examples are the [[Toledo School of Translators]] from the 11th century. Jews and morsicos were allowed to hold high offices in the administration.&lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"/&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2018}}

A tightening of the laws to protect the right of Jews to collect loans during the Medieval Crisis, was one of the causes of the revolt against [[Peter the Cruel]] and catalyst of the anti-semitic episodes of 1490 in Castile, a kingdom that had shown no significant antisemitic backlash to the black death an drought crisis of the early 14th century. Even after the sudden increase in hostility towards other religions that the kingdom experienced after the 14th century crisis, which clearly worsened the living conditions of non-Catholics in Castile, it remained one of the most tolerant kingdoms in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, César Mantilla. Derecho De Los Judíos De Castilla En La Época De Su Expulsión(Legal Rights of Jews in Castile at the Time of their Expulsion). Valladolid: Maxtor, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2018}}

The kingdom had serious tensions with Rome regarding the Church's attempts to extend its authority into it. A focuss of conflict was Castilian resistance to truly abandon the [[mozarabic rite]], and the refusal to grant Papal control over Reconquest land (a request Aragon and Portugal conceded). This conflicts added up with a strong resistance to allow the creation of an Inquisition, and the kingdom´s general willingness to accept the heretics that came in seeking refuge from prosecution in France.

==Creation of the Spanish Inquisition==
There are several hypotheses of what prompted the creation of the tribunal after [[La Convivencia|centuries of outstanding tolerance]] (within the context of medieval Europe). The truth is probably a combination of varieties of them.

===The "Too Multi-Religious" hypothesis===
The Spanish Inquisition (Inquisición Española) can be interpreted as a response to the multi-religious nature of Spanish society following the [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the Muslim [[Moors]]. After invading in 711, large areas of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by Muslims until 1250, when they were restricted to Granada, which fell in 1492. However, the Reconquista did not result in the total expulsion of Muslims from Spain, since they, along with Jews, were tolerated by the ruling Christian elite. Large cities, especially [[Seville]], [[Valladolid]] and [[Barcelona]], had significant Jewish populations centered in [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Juderia]], but in the coming years the Muslims were increasingly subjugated by alienation and torture.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Post-reconquest medieval Spain has been characterized by [[Americo Castro]] as a society of relatively peaceful co-existence (''convivencia'') punctuated by occasional conflict among the ruling Catholics and the Jews and Muslims. However, as historian Henry Kamen notes, the "so-called convivencia was always a relationship between unequals."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their legal inequality, there was a long tradition of Jewish service to the crown of Aragon and Jews occupied many important posts, both religious and political. Castile itself had an unofficial [[rabbi]]. Ferdinand's father [[John II of Castile|John II]] named the Jewish [[Abiathar Crescas]] to be Court [[Astronomer]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Antisemitic]] attitudes increased all over Europe during the late 13th century and throughout the 14th century. England and France expelled their [[Jewish]] populations in 1290 and 1306 respectively.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=79}}  At the same time, during the [[Reconquista]], Spain's anti-Jewish sentiment steadily increased. This prejudice climaxed in the summer of 1391 when violent anti-Jewish riots broke out in Spanish cities like [[Barcelona]]{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=82}}  To linguistically distinguish them from non-converted or long-established Catholic families, new converts were called [[conversos]], or New Catholics.

According to Don [[Hasdai Crescas]], persecution against Jews began in earnest in [[Seville]] in 1391, on the 1st day of the lunar month Tammuz (June).&lt;ref name="Crescas"&gt;Letter of Hasdai Crescas, ''Shevaṭ Yehudah'' by [[Solomon ibn Verga]] (ed.

So, too, many Jews who resided in the neighboring provinces of [[Province of Lleida|Lérida]] and Gironda and in the kingdom of  [[Valencia, Spain|València]] had been affected,&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon ibn Verga]], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/39487 ''Shevaṭ Yehudah'' (The Sceptre of Judah)], Lvov 1846, pp. 41 (end) – 42 in PDF); {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=17}}. Kamen cites approximate numbers for Valencia (250) and Barcelona (400), but no solid data about Córdoba.&lt;/ref&gt; as were also the Jews of [[Al-Andalus]] (Andalucía),&lt;ref&gt;According to Gedaliah Ibn Yechia, these disturbances were caused by a malicious report spread about the Jews. See: [[Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph|Gedaliah Ibn Yechia]], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/6618 ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah''] Jerusalem 1962, p. רסח, in PDF p. 277 (top) (Hebrew); Solomon ibn Verga, ''Shevat Yehudah'', Lvov 1846 (p. 76 in PDF) (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas many died a martyr’s death, while others converted in order to save themselves.

Encouraged by the preaching of [[Ferrand Martinez]], [[Archdeacon]] of [[Ecija]], the general unrest affected nearly all of the Jews in Spain, during which time an estimated 200,000 Jews changed their religion or else concealed their religion, becoming known in Hebrew as "Anūsim",&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Zacuto]], ''Sefer Yuchasin'', [[Cracow]] 1580 (q.v. [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/11550 ''Sefer Yuchasin''], p. 266 in PDF) (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, "those who are compelled [to hide their religion]." Only a handful of the more principal persons of the Jewish community managed to escape, who had found refuge among the viceroys in the outlying towns and districts.&lt;ref name="Crescas" /&gt;

Forced baptism was contrary to the law of the Catholic Church, and theoretically anybody who had been forcibly baptized could legally return to Judaism. Legal definitions of the time theoretically acknowledged that a forced baptism was not a valid sacrament, but confined this to cases where it was literally administered by physical force: a person who had consented to baptism under threat of death or serious injury was still regarded as a voluntary convert, and accordingly forbidden to revert to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond of Peñafort]], ''Summa'', lib. 1 p.33, citing D.45 c.5.&lt;/ref&gt; After the public violence, many of the converted "felt it safer to remain in their new religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, after 1391, a new social group appeared and were referred to as ''[[conversos]]'' or ''New Christians''. Many ''conversos'', now freed from the anti-Semitic restrictions imposed on Jewish employment, attained important positions in fifteenth century Spain, including positions in the government and in the Church. Among many others, physicians [[Andrés Laguna]] and Francisco Lopez Villalobos (Ferdinand's court physician), writers [[Juan del Enzina]], [[Juan de Mena]], [[Diego de Valera]] and [[Alonso de Palencia]], and bankers [[Luis de Santangel]] and Gabriel Sanchez (who financed the voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]]) were all ''conversos''. ''Conversos'' – not without opposition – managed to attain high positions in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, at times becoming severe detractors of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Notably Bishop [[Pablo de Santa Maria]], author of ''Scrutinium Scripturarum'', [[Jeronimo de Santa Fe]] (''Hebraomastix'') and [[Pedro de la Caballeria]] (''Zelus Christi contra Judaeos''). All three were ''conversos''. ({{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=39}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Some even received titles of nobility, and as a result, during the following century some works attempted to demonstrate that virtually all of the nobles of Spain were descended from Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Notably the ''Libro verde de Aragon'' and ''Tizón de la nobleza de España'' (cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=38}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Enforcement Across Borders" hypothesis===
According to this hypothesis, the Inquisition was created to standardize the variety of laws and many jurisdictions Spain was divided into. It would be an administrative program analogous to the [[Santa Hermandad]] (the "Holy Brotherhood", a law enforcement body, answering to the crown, that prosecuted thieves and criminals across counties in a way local county authorities could not, ancestor to the [[Guardia Civil]]), an institution that would guarantee uniform prosecution of crimes against royal laws across all local jurisdictions.

The Kingdom of Castile had been prosperous and successful in Europe thanks in part to the unusual authority and control the king exerted over the nobility, which ensured political stability and kept the kingdom from being weakened by in-fighting (as was the case in England, for example). However, under the [[Trastamara]] dynasty, both the kings of Castile and Aragon had lost power to the great nobles, who now formed dissenting and conspiratorial factions. Taxation and varying privileges differed from county to county, and powerful noble families constantly extorted the kings to attain further concessions, particularly in Aragon.

The main goals of the reign of the Catholic Monarchs were to strengthen royal power to guarantee stability, and to unite their two kingdoms. In this, they sought to further unify the laws of their realms and reduce the power of the nobility in certain local areas. They attained this partially by raw military strength, by creating a combined army between the two of them that could outmatch the army of most noble coalitions in the Peninsula. However, it was impossible to change the entire laws of both realms by force alone, and due to reasonable suspicion of one another, the monarchs kept their kingdoms separate during their lifetimes. The only way to unify both kingdoms and ensure that Isabella, Ferdinand, and their descendants maintained the power of both kingdoms without uniting them in life was to find, or create, an executive, legislative and judicial arm directly under the Crown empowered to act in both kingdoms. This goal, the hypothesis goes, might have given birth to the Spanish Inquisition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Spanish Inquisition: a History. Joseph Pérez - Yale University Press - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious organization to oversee this role was obvious: Catholicism was the only institution common to both kingdoms, and the only one with enough popular support that the nobility could not easily attack it. Through the Spanish Inquisition, Isabella and Ferdinand created a personal police force and personal code of law that rested above the structure of their respective realms without altering it or mixing them, and that could operate freely in both. As the Inquisition had the backing of both kingdoms, it would exist independent of both the nobility and local interests of either kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Joseph (2012) [2009]. Breve Historia de la Inquisición en España. Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|978-84-08-00695-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, the prosecution of heretics would be secondary, or simply not considered different at the time from the prosecution of conspirators, traitors, or groups of any kind who planned to resist royal authority. At the time, royal authority rested on divine right and on oaths of loyalty held before God, so the connection between religious deviation and political disloyalty would appear obvious. This hypothesis is supported by the disproportionately high representation of the nobility and high clergy among those investigated by the Inquisition, as well as by the many administrative and civil crimes the inquisition prosecuted. The Inquisition prosecuted the counterfeiting of royal seals and currency, ensured the effective transmission of the orders of the kings, and verified the authenticity of official documents traveling through the kingdoms, especially from one kingdom to the other. See "Non-Religious Crimes".&lt;ref&gt;Canessa De Sanguinetti, Marta. El Bien Nacer: Limpieza De Oficios Y Limpieza De Sangre : Raíces Ibéricas De Un Mal Latinoamericano. Taurus, Ediciones Santillana, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The "Placate Europe" hypothesis===

At a time in which most of Europe had already [[History of the Jews in the Middle Ages|expelled the Jews from the Christian kingdoms]] the "dirty blood" of Spaniards was met with open suspicion and contempt by the rest of Europe. As the world became smaller and foreign relations became more relevant to stay in power this foreign image of "being the seed of jews and moors" may have become a problem. In addition, the coup that allowed Isabella to take the throne from [[Joana of Portugal|Joana of Avis]] and the Catholic Monarchs to marry had stranged Castile from Portugal, its historical ally, and created the need for new relationships. Similarly, Aragon's ambitions lied in control of the Mediterranean and the defence against France. As their [[Catholic Monarchs|policy of royal marriages]] proved, the Catholic Monarchs were deeply concerned about France's growing power and expected to create strong dynastic alliances across Europe. In this scenario, the Iberian reputation of being too tolerant was a problem. 
Despite the prestige earned through the reconquest ([[reconquista]]) that foreign image on Spaniards coexisted with an almost universal image of heretics and "bad Christians" due to the long coexistence between the three religions, they had accepted in their lands. Anti-Jews stereotypes created to justify or prompt the expulsion and expropriation of the European Jews were also applied to Spaniards in most European courts, and the idea of them being "greedy, gold-thirsty, cruel and violent", "like Jews", due to the "Jewish and Moorish blood" was prevalent in Europe before America was discovered by Europeans. Chronicles by foreign travelers circulated through Europe, describing the tolerant ambiance reigning in the court of Isabela and Ferdinand and how Moors and Jews were free to go about without anyone trying to convert them. Past and common clashes between the Pope and the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, regarding the Inquisition in Castile's case and regarding South Italy in Aragon's case, also reinforced their image of cymatics and heretics in the international courts. These accusations and image could have direct political and military consequences at the time, especially considering that the union two powerful kingdoms were a particularly delicate moment that could prompt the fear and violent reactions from neighbors, even more, if combined with the expansion of the Ottoman Turks on the Mediterranean.
The creation of the Inquisition and the expulsion of both Jews and Moriscos may have been part of a strategy to whitewash the image of Spain and ease international fears regarding Spain's allegiance. In this scenario, the creation of the Inquisition could have been part of the catholic's Monarch strategy to " turn" away from African allies and "towards" Europe, a tool to turn both actual Spain and Spanish image more European and improve relations with the Pope.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Elvira, Roca Barea María, and Arcadi Espada. Imperiofobia Y Leyenda Negra: Roma, Rusia, Estados Unidos Y El Imperio Español. Madrid: Siruela, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Ottoman Scare" hypothesis===

No matter if any of the previous hypothesis was already operating in the minds of the monarchs, the alleged discovery of Morisco plots to support a possible Ottoman invasion were crucial factors in their decision to create the Inquisition.

At this point in time, the Ottoman Empire was in expansion and making its power noticeable in the Mediterranean and North Africa. At the same time, the Aragonese Mediterranean Empire was crumbling under debt and war exhaustion. Ferdinand reasonably feared that he would not be capable of repelling an Ottoman attack to Spain's shores, especially if the Ottomans had internal help. The regions with the highest concentration of Moriscos were those close to the common naval crossings between Spain and Africa. If the weakness of the Aragonese Naval Empire was combined with the resentment of the higher nobility against the monarchs, the dynastic [[War of the Castilian Succession|claims of Portugal on Castile]] and the two monarch's exterior politic that turned away from Morocco and other African nations in favor of Europe, the fear of a second Muslim invasion - and thus a second Muslim occupation was hardly unfounded. This fear may have been the base reason for the expulsion of those citizens who had either a religious reason to support the invasion of the Ottomans (Moriscos) or no particular religious reason to not do it (Jews). The Inquisition might have been part of the preparations to enforce these measurements and ensure their effectiveness by rooting out false converts that would still pose a threat of foreign espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Abou Al Fadl, K. (1994). Islamic law and Muslim minorities: the juristic discourse on Muslim minorities from the second/eight to the eleventh/seventeenth centuries. Islamic Law and Society, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goosenes, A. (1997). Les inquisitions modernes dans les Pays-Bas meridionaux. 1520-1633. 2 vols. Bruselas&lt;/ref&gt;

In favor of this view there is the obvious military sense it makes, and the many early attempts of peaceful conversion and persuasion that the Monarchs used at the beginning of their reign, and the sudden turn towards the creation of the Inquisition and the edicts of expulsion when those initial attempts failed. The [[History of Naples|conquest of Naples]] by the [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba|Gran Capitan]] is also proof of an interest in Mediterranean expansion and re-establishment of Spanish power in that sea that was bound to generate frictions with the Ottoman Empire and other African nations. So, the Inquisition would have been created as a permanent body to prevent the existence of citizens with religious sympathies with African nations now that rivalry with them had been deemed unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Boronat, P. (1901). Los moriscos españoles y su expulsión. 2 vols. Valencia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical and Religious Reasons===

The creation of the Spanish Inquisition would be consistent with the most important political philosophers of the [[Florentine School]], with whom the kings were known to have contact ([[Guicciardini]], [[Pico della Mirandola]], [[Machiavelli]], Segni, Pitti, Nardi, Varchi…). Both Guicciardini and Machiavelli defended the importance of centralization and unification in order to create a strong state capable of repelling foreign invasions, and also warned of the dangers of excessive social uniformity to the creativity and innovation of a nation. Machiavelli considered piety and morals desirable for the subjects but not so much for the ruler, whom should use them as a way to unify its population. He also warned of the nefarious influence of a corrupt church in the creation of a selfish population and middle nobility,  which had fragmented the peninsula and made it unable to resist either France or Aragon. German philosophers at the time were spreading the importance of a vassal to share the religion of their lord.

The Inquisition may have just been the result of putting these ideas into practice. The use of religion as a unifying factor across a land that was allowed to stay diverse and maintain different laws in other respects, and the creation of the Inquisition to enforce laws across it, maintain said religious unity and control the local elites were consistent with most of those teachings.

Alternatively, the enforcement of Catholicism across the realm might indeed be the result of simple religious devotion or a belief in a mystic religious ditty by the monarchs. The recent scholarship on the expulsion of the Jews leans towards the belief of religious motivations being at the bottom of it.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Nancy Rubin. Isabella of Castile: The First Renaissance Queen. New York: ASJA Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; but considering the reports on Ferdinand's political persona that is unlikely to be the only reason. Ferdinand was described, among others, by Machiavelli, as "a man who didn't know the meaning of piety, but who made political use of it and would had achieved little if he had really known it." He was Machiavelli's main inspiration while writing [[The Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Robert. Machiavelli. Abigdon, Oxon: Routledge, Tylor &amp;, 2013. pp83-120 (the quote is paraphrased)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Keeping the Pope in Check" hypothesis===

The hierarchy of the Catholic Church had made many attempts during the Middle Ages to take over Christian Spain politically, such as claiming the Church's ownership over all land reconquered from non Christians (a claim that was rejected by Castille but accepted by Aragon and Portugal). In the past, the papacy had tried and partially succeeded, in forcing out of Iberia the [[mozarabic rite]]. Its meddling attempts had been pivotal for [[Albigensian crusade|Aragon's lose of Rosellon]]. The [[Crusade of Aragon|meddling regarding Aragon's control over South Italy]] was even stronger historically. In their lifetime, the Catholic Monarchs had [[Carrillo de Acuña|problems with]] [[Pope Paul II]], a very strong proponent of absolute authority of the church over the Kings. Carrillo actively opposed them both and often used Spain's "mixed blood" as an excuse to intervene. The papacy and the monarch of Europe had been involved in a  [[Investiture controversy|war for power all through the high Middle Ages]] that Rome had already won in other powerful kingdoms like [[France]].
Since the legitimacy granted by the church was necessary both, especially Isabella, to stay in power, the creation of the Spanish Inquisition may have been a way to apparently concede to the Pope's demands and criticism regarding Spain's mixed religious heritage, while at the same time ensuring that the Pope could hardly force the second inquisition of his own, and at the same time create a tool to control the power of the Roman Church in Spain.
The Spanish Inquisition was unique at the time because it did not depend on the Pope in the slightest. Once the bull of creation was granted the head of the inquisition was the Monarch of Spain. It was in charge of enforcing the laws of the king regarding religion and other private-life matters, not of following orders from Rome, from which was independent. This independence allowed the Inquisition to investigate, prosecute and convict clergy for both corruptions ([[pedophilia]], forgery of documents..) and possible charges of treason of conspiracy against the crown (on the Pope's behalf presumably) without the Pope's intervention. The inquisition was, despite of its title of "Holy", not formed necessarily by clergy but secular lawyers were equally welcome to it. If it was an attempt at keeping Rome out of Spain, it was an extremely successful and refined one. It was a bureaucratic body which had the nominal authority of the church and permission to prosecute members of the church, which the kings couldn't do while responding only to the Spanish Crown. This did not prevent the Pope from having influence on the decisions of Spanish monarchs of course, but it forced the influence to be through the kings and made direct influence very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;El Rey Y El Papa: Política Y Diplomacia En Los Albores Del Renacimiento (Castilla En El Siglo Xv) Óscar González - Sílex - 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other hypotheses===
Other hypotheses that circulate regarding the Spanish Inquisition's creation include:
*'''Economic reasons''': Since one of the penalties that the inquisition could enforce on the convicts was the confiscation of their property, which became Crown property, it has been stated that the creation of the Inquisition was a way to finance the crown. There is no solid reason for this hypothesis to stand alone, nor for the Kings of Spain to need an institution to do this gradually instead of confiscating property through edicts, but it may be one of the reasons why the Inquisition stayed for so long. This hypothesis notices the tendency of the Inquisition to operate in large and wealthy cities and is favoured for those who consider that most of those prosecuted for practising Judaism and Islam in secret were actually innocent of it.&lt;ref name="Spain 1966"&gt;The Marranos of Spain. From the late XIVth to the early XVIth Century, 1966. Ithaca, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gustav Bergenroth]] editor and translator of the Spanish state papers 1485-1509 believed that revenue was the incentive for Ferdinand and Isabella's decision to invite the Inquisition into Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/spain/vol1/i-lxxiii Calendar of State Papers, Spain, Vol. 1, 1485-1509; intro.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors point out that both monarchs were very aware of the economic backlash they would suffer from such decrease in population.
*'''Intolerance and racism''': This argument is usually made regarding the expulsion of the Jews or the Moriscos,&lt;ref name="Spain 1966"/&gt; and since the Inquisition was so closely interconnected with those actions can be expanded to it. It varies between those who deny that Spain was really that different to the rest of Europe regarding tolerance and openmindedness, and those who argue that it used to be but gradually the antisemitic and racism atmosphere of medieval Europe rubbed onto it. It explains the creation of the Inquisition as the result of exactly the same forces than the creation of similar entities across Europe. This view may account for the similarities between the Spanish Inquisition and similar institutions but completely fails to account for its many unique characteristics, including its time of appearance and its duration through time, so even if accepted requires the addition of some of the other hypothesis to be complete.&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish Inquisition: a History
Joseph Pérez - Yale University Press - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Purely religious reasons''': essentially this view suggests that the Catholic Monarchs created the Inquisition to prosecute heretics and sodomites "because the Bible says so". A common criticism that this view receives is that the Bible also condemns greed, hypocrisy, and adultery, but the Inquisition was not in charge of prosecuting any of those things. It also did not prosecute those who did not go to mass on Sunday or otherwise broke the Catholic rituals as far as it was out of simple laziness. Considering this double standard, its role was probably more complex and specific.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Activity of the Inquisition==

===Start of the Inquisition===
Fray Alonso de Ojeda, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar from Seville, convinced [[Queen Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of the existence of [[Crypto-Judaism]] among [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] ''[[conversos]]'' during her stay in [[Seville]] between 1477 and 1478.&lt;ref&gt;The terms ''converso'' and crypto-Jew are somewhat vexed, and occasionally historians are not clear on how, precisely, they are intended to be understood. For the purpose of clarity, in this article ''converso'' will be taken to mean one who has sincerely renounced Judaism or Islam and embraced Catholicism. Crypto-Jew will be taken to mean one who accepts Christian baptism, yet continues to practice Judaism.&lt;/ref&gt; A report, produced by [[Pedro González de Mendoza]], Archbishop of Seville, and by the Segovian Dominican [[Tomás de Torquemada]], corroborated this assertion.

Spanish monarchs [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] requested a [[papal bull]] establishing an inquisition in Spain in 1478 in response to the ''conversos'' returning to the practice of Judaism. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] granted a bull permitting the monarchs to select and appoint two or three priests over forty years of age to act as inquisitors.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=85}} In 1483, [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] established a state council to administer the inquisition with the Dominican Friar [[Tomás de Torquemada]] acting as its president, even though Sixtus IV protested the activities of the inquisition in [[Aragon]] and its treatment of the ''conversos''. Torquemada eventually assumed the title of Inquisitor-General.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=89}}

[[Thomas F. Madden]] describes the world that formed medieval politics: "The Inquisition was not born out of desire to crush diversity or oppress people; it was rather an attempt to stop unjust executions. Yes, you read that correctly. Heresy was a crime against the state. Roman law in the [[Code of Justinian]] made it a capital offense. Rulers, whose authority was believed to come from God, had no patience for heretics".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Madden: The Real Inquisition. National Review 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchs decided to introduce the Inquisition to [[Castile (Spain)|Castile]] to discover and punish crypto-Jews, and requested the pope's assent. [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] pressured Pope Sixtus IV to agree to an Inquisition controlled by the monarchy by threatening to withdraw military support at a time when the Turks were a threat to Rome. The pope issued a [[papal bull|bull]] to stop the Inquisition but was pressured into withdrawing it.  On 1 November 1478, Sixtus published the [[Papal bull]], ''Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus'', through which he gave the monarchs exclusive authority to name the inquisitors in their kingdoms. The first two inquisitors, [[Miguel de Morillo]] and [[Juan de San Martín]], were not named, however, until two years later, on 27 September 1480 in [[Medina del Campo]].

The first ''[[auto-da-fé]]'' was held in Seville on 6 February 1481: six people were burned alive. From there, the Inquisition grew rapidly in the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. By 1492, tribunals existed in eight Castilian cities: [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], [[Medina del Campo]], [[Segovia]], [[Sigüenza]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and [[Valladolid]]. Sixtus IV promulgated a new [[papal bull|bull]] categorically prohibiting the Inquisition's extension to [[Aragón]], affirming that:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | ... many true and faithful Christians, because of the testimony of enemies, rivals, slaves and other low people—and still less appropriate—without tests of any kind, have been locked up in secular prisons, tortured and condemned like relapsed heretics, deprived of their goods and properties, and given over to the [[secular arm]] to be executed, at great danger to their souls, giving a pernicious example and causing scandal to many. | Henry Kamen | The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision}}

According to the book ''A History of the Jewish People'',&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, H.H., editor. 1976. p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | In 1482 the pope was still trying to maintain control over the Inquisition and to gain acceptance for his own attitude towards the [[New Christian]]s, which was generally more moderate than that of the Inquisition and the local rulers. | A History of the Jewish People}}

In 1483, Jews were expelled from all of [[Andalusia]]. Though the pope wanted to crack down on abuses, Ferdinand pressured him to promulgate a new bull, threatening that he would otherwise separate the Inquisition from Church authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Mathew|Archbishop Arnold H. Mathew]], ''The Life and Times of Rodrigo Borgia'', p. 52-53. Quote: "Isabella's Confessor, [[Tomás de Torquemada|Torquemada]], had imbued her with the idea that the suppression of all heresy within her realms was a sacred duty. She had, therefore, in November 1478, obtained a bull from the Pope, Sixtus IV., for the establishment of the Inquisition in Castile. Many modern writers have sought to reduce her share in the introduction of this terrible institution, but it must be remembered that Isabella herself probably considered it a meritorious action to punish with inhuman barbarity those whom she looked upon as the enemies of the Almighty. In 1480, two Dominicans were appointed by her, as Inquisitors, to set up their tribunal at Seville. Before the end of the year 1481, 2,000 victims were burned alive in Andalusia alone. The Pope himself became alarmed and threatened to withdraw the bull, but Ferdinand intimated that he would make the Inquisition altogether an independent tribunal. This it became later for all practical purposes, and its iniquitous proceedings continued unchecked."&lt;/ref&gt; Sixtus did so on 17 October 1483, naming [[Tomás de Torquemada]] Inquisidor General of Aragón, Valencia, and [[Catalonia]].

Torquemada quickly established procedures for the Inquisition. A new court would be announced with a thirty-day grace period for confessions and the gathering of accusations by neighbors. Evidence that was used to identify a crypto-Jew included the absence of chimney smoke on Saturdays (a sign the family might secretly be honoring the Sabbath) or the buying of many vegetables before Passover or the purchase of meat from a converted butcher. The court employed [[Forced confession|physical torture to extract confessions]]. Crypto-Jews were allowed to confess and do penance, although those who relapsed were burned at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, H.H., editor. A History of the Jewish People. Harvard University Press, 1976, pp. 588-590.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1484, Pope [[Innocent VIII]] attempted to allow appeals to Rome against the Inquisition, but Ferdinand in December 1484 and again in 1509 decreed death and confiscation for anyone trying to make use of such procedures without royal permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this, the Inquisition became the only institution that held authority across all the realms of the Spanish monarchy and, in all of them, a useful mechanism at the service of the crown. However, the cities of Aragón continued resisting, and even saw revolt, as in [[Teruel]] from 1484 to 1485. However, the murder of ''Inquisidor'' [[Pedro Arbués]] in [[Zaragoza]] on September 15, 1485, caused public opinion to turn against the ''conversos'' and in favour of the Inquisition. In Aragón, the Inquisitorial courts were focused specifically on members of the powerful ''converso'' minority, ending their influence in the Aragonese administration.

The Inquisition was extremely active between 1480 and 1530. Different sources give different estimates of the number of trials and executions in this period; some estimate about 2,000 executions, based on the documentation of the ''autos-da-fé'', the great majority being ''conversos'' of Jewish origin. He offers striking statistics: 91.6% of those judged in Valencia between 1484 and 1530 and 99.3% of those judged in Barcelona between 1484 and 1505 were of Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False conversions===

The Inquisition had jurisdiction only over Christians. It had no power to investigate, prosecute, or convict Jews, Muslims, or any open member of other religion. Anyone who was known to identify as either Jew or Muslim was outside of Inquisitorial jurisdiction and could only be trialed by the King. All the inquisition could do in some of those cases was to deport the individual according to the King's law, but usually, even that had to go through a Civil Tribunal. The Inquisition only had power to trial those who self-identified as Christians (initially for taxation purposes, later to avoid deportation well) while practicing another religion de facto. Even those were treated as Christians. If they confessed or identified not as "judeizantes" but as fully practicing Jews, they fell back into the previously explained category and could not be targeted (they would have pleaded guilty to lying about being Christians previously though).

====Expulsion of Jews. Jewish ''conversos''====
[[File:An auto-da-fé of the Spanish Inquisition and the execution o Wellcome V0041892.jpg|thumb|Though not subject to the Inquisition, Jews who refused to convert or leave Spain were called heretics and could be burned to death on a stake]]
The Spanish Inquisition had been established in part to prevent ''conversos'' from engaging in Jewish practices, which, as Christians, they were supposed to have given up. However this remedy for securing the orthodoxy of ''conversos'' was eventually deemed inadequate since the main justification the monarchy gave for [[Antisemitism in Spain|formally expelling all Jews from Spain]] was the "great harm suffered by Christians (i.e., ''conversos'') from the contact, intercourse and communication which they have with the Jews, who always attempt in various ways to seduce faithful Christians from our Holy Catholic Faith", according to the 1492 edict.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alhambra Decree]], issued in January 1492, gave the choice between expulsion and conversion. It was among the few expulsion orders that allowed conversion as an alternative and is used as a proof of the religious, not racial, element of the measure. The enforcement of this decree was very unequal however, with the focus mainly on coastal and southern regions-those at risk of Ottoman invasion- and a more gradual and ineffective enforcement towards the interior.&lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"/&gt;

Historic accounts of the numbers of Jews who left Spain were based on speculation, and some aspects were exaggerated by early accounts and historians: [[Juan de Mariana]] speaks of 800,000 people, and [[Don Isaac Abravanel]] of 300,000. While few reliable statistics exist for the expulsion, modern estimates based on tax returns and population estimates of communities are much lower, with Kamen stating that, of a population of approximately 80,000 Jews and 200,000 ''conversos'', about 40,000 emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of the kingdom of Castile emigrated mainly to Portugal (where the entire community was forcibly converted in 1497) and to North Africa. The Jews of the kingdom of Aragon fled to other Christian areas including Italy, rather than to Muslim lands as is often assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the vast majority of ''conversos'' simply assimilated into the Catholic dominant culture, a minority continued to practice Judaism in secret, gradually migrated throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire, mainly to areas where Sephardic communities were already present as a result of the Alhambra Decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murphy | first = Cullen | title = God's jury : the Inquisition and the making of the modern world | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | location = Boston | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0-618-09156-0 | page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most intense period of persecution of ''conversos'' lasted until 1530. From 1531 to 1560, however, the percentage of ''conversos'' among the Inquisition trials dropped to 3% of the total. There was a rebound of persecutions when a group of crypto-Jews was discovered in [[Quintanar de la Orden]] in 1588; and there was a rise in denunciations of ''conversos'' in the last decade of the sixteenth century. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, some ''conversos'' who had fled to Portugal began to return to Spain, fleeing the persecution of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], founded in 1536. This led to a rapid increase in the trials of crypto-Jews, among them a number of important financiers. In 1691, during a number of ''[[autos-da-fé]]'' in [[Majorca]], 37 ''chuetas'', or ''conversos'' of Majorca, were burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eighteenth century the number of ''conversos'' accused by the Inquisition decreased significantly. [[Manuel Santiago Vivar]], tried in Córdoba in 1818, was the last person tried for being a crypto-Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expulsion of the Moriscos and Morisco ''conversos''====
The Inquisition searched for false or relapsed converts among the [[Moriscos]], who had converted from [[Islam]]. Beginning with a decree on February 14, 1502, Muslims in Granada had to choose between conversion to Christianity or expulsion.&lt;ref name="Prien2012" /&gt; In the Crown of Aragon, most Muslims had faced this choice after the [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods]] (1519–1523). It is important to note that the enforcement of the expulsion of the moriscos was enforced really unevenly, especially in the lands of the interior and the north, where the coexistence had lasted for over five centuries and moriscos were protected by the population, and orders were partially or completely ignored.

The [[Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1568–71)|War of the Alpujarras]] (1568–71), a general Muslim/Morisco uprising in Granada that expected to aid an Ottoman disembarc in the peninsula, ended in a forced dispersal of about half of the region's Moriscos throughout Castile and Andalusia as well as increased suspicions by Spanish authorities against this community.

Many Moriscos were suspected of practising Islam in secret, and the jealousy with which they guarded the privacy of their domestic life prevented the verification of this suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Scott: History, Vol II, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially they were not severely persecuted by the Inquisition, experiencing instead a policy of evangelization&lt;ref&gt;Absent records, the Inquisition decreed that all Moors were to be regarded as baptized and thus were Moriscos subject to the Inquisition.  Secular authorities then decreed (in 1526) that 40 years of religious instruction would precede any prosecution.  Fifty Moriscos were burnt at the stake before the Crown clarified its position.  Neither the Church nor the Moriscos utilized the years well. The Moriscos can be stereotyped as poor, rural, uneducated agricultural workers who spoke Arabic.  The Church had limited willingness or ability to educate this now-hostile group.{{harvp|Green|2007|pp=124-127}}&lt;/ref&gt; a policy not followed with those ''conversos'' who were suspected of being crypto-Jews. There were various reasons for this. In the kingdoms of Valencia and Aragon a large number of the Moriscos were under the jurisdiction of the nobility, and persecution would have been viewed as a frontal assault on the economic interests of this powerful social class. Most importantly, the moriscos had integrated in the Spanish society way better than the Jews, intermarrying with the population often, and were not seen as a foreign element, especially in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor J. Dadson, The Assimilation of Spain’s Moriscos:
Fiction or Reality? Journal of Levantine Studies, Vol. 1, No. 2, Winter 2011, pp. 11-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, fears ran high among the population that the Moriscos were traitorous, especially in Granada. The coast was regularly raided by [[Barbary pirate]]s backed by Spain's enemy, the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the Moriscos were suspected of aiding them.

In the second half of the century, late in the reign of Philip II, conditions worsened between [[Old Christians]] and Moriscos. The [[Morisco Revolt]] in Granada in 1568–1570 was harshly suppressed, and the Inquisition intensified its attention on the Moriscos. From 1570 Morisco cases became predominant in the tribunals of [[Zaragoza]], Valencia and Granada; in the tribunal of Granada, between 1560 and 1571, 82% of those accused were Moriscos, who were a vast majority of the Kingdom's population at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still the Moriscos did not experience the same harshness as judaizing ''conversos'' and Protestants, and the number of capital punishments was proportionally less.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609, King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], upon the advice of his financial adviser the [[Duke of Lerma]] and Archbishop of Valencia [[Juan de Ribera]], decreed the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]]. Hundreds of thousands of Moriscos were expelled, some of them probably sincere Christians. This was further fueled by the religious intolerance of Archbishop Ribera who quoted the Old Testament texts ordering the enemies of God to be slain without mercy and setting forth the duties of kings to extirpate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lea|1901|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edict required: 'The [[Moriscos]] to depart, under the pain of death and confiscation, without trial or sentence... to take with them no money, bullion, jewels or bills of exchange.... just what they could carry.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lea|1901|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initial estimates of the number expelled such as those of Henri Lapeyre reach 300,000 Moriscos (or 4% of the total Spanish population), the extent and severity of the expulsion in much of Spain has been increasingly challenged by modern historians such as Trevor J. Dadson.&lt;ref name="bibliotecaspublicas.es"&gt;Trevor J. Dadson:  [http://www.bibliotecaspublicas.es/villarrubiadelosojos/imagenes/Dadson_Assimilation_Reality_or_Fiction.pdf ''The Assimilation of Spain's Moriscos: Fiction or Reality?'']. Journal of Levantine Studies, vol. 1, no. 2, Winter 2011, pp. 11-30&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the eastern region of Valencia, where ethnic tensions were high, was particularly affected by the expulsion, suffering economic collapse and depopulation of much of its territory.

Of those permanently expelled, the majority finally settled in the Maghreb or the Barbary coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boase|first=Roger|date=4 April 2002|title=The Muslim Expulsion from Spain|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=52|issue=4|quote=The majority of those permanently expelled settling in the [[Maghreb]] or [[Barbary Coast]], especially in Oran, Tunis, Tlemcen, Tetuán, Rabat and Salé.

The Inquisition pursued some trials against Moriscos who remained or returned after expulsion: at the height of the Inquisition, cases against Moriscos are estimated to have constituted less than 10 percent of those judged by the Inquisition. Upon the coronation of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] in 1621, the new king gave the order to desist from attempting to impose measures on remaining Moriscos and returnees. In September 1628 the Council of the Supreme Inquisition ordered inquisitors in Seville not to prosecute expelled Moriscos "unless they cause significant commotion." &lt;ref&gt;[http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CHMO/article/view/37358/36158 Michel Boeglin: ''La expulsión de los moriscos de Andalucía y sus límites. El caso de Sevilla (1610-1613)''] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; The last mass prosecution against Moriscos for crypto-Islamic practices occurred in Granada in 1727, with most of those convicted receiving relatively light sentences. By the end of the 18th century, the indigenous practice of Islam is considered to have been effectively extinguished in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4040221 ''Vínculos Historia'': ''The Moriscos who remained. The permanence of Islamic origin population in Early Modern Spain: Kingdom of Granada, XVII-XVIII centuries''] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian Heretics===

The Spanish Inquisition had jurisdiction only over Christians. As such, those who self-identified as Christians could be investigated and trialed by it. Those in the group of "heretics" were all subject to investigation. All forms of heretic Christianity (Protestants, Orthodox, blaspheming Catholics, etc.) were considered under its jurisdiction.

==== Protestants and Anglicans====
[[File:Witch-scene4.JPG|thumb|The burning of a 16th-century Dutch [[Anabaptist]], Anneken Hendriks, who was charged with heresy]]
Despite popular myths about the Spanish Inquisition relating to Protestants, it dealt with very few cases involving actual Protestants, as there were so few in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the [[Inquisition of the Netherlands]], is here not considered part of the Spanish Inquisition. Lutheran was a portmanteau accusation used by the Inquisition to act against all those who acted in a way that was offensive to the church. The first of the trials against those labeled by the Inquisition as "Lutheran" were those against the sect of [[mysticism|mystics]] known as the "[[Alumbrados]]" of [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]] and [[Valladolid]]. The trials were long and ended with prison sentences of differing lengths, though none of the sect were executed. Nevertheless, the subject of the "Alumbrados" put the Inquisition on the trail of many intellectuals and clerics who, interested in [[Erasmian]] ideas, had strayed from orthodoxy. This is striking because both Charles I and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] were confessed admirers of [[Erasmus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such{{clarify|being an intellectual or professing Erasmian ideas/and/or both?|date=June 2014}} was the case with the humanist [[Juan de Valdés]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was forced to flee to Italy to escape the process that had been begun against him, and the preacher, [[Juan de Ávila]], who spent close to a year in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first trials against [[Lutheran]] groups, as such, took place between 1558 and 1562, at the beginning of the reign of Philip II, against two communities of Protestants from the cities of Valladolid and Seville, numbering about 120.&lt;ref&gt;These trials, specifically those of Valladolid, form the basis of the plot of ''The Heretic: A novel of the Inquisition'' by Miguel Delibes (Overlook: 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The trials signaled a notable intensification of the Inquisition's activities. A number of ''[[auto-da-fé|autos-da-fé]]'' were held, some of them presided over by members of the royal family, and around 100 executions took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=99}} gives the figure of about 100 executions for heresy of any kind between 1559 and 1566. He compares these figures with those condemned to death in other European countries during the same period, concluding that in similar periods England, under [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], executed about twice as many for heresy: in France, three times the number, and ten times as many in the [[Low Countries]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''autos-da-fé'' of the mid-century virtually put an end to Spanish Protestantism, which was, throughout, a small phenomenon to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|pp=102-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1562, though the trials continued, the repression was much reduced. About 200 Spaniards were accused of being Protestants in the last decades of the 16th century. &lt;blockquote&gt;Most of them were in no sense Protestants ... Irreligious sentiments, drunken mockery, anticlerical expressions, were all captiously classified by the inquisitors (or by those who denounced the cases) as "Lutheran." Disrespect to church images, and eating meat on forbidden days, were taken as signs of heresy...&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; It is estimated that a dozen Spaniards were burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to notice that Protestantism and Anglicanism were treated as a marker to identify agents of foreign powers and symptoms of political disloyalty as much, if not more, than as a cause of prosecution in itself. Religion, patriotism, obedience to the king and personal beliefs were not seen as separate aspects of life until the end of the Modern Age. Spain especially had a long tradition of using self-identified religion as a political and cultural marker, and expression of loyalty to a specific overlord, more than as an accurate description of personal beliefs -here the common accusation of heretics they received from Rome. In that note, accusations or prosecutions due to beliefs held by enemy countries must be seen as political accusations regarding political treason more than as religious ones. Other times the accusation of Protestantism was considered as an equivalent of blasphemy, just a general way of addressing insubordination.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez-Sala, Maria Luisa. Los PROTESTANTES Y LA INQUISICIÓN. UNAM. https://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/6/2905/6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox Christianity====
Even though the Inquisition had theoretical permission to investigate Orthodox "heretics", it almost never did. There was no major war between Spain and any Orthodox nation, so there was no reason to do so. There was one casualty tortured by those "Jesuits" (though most likely, [[Franciscans]]) who administered the Spanish Inquisition in North America, according to authorities within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],:  St. [[Peter the Aleut]]. Even that single report has various numbers of inaccuracies that make it problematic, and has no confirmation in the Inquisitorial archives.

===Witchcraft and Superstition===
The category "superstitions" includes trials related to [[witchcraft]]. The [[witch-hunt]] in Spain had much less intensity than in other European countries (particularly France, Scotland, and Germany). One remarkable case was [[Logroño witch trials|that of Logroño]], in which the witches of [[Zugarramurdi]] in [[Navarre]] were persecuted. During the ''[[auto-da-fé]]'' that took place in [[Logroño]] on November 7 and November 8, 1610, six people were burned and another five burned in [[effigy]].&lt;ref&gt;These trials are the theme of the film ''Akelarre'', by the Spanish director Pedro Olea.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the inquisition in cases of witchcraft was much more restricted than is commonly believed. Well after the foundation of the inquisition, jurisdiction over sorcery and witchcraft remained in secular hands.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamen: The Spanish Inquisition A Historical Revision. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In general the Inquisition maintained a skeptical attitude towards cases of witchcraft, considering it as a mere superstition without any basis. [[Alonso Salazar Frias|Alonso de Salazar Frías]], who took the Edict of Faith to various parts of Navarre after the trials of Logroño, noted in his report to the Suprema that, "There were neither [[witches]] nor [[bewitched]] in a village until they were talked and written about".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Henningsen, Gustav, ed. The Salazar Documents: Inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frías and Others on the Basque Witch Persecution. Vol 21, Cultures, Beliefs, and Traditions: Medieval and Early Modern Peoples. Boston: Koninklijke Brill, 2004. Second Report of Salazar to the Inquisitor General (Logroño, 24 March 1612): An account of the whole visitation and publication of the Edict with special reference to the witches' sect, 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blasphemy====
Included under the rubric of ''heretical propositions'' were verbal offences, from outright [[blasphemy]] to questionable statements regarding religious beliefs, from issues of sexual morality to misbehaviour of the clergy. Many were brought to trial for affirming that ''simple fornication'' (sex between unmarried persons) was not a sin or for putting in doubt different aspects of [[Christian]] faith such as [[Transubstantiation]] or the virginity of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|pp=223-224}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, members of the clergy itself were occasionally accused of heretical propositions. These offences rarely led to severe penalties.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====Sodomy====
The first sodomite was burned by the Inquisition in Valencia in 1572, and those accused included 19% clergy, 6% nobles, 37% workers, 19% servants, and 18% soldiers and sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all of almost 500 cases of sodomy between persons concerned the relationship [[pederasty|between an older man and an adolescent]], often by coercion, with only a few cases where the couple were consenting [[homosexual]] adults. About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse. Adolescents were generally punished more leniently than adults, but only when they were very young (under ca. 12 years) or when the case clearly concerned rape did they have a chance to avoid punishment altogether. As a rule, the Inquisition condemned to death only those sodomites over the age of 25 years. As about half of those tried were under this age, it explains the relatively small percentage of death sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Monter, ''Frontiers of Heresy'', pp. 276-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to notice that cases of sodomy did not receive the same treatment in all areas of Spain. In the Kingdom of Castile crimes of sodomy were not investigated by the Inquisition unless they were associated with religious heresy (In other words, the sodomy itself was investigated only as, and when, considered a symptom of a heretic belief or practice). In any other area cases were considered an issue of civil authorities, and even then was not very actively investigated. The Crown of Aragon was the only area in which they were considered under the Inquisitorial jurisdiction, probably due to the previous presence of the Pontifical Inquisition in that kingdom. Within the Crown of Aragon, the tribunal of the city of Zaragoza was famously harsh even at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry (2011). La Inquisición Española. Una revisión histórica. p. 192 pp259&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason to group "sodomy" with heresies and not with "marriage and family" is that sodomy was strongly associated with Islam, Judaism, Catharism, and heresy in general. It was seen as a symptom of them more than as a condition or peculiarity in itself.

====Freemasonry====
{{Further|Papal ban of Freemasonry|In eminenti apostolatus}}
The Roman Catholic Church has regarded [[Freemasonry]] as heretical since about 1738; the ''suspicion'' of Freemasonry was potentially a capital offense. Spanish Inquisition records reveal two prosecutions in Spain and only a few more throughout the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, [[Francisco Javier de Mier y Campillo]], the [[Inquisitor General]] of the Spanish Inquisition and the [[Bishop of Almería]], suppressed Freemasonry and denounced the lodges as "societies which lead to atheism, to sedition and to all errors and crimes."&lt;ref name="Denslow"&gt;William R. Denslow, [[Harry S. Truman]]: ''10,000 Famous Freemasons'', {{ISBN|1-4179-7579-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He then instituted a purge during which [[Spaniards]] could be arrested on the charge of being "suspected of Freemasonry".&lt;ref name="Denslow" /&gt;

=== Censorship ===
[[File:Inquisition01.jpg|thumb|A 1508 woodcut of the Inquisition]]

As one manifestation of the [[Counter-Reformation]], the Spanish Inquisition worked actively to impede the diffusion of heretical ideas in Spain by producing "Indexes" of prohibited books. Such lists of prohibited books were common in Europe a decade before the Inquisition published its first. The first Index published in Spain in 1551 was, in reality, a reprinting of the Index published by the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] in 1550, with an appendix dedicated to Spanish texts. Subsequent Indexes were published in 1559, 1583, 1612, 1632, and 1640. The Indexes included an enormous number of books of all types, though special attention was dedicated to religious works, and, particularly, vernacular translations of the Bible.

Included in the Indices, at one point, were many of the great works of [[Spanish literature]]. Also, a number of religious writers who are today considered saints by the Catholic Church saw their works appear in the Indexes. At first, this might seem counter-intuitive or even nonsensical—how were these Spanish authors published in the first place if their texts were then prohibited by the Inquisition and placed in the Index? The answer lies in the process of publication and censorship in Early Modern Spain. Books in Early Modern Spain faced prepublication licensing and approval (which could include modification) by both secular and religious authorities. However, once approved and published, the circulating text also faced the possibility of post-hoc censorship by being denounced to the Inquisition—sometimes decades later. Likewise, as Catholic theology evolved, once-prohibited texts might be removed from the Index.

At first, inclusion in the Index meant total prohibition of a text; however, this proved not only impractical and unworkable, but also contrary to the goals of having a literate and well-educated clergy. Works with one line of suspect dogma would be prohibited in their entirety, despite the orthodoxy of the remainder of the text. In time, a compromise solution was adopted in which trusted Inquisition officials blotted out words, lines or whole passages of otherwise acceptable texts, thus allowing these expurgated editions to circulate. Although in theory the Indexes imposed enormous restrictions on the diffusion of culture in Spain, some historians argue that such strict control was impossible in practice and that there was much more liberty in this respect than is often believed. And Irving Leonard has conclusively demonstrated that, despite repeated royal prohibitions, romances of chivalry, such as ''[[Amadis de Gaula|Amadis of Gaul]]'', found their way to the New World with the blessing of the Inquisition. Moreover, with the coming of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century, increasing numbers of licenses to possess and read prohibited texts were granted.

[[File:Scene from an Inquisition by Goya.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Inquisition Scene'' by [[Francisco Goya]]. The Spanish Inquisition was still in force in the late eighteenth century, but much reduced in power.]]
Despite the repeated publication of the Indexes and a large bureaucracy of censors, the activities of the Inquisition did not impede the development of Spanish literature's "Siglo de Oro", although almost all of its major authors crossed paths with the Holy Office at one point or another. Among the Spanish authors included in the Index are [[Bartolomé Torres Naharro]], [[Juan del Enzina]], [[Jorge de Montemayor]], [[Juan de Valdés]] and [[Lope de Vega]], as well as the anonymous ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' and the ''[[Cancionero General]]'' by [[Hernando del Castillo]]. ''[[La Celestina]]'', which was not included in the Indexes of the [[16th century]], was expurgated in 1632 and prohibited in its entirety in 1790. Among the non-Spanish authors prohibited were [[Ovid]], [[Dante]], [[Rabelais]], [[Ariosto]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Erasmus]], [[Jean Bodin]], [[Valentin Naboth#cite note-13|Valentine Naibod]] and [[Thomas More]] (known in Spain as Tomás Moro). One of the most outstanding and best-known cases in which the Inquisition directly confronted literary activity is that of [[Fray Luis de León]], noted humanist and religious writer of converso origin, who was imprisoned for four years (from 1572 to 1576) for having translated the [[Song of Songs]] directly from Hebrew.

Some scholars state that one of the main effects of the inquisition was to end free thought and scientific thought in Spain. As one contemporary Spaniard in exile put it: "Our country is a land of ... [[barbarian|barbarism]]; down there one cannot produce any culture without being suspected of [[heresy]], error and [[Judaism]]. Thus silence was imposed on the learned."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For the next few centuries, while the rest of Europe was slowly awakened by the influence of the Enlightenment, Spain stagnated.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul, ''A History of Christianity'', [[Penguin Books|Penguin]], [[London]] 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this conclusion is contested.

The [[censorship]] of books was actually very ineffective, and prohibited books circulated in Spain without significant problems. The Spanish Inquisition never persecuted [[scientist]]s, and relatively few scientific books were placed on the Index. On the other hand, Spain was a state with more political freedom than in other absolute monarchies in the 16th to 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2005|pp=126–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent paradox gets explained by both the [[hermeticist]] religious ideas of the Spanish church and monarchy, and the budding seed of what would become [[Enlightened absolutism]] taking shape in Spain. The list of banned books was not, as interpreted sometimes, a list of evil books but a list of books that lay people were very likely to misinterpret. The presence of highly symbolical and high-quality literature in the list was so explained. These metaphorical or parable sounding books were listed as not meant for free circulation, but there might be no objections to the book itself and the circulation among scholars was mostly free. Most of this books were carefully collected by the elite. The practical totality of the prohibited books can be found now as then in the library of the [[monasterio del Escorial]], carefully collected by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]]. The collection was "public" after Philip II's death and members of universities, intellectuals, courtesans, clergy, and certain branches of the nobility didn't have too many problems to access them and commission authorised copies. The Inquisition has not been known to make any serious attempt to stop this for all the books, but there are some records of them "suggesting" the King of Spain to stop collecting grimoires or magic related ones.
This attitude was also not new. Translations of the Bible to Castillian and Provenzal (Catalan) had been made and allowed in Spain since the Middle Ages. The first preserved copy dates from the 13th century. However, like [[Polyglot Bible|the bible of Cisneros]] they were mostly for scholarly use, and it was customary for laymen to ask religious or academic authorities to review the translation and supervise the use.

===Family and Marriage===

====Bigamy====
The Inquisition also pursued offenses against morals and general social order, at times in open conflict with the jurisdictions of civil tribunals.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In particular, there were trials for [[bigamy]], a relatively frequent offence&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a society that only permitted divorce under the most extreme circumstances.  In the case of men, the penalty was two hundred lashes and five to ten years of "service to the Crown".

====Unnatural Marriage====

Under the category of "unnatural marriage" fell any marriage or attempted marriage between two individuals who could not procreate. The Catholic Church in general, and in particular a nation constantly at war like Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Estudios Sobre Cultura, Guerra Y Polt̕ica En La Corona De Castilla (siglos Xiv-xvii) (Studies Over War Culture and Politics in the Kingdom of Castile) Fernando Cc̀eres - Editorial Csic Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientf̕icas - 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaler, Amy. Fertility, Gender and War: The "culture of Contraception". University of Minnesota, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised the reproductive goal of marriage. The Spanish Inquisition's policy in this regard was restrictive but applied in a very egalitarian way. It considered unnatural any non-reproductive marriage, and natural any reproductive one, regardless of gender or sex involved. The two forms of obvious male sterility were either due to damage to the genitals through castration or accidental wounding at war (capón) or to some genetic condition that might keep the man from completing puberty (lampiño). Female sterility was also a reason to declare a marriage unnatural but was harder to prove. One of the most interesting cases to study the attitude of the Spanish Inquisition regarding marriage, sex, and gender is the trial of [[Eleno de Céspedes]].

===Non-religious Crimes===

Despite popular belief, the role of the Inquisition as a mainly religious institution, or religious in nature at all, is contested at best. Its main function was that of a private police for the Crown with jurisdiction to enforce the law in those crimes that took place in the private sphere of life. The notion of religion and civil law being separate is a modern construction and made no sense in the 15th century, so there was no difference between breaking a law regarding religion and breaking a law regarding tax collection. The difference between them is a modern projection the institution itself did not have.
As such, the Inquisition was the prosecutor (in some cases the only prosecutor) of any crimes that could be perpetrated without the public taking notice (mainly domestic crimes, crimes against the weakest members of society, administrative crimes and forgeries, organized crime, and crimes against the Crown).

Examples include crimes associated with sexual or family relations such as [[rape]] and [[sexual violence]] (the Inquisition was the first and only body who punished it across the nation), [[bestiality]], [[pedophilia]] (often overlapping with sodomy), [[incest]], [[child abuse]] or [[child neglect|neglect]] and (as discussed) [[bigamy]]. Non-religious crimes also included [[procurement]] (not [[prostitution]]), [[human trafficking]], [[smuggling]], forgery or falsification of [[counterfeit currency|currency]], [[document forgery|documents]] or [[signature forgery|signatures]], tax [[fraud]] (many religious crimes were considered subdivisions of this one), [[illegal weapons]], [[wikt:swindle|swindle]]s, disrespect to the Crown or its institutions (the Inquisition included, but also the church, the guard, and the kings themselves), [[espionage]] for a foreign power, [[conspiracy]], [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/3241610 Online access to the Historical Archives of the Inquisition in Valencia], where the records of the trials and correspondence to officials can be found; you can find the corresponding ones to various other areas in Spain in the same webpage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The non-religious crimes processed by the Inquisition accounted for a considerable percentage of its total investigations and are often hard to separate in the statistics, even when documentation is available. The line between religious and non-religious crimes did not exist in 15th century Spain as legal concept. Many of the crimes listed here and some of the religious crimes listed in previous sections were contemplated under the same article. For example, "sodomy" included paedophilia as a subtype. Often part of the data given for prosecution of male homosexuality corresponds to convictions for paedophilia, not adult homosexuality. In other cases, religious and non-religious crimes were seen as distinct but equivalent. The treatment of public blasphemy and street swindlers was similar (since in both cases you are "misleading the public in a harmful way). Making counterfeit currency and heretic proselytism was also treated similarly; both of them were punished by death and subdivided in similar ways since both were "spreading falsifications". In general heresy and falsifications of material documents were treated similarly by the Spanish Inquisition, indicating that they may have been thought of as equivalent actions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Another difficulty to discriminate the inquisition's secular and religious activity is the common association of certain types of investigations. An accusation or suspicion on certain crime often launched an automatic investigation on many others. Anyone accused of espionage due to non-religious reasons would likely be investigated for heresy too, and anyone suspected of a heresy associated to a foreign power would be investigated for espionage too automatically. Likewise, some religious crimes were considered likely to be associated with non-religious crimes, like human trafficking, procurement, and child abuse was expected to be associated to sodomy, or sodomy was expected to be associated to heresy and false conversions. Which accusation started the investigation isn't always clear.
Finally, trials were often further complicated by the attempts of witnesses or victims to add further charges, especially [[witchcraft]]. Like in the case of [[Eleno de Céspedes]], charges for witchcraft done in this way, or in general, were quickly dismissed but they often show in the statistics as investigations made.

== Organization ==
Beyond its role in religious affairs, the Inquisition was also an institution at the service of the monarchy. The Inquisitor General, in charge of the Holy Office, was designated by the crown. The Inquisitor General was the only public office whose authority stretched to all the kingdoms of Spain (including the American viceroyalties), except for a brief period (1507–1518) during which there were two Inquisitors General, one in the kingdom of Castile, and the other in [[Aragon]].

[[File:Auto de fe Lima.jpg|thumb|Auto-da-fé, [[Plaza Mayor, Lima|Plaza Mayor]] in [[Lima]], Viceroyalty of Peru, 17th century]]

The Inquisitor General presided over the Council of the Supreme and General Inquisition (generally abbreviated as "Council of the Suprema"), created in 1483, which was made up of six members named directly by the crown (the number of members of the Suprema varied over the course of the Inquisition's history, but it was never more than 10). Over time, the authority of the Suprema grew at the expense of the power of the Inquisitor General.

The Suprema met every morning, except for holidays, and for two hours in the afternoon on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The morning sessions were devoted to questions of faith, while the afternoons were reserved for "minor heresies"&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, Gustav: The Spanish Inquisition and the Inquisitorial Mind, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; cases of perceived unacceptable sexual behavior, [[bigamy]], [[witchcraft]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the Suprema were the various tribunals of the Inquisition, which were originally itinerant, installing themselves where they were necessary to combat heresy, but later being established in fixed locations. During the first phase numerous tribunals were established, but the period after 1495 saw a marked tendency towards centralization.

In the kingdom of Castile, the following permanent tribunals of the Inquisition were established:
* 1482 In [[Seville]] and in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].
* 1485 In [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and in [[Llerena, Badajoz|Llerena]].
* 1488 In [[Valladolid]] and in [[Murcia]].
* 1489 In [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]].
* 1505 In [[Las Palmas]] ([[Canary Islands]]).
* 1512 In [[Logroño]].
* 1526 In [[Granada]].
* 1574 In [[Santiago de Compostela]].

There were only four tribunals in the kingdom of [[Aragon]]: [[Zaragoza]] and [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] (1482), [[Barcelona]] (1484), and [[Majorca]] (1488).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand the Catholic]] also established the Spanish Inquisition in [[Sicily]] (1513), housed in [[Palermo]], and [[Sardinia]], in the town of [[Sassari]].&lt;ref&gt;In [[Sicily]], the Inquisition functioned until 30 March 1782, when it was abolished by King [[Ferdinand IV of Naples]]. It is estimated that 200 people were executed during this period.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Americas, tribunals were established in [[Lima]] and in [[Mexico City]] (1569) and, in 1610, in [[Cartagena de Indias]] (present day [[Colombia]]).

==Composition of the tribunals==
[[File:Estructura de la Inquisición.svg|thumb|Structure of the Spanish Inquisition]]

Initially, each of the tribunals included two inquisitors, a ''calificador'' (qualifiers), an ''alguacil'' (bailiff), and a ''fiscal'' (prosecutor); new positions were added as the institution matured. The inquisitors were preferably jurists more than theologians; in 1608 [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] even stipulated that all the inquisitors must have a background in law. The inquisitors did not typically remain in the position for a long time: for the Court of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], for example, the average tenure in the position was about two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the inquisitors belonged to the secular clergy (priests who were not members of [[religious orders]]) and had a university education.

The ''fiscal'' was in charge of presenting the accusation, investigating the denunciations and interrogating the witnesses by the use of physical and mental torture. The ''calificadores'' were generally theologians; it fell to them to determine if the defendant's conduct added up to a crime against the faith. Consultants were expert jurists who advised the court in questions of procedure. The court had, in addition, three secretaries: the ''notario de secuestros'' (Notary of Property), who registered the goods of the accused at the moment of his detention; the ''notario del secreto'' (Notary of the Secret), who recorded the testimony of the defendant and the witnesses; and the ''escribano general'' (General Notary), secretary of the court. The ''alguacil'' was the executive arm of the court, responsible for detaining, jailing, and physically torturing the defendant. Other civil employees were the ''nuncio'', ordered to spread official notices of the court, and the ''alcaide'', jailer in charge of feeding the prisoners.

In addition to the members of the court, two auxiliary figures existed that collaborated with the Holy Office: the ''familiares'' and the ''comissarios'' (commissioners). ''Familiares'' were lay collaborators of the Inquisition, who had to be permanently at the service of the Holy Office. To become a ''familiar'' was considered an honour, since it was a public recognition of ''[[limpieza de sangre]]'' — Old Christian status — and brought with it certain additional privileges. Although many nobles held the position, most of the ''familiares'' came from the ranks of commoners. The commissioners, on the other hand, were members of the religious orders who collaborated occasionally with the Holy Office.

One of the most striking aspects of the organization of the Inquisition was its form of financing: devoid of its own budget, the Inquisition depended exclusively on the confiscation of the goods of the denounced. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of those prosecuted were rich men. That the situation was open to abuse is evident, as stands out in the memorial that a ''converso'' from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] directed to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Your Majesty must provide, before all else, that the expenses of the Holy Office do not come from the properties of the condemned, because if that is the case, if they do not burn they do not eat.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Accusation ===
When the Inquisition arrived in a city, the first step was the ''Edict of Grace''. Following the Sunday mass, the Inquisitor would proceed to read the edict; it explained possible heresies and encouraged all the congregation to come to the tribunals of the Inquisition to "relieve their consciences". They were called ''Edicts of Grace'' because all of the self-incriminated who presented themselves within a ''period of grace'' (usually ranging from thirty to forty days) were offered the possibility of reconciliation with the Church without severe punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of benevolence was effective, and many voluntarily presented themselves to the Inquisition and were often encouraged to denounce others who had also committed offenses, informants being the Inquisition's primary source of information. After about 1500, the Edicts of Grace were replaced by the ''Edicts of Faith'', which left out the grace period and instead encouraged the denunciation of those guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The denunciations were anonymous, and the defendants had no way of knowing the identities of their accusers.&lt;ref&gt;Though over the course of the trial, their identities likely became apparent.&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the points most criticized by those who opposed the Inquisition (for example, the [[Cortes of Castile]], in 1518). In practice, false denunciations were frequent. Denunciations were made for a variety of reasons, from genuine concern, to rivalries and personal jealousies.

=== Detention ===
[[File:Mateo Zapata.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Diego Mateo Zapata|Diego Mateo López Zapata]] in his cell before his trial by the Inquisition Court of Cuenca]]

After a denunciation, the case was examined by the ''calificadores'', who had to determine if there was heresy involved, followed by detention of the accused. In practice, however, many were detained in preventive custody, and many cases of lengthy incarcerations occurred, lasting up to two years, before the ''calificadores'' examined the case.&lt;ref&gt;"In the tribunal of [[Valladolid]], in 1699, various suspects (including a girl of 9 and a boy of 14) were jailed for up to two years with having had the least evaluation of the accusations presented against them" ({{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=180}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Detention of the accused entailed the preventive sequestration of their property by the Inquisition. The property of the prisoner was used to pay for procedural expenses and the accused's own maintenance and costs. Often the relatives of the defendant found themselves in outright misery. This situation was remedied only following instructions written in 1561.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Some authors, such as [[Thomas William Walsh]], stated that the entire process was undertaken with the utmost secrecy, as much for the public as for the accused, who were not informed about the accusations that were levied against them. Months or even years could pass without the accused being informed about why they were imprisoned. The prisoners remained isolated, and, during this time, the prisoners were not allowed to attend [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] nor receive the [[sacraments]]. The jails of the Inquisition were no worse than those of secular authorities, and there are even certain testimonies that occasionally they were much better.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Thomas William, ''Characters of the Inquisition'', P.J. Kennedy &amp; Sons, 1940, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are few records of the time of the accused in prison, but the transcription of the trials repeatedly shows the accused being informed of every charge during the trial. They also show the accused answers, in which they address each accusation specifically. Given that they would be informed anyway, it makes little sense for the accused to be kept in the dark prior to the trial, unless the investigation was still open.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:7d0f0b12-1c0e-49f6-b437-23206a95086d/original-primera-parte.pdf preserved transcripts of a trial as sample&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:a1b40405-5bbd-4a44-a031-41bb121702a3/transcripcion.pdf Printed version of previous source&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial ===
The inquisitorial process consisted of a series of hearings, in which both the denouncers and the defendant gave testimony. A [[defense counsel]] was assigned to the defendant, a member of the tribunal itself, whose role was simply to advise the defendant and to encourage them to speak the truth. The prosecution was directed by the ''fiscal''. Interrogation of the defendant was done in the presence of the ''Notary of the Secreto'', who meticulously wrote down the words of the accused. The archives of the Inquisition, in comparison to those of other judicial systems of the era, are striking in the completeness of their documentation. 
The documentation of said notary usually shows a series of In order to defend themselves, the accused had two possibilities: ''abonos'' (to find favourable witnesses, akin to "substantive" evidence/testimony in Anglo-American law) or ''tachas'' (to demonstrate that the witnesses of accusers were not trustworthy, akin to Anglo-American "impeachment" evidence/testimony).

The documentation from the notary usually show the following content, which gives us an idea of what the actual trial was likely to look like:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:a1b40405-5bbd-4a44-a031-41bb121702a3/transcripcion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*A first page in which the notary wrote the date, the names and charges of the members of the tribunal, the name of the accused and the accuser, the accusation, and the names of everyone present in the room during the trial.
*A second page with the accused's first statement about their innocence or culpability, and their general response and recollection of the facts. This part usually takes from a thick fluid paragraph to a couple of pages and are relatively formal, within the accused's education level, from which one can suspect that the accused had time to prepare it prior to either the trial or the declaration, and probably help from the defendant. This paragraph also shows the accused addressing every charge from the first page, by points, which shows that the accused must have been informed of the charges against them.
*A third section with the ''fiscal'''s name and the transcription of a speech in which they address the accused's statement, also by points, and presents their case regarding each one separately.
*A fourth section, usually dated on the next day or a couple of days after the fiscal's intervention, with the name of the "procurador"( defendant) and the transcription of a speech in which they address the fiscal's arguments, again by points and separately, and defend the accused regarding each one. 
*A fifth section with the tribunal's response to this. In the vast majority of cases, the response is to order the search and calling of certain individuals, as witnesses, or of some experts such as doctors to testify and ratify some parts of what has been said, and giving a date for the tribunal to come together again and examine the evidence. Usually, the fiscal and procurator can ask for the presence of some witnesses here too, as it is inferred by them showing up later, but that is not always specifically stated in the transcripts and may be done outside of trial.
*The next section is often dated sometime later. Each witness or expert is introduced by complete name, job, relationship to the victim if any, and relationship to the case.  The witness's testimony is not transcribed word by word like in previous cases but summarized by the notary, probably because it was not prepared and does not follow a coherent, consistent order and writing implements were rather expensive to waste. 
* A page in which the procurador(defendant) declared the questions he is going to make to (usually another) group of witnesses of his choice since he often states that "he has asked them to come"or "he has called them". The answers given by each witness follow, with each witness presented as in the previous section. These testimonies are also paraphrased and summarized but addressed by points, with the answer to each question paraphrased separately.
*The fiscal and the procurador require equal copies of the testimony of the witnesses and keep them, demanding that no copy is shown to anyone until the end of a period of usually six days in which the witnesses have the chance to call the tribunal again to change their mind or add something.
*A third meeting of the tribunal with a new date. The transcription of a new speech by the procurator stating his view of the declarations and wrapping the witnesses' testimony up from his perspective. 
*A similar intervention, usually far shorter, from the fiscal.
*The response from the tribunal, paraphrased, which could be to dictate the sentence, but often was to require either further clarification from the witness (restarting the procedure from the second step) or call for another type of proof (restarting the procedure from the sixth step). These steps would repeat cyclically in the documentation of the trial, through different meetings of the tribunal and different weeks, until the tribunal has reached a conclusion.
*A literal transcription of the verdict and sentence. If the accused has been accused of more than one thing the sentence usually comes by points too. It is not uncommon for some of the accusations to be dismissed along with the process and said the process to continue taking into account the remaining ones. While sentences of innocence could be given at any point in a trial for multiple crimes, sentences of culpability only appear once the trial is over and all investigations opened against the accused are closed.

Regarding the fairness of the trials, the structure of them was similar to modern trials and extremely advanced for the time. However, the  Inquisition was dependent on the political power of the King. The lack of separation of powers allows assuming questionable fairness for certain scenarios. The fairness of the Inquisitorial tribunals seemed to be among the best in early modern Europe when it came to the trial of laymen.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Madden. "The Truth about the Spanish Inquisition." Crisis (october de 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"LA INQUISICIÓN ESPAÑOLA".José Martínez MillánAlianza Editorial Bolsillo(2010)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also testimonies by former prisoners that, if believed, suggest that said fairness was less than ideal when national or political interests were involved.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry (2011). La Inquisición Española. Una revisión histórica. pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to obtain a confession or information relevant to an investigation, the Inquisition made use of [[torture]], but not in a systematic way. It could only be applied when all other options, witnesses and experts had been used, the accused was found guilty or most likely guilty, and relevant information regarding accomplices or specific details were missing. It was applied mainly against those suspected of [[Judeization]] and [[Protestantism]] beginning in the 16th century, in other words "enemies of the state", since said crimes were usually thought to be associated with a larger organized network of either espionage or conspiracy with foreign powers. For example, Lea estimates that between 1575 and 1610 the court of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] tortured approximately a third of those processed for Protestant heresy.&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Lea, III, p. 33, Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=185}}. {{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=43}} finds the same statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; The recently opened Vatican Archives suggest even lower numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Madden. "The Truth about the Spanish Inquisition." Crisis (October de 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messori, Vittorio (2000). Leyendas Negras de la Iglesia. Editorial Planeta (this source is a Catholic apologist)&lt;/ref&gt;  In other periods, the proportions varied remarkably. Torture was always a means to obtain the confession of the accused, not a punishment itself.

=== Torture ===
[[File:Picard.jpg|thumb|Inquisition [[torture chamber]]. ''Mémoires Historiques'' (1716)]]

Torture was employed in all civil and religious trials in Europe. The Spanish Inquisition was no exception. Its main differentiation characteristic was that, as opposed to both civil trials and other inquisitions, it had very strict regulations regarding when, what, to whom, how many times, for how long and under what supervision it could be applied.&lt;ref name="Bethencourt, Francisco 1997"&gt;Bethencourt, Francisco. La Inquisición En La Época Moderna: España, Portugal E Italia, Siglos Xv-xix. Madrid: Akal, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haliczer_79"&gt;Haliczer, Stephen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=crCQmS_85EEC&amp;dq Inquisition and society in the kingdom of Valencia, 1478-1834], p. 79, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamenop"&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish inquisition engaged in it far less often and with greater care than other courts.&lt;ref name="Haliczer_79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters, Edward pp. 92-93"&gt;by Peters, Edward, ''Inquisition'', Dissent, Heterodoxy and the Medieval Inquisitional Office, pp. 92-93, University of California Press (1989), {{ISBN|0-520-06630-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the civil court, both Spanish and otherwise, there was no restriction regarding duration or any other point.

*''''When''':' Torture was allowed only: ''" when sufficient proofs to confirm the culpability of the accused have been gathered by other means, and every other method of negotiation have been tried and exhausted''". It was stated by the inquisitorial rule that information obtained through torment was not reliable, and confession should only be extracted this way when all needed information was already known and proven. Confessions obtained through torture could not be used to convict or sentence anyone.
*'''What''': The Spanish Inquisition was prohibited to "''maim, mutilate, draw blood or cause any sort of permanent damage''" to the prisoner. Breaking bones was of course not allowed.&lt;ref name="Kamenop" /&gt; There was a closed list of the allowed torture methods. These were all tried and used in the civil courts all through Europe, and therefore known to be "safe" in this regard. Any other method, regardless of whether it was legal in the country or practiced in civil courts, was not allowed.
*'''Who''': Neither the elderly, the young, the sick or injured, or pregnant women could be subjected to torture. Torture of females was prohibited in all but the most extreme crimes and could not be performed by males.
*'''How many times''': Each accusation allowed for a different number of torment sessions on the same person (once the "when" condition of the culpability being supported by the strong external evidence was fulfilled). The number was dependent on how "harmful to society" the crime was. Counterfeit currency allowed for a maximum of two. The most serious offenses allowed for a maximum of eight.
*'''For how long''': "Torment" could be applied for a maximum of 15 minutes. The Roman Inquisition allowed for 30 minutes.
*'''Supervisio'''n: The presence of a doctor was required at all times to ensure that no serious harm could result and to intervene in case of unexpected complications. It was also required for a doctor to certify that the prisoner was healthy enough to go through the torment without suffering harm and make himself before it could even start.&lt;ref&gt;Crespo Vargas, Pablo L. La Inquisición Española Y Las Supersticiones En El Caribe Hispano. Madrid: Palibrio, 2011. pp120-130&lt;/ref&gt;

Per contrast, European civil trials from England to Italy and from Spain to Russia could use, and did use, torture without justification and for as long as they considered. So much so that there were serious tensions between the Inquisition and Philip III, since the Inquisitors complained that "those people sent to the prisons of the King blasphemed and accused themselves of heresy just to be sent under the Inquisitorial jurisdiction instead of the King's" and that was collapsing the Inquisition's tribunals. During the reign of Philip IV there were registered complaints of the Inquisitors about people who "Blasphemated, mostly in winter, just to be detained and fed inside the prison".  
Despite some popular accounts, modern historians state that torture was only ever used to confirm information or a confession, not for punitive reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The inside of a jail of the Spanish Inquisition, with a prie Wellcome V0041650.jpg|thumb|left|The inside of a jail of the Spanish Inquisition, with a priest supervising his scribe while men and women are suspended from pulleys, tortured on the rack or burnt with torches. Etching.]]

Rafael Sabatinni states that among the methods of [[torture]] allowed, and common in other secular and ecclesiastical tribunals, were ''garrucha'', ''toca'' and the ''potro''.,&lt;ref name="Kamenop" /&gt; even though those claims contradict both the Inquisitorial law and the claims made by Kamen. The application of the ''garrucha'', also known as the [[strappado]], consisted of suspending the victim from the ceiling by the wrists, which are tied behind the back. Sometimes weights were tied to the ankles, with a series of lifts and drops, during which the arms and legs suffered violent pulls and were sometimes dislocated.&lt;ref&gt;Sabatini, Rafael, ''Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition: A History'', p. 190, Kessinger Publishing (2003), {{ISBN|0-7661-3161-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The use of te ''toca''(cloth), also called ''interrogatorio mejorado del agua'' (improved [[waterboarding]]/improved water interrogation), is better documented. It consisted of introducing a cloth into the mouth of the victim, and forcing them to [[waterboarding|ingest water]] spilled from a jar so that they had the impression of drowning.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, George Ryley, ''The History of Torture Throughout the Ages'', p. 172, Columbia University Press (2003) {{ISBN|0-7103-0837-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''potro'', the [[rack (torture)|rack]], in which the limbs were slowly pulled apart, was thought to be the instrument of torture used most frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Carrol. James, ''Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews: A History'', p. 356, Houghton Mifflin Books (2002), {{ISBN|0-618-21908-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them all, the "submarino/ [[waterboarding]]" was by far the most commonly used, since it was cheap, and seen as "harmless and very safe" (safer for the victim than clothless waterboarding, hence the "improved" (''mejorado'') epithet).

The assertion that ''confessionem esse veram, non factam vi tormentorum'' (literally: '[a person's] confession is truth, not made by way of torture') sometimes follows a description of how, after torture had ended, the subject freely confessed to the offenses.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Edward, ''Inquisition'', Dissent, Heterodoxy and the Medieval Inquisitional Office, p. 65, University of California Press (1989), {{ISBN|0-520-06630-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus confessions following torture were deemed to be made of the confessor's free will, and hence valid.

Once the process concluded, the inquisidores met with a representative of the bishop and with the ''consultores'' (consultants), experts in [[theology]] or [[Canon Law]] (but not necessarily clergy themselves), which was called the ''consulta de fe'' (faith consultation/religion check). The case was voted and sentence pronounced, which had to be unanimous. In case of discrepancies, the ''Suprema'' had to be informed.

=== Sentencing ===
The results of the trial could be the following:
# Although quite rare in actual practice, the defendant could be '''acquitted'''. Inquisitors did not wish to terminate the proceedings. If they did, and new evidence turned up later, they would be forced into reopening and re-presenting the old evidence.
# The trial could be '''suspended''', in which case the defendant, although under suspicion, went free (with the threat that the process could be continued at any time) or was held in long-term imprisonment until a trial commenced. When set free after a suspended trial it was considered a form of acquittal without specifying that the accusation had been erroneous.
# The defendant could be '''penanced'''. Since they were considered guilty, they had to publicly abjure their crimes (''de levi'' if it was a misdemeanor, and ''de vehementi'' if the crime were serious), and accept a public punishment. Among these were ''[[sanbenito]]'', exile, fines or even sentencing to service as oarsmen in royal [[galley]]s.
# The defendant could be '''reconciled'''. In addition to the public ceremony in which the condemned was reconciled with the Catholic Church, more severe punishments were used, among them long sentences to jail or the galleys, plus the confiscation of all property. Physical punishments, such as whipping, were also used.
# The most serious punishment was '''relaxation''' to the [[secular arm]]. The Inquisition had no power to actually kill the convict or determine the way in which they should die, that was a right of the King. [[Burning at the stake]] was a possibility, probably kept from the Papal Inquisition of Aragon, but a very uncommon one. This penalty was frequently applied to impenitent heretics and those who had relapsed. Execution was public. If the condemned repented, they were shown mercy by being [[garrote]]d before getting their corpse burned; if not, they were burned alive.

Frequently, cases were judged ''in absentia'', and when the accused died before the trial finished, the condemned were burned in effigy.

The distribution of the punishments varied considerably over time. It is believed that sentences of death were enforced in the first stages within the long history of the Inquisition. According to García Cárcel, the court of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], one of the most active, employed the death penalty in 40% of the convicts{{clarify|date=April 2018}}&lt;!---It isn't very clear if it means 40% / 3% of all the convicts, of all the trialed, or if 40% of crimes were punished this way.---&gt; before 1530, but later that percentage dropped to 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Auto-da-fé'' ===
{{main|Auto-da-fé}}
[[File:Francisco rizi-auto de fe.jpg|thumb|Auto-da-fé, [[Plaza Mayor, Madrid|Plaza Mayor]] in Madrid, 1683]]

If the sentence was [[wikt:condemnatory|condemnatory]], this implied that the condemned had to participate in the ceremony of an ''auto de fe'' (more commonly known in English as an ''auto-da-fé'') that solemnized their return to the Church (in most cases), or punishment as an impenitent heretic. The ''autos-da-fé'' could be private (''auto particular'') or public (''auto publico'' or ''auto general'').

Although initially the public ''autos'' did not have any special solemnity nor sought a large attendance of spectators, with time they became solemn ceremonies, celebrated with large public crowds, amidst a festive atmosphere. The ''auto-da-fé'' eventually became a [[baroque]] spectacle, with staging meticulously calculated to cause the greatest effect among the spectators. The ''autos'' were conducted in a large public space (frequently in the largest plaza of the city), generally on holidays. The rituals related to the ''auto'' began the previous night (the "procession of the Green Cross") and sometimes lasted the whole day. The ''auto-da-fé'' frequently was taken to the canvas by painters: one of the better-known examples is the painting by [[Francesco Rizzi]] held by the [[Prado]] Museum in [[Madrid]] that represents the ''auto'' celebrated in the Plaza Mayor of Madrid on 30 June 1680. The last public ''auto-da-fé'' took place in 1691.

The ''auto-da-fé'' involved a Catholic Mass, prayer, a public procession of those found guilty, and a reading of their sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Peters 1988: 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; They took place in public squares or esplanades and lasted several hours; ecclesiastical and civil authorities attended. Artistic representations of the ''auto-da-fé'' usually depict torture and the burning at the stake. However, this type of activity never took place during an ''auto-da-fé'', which was in essence a religious act. Torture was not administered after a trial concluded, and executions were always held after and separate from the ''auto-da-fé'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=192–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in the minds and experiences of observers and those undergoing the confession and execution, the separation of the two might be experienced as merely a technicality.

[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|upright|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] (converted Jew), Mexico City, 1601]]

The first recorded ''auto-da-fé'' was held in Paris in 1242, during the reign of Louis IX.&lt;ref&gt;Stavans 2005:xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Spanish ''auto-da-fé'' did not take place until 1481 in Seville; six of the men and women subjected to this first religious ritual were later executed. The Inquisition had limited power in Portugal, having been established in 1536 and officially lasting until 1821, although its influence was much weakened with the government of the Marquis of Pombal in the second half of the 18th century. ''Autos-da-fé'' also took place in Mexico, Brazil and Peru: contemporary historians of the Conquistadors such as Bernal Díaz del Castillo record them. They also took place in the Portuguese colony of Goa, India, following the establishment of Inquisition there in 1562–1563.

The arrival of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Spain slowed inquisitorial activity. In the first half of the 18th century, 111 were condemned to be burned in person, and 117 in effigy, most of them for [[Judaizers|judaizing]]. In the reign of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], there were 125 ''autos-da-fé'', while in the reigns of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] and [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] only 44.

During the 18th century, the Inquisition changed: Enlightenment ideas were the closest threat that had to be fought. The main figures of the Spanish Enlightenment were in favour of the abolition of the Inquisition, and many were processed by the Holy Office, among them [[Pablo de Olavide|Olavide]], in 1776; [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa|Iriarte]], in 1779; and [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos|Jovellanos]], in 1796; Jovellanos sent a report to Charles IV in which he indicated the inefficiency of the Inquisition's courts and the ignorance of those who operated them: "friars who take [the position] only to obtain gossip and exemption from choir; who are ignorant of foreign languages, who only know a little [[scholastic theology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el pensamiento ilustrado.'' Historia 16. Especial 10º Aniversario ''La Inquisición''; p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its new role, the Inquisition tried to accentuate its function of censoring publications but found that Charles III had secularized [[censorship]] procedures, and, on many occasions, the authorization of the [[Council of Castile]] hit the more intransigent position of the Inquisition. Since the Inquisition itself was an arm of the state, being within the Council of Castile, civil rather than ecclesiastical censorship usually prevailed. This loss of influence can also be explained because the foreign Enlightenment texts entered the peninsula through prominent members of the nobility or government,&lt;ref&gt;Members of the government and the Council of Castile, as well as other members close to the court, obtained special authorization for books purchased in France, the Low Countries or Germany to cross the border without inspection by members of the Holy Office. This practice grew beginning with the reign of Charles III.&lt;/ref&gt; influential people with whom it was very difficult to interfere. Thus, for example, [[Diderot's Encyclopedia]] entered Spain thanks to special licenses granted by the king.

After the [[French Revolution]], however, the Council of Castile, fearing that revolutionary ideas would penetrate Spain's borders, decided to reactivate the Holy Office that was directly charged with the persecution of French works. An Inquisition edict of December 1789, that received the full approval of Charles IV and [[José Moñino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|Floridablanca]], stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;having news that several books have been scattered and promoted in these kingdoms... that, without being contented with the simple narration events of a seditious nature... seem to form a theoretical and practical code of independence from the legitimate powers.... destroying in this way the political and social order... the reading of thirty and nine French works is prohibited, under fine...&lt;ref&gt;Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el pensamiento ilustrado.'' p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, inquisitorial activity was impossible in the face of the information avalanche that crossed the border; in 1792, "the multitude of seditious papers... does not allow formalizing the files against those who introduce them".

The fight from within against the Inquisition was almost always clandestine. The first texts that questioned the Inquisition and praised the ideas of [[Voltaire]] or [[Montesquieu]] appeared in 1759. After the suspension of pre-publication censorship on the part of the Council of Castile in 1785, the newspaper ''[[El Censor]]'' began the publication of protests against the activities of the Holy Office by means of a rationalist critique. [[Valentin de Foronda]] published ''[[Espíritu de los Mejores Diarios]]'', a plea in favour of freedom of expression that was avidly read in the salons. Also, in the same vein, [[Manuel de Aguirre]] wrote On Toleration in ''El Censor'', ''[[El Correo de los Ciegos]]'' and ''[[El Diario de Madrid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument presented in the periodicals and other works circulating in Spain were virtually exact copies of the reflections of Montesquieu or Rousseau, translated into Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Inquisition==
[[File:Penitenciado por la Inquisición.jpg|thumb|The [[Peruvian Inquisition]], based in Lima, ended in 1820.]]

During the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain]] (1788–1808), in spite of the fears that the [[French Revolution]] provoked, several events accelerated the decline of the Inquisition. The state stopped being a mere social organizer and began to worry about the well-being of the public. As a result, the land-holding power of the Church was reconsidered, in the ''[[señorío]]s'' and more generally in the accumulated wealth that had prevented social progress.&lt;ref&gt;Church properties, in general, and those of the Holy Office in particular, occupied large tracts of today's [[Castile and León]], [[Extremadura]] and [[Andalucia]]. The properties were given under feudal terms to farmers or to localities who used them as community property with many restrictions, owing a part of the rent, generally in cash, to the church.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the throne increased, under which [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers found better protection for their ideas. [[Manuel Godoy]] and [[Antonio Alcalá Galiano]] were openly hostile to an institution whose only role had been reduced to [[censorship]] and was the very embodiment of the Spanish [[Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition|Black Legend]], internationally, and was not suitable to the political interests of the moment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Inquisition? Its old power no longer exists: the horrible authority that this bloodthirsty court had exerted in other times was reduced... the Holy Office had come to be a species of commission for book censorship, nothing more...&lt;ref&gt;Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el Pensamiento Ilustrado''. Historia 16. Especial 10º Aniversario ''La Inquisición''; pg. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Inquisition was first abolished during the domination of [[Napoleon]] and the reign of [[Joseph Bonaparte]] (1808–1812). In 1813, the liberal deputies of the [[Cortes of Cádiz]] also obtained its abolition,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Antonio Puigblanch]], ''La Inquisición sin máscara'', Cádiz, 1811–1813.&lt;/ref&gt; largely as a result of the Holy Office's condemnation of the popular revolt against French invasion. But the Inquisition was reconstituted when [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] recovered the throne on 1 July 1814. [[Juan Antonio Llorente]], who had been the Inquisition's general secretary in 1789, became a [[Afrancesado|Bonapartist]] and published a critical history in 1817 from his French exile, based on his privileged access to its archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly as a result of Llorente's criticisms, the Inquisition was once again temporarily abolished during the three-year Liberal interlude known as the [[Trienio liberal]], but still the old system had not yet had its last gasp. Later, during the period known as the [[Ominous Decade]], the Inquisition was not formally re-established,&lt;ref&gt;Historians have different interpretations. One argument is that during the Ominous Decade, the Inquisition was re-established- because of a statement made by [[King Alphonso]] upon a visit to the Vatican that he would reintroduce it if the occasion arose, but the Royal Decree that would have abolished the order of the Trienio Liberal was never approved, or at least, never published. The formal abolition under the regency of Maria Cristina was thus nothing more than a ratification of the abolition of 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; although, ''de facto'', it returned under the so-called Congregation of the Meetings of Faith, tolerated in the dioceses by King Ferdinand.  On 26 July 1826 the "Meetings of Faith" Congregation condemned and executed the school teacher [[Cayetano Ripoll]], who thus became the last person known to be executed by the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|pp=372-373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On that day, Ripoll was hanged in [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], for having taught [[deist]] principles.  This execution occurred against the backdrop of a European-wide scandal concerning the despotic attitudes still prevailing in Spain.  Finally, on 15 July 1834, the Spanish Inquisition was definitively abolished by a Royal Decree signed by regent [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies]], Ferdinand VII's liberal widow, during the minority of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and with the approval of the President of the Cabinet [[Francisco Martínez de la Rosa]]. (It is possible that something similar to the Inquisition acted during the 1833–1839 [[First Carlist War]], in the zones dominated by the Carlists, since one of the government measures praised by [[Conde de Molina Carlos Maria Isidro de Borbon]] was the re-implementation of the Inquisition to protect the Church). During the Carlist Wars it was the conservatives who fought the liberals who wanted to reduce the Church's power, amongst other reforms to liberalize the economy. It can be added that [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] is alleged to have stated that he would attempt to reintroduce it, possibly as a sop to Vatican approval of his coup.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The [[Alhambra Decree]] that had expelled the Jews was formally rescinded on 16 December 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/17/archives/1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-by-spain-1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-in.html 1492 Ban on Jews Is Voided by Spain]– ''The New York Times'', 17 December 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

===Confiscations===
It is unknown exactly how much wealth was confiscated from converted Jews and others tried by the Inquisition. Wealth confiscated in one year of persecution in the small town of Guadaloupe paid the costs of building a royal residence.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the Spanish Inquisition. Greenwood Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-313-31667-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous records of the opinion of ordinary Spaniards of the time that "the Inquisition was devised simply to rob people". "They were burnt only for the money they had", a resident of Cuenca averred. "They burn only the well-off", said another. In 1504 an accused stated, "only the rich were burnt". In 1484 Catalina de Zamora was accused of asserting that "this Inquisition that the fathers are carrying out is as much for taking property from the conversos as for defending the faith. It is the goods that are the heretics." This saying passed into common usage in Spain. In 1524 a treasurer informed Charles V that his predecessor had received ten million ducats from the conversos, but the figure is unverified. In 1592 an inquisitor admitted that most of the fifty women he arrested were rich. In 1676, the Suprema claimed it had confiscated over 700,000 ducats for the royal treasury (which was paid money only after the Inquisition's own budget, amounting in one known case to only 5%). The property on Mallorca alone in 1678 was worth "well over 2,500,000 ducats".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death tolls and sentenced===
[[File:Contemporary illustration of the Auto-da-fe held at Validolid Spain 21-05-1559..jpg|thumb|Contemporary illustration of the auto-da-fé of [[Valladolid]], in which fourteen Protestants were burned at the stake for their faith, on May 21, 1559]]
García Cárcel estimates that the total number prosecuted by the Inquisition throughout its history was approximately 150,000; applying the percentages of executions that appeared in the trials of 1560–1700—about 2%—the approximate total would be about 3,000 put to death. Nevertheless, some authors consider that the toll may have been higher, keeping in mind the data provided by Dedieu and García Cárcel for the tribunals of Toledo and Valencia, respectively, and estimate between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed.&lt;ref name="Levack, Brian P. 1995"&gt;Data for executions for witchcraft: Levack, Brian P. (1995). The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe (Second Edition). London and New York: Longman, and see [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]] for more detail.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors disagree and estimate a max death toll between 1% and 5%, (depending on the time span used) combining all the processes the inquisition carried, both religious and non-religious ones.&lt;ref name="Bethencourt, Francisco 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eire, Carlos M. N. Reformations: The Early Modern World 1450-1650. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2016 pp 640&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, this is significantly lower than the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe#Numbers of executions|number]] of people executed exclusively [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|for witchcraft in other parts of Europe]] during about the same time span as the Spanish Inquisition (estimated at c. 40,000–60,000).&lt;ref name="Levack, Brian P. 1995"/&gt; Other authors disagree with that statement though

Modern historians have begun to study the documentary records of the Inquisition. The archives of the Suprema, today held by the [[National Historical Archive (Spain)|National Historical Archive of Spain]] (Archivo Histórico Nacional), conserves the annual relations of all processes between 1540 and 1700. This material provides information for approximately 44,674 judgments. These 44,674 cases include 826 executions ''in persona'' and 778 ''in effigie'' (i.e. an effigy was burned). This material, however, is far from being complete—for example, the tribunal of Cuenca is entirely omitted, because no ''relaciones de causas'' from this tribunal have been found, and significant gaps concern some other tribunals (e.g., Valladolid). Many more cases not reported to the Suprema are known from the other sources (i.e., no ''relaciones de causas'' from Cuenca have been found, but its original records have been preserved), but were not included in Contreras-Henningsen's statistics for the methodological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;For full account see: Gustav Henningsen, ''The Database of the Spanish Inquisition. The relaciones de causas project revisited'', in: Heinz Mohnhaupt, Dieter Simon, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A_Sdchs7yAkC&amp;hl=pl Vorträge zur Justizforschung]'', Vittorio Klostermann, 1992, pp. 43-85.&lt;/ref&gt; William Monter estimates 1000 executions between 1530 and 1630 and 250 between 1630 and 1730.&lt;ref&gt;W. Monter, ''Frontiers of Heresy: The Spanish Inquisition from the Basque Lands to Sicily'', Cambridge 2003, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The secret archives of the Vatican regarding the Investigation have recently been disclosed, and are currently being revised. So far they support the lowest estimates given by historians for deaths and prosecution.

The archives of the Suprema only provide information about the processes which took place prior to 1560. To study the processes themselves, it is necessary to examine the archives of the local tribunals; however, the majority have been lost to the devastation of war, the ravages of time or other events. Some archives have survived including those of Toledo, where 12,000 were judged for offences related to heresy, mainly minor "blasphemy",  and those of Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Dedieu, ''Los Cuatro Tiempos'', in Bartolomé Benassar, ''Inquisición Española: poder político y control social'', pp. 15-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; These indicate that the Inquisition was most active in the period between 1480 and 1530, and that during this period the percentage condemned to death was much more significant than in the years that followed. Modern estimates show approximately 2,000 executions ''in persona'' in the whole of Spain up to 1530.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse of power===
Author [[Toby Green]] notes that the great unchecked power given to inquisitors meant that they were "widely seen as above the law"&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"/&gt; and sometimes had motives for imprisoning and sometimes executing alleged offenders other than for the purpose of punishing religious nonconformity, mainly in Hispanoamerica and Iberoamerica.&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de las Indias, Seville, Santa Fe 228, Expediente 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de las Indias, Seville, Santa Fe 228, Expediente 81A, n.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Green quotes a complaint by historian Manuel Barrios&lt;ref name="Green-2007-65"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; about one Inquisitor, [[Diego Rodriguez Lucero]], who in Cordoba in 1506 burned to death the husbands of two different women he then kept as mistresses. According to Barrios, &lt;blockquote&gt;the daughter of Diego Celemin was exceptionally beautiful, her parents and her husband did not want to give her to [Lucero], and so Lucero had the three of them burnt and now has a child by her, and he has kept for a long time in the [[Alcázar of Seville|alcazar]] as a mistress.&lt;ref name="Barrios-1991-58"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrios|first1=Manuel|title=El Tribunal de la Inquisicion en Andalucia: Seleccion de Textos y Documentos|date=1991|publisher=J.

Defenders of the Inquisition discrediting with Green are many and seem to be the growing trend in current scholarship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; These authors don't necessarily deny the abuses of power but classify them as politically instigated and comparable to those of any other law enforcement body of the period. Criticisms, usually indirect, have gone from he suspiciously sexual overtones or similarities of these accounts with unrelated older antisemitic accounts of kidnap and torture,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; to the clear proofs of control that the king had over the institution, to the sources used by Green,&lt;ref&gt;Contreras, Jaime y Gustav Henningsen (1986). “Forty-four thousand cases of the Spanish Inquisition (1540-1700): analysis of a historical data bank”, en Henningsen G., J. A. Tedeschi et al. (comps.), The Inquisition in early modern Europe: studies on sources and methods. Dekalb: Northern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or just by reaching completely different conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Joseph (2006). The Spanish Inquisition: a history. New Haven, CT : Yale University Press; p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juan Antonio Llorente: Historia crítica de la Inquisición en España (tomo IV, p. 183). Madrid: Hiperión, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the context of Hispano America, that Green refers to often, was different from the Iberian context studied for many of those authors, due to the distance from the immediate executive power of the King, and deserves to be examined separately. Among those who do, there are also discrediting voices regarding the nature and extent of the Inquisition's abuses.&lt;ref&gt;''Las luchas por la memoria en América Latina.

==Historiography==
&lt;!--NOTE: This intro paragraph is a high-level summary of the content below. Please add specific new information to the main sub-sections below.--&gt;
How historians and commentators have viewed the Spanish Inquisition has changed over time and continues to be a source of controversy. Before and during the 19th century historical interest focused on who was being persecuted. In the early and mid 20th century, historians examined the specifics of what happened and how it influenced Spanish history. In the later 20th and 21st century, historians have re-examined how severe the Inquisition really was, calling into question some of the assumptions made earlier periods.

===19th to early 20th century scholarship===
Before the rise of professional historians in the 19th century, the Spanish Inquisition had largely been portrayed by Protestant scholars who saw it as the archetypal symbol of Catholic intolerance and ecclesiastical power.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; The Spanish Inquisition for them was largely associated with the persecution of Protestants, or inexplicably, of witches.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; [[William H. Prescott]] described the Inquisition as an "eye that never slumbered".  Despite of the existence of extensive documentation regarding the trials and procedures, and to the Inquisition's deep bureaucratization, none of these sources were studied outside of Spain, and Spanish scholars arguing against the predominant view were automatically dismissed. The 19th-century professional historians, including the Spanish scholar [[José Amador de los Ríos|Amador de los Ríos]], were the first to successfully challenge this perception in the international sphere and get foreign scholars to make eco of their discoveries. Said scholars would obtain international recognition and start a period of revision on the [[Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt;

At the start of the 20th century [[Henry Charles Lea]] published the groundbreaking ''History of the Inquisition in Spain''. This influential work describes the Spanish Inquisition as "an engine of immense power, constantly applied for the furtherance of obscurantism, the repression of thought, the exclusion of foreign ideas and the obstruction of progress."&lt;ref name=kagan&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/19/reviews/980419.19kagent.html "A Kinder, Gentler Inquisition"], by [[Richard Kagan]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'', 19 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Lea documented the Inquisition's methods and modes of operation in no uncertain terms, calling it "theocratic absolutism" at its worst.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; In the context of the polarization between Protestants and Catholics during the second half of the 19th century,&lt;ref name=leabio/&gt; some of Lea's contemporaries, as well as most modern scholars thought Lea's work had an [[anti-Catholic]] bias.&lt;ref name=leabio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/mss/lea/leabio.html/ |title=Henry Charles Lea Papers - Biographical Sketch |website=Univ. of Penn.-Penn Special Collections |accessdate=2007-04-18 |date=January 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/1112-96/article3.html |title=A New Industry: The Inquisition |website=Catholic.net |accessdate=2007-04-18 |date=12 November 1996|last=Van Hove |first=Brian |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070405150258/http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/1112-96/article3.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1920s, Jewish scholars picked up where Lea's work left off.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; They published [[Yitzhak Baer]]'s ''History of the Jews in Christian Spain'', [[Cecil Roth]]'s ''History of the Marranos'' and, after World War II, the work of [[Haim Beinart]], who for the first time published trial transcripts of cases involving conversos.

Contemporary historians who subscribe to the idea that the image of the Inquisition in historiography has been systematically deformed by the Black Legend include [[Edward Peters (scholar)|Edward Peters]], [[Philip Wayne Powell]], [[William S.Maltby]],  [[Richard Kagan]], [[Margaret R. Greer]], [[Helen Rawlings]], [[Ronnie Hsia]], [[Lu Ann Homza]], [[Stanley G. Payne]], [[Andrea Donofrio]], [[Irene Silverblatt]], [[Christopher Schmidt-Nowara]], [[Charles Gibson (historian)|Charles Gibson]], and [[Joseph Pérez]]. Contemporary historians who support the traditional view and deny the existence of a Black Legend include [[Toby Green]]. Contemporary historians who partially accept an impact of the Black Legend but deny other aspects of the hypothesis it include [[Henry Kamen]], [[David Nirenberg]] and [[Karen Armstrong]].

=== Revision after 1960 ===
{{Main|Historical revision of the Inquisition}}
The works of [[Julian Juderias|Juderias]] in (1913) and other Spanish scholars prior to him was mostly ignored by international scholarship until 1960.

One of the first books to build on them and internationally challenge the classical view was ''The Spanish Inquisition'' (1965) by [[Henry Kamen]]. Kamen argued that the Inquisition was not nearly as cruel or as powerful as commonly believed. The book was very influential and largely responsible for subsequent studies in the 1970s to try to quantify (from archival records) the Inquisition's activities from 1480 to 1834.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Jean-Pierre Dedieu, Los Cuatro Tiempos, in Bartolomé Benassar, Inquisición Española: poder político y control social, pp. 15-39 and {{harvp|García Cárcel|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those studies showed there was an initial burst of activity against conversos suspected of relapsing into Judaism, and a mid-16th century pursuit of Protestants, but the Inquisition served principally as a forum Spaniards occasionally used to humiliate and punish people they did not like: blasphemers, bigamists, foreigners and, in Aragon, homosexuals and horse smugglers.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; Kamen went on to publish two more books in 1985 and 2006 that incorporated new findings, further supporting the view that the Inquisition was not as bad as once described by Lea and others. Along similar lines is [[Edward Peters (scholar)|Edward Peters]]'s ''Inquisition'' (1988).

One of the most important works about the inquisition´s relation to the Jewish conversos or New Christians is ''The Origins of the Inquisition in Fifteenth Century Spain'' (1995/2002) by [[Benzion Netanyahu]]. It challenges the view that most conversos were actually practicing Judaism in secret and were persecuted for their crypto-Judaism. Rather, according to Netanyahu, the persecution was fundamentally racial, and was a matter of envy of their success in Spanish society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/news-and-politics/38335/personal-history/ Benzion Netanyahu’s History]&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged multiple times, and with some reasonable divergences the majority of historians either align with religious causes or with merely cultural ones, with no significant racial element.&lt;ref&gt;Vicente Ángel Álvarez Palenzuela. ''Judíos y conversos en la España medieval. Estado de la cuestión'' (Jews and converts in medieval Spain. Estate of the matter). Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) eHumanista/Converso 4 (2015):156-191 [http://www.ehumanista.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.span.d7_eh/files/sitefiles/conversos/volume3/11%20ehumcon4.palenzuela.pdf It can be checked for free here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenging some of the claims of revisionist historians is [[Toby Green]] in ''Inquisition, the Reign of Fear'', who calls the claim by revisionists that torture was only rarely applied by inquisitors, a "worrying error of fact".&lt;ref name="Green-2007-10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Thomas F. Madden]] has written about popular myths of the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/211193/real-inquisition-thomas-f-madden ''The Real Inquisition: investigating the popular myth''] by [[Thomas F. Madden]] ([[National Review]], 18 June 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
[[File:Francisco de Goya - Escena de Inquisición - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[The Inquisition Tribunal]] as illustrated by [[Francisco de Goya]]]]

The literature of the 18th century approaches the theme of the Inquisition from a critical point of view. In ''[[Candide]]'' by [[Voltaire]], the Inquisition appears as the epitome of intolerance and arbitrary justice in Europe.

During the [[Romanticism|Romantic Period]], the [[Gothic novel]], which was primarily a genre developed in Protestant countries, frequently associated Catholicism with terror and repression. This vision of the Spanish Inquisition appears in, among other works, ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796) by [[Matthew Gregory Lewis]] (set in Madrid during the Inquisition, but can be seen as commenting on the [[French Revolution]] and [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]]); ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'' (1820) by [[Charles Robert Maturin]] and ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' by [[Poland|Polish]] author [[Jan Potocki]].

Literature of the 19th century tends to focus on the element of torture employed by the Inquisition. In France, in the early 19th century, the [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Cornelia Bororquia, or the Victim of the Inquisition]]'', which has been attributed to Spaniard [[Luiz Gutiérrez]], and is based on the case of [[María de Bohórquez]], ferociously criticizes the Inquisition and its representatives. The Inquisition also appears in one of the chapters of the novel ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880) by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], which imagines an encounter between [[Jesus]] and the Inquisitor General. One of the best known stories of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]", explores along the same lines the use of torture by the Inquisition. [[File:Ф.Гойя. Из цикла Los Caprichos 1797-98.jpg|thumb|upright|''There was no remedy'', from ''[[Caprichos|Los Caprichos]]'', 1797–98, by Francisco de Goya.]] The novel [[Cornelia Bororquia]] was published in France, probably by a French writer under the false name of Luis Gutiérrez. The Inquisition, as portrayed by the Black legend, has a prominent role in ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].

The Inquisition also appears in 20th-century literature. ''La Gesta del Marrano'', by the Argentine author [[Marcos Aguinis]], portrays the length of the Inquisition's arm to reach people in Argentina during the 16th and 17th centuries. The first book in [[Les Daniels]]' "Don Sebastian Vampire Chronicles", ''The Black Castle'' (1978), is set in 15th-century Spain and includes both descriptions of Inquisitorial questioning and an [[auto-da-fé]], as well as [[Tomás de Torquemada]] appearing in one chapter. The [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' shows the Inquisition targeting [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutants]] for "blasphemy". The character [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] also appears as the [[Grand Inquisitor]]. The [[Captain Alatriste]] novels by the Spanish writer [[Arturo Pérez-Reverte]] are set in the early 17th century. The second novel, ''Purity of Blood'', has the narrator being tortured by the Inquisition and describes an [[auto-da-fé]]. [[Carme Riera]]'s novella, published in 1994, ''[[Dins el Darrer Blau]]'' (''In the Last Blue'') is set during the repression of the ''chuetas'' (''conversos'' from [[Majorca]]) at the end of the 17th century. In 1998, the Spanish writer [[Miguel Delibes]] published the historical novel ''The Heretic'', about the Protestants of [[Valladolid]] and their repression by the Inquisition. [[Samuel Shellabarger]]'s ''[[Captain from Castile]]'' deals directly with the Spanish Inquisition during the first part of the novel.

In the novel [[Cathedral of the Sea|La Catedral del Mar]]  by [[Ildefonso Falcones]], published in 2006 and set in the 14th century, there are scenes of inquisition investigations in small towns and a great scene in Barcelona.

===Film===
* The 1947 epic ''[[Captain from Castile]]'' by [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], starring [[Tyrone Power]], uses the Inquisition as the major plot point of the film. It tells how powerful families used its evils to ruin their rivals. The first part of the film shows this and the reach of the Inquisition reoccurs throughout this movie following [[Pedro De Vargas]] (played by Power) even to the 'New World'.
* The [[The History of the World Part 1#The Spanish Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition segment]] of the 1981 [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[The History of the World Part 1]]'' is a comedic musical performance based on the activities of the first [[Inquisitor General]] of Spain, [[Tomás de Torquemada]].
* The film ''[[The Fountain]]'' (2006), by [[Darren Aronofsky]], features the Spanish Inquisition as part of a plot in 1500 when the Grand Inquisitor threatens Queen Isabella's life.
* ''[[Goya's Ghosts]]'' (2006) by [[Miloš Forman]] is set in Spain between 1792 and 1809 and focuses realistically on the role of the Inquisition and its end under Napoleon's rule.
* The film ''[[Assassin's Creed (film)|Assassin's Creed]]'' (2016) by [[Justin Kurzel]], starring [[Michael Fassbender]], is set in both modern times and Spain during the Inquisition. The film follows Callum Lynch (played by Fassbender) as he is forced to relive the memories of his ancestor, Aguilar de Nehra (also played by Fassbender), an Assassin during the Spanish Inquisition.
* ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]'' ([[Roger Corman]], 1961).
*''[[Akelarre]]'' (Pedro Olea, 1984), a film, about the [[Logroño]] trial of the [[Zugarramurdi witches]].
*[[Tomás de Torquemada]] is portrayed in ''[[1492: The Conquest of Paradise]]'' (1992)

===Theatre, music, television, and video games===

* The Grand Inquisitor of Spain plays a part in ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'' (1867), a play by [[Friedrich Schiller]] (which was the basis for the opera ''[[Don Carlos]]'' in five acts by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], in which the Inquisitor is also featured, and the third act is dedicated to an ''auto-da-fé'').
* In the ''[[Monty Python]]'' comedy team's [[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|Spanish Inquisition sketches]], an inept Inquisitor group repeatedly bursts into scenes after someone utters the words "I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition", screaming "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!" The Inquisition then uses ineffectual forms of [[torture]], including a dish-drying [[Rack (torture)|rack]], soft cushions and a comfy chair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf_Y4MbUCLY 'Spanish Inquisition' Compilation - Monty Python's Flying Circus]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Spanish Inquisition features as a main plot line element of the 2009 video game ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''.
*The video game ''[[Nicolas Eymerich]]'' features a cruel, bloodthirsty and torture hungry Inquisitor as the main character.
* The Universe of ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' borrows several elements and concepts of the Catholic church Imaginarium, including the notion of the Black Legend's ideal of a fanatic Inquisitors, for some of its troops in ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor – Martyr]]''.
*The 1965 musical [[Man of La Mancha]] depicts a fictionalized account of author [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' run-in with Spanish authorities. The character of Cervantes produces a play-within-a-play of his unfinished manuscript, [[Don Quixote]], while he awaits sentencing by the Inquisition.

===Contemporary politics===

The Spanish Inquisition is a recurring trope that makes an occasional appearance in the British parliament, similar to calling something "nazi" to reject ideas seen as religiously authoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbett's Parliamentary History of England: From the Norman, Volumen 35&lt;/ref&gt;
