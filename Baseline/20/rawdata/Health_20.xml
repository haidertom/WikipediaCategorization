The '''Compensation scheme for radiation-linked diseases''' is a workers compensation scheme administered by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]]. It was established in November 1982 by [[British Nuclear Fuels Ltd|British Nuclear Fuels Limited]] and its [[Trade union|trade unions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=shCh5KzE7xEC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=%22compensation+scheme+for+radiation+linked+diseases%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ay7uRDDnnA&amp;sig=bHI_Fkk4rUc8nrJO_z454mgC10E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj6uWFjcPRAhUBTJQKHeIbBFkQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compensation%20scheme%20for%20radiation%20linked%20diseases%22&amp;f=false|title=The Redfern Inquiry into human tissue analysis in UK nuclear facilities|last=|first=|date=2010-11-16|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=|isbn=9780102966183|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following legal actions brought against the company by nuclear industry workers in the late 1970s. At the time of its establishment, BNFL and its trade unions agreed that the causation of cancer by radiation was sufficiently well understood that "it should be possible to construct a scheme which would evaluate the probability that a diagnosed cancer may have been caused by radiation exposure at work." Initially the scheme only accepted claims in which a worker had died from a radiation-linked disease. In 1987 this was expanded to allow [[Disease|morbidity]] claims.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/scheme_history.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Scheme history|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of participating member employers and trade unions has grown through the 1990s and 2000s. As of December 2015, 1525 claims have been made out of which 156 have been successful.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/annual_statement.php|title=CSRLD: 2015 Compensation Scheme Annual Statement|last=|first=|date=2015-12-01|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eligibility ==
In order to be eligible for compensation, a worker must have been employed by a listed company, and have received an occupational radiation dose. Then the claimant must have developed [[cancer]] of the [[Bladder cancer|bladder]], [[Bone Cancer|bone]], [[Brain cancer|brain]] and central nervous system, [[Breast cancer|breast]] or [[Uterine cancer|uterus]] (for female workers), [[Colorectal cancer|colon]], [[Liver cancer|liver]], [[Esophageal cancer|oesophagus]], respiratory or [[Lung cancer|lung]], prostate, [[Ovarian cancer|ovary]], skin (non-Melanoma), [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]] or other tissues. Other compensable diseases include [[Cataract|cataracts]] and [[Leukemia|leukaemias]] (with two exceptions). Some diseases are excluded on the basis that there is no convincing epidemiological evidence to link them with ionising radiation exposure. Excluded diseases include: [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin’s disease]], [[Hairy cell leukemia|hairy cell leukaemia]], [[Chronic lymphatic leukemia|chronic lymphatic leukaemia]] (CLL), [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]] and [[mesothelioma]].

=== Member Trade Unions ===
In 1982, trade union members of the scheme included [[Transport and General Workers' Union|Transport and General Workers Union]], [[Institution of Professional Civil Servants]], [[Amalgamated Engineering Union]], [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] and PCS. Other trades unions joined as the scheme expanded. Later members include the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union|EETPU]] and [[Manufacturing Science Finance|MSF]], [[Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians|UCATT]], [[Engineers and Managers Association]], [[UNISON|Unison]], the [[First Division Association]] of Civil Servants, the AEA Constabulary Federation (now the Civil Nuclear Police Federation) and the [[Defence Police Federation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/scheme_employers.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Scheme employers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claiming compensation ==
Claims may be lodged by the worker, his or her wife, husband or partner (including same sex), the worker's "first line children" (those born to or legally adopted by the claimant). Once diagnosed with or deceased from an eligible disease, the worker or surviving family members have 30 years in which to make a claim. Claims can be made online, by post, by phone or through the worker's trade union. Once made, claims are assessed on consideration of medical, employment and dosimetry histories and data. These are used to calculate the probability that the cancer could have been caused by occupational exposure to radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/qa.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Q &amp; A|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Payments ==
The payment received following a successful claim varies depending on the actual loss (in earnings and pension) suffered by the claimant and sums for pain and suffering, loss of amenity and number of dependents. The level of payment awarded to a claimant (or estate if deceased) is determined by the "causation probability". The greater the causation probability, the greater the payment. Top tier payments are awarded if the causation probability is 50% or more. The Scheme publishes an Annual statement which is approved by the Scheme Council. The report includes a paragraph updating the number of claims and payments awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/case_processing.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Case Processing|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 22 February 2005, 1000 claims had been made, of which 97 had been awarded to varying degrees along a sliding scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oxqdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT152&amp;lpg=PT152&amp;dq=%22compensation+scheme+for+radiation+linked+diseases%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sCtN2E6adQ&amp;sig=0MUeAJ5xKrJx-EFVDn_13BMYhEI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj6uWFjcPRAhUBTJQKHeIbBFkQ6AEIRzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compensation%20scheme%20for%20radiation%20linked%20diseases%22&amp;f=false|title=Assessment of the Scientific Information for the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|date=2005-10-01|publisher=National Academies Press|year=|isbn=9780309096102|location=|pages=137|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015, 1525 cases had been considered since the compensation scheme for radiation-linked diseases was established. 156 of these claims were successful, and payments totaling £8.24 million had been dispatched.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3512">'''Consumer health informatics''' ('''CHI''') is a sub-branch of [[health informatics]] that helps bridge the gap between patients and health resources. It is defined by the [[American Medical Informatics Association]] as "the field devoted to informatics from multiple consumer or patient views". The Consumer Health Informatics Working Group (CHIWG) of the [[International Medical Informatics Association]] (IMIA) define it as "the use of modern computers and telecommunications to support consumers in obtaining information, analyzing unique health care needs and helping them make decisions about their own health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IMIA|first1=CHIWG|title=Consumer Health Informatics|url=http://www.imia-medinfo.org/new2/node/137|website=IMIA|accessdate=8 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307030452/http://www.imia-medinfo.org/new2/node/137|archivedate=7 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHI includes patient-focused informatics, [[health literacy]], and [[consumer education]]. The focus of this field is to allow consumers to manage their own health, through the use of internet-based strategies and resources with consumer-friendly language. Currently, CHI stands at a crossroads between various healthcare related fields such as nursing, public health, health promotion, and health education&lt;ref&gt;American Medical Informatics Association.

Medical informatics has expanded rapidly over the past couple of years.{{When|date=July 2012}}  After decades of development of information systems designed primarily for physicians and other healthcare managers and professionals, there is an increasing interest in reaching consumers and patients directly through computers and telecommunications systems. Consumer health informatics is the branch of medical informatics that analyses consumers' needs for information; studies and implements methods of making information accessible to consumers; and models and integrates consumers' preferences into medical information systems. Consumer informatics stands at the crossroads of other disciplines, such as [[nursing informatics]], [[public health]], health promotion, [[health education]], [[library science]], and [[communication science]], and is perhaps the most challenging and rapidly{{Quantify|date=July 2012}} expanding field in medical informatics; it is paving the way{{Peacock term|date=July 2012}} for health care in the information age.&lt;ref&gt;BMJ 2000; 320 : 1713 {{doi|10.1136/bmj.320.7251.1713}} (Published 24 June 2000){{Full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a man can reach orgasm within a few minutes of active thrusting during [[sexual intercourse]], whereas a man with delayed ejaculation either does not have orgasms at all or cannot have an orgasm until after prolonged intercourse which might last for 30–45 minutes or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Knowles |first=David R. |encyclopedia=A.D.A.M.

It is the least common of the male sexual dysfunctions, and can result as a side effect of some medications. In one survey, 8% of men reported being unable to achieve orgasm over a 2-month period or longer in the previous year.&lt;ref name = Oxford2009&gt;Strassberg, D. S., &amp; Perelman, M. A. (2009).

==Signs and symptoms==
Delayed ejaculation can be ''mild'' (men who still experience orgasm during intercourse, but only under certain conditions), ''moderate'' (cannot ejaculate during intercourse, but can during [[fellatio]] or manual stimulation), ''severe'' (can ejaculate only when alone), or ''most severe'' (cannot ejaculate at all).&lt;ref name = Oxford2009/&gt; All forms may result in a sense of [[sexual frustration]].&lt;ref&gt;Hatzimouratidis, Konstantinos, et al.

==Causes==
Medical conditions that can cause delayed ejaculation include [[hypogonadism]], [[thyroid]] disorders, [[pituitary]] disorders such as [[Cushing's disease]], [[prostate]] surgery outcome, and drug and alcohol use.&lt;ref name=Oxford2009/&gt; Difficulty in achieving orgasm can also result from [[pelvic]] [[surgery]] that involved [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to pelvic nerves responsible for orgasm. Some men report a lack of sensation in the nerves of the glans penis, which may or may not be related to external factors, including a history of circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Dias J, Freitas R, Amorim R, Espiridião P, Xambre L, Ferraz L, Adult circumcision and male sexual health: a retrospective analysis, Andrologia, 20 April 2013 {{DOI|10.1111/and.12101}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/and.12101/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

Delayed ejaculation is a possible [[adverse effect|side effect]] of certain [[medications]], including [[SSRI|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), [[opiates]] such as [[morphine]], [[methadone]], or [[oxycodone]], many [[benzodiazepines]] such as Valium, certain antipsychotics, and [[antihypertensives]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drugs.com/enc/delayed-ejaculation.html drugs.com &gt; Delayed ejaculation] Review Date: 6/5/2007.

Factors such as pressure, angle and [[death-grip|grip]] during masturbation can make for an experience so different from sex with a partner that the ability to ejaculate is reduced or eliminated.

On the same note, it may be the visual factor present in masturbation that may delay vaginal ejaculation. As the sensation during masturbation is intrinsically linked with the visual input of a sexual model, be it male or female, the diminished view during sex may result in the loss of that link, and as such, delay ejaculation in the man. A possible cure for this may be a better view of the partner during intercourse. {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Treatment==

===Sex therapy===
Therapy usually involves homework assignments and exercises intended to help a man get used to having orgasms through [[insertional intercourse]], vaginal, anal, or oral, that is through the way to which he is not accustomed. Commonly, the couple is advised to go through three stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sex_relationships/facts/ejaculatoryincompetence.htm|title=Delayed ejaculation (retarded ejaculation)|publisher=NetDoctor.co.uk|date=2007-06-25|accessdate=2007-10-25|author=Dr. David Delvin}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the first stage, a man masturbates in the presence of his partner. Sometimes, this is not an easy matter as a man may be used to having orgasms alone. After a man learns to ejaculate in the presence of his partner, the man's hand is replaced with the hand of his partner. In the final stage, the receptive partner inserts the [[insertive partner]]'s [[penis]] into the partner's vagina, anus, or mouth as soon as the ejaculation is felt to be imminent. Thus, a man gradually learns to ejaculate inside the desired orifice by an incremental process.&lt;ref name=Oxford2009/&gt;

===Other===
[[Meditation]] has demonstrated effectiveness in case studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/v673716h15l1672n/|title=Case reports on the use of meditative relaxation as an intervention strategy with retarded ejaculation |publisher=Springer Netherlands|date=June 1984|accessdate=2007-10-25|author=M.

'''Environmental Health Officers''' (also known as '''Public Health Inspectors''' or '''Environmental Health Practitioners''') are responsible for carrying out measures for protecting public health, including administering and enforcing legislation related to [[environmental health]] and providing support to minimize health and safety hazards. Environmental Health Practitioners are multi-skilled in many areas with individuals being highly trained, usually to degree level, and often requiring additional professional training, professional competency assessment and continuing professional development in order to continue to practise in the field.
They are involved in a variety of activities, for example inspecting food facilities, investigating public health nuisances, and implementing disease control, conducting work place safety assessments and accident investigation. Environmental health officers are focused on prevention, consultation, investigation, and education of the community regarding health risks and maintaining a safe environment.

EHOs bring to the position an understanding of microbiology, risk assessment, environmental science and technology, food science, knowledge of the built environment as well as the skills and knowledge related to the tracking and control of communicable disease, investigation of environmental health related incidents and criminal investigations. They therefore must also have strong investigative skills and a thorough understanding of the application of legislation related to public health, the built environment, pollution control and workplace safety. Working in partnership with Government Ministries (such as Health, Agriculture and Environment), local municipalities, businesses, community groups, other agencies and individual members of the community, the EHO plays a major role in protecting public health. They are allowed with a permit to select what to inspect.

Some past/historic titles include inspector of nuisances, sanitarian, and sanitary inspector. Other titles that currently exist include environmental health specialist/practitioner/professional, public health officer, health officer, health inspector, and health official. The legal title used will depend on the definitions found in local legislation/jurisdiction.

Environmental health professionals are usually employed by local government or state health authorities to advise on and enforce [[public health]] standards. However, many are employed in the [[private sector]] the [[military]] and other third sector agencies such as charities and NGOs.

==Jobs==
The following represents jobs that can be found in either the public or private sectors:
* Inspection and enforcement services
* Environmental health consulting and education
* Communicable disease investigations and outbreak control
* Food safety course training
* Community planning
* Sewage disposal (septic) systems planning
* Floor plan review and approval
* Housing standards/quality inspection and control
* Urban renewal 
* Pest control
* Emergency contingency planning and implementation
* Noise control
* Air quality monitoring
* Health and safety at work inspection and control
* Water testing (drinking water &amp; recreational water)
* Tobacco control
* Community care facilities licensing
* Public Buildings
* Quality Improvement

The common identifier of environmental health personnel is that they are responsible for the identification, evaluation and management of risks to human health from factors in the environment, whether on behalf of government agencies or commercial and industrial concerns.

==Roles==
A Public Health Inspector (also known as an Environmental Health Officer) investigates health hazards in a wide variety of settings, and will take action to mitigate or eliminate the hazards. Usually the public perception of a health inspector is someone who examines restaurants and ensures they maintain sanitary standards for food safety set by the regulating authority. However, public health inspectors have much broader job duties, including inspecting swimming pools, substandard housing conditions, public schools, day cares, nursing homes, and personal service establishments such as tattoo parlours. Depending on their jurisdiction, Registered Environmental Health Officers often permit and inspect wells, private water systems, and individual subsurface sewage disposal (septic) systems. Other tasks include: campground inspections, tanning salon inspections, beauty salon inspections, correctional facility inspections and mobile home park inspection. The public health inspector (environmental health officer) also plays a vital role in community projects such as those concerning health promotion, tobacco reduction, healthy built environments/healthy communities, food security, and emergency preparedness.
  
They may also respond to complaints such as animal bites, garbage complaints, odor complaints, or sewage overflows. Due to their educational background they can provide information and referrals with regards to; lead, radon, mold, and emerging diseases such as West Nile Virus and Avian Flu. The field also overlaps with hazardous materials (Hazmat) and many Hazmat responders are also Licensed Environmental Health Practitioners or Registered Environmental Health Specialists.

==Working conditions==
Environmental health officers work with many different people in a variety of environments. Their jobs often involve considerable fieldwork, and some travel frequently. Many environmental health officers work long and often irregular hours. They inspect pools, childcare centers, restaurants, septic systems, and many other types of establishments that relate to health and safety.

Environmental health officers may be exposed to many of the same physically strenuous conditions and hazards as industrial employees, and the work may be performed in unpleasant, stressful, and dangerous working conditions. They may find themselves in an adversarial role if the management of an organization disagrees with the recommendations for ensuring a safe working environment.

==History==
The field of environmental health can be traced back to the 1840s in England. [[Edwin Chadwick]], a Poor Law Commissioner, conducted an inquiry into the causes of poverty which concluded that people often became poor because of ill health due to a bad environment. He believed that improving sanitation was the key to breaking this vicious cycle.

Chadwick led a vigorous campaign for change which eventually won over the establishment, resulting in the [[Public Health Act 1848]]. The Act provided for the appointment of Inspectors of Nuisances – the forerunners of today’s environmental health practitioners – in areas of need.

The Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors – the organisation which was to become the United Kingdom's [[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]] – was established in 1883. Over subsequent decades, the role of environmental health practitioners changed and grew, with standards of qualification rising until, in the 1960s, it became a graduate profession. The grant of a Royal Charter in 1984 set the seal on this enhanced role and status. As a result of changing roles, the titles have changed over the decades from inspector of nuisances -&gt; sanitary inspector -&gt; public health inspector / environmental health officer (see Inspector of Nuisances below). This is also true internationally, as the titles have changed to reflect the advanced education and roles of environmental health officers today.

===Inspector of Nuisances===
An Inspector of Nuisances was the title of an office in several English-speaking jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions this term is now archaic, the position and/or term having been replaced by others. In the United Kingdom from the mid 19th century this office was generally associated with public health and sanitation.

The first Inspector of Nuisances appointed by a UK local authority Health Committee was [[Thomas Fresh]]  in Liverpool in 1844. Both the 1855 Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act and the Metropolis Management Act 1855 defined such an office but with the title of 'Sanitary Inspector'. In local authorities that had established a Board of Health, the title was 'Inspector of Nuisances'. Eventually the title was standardized across all UK local authorities as 'Sanitary Inspector'. An Act of Parliament later changed the title to 'Public Health Inspector'. Similar offices were established across the British Empire.

The nearest modern equivalent of this position in the UK is an Environmental Health Officer. This title being adopted by local authorities on the recommendation of Central Government after the Local Government Act 1972. Today, Registered UK Environmental Health Officers working in non-enforcement roles (e.g. in the private sector) may prefer to use the generic term 'Environmental Health Practitioner'.

In the United States, a modern example of an officer with the title 'Inspector of Nuisances' but not the public health role is found in Section 3767[7] of the Ohio Revised Code which defines such a position to investigate nuisances, where this term broadly covers establishments in which lewdness and alcohol are found. Whereas in the United States the environmental health officer role in local authorities is taken by officers with the titles 'Registered Environmental Health Specialist' or 'Registered Sanitarian' depending on the jurisdiction. The role in the US Public Health Service is undertaken by Commissioned (uniformed) 'Environmental Health Officers'.

==Qualifications==
Environmental health is a graduate career in most countries. The minimum requirements in most countries include an approved university degree program, field training and professional certification &amp; registration.

===Australia – General===
[[Environmental Health Australia]] accredits Australian Environmental Health Degree and Graduate Diploma programs in accordance with the Environmental Health Australia  [http://accreditation.eh.org.au/ Accreditation Policy] to ensure course content meets nationally consistent requirements for practice as an EHO anywhere in Australia.

Public Health Inspectors are highly trained individuals whose training include a bachelor's degree in environmental health followed by certification by the [[Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors]] (CIPHI). To become nationally certified, public health inspectors must complete a field training practicum, submit a number of reports and pass the Institute's exam. Some inspectors have additional training in areas such as biology, toxicology and epidemiology.

Only six schools in Canada offer degree programs approved by the CIPHI as meeting the educational component for certification: British Columbia Institute of Technology, Cape Breton University, Concordia University of Edmonton, Conestoga College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, First Nations University of Canada, and Ryerson University. These programs are generally four years long, however fast-track programs are available in some schools for those who have completed a previous science degree.

'''Happy life expectancy''' ('''HLE''') is calculated by multiplying [[life expectancy]] by a happiness index. The first uses life expectancy at birth. The happiness index is the average appreciation of life (with a value from 0 to 1) from the [[World Database of Happiness|world databases of happiness]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.eur.nl/fsw/research/veenhoven/Pub1990s/96b-full.pdf|title=Happy Life-Expectancy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality of life indexes==
Arguably, one of the most widely valued social indicators is happiness. Social researchers often use the term [[quality of life|quality of life (QOL)]] to describe what is commonly called "happiness". One of the leading pioneers of happiness research is  Ruut Veenhoven (see [[#References]])), emeritus-professor of 'social conditions for human happiness' at [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] in the Netherlands. He is also one of the chief critics of one of the most widely used QOL indexes, the Human Development Index (HDI) published by [[Human development index|the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]]. His 1996 paper "Happy Life-Expectancy, A Comprehensive Measure of Quality-of Life in Nations", which appeared in the journal ''Social Indicators Research'', proposed an alternative QOL index, called happy life expectancy (HLE). HLE may be a better indicator of happiness as it relies on subjective measures of happiness, as opposed to the largely materialistic measures that go into creating the HDI.

===HDI===
{{main|Human Development Index}}
The HDI measures average achievements based on three dimensions: 1. [[life-span]], as measured by life expectancy at birth. 2. Education, as measured by the adult literacy rate and average number of years spent in school in adults over 25 3. Standard of living, as measured by GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms in US dollars. Veenhoven is critical of the HDI because it measures QOL in terms of input, while never addressing to what extent these input provisions are in fact good for people. Furthermore, the HDI is a rather generalized index that gives a simple average of the three-dimensional achievements mentioned above, which can be expressed in this formula:
::HDI = 1/3 (life expectancy index) + 1/3 (education index) + 1/3 (GDP index).

One can see that highly developed nations can have high life expectancy rates if those nations rely on excessive measures to keep a person alive. The HDI however does not account for the HOW of a particular dimension, but merely the NET RESULT. In the HDI, a hypothetical nation that had a life expectancy of say 100, would score very highly, regardless of how this nation sustained life. Using the actual HDI for 2004, [[economic history of China|China]] ranked number 22 out of 177 nations included in the HDI, right behind Germany (number 21 in the 2004 HDI). One of the reasons China ranked so highly was because its GDP was very high, although its education index and life expectancy are low when compared to other nations, such as the United States, Japan, or Germany.

===HLE===
"The most fundamental problem with this generation of QOL's," writes Veenhoven, "... is that they do not distinguish between means and ends, nor between societal input and societal output."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; "Economic affluence," he writes, "can hardly be seen as an end in itself."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; HLE does not mix means and ends; but rather, looks at societal output specifically. For example, while current QOL-indices will look at 'healthcare' and 'health' as a single indicator, HLE focuses on the ends, 'health.' This makes HLE a more specific index than traditional QOL-indices. The output centric method of HLE is also one of its shortcomings. Veenhoven says, "it is of little help in daily piecemeal decision making."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He adds, "Because it is a long term measure, it reacts slowly... it is more analogous to climate change than to the weather."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==HLE, better QOL gauge==
Nonetheless, the HLE may prove to be a better gauge and social tool in accessing what political and social policies can actually make a nation's peoples happier in the long run. HLE uses eight 'nation characteristics' when calculating the 'happy life-expectancy.' These  criteria (which are further individuated into more subjective determinants within the larger category) are: affluence, security, freedom, social equality, cultural climate, social climate, modernization, population pressure. In determining HLE scores, Veenhoven multiplied standard-life expectancy by a happiness index correlated from the eight characteristics listed above. Iceland had the highest HLE observed by Veenhoven's method, while Bulgaria had the lowest. The HLE was not found to be related to unemployment, state welfare, or income equality, nor to religiousness and trust in institutions.

==HDI, top 5 countries==
There are startling differences between the QOL-indexes as reported by Veenhoven's method and those of the dominant QOL, the United Nation's HDI. In 1996 the nations with the highest HDI were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr_1996_en_indicators1.pdf|title=- Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Canada
# USA
# Japan
# Netherlands
# Norway

==HLE, top 5 countries==
In that same year the nations with the highest HLE were:

# Iceland
# Netherlands
# Sweden
# Switzerland
# Austria

The USA ranked 10th on the 1996 HLE scale.

'''''Hazards''''' is an independent, award-winning [[occupational safety and health]] [[magazine]]. Published quarterly, it is the [[trade union]] recommended magazine for UK union health and safety representatives. ''Hazards'' has also jointly developed a NewsWire with [[LabourStart]] which provides health and safety news headlines for union websites as an [[RSS]] feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Health and Safety NewsWire|url=http://www.labourstart.org/docs/en/000077.html|accessdate=17 July 2013|work=[[LabourStart]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Hazards'' was conceived in January 1976 as the ''Hazards Bulletin'' by Charlie Clutterbuck, Alan Dalton and Tony Fletcher - all members of the [[British Society for Social Responsibility in Science]] (BSSRS) - in response to the introduction of the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]].&lt;ref name="hazards"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hazards|work=BSSRS|url=https://sites.google.com/site/bssrsarchive/groups/hazards|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Background|work=BSSRS|url=https://sites.google.com/site/bssrsarchive/groups/hazards/background|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three had been involved in the production of the BSSRS magazine ''Science for People'' (SfP), which "provided brief coverage of topical science matters from a radical standpoint as well as reporting on the work of BSSRS", and increasingly found themselves addressing [[Labour movement|organised labour]] events on the subject of industrial hazards.&lt;ref name=hazards/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Science for People|work=BSSRS|url=https://sites.google.com/site/bssrsarchive/clients/resources|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clutterbuck said later: "We recognised that there was a lot of different people becoming more interested in health and safety matters, because it was more "political". We saw health and safety at the very core of the crunch between capital and labour.

Following publication of his book ''Asbestos: Killer Dust'' (1979; BSSRS) Dalton was successfully sued for libel in 1984 by Robert Murray, a former medical adviser to the [[Trades Union Congress]]. In the book Dalton had criticised Murray's pro-asbestos industry views and claimed that they were contrary to his position within the union movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defending the Indefensible: The Global Asbestos Industry and its Fight for Survival|first1=Jock|last1=McCulloch|first2=Geoffrey|last2=Tweedale|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=2008|isbn=9780199534852|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Murray was only awarded £500 damages, Dalton's legal costs of £30,000 bankrupted ''Hazards Bulletin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obituary: Alan Dalton, Environmental campaigner who helped get asbestos banned|first=Rory|last=O'Neill|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=16 December 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/dec/16/guardianobituaries|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine relaunched under the truncated title ''Hazards'' the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obituary: Alan Dalton|work=Hazards|location=Sheffield|year=2003|url=http://www.hazards.org/alandalton/|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multiple morbidities''' or '''Multimorbidities''' means co-occurring [[disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Valderas JM, Starfield B, Sibbald B, Salisbury C, Roland M. Defining comorbidity: implications for understanding health and health services. Ann Fam Med. 2009 Jul-Aug;7(4):357-63.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person could have [[diabetes]] and [[heart disease]] and [[high blood pressure]].  In the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] population, 65% of patients have two or more [[chronic illness]]es.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;Wolff JL, Starfield B, Anderson G.  [[Prevalence]], [[expenditures]], and complications of multiple [[chronic conditions]] in the elderly.  Arch Intern Med. 2002 Nov 11;162(20):2269-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the difficulties experienced by patients include: poor coordination of [[medical care]], managing multiple [[medication]]s, increases in their time spent managing illness,&lt;ref&gt;Jowsey, T., McRae, I. S., Valderas, J. M., Dugdale, P., Phillips, R., Bunton, R., ... &amp; Yen, L. (2013). Time’s up. Descriptive epidemiology of multi-morbidity and time spent on health related activity by older Australians: A time use survey. PLOS One, 8(4), e59379.&lt;/ref&gt; difficulty managing multiple illness management regimes,&lt;ref&gt;Jowsey, T., Dennis, S., Yen, L., Mofizul Islam, M., Parkinson, A., &amp; Dawda, P. (2016). Time to manage: patient strategies for coping with an absence of care coordination and continuity. Sociology of health &amp; illness, 38(6), 854-873.&lt;/ref&gt; and aggravation of one condition by [[symptoms]] or treatment of another.&lt;ref name=Bayliss&gt;Bayliss EA, Steiner JF, Fernald DH, Crane LA, Main DS.  Descriptions of barriers to self-care by persons with comorbid chronic diseases.  Ann Fam Med. 2003 May-Jun;1(1):15-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
Concerning the qualitative experience of people with multimorbid chronic illness, Jowsey et al (2009) write: 
"Co-morbidity increased the amount of time participants spent managing their health and increased patients' dependency on others. Patients with co-morbid conditions encountered problems with the coordination between services and with polypharmacy. Patients prioritised the management of one condition over another; consequently, some health issues could be neglected or compromised. The three most common challenges to patients and carers in managing chronic illness (either caused or made worse by co-morbidity), relate to acting on risk factors, recognising signs and symptoms of illness and managing medications."&lt;ref&gt;Jowsey, T., Jeon, Y. H., Dugdale, P., Glasgow, N. J., Kljakovic, M., &amp; Usherwood, T. (2009). Challenges for co-morbid chronic illness care and policy in Australia: a qualitative study. Australia and New Zealand health policy, 6(1), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
These kinds of challenges for people living with multiple chronic conditions have direct implications for health services and the way they support patient self-management.&lt;ref&gt;Jowsey, T., Dennis, S., Yen, L., Mofizul Islam, M., Parkinson, A., &amp; Dawda, P. (2016). Time to manage: patient strategies for coping with an absence of care coordination and continuity. Sociology of health &amp; illness, 38(6), 854-873.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multimorbidity is common in people who are elderly,&lt;ref&gt;Britt, H. C., Harrison, C. M., Miller, G. C., &amp; Knox, S. A. (2008). Prevalence and patterns of multimorbidity in Australia. The Medical Journal of Australia, 189(2), 72-77.&lt;/ref&gt; [[malnourishment|malnourished]], or poor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33407">'''Nutriepigenomics''' is the study of food [[nutrient]]s and their effects on human health through [[epigenetic]] modifications.  There is now considerable evidence that nutritional imbalances during [[gestation]] and [[lactation]] are linked to [[non-communicable disease]]s, such as [[obesity]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], and [[cancer]].  If metabolic disturbances occur during critical time windows of development, the resulting epigenetic alterations can lead to permanent changes in tissue and organ structure or function and predispose individuals to disease.&lt;ref name="Gallou"&gt;Gallou-Kabani C, Vige A, Gross MS, Junien C. Nutri-epigenomics: Lifelong remodelling of our epigenomes by nutritional and metabolic factors and beyond. Clin Chem Lab Med. 2007;45(3):321-7 {{DOI|10.1515/CCLM.2007.081}} {{PMID|17378726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Epigenetics]] relates to heritable changes in [[gene]] function that occur independently of alterations in primary [[DNA]] sequence.  Two major epigenetic mechanisms implicated in nutriepigenomics are [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone]] modification.  DNA methylation in [[gene promoter]] regions usually results in [[gene silencing]] and influences gene expression.  While this form of gene silencing is extremely important in development and cellular differentiation, aberrant DNA methylation can be detrimental and has been linked to various disease processes, such as cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Berdasco M, Esteller M. Aberrant epigenetic landscape in cancer: How cellular identity goes awry. Dev Cell. 2010 Nov 16;19(5):698-711 {{DOI|10.1016/j.devcel.2010.10.005}} {{PMID|21074720}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The methyl groups used in DNA methylation are often derived from dietary sources, such as folate and [[choline]], and explains why diet can have a significant impact on methylation patterns and gene expression.&lt;ref name="Pozharny"&gt;Pozharny Y, Lambertini L, Clunie G, Ferrara L, Lee MJ. Epigenetics in women's health care. Mt Sinai J Med. 2010 Mar;77(2):225-35 {{DOI|10.1002/msj.20176}} {{PMID|20309920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gene silencing can also be reinforced through the recruitment of [[histone deacetylases]] to decrease transcriptional activation.  Conversely, [[histone acetylation]] induces transcriptional activation to increase gene expression.  Dietary components can influence these epigenetic events, thereby altering gene expression and disturbing functions such as appetite control, metabolic balance and fuel utilization.&lt;ref name="Gallou"/&gt;

Various genetic sequences can be targeted for epigenetic modification.  A [[transcriptome]]-wide analysis in mice found that a protein-restricted (PR) diet during gestation resulted in differential gene expression in approximately 1% of the fetal genes analyzed (235/22,690).  Specifically, increased expression was seen in genes involved in the [[p53]] pathway, [[apoptosis]], negative regulators of cell metabolism, and genes related to epigenetic control.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe CP, Goyal R, Holweger JD, Longo LD. Placental gene expression responses to maternal protein restriction in the mouse. Placenta. 2009 May;30(5):411-7 {{DOI|10.1016/j.placenta.2009.03.002}} {{PMID|19362366}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional studies have investigated the effect of a PR-diet in rats and found changes in promoter methylation of both the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] and [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]] (PPAR).&lt;ref&gt;Lillycrop KA, Phillips ES, Torrens C, Hanson MA, Jackson AA, Burdge GC. Feeding pregnant rats a protein-restricted diet persistently alters the methylation of specific cytosines in the hepatic PPAR alpha promoter of the offspring. Br J Nutr. 2008 Aug;100(2):278-82 {{DOI|10.1017/S0007114507894438}} {{PMID|18186951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lillycrop KA, Slater-Jefferies JL, Hanson MA, Godfrey KM, Jackson AA, Burdge GC. Induction of altered epigenetic regulation of the hepatic glucocorticoid receptor in the offspring of rats fed a protein-restricted diet during pregnancy suggests that reduced DNA methyltransferase-1 expression is involved in impaired DNA methylation and changes in histone modifications. Br J Nutr. 2007 Jun;97(6):1064-73 {{DOI|10.1017/S000711450769196X}} {{PMID|17433129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altered expression of these receptors can result in elevated blood glucose levels and affect lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.&lt;ref name="Pozharny"/&gt; Feeding a PR-diet to pregnant and/or lactating mice also increased expression of [[glucokinase]], [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]], [[PPARα]], and [[acyl-CoA oxidase]].&lt;ref name="Burdge"&gt;Burdge GC, Lillycrop KA. Nutrition, epigenetics, and developmental plasticity: Implications for understanding human disease. Annu Rev Nutr. 2010 Aug 21;30:315-39 {{DOI|10.1146/annurev.nutr.012809.104751}} {{PMID|20415585}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes in expression were reportedly due to epigenetic regulation of either the gene promoter itself, or promoters of transcription factors that regulate gene expression.  Additional genes that have been shown, either by [[in vitro]] or [[in vivo]] studies, to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms include [[leptin]], [[SOCS3]], [[glucose transporter]] (GLUT)-4, [[POMC]], [[Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2|11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2]] and [[Corticotrophin-releasing factor|corticotrophin releasing hormone]].  Epigenetic modification of these genes may lead to “metabolic programming” of the fetus and result in long-term changes in [[metabolism]] and energy homeostasis.&lt;ref name="Tamashiro"&gt;Tamashiro KL, Moran TH. Perinatal environment and its influences on metabolic programming of offspring. Physiol Behav. 2010 Jul 14;100(5):560-6 {{DOI|10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.04.008}} {{PMID|20394764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutriepigenomics and development==
The period of development in which the nutritional imbalance occurs is very important in determining which disease-related genes will be affected.  Different organs have critical developmental stages, and the time point at which they are compromised will predispose individuals to specific diseases.&lt;ref name="hanley"&gt;Hanley B, Dijane J, Fewtrell M, Grynberg A, Hummel S, Junien C, Koletzko B, Lewis S, Renz H, Symonds M, Gros M, Harthoorn L, Mace K, Samuels F, van Der Beek EM. Metabolic imprinting, programming and epigenetics - a review of present priorities and future opportunities. Br J Nutr. 2010 Jul;104 Suppl 1:S1-25 {{DOI|10.1017/S0007114510003338}} {{PMID|20929595}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Epigenetic modifications that occur during development may not be expressed until later in life depending on the function of the gene.&lt;ref name="Pozharny"/&gt; While the majority of studies implicate [[prenatal]] and [[perinatal]] periods as critical time windows, some research has shown that nutritional intake during [[adulthood]] can also affect the epigenome.

===Prenatal ===
[[Developmental plasticity]] is the process in which fetuses adapt to their environment.  Environmental cues, including dietary components, present in the [[in utero]] environment can induce significant changes in the expression of the genome through epigenetic modifications.&lt;ref name="Burdge"/&gt; Fetal developmental plastic responses can cause changes in lean body mass, endocrinology, blood flow and vascular loading, and lead to increased risk of various diseases in adulthood.

====Low Birth Weight ====
Fetal exposure to calcium, folate, magnesium, high or low protein, and zinc have all been associated with birth weight.&lt;ref name="hanley"/&gt; Numerous studies have investigated the link between birth weight and risk of disease and have found that low birth weight is significantly associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and type-2 diabetes.  Most importantly, these associations occurred after adjusting for lifestyle factors, implying a genetic basis for onset of disease.&lt;ref name = "Simmons"&gt;Simmons R. Epigenetics and maternal nutrition: Nature v. nurture.

[[Image:Histones.jpg|thumb|alt=PDX1 is an essential transcription factor for proper development and function of pancreatic [[beta cells]].  Poor maternal nutrition is linked to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight, and can result in decreased expression of PDX1 through decreased histone acetylation at the PDX1 proximal promoter.  Reduced expression of PDX1 may result in improper formation of beta cells and increase the risk of type-2 diabetes in the offspring.|Development of type 2 diabetes following intrauterine growth retardation in rats is associated with progressive epigenetic silencing of Pdx1]]

==== Obesity ====
Obesity during pregnancy and high-fat maternal diets both show strong associations with obesity in offspring.  As the number of overweight reproductive-age women increases, the number of overweight children and infants also increases.&lt;ref name="Simmons"/&gt;  It has been postulated that maternal obesity causes an accumulation of fat in fetal [[adipose tissue]] (adiposity) and predisposes babies for obesity in childhood and adulthood.&lt;ref name = "Simmons"/&gt;  Animal studies have shown that maternal overnutrition may impact brain development and cause disruptions to programming of the [[hypothalamus]].  Offspring that were exposed to a high-fat or high-caloric maternal diet had increased levels of insulin, glucose and leptin.  It is hypothesized that these elevations are due to disturbances in the complex neuronal network that includes the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) pathways.&lt;ref name="Tamashiro"/&gt;  This altered neuronal signaling can consequently impact food-intake behavior and lead to diet-induced obesity in adulthood.  While epigenetic modifications are most likely involved in the development of obesity, the specific target genes have yet to be identified.  Genes involved in adipogenesis, such as fibroblast growth-factor-2, phosphatase and tensin homologue, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A and oestrogen receptor-alpha, possess multiple [[CpG islands]] in their promoter sites and may act as epigenetic targets.&lt;ref name="Campion"&gt;Campion J, Milagro FI, Martinez JA. Individuality and epigenetics in obesity. Obes Rev. 2009 Jul;10(4):383-92 {{DOI|10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00595.x}} {{PMID|19413700}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, it has been shown that prenatal exposure to a hypomethylating agent, such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), is associated with increased body weight and suggests modified DNA methylation as a mechanism for increasing susceptibility to obesity.&lt;ref name="Campion"/&gt;

==== Folate ====
It has long been realized that maternal folate intake during pregnancy is linked to fetal development and growth, and can reduce the risk of serious birth defects.  Folate is a source of [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM), which is used to supply DNA methyltransferases with methyl groups.  Therefore, changes in folate supply have a substantial effect on DNA methylation patterns.  Low levels of folate are associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, poor growth of the placenta and uterus, and intrauterine growth retardation.&lt;ref name="Pozharny"/&gt;  Several complex diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and [[autism]] have also been linked to maternal folate status.  Based on animal studies it has been hypothesized that reduced folate intake could increase the risk of [[neural tube defects]] by reducing the amount of methylayed DNA during cranial neural tube closure.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlevy LP, Burren KA, Mills K, Chitty LS, Copp AJ, Greene ND. Integrity of the methylation cycle is essential for mammalian neural tube closure. Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol. 2006 Jul;76(7):544-52 {{DOI|10.1002/bdra.20286}} {{PMID|16933307}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently it was discovered that folate protection from congenital heart defects is linked to epigenetics and Wnt signaling.  Multiple environmental factors target the [[Wnt signaling pathway]] during embryogenesis and can cause misregulation of the pathway.  [[Folic acid]] metabolism generates SAM, thereby altering the methylation states of histones H3K9, H3K4, and H3K27 and genetically altering Wnt signaling.&lt;ref&gt;Linask KK, Huhta J. Folate protection from congenital heart defects linked with canonical wnt signaling and epigenetics. Curr Opin Pediatr. 2010 Oct;22(5):561-6 {{DOI|10.1097/MOP.0b013e32833e2723}} {{PMID|20844350}} .&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently a [[Blind experiment|double-blind]] placebo controlled trial of high dose [[Folinic acid|Folinic Acid]] (Leucovorin Calcium) demonstrated efficacy at improving verbal communication in children with [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frye|first=R.

=== Perinatal ===
Another critical developmental time window is the perinatal period, the time period immediately before and after birth.   It has been shown that maternal diet in late pregnancy and an infant’s diet in the beginning weeks can all have significant impacts on gene expression. Therefore, perinatal nutrition is both late-stage ''in utero'' nutrition and lactation.

==== Bone health ====
Bone mass and the development of [[osteoporosis]] have been studied in relation to perinatal nutrition.  An important factor to consider when investigating perinatal nutrition is whether the baby was [[breastfeeding|breast-fed]] or formula-fed.  Studies have shown that breast-fed babies have increased bone mass compared to those were not breast-fed, and that this small increase in bone mass during a period of critical development could potentially program the skeleton to continue along a “healthy” growth trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;Jones G, Dwyer T. Birth weight, birth length, and bone density in prepubertal children: Evidence for an association that may be mediated by genetic factors. Calcif Tissue Int. 2000 Oct;67(4):304-8 {{PMID|11000344}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been shown that maternal [[vitamin D]] insufficiency during late pregnancy is associated with reduced bone size and mineral mass in late childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Javaid MK, Crozier SR, Harvey NC, Gale CR, Dennison EM, Boucher BJ, Arden NK, Godfrey KM, Cooper C, Princess Anne Hospital Study Group. Maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy and childhood bone mass at age 9 years: A longitudinal study. Lancet. 2006 Jan 7;367(9504):36-43 {{PMID|16399151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peak bone mass has shown to be a good predictor of risk of fracture and osteoporosis, with even a small increase in peak bone mass resulting in a much lower risk of bone fracture.&lt;ref name="hanley"/&gt; Research shows that genetic markers explain only a small proportion of variation in bone mass and risk of fracture.  Therefore, healthy bone programming is most likely influenced by various epigenetic mechanisms, such as imprinting of the growth promoting genes IGF-2, or changes to the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA).&lt;ref&gt;Cooper C, Harvey N, Cole Z, Hanson M, Dennison E. Developmental origins of osteoporosis: The role of maternal nutrition. Adv Exp Med Biol. 2009;646:3h1-9 {{PMID|19536660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neurodevelopment ====
Imbalances in maternal nutrition can also have a significant effect on fetal [[neurodevelopment]].  Brain development occurs most rapidly during fetal development and infancy, and research has shown that exposure to certain environmental conditions can have long-lasting effects on [[cognition]].  Specifically, n-3 [[fatty acids]], [[iodine]], [[iron]] and [[choline]] have been shown to influence brain development and impact cognitive ability and behavior.  The greatest evidence for a link between nutrition and neurodevelopment comes from studies that show low birth weight associated with low IQ and increased risk of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards M, Hardy R, Kuh D, Wadsworth ME. Birth weight and cognitive function in the british 1946 birth cohort: Longitudinal population based study. BMJ. 2001 Jan 27;322(7280):199-203 {{PMID|11159613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunnell D, Harrison G, Whitley E, Lewis G, Tynelius P, Rasmussen F. The association of fetal and childhood growth with risk of schizophrenia. cohort study of 720,000 swedish men and women. Schizophr Res. 2005 Nov 15;79(2-3):315-22 {{PMID|16125903}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies suggest that breast-feeding promotes long-term neurodevelopment by providing the nutrients necessary for proper brain development.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas A. Programming by early nutrition: An experimental approach. J Nutr. 1998 Feb;128(2 Suppl):401S-6S {{PMID|9478036}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study in mice showed that choline-deficient diets during the late gestation period impaired fetal brain development, including decreased cell proliferation and reduced visual-spatial and auditory memory.&lt;ref&gt;Mehedint MG, Niculescu MD, Craciunescu CN, Zeisel SH. Choline deficiency alters global histone methylation and epigenetic marking at the Re1 site of the calbindin 1 gene. FASEB J. 2010 Jan;24(1):184-95 {{PMID|19752176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cognitive changes appeared to be due to altered histone and DNA methylation patterns in the fetal [[hippocampus]], thus providing a link between maternal nutrition, epigenetics, and early brain development.

==== Type-1 diabetes ====
It has been postulated that breast-feeding may also protect against type-1 diabetes, with research showing that formula-fed infants are at an increased risk of developing islet [[autoantibodies]].  Individuals with type-1 diabetes experience a pre-clinical diabetes phase characterized by [[autoimmunity]] against [[pancreatic islets]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisenbarth GS. Type I diabetes mellitus. A chronic autoimmune disease. N Engl J Med. 1986 May 22;314(21):1360-8 {{DOI|10.1056/NEJM198605223142106}} {{PMID|3517648}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of certain foods in the first few months of life, such as berries and cereal, is significantly associated with increased risk of islet autoantibody development compared to babies who are exposed to solid foods later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler AG, Schmid S, Huber D, Hummel M, Bonifacio E. Early infant feeding and risk of developing type 1 diabetes-associated autoantibodies. JAMA. 2003 Oct 1;290(13):1721-8 {{DOI|10.1001/jama.290.13.1721}} {{PMID|14519706}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the pathogenesis behind development of autoantibodies remains largely unknown, it is very probable that an epigenetic link exists between perinatal diet and risk of type-1 diabetes.&lt;ref name="hanley"/&gt;

=== Adulthood ===
The majority of research in nutriepigenomics has focused on nutritional imbalances during gestation and lactation periods.  However, foods that are consumed during adulthood can also impact gene expression and disease pathogenesis.  Cancer is the disease most commonly associated with adult nutrition and epigenetic modifications. DNA hypomethelation promotes cancer progression by allowing increased gene transcription, while hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes and further promote uncontrolled [[cell division]] and [[tumor]] formation.  Compounds found in foods, such as [[genistein]] and [[tea polyphenols]], are able to regulate DNA methyltransferases and histone acetylation in cultured cancer cells and may provide protection against certain types of cancer.&lt;ref name="Campion"/&gt;  Other dietary compounds, such as [[diallyl disulfide]] present in garlic and [[sulforaphane]] present in cruciferous vegetables, have been associated with cancer prevention in clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis CD, Ross SA. Dietary components impact histone modifications and cancer risk. Nutr Rev. 2007 Feb;65(2):88-94 {{PMID|17345961}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be due to their ability to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes and prevent silencing of important regulatory genes.

== Transgenerational effects ==
{{main|Transgenerational epigenetics}}

Many believe epigenetic regulation is cleared during the [[fertilization]] process, yet more evidence for transgenerational effects (TGEs) are being revealed.&lt;ref name="Gallou"/&gt; These TGEs take place when the epigenetic regulatory patterns are not sufficiently erased during fertilization, possibly due to nutrition levels in previous generations. Later generations may be affected from caloric and protein restriction, high-fat interventions and endocrine disruption in earlier generations.&lt;ref name="Gallou"/&gt;  Differences within the nutritional behavior of the maternal rat are believed to cause malprogramming in the F1 generation and may then be passed to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="Gallou"/&gt;   
Maternal rats fed a PR-diet during the entire length of pregnancy led to metabolic-related problems in the F1 and F2 generations, even with normal nutrition during the F1 pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Martin JF, Johnston CR, Han CT, Benyshek DC. Nutritional origins of insulin resistance: a rat model for diabetes-prone human populations. 2000. J Nutr. 130:741-44 {{PMID|10736323}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zambrano E, Martinez-Samayoa PM, Bautista CJ, Deas M, Guillen L, Rodriguez-Gonzalez GL, Guzman C, Larrea F &amp; Nathanielsz PW. Sex differences in transgenerational alterations of growth and metabolism in progeny (F2) of female offspring (F1) of rats fed a low protein diet during pregnancy and lactation. 2005. J Physiol (Lond.) 566:225-36 {{PMID|15860532}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects have also been seen in the F3 generation depending on the length of protein restriction.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison M &amp; Langley-Evans SC. Intergenerational programming of impaired nephrogenesis and hypertension in rats following maternal protein restriction during pregnancy. 2009. Br. J. Nutr. 101: 1020-30 {{PMID|18778527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benyshek"&gt;Benyshek DC, Johnston CS &amp; Martin JF. Glucose metabolism is altered in the adequately-nourished grand-offspring (F3 generation) of rats malnourished during gestation and perinatal life. 2006. Diabetologia. 49: 1117-19 {{PMID|16557373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If protein restriction occurred solely during pregnancy, the F1 and F2 offspring had higher systolic blood pressure and lower nephron numbers, possibly predisposing them to hypertension.&lt;ref name="Benyshek"/&gt; Altered glucose utilization was detected in the grand-offspring of maternal rats fed a PR-diet during pregnancy and lactation, potentially resulting in diabetes later on in life &lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;

[[Image:Transgenerational ProteinRestrictdiet.jpg|thumb|alt=Protein-restricted (PR) diets fed to maternal mice leads to transgenerational effects in the offspring, up to the F3 generation depending on the length of protein restriction. All offspring are adequately fed, i.e. are not on a PR-diet. Grey mice represent wild-type phenotypes and pink mice represent offspring with either a genetic predisposition to hypertension (maternal rat fed PR-diet during pregnancy) or diabetes (maternal rat fed PR-diet during pregnancy and lactation). Mechanisms behind PR-diets are only proposed, as further research is needed to confirm their exact pathways|Transgenerational effects of maternal protein restriction]]

Protein-restriction in the F0 generation led to hypomethylation of promoters involved in metabolism in the F1 and F2 generations, even though the F1 pregnant rat was given a normal diet.&lt;ref&gt;Burdge GC, Slater-Jefferies J, Torrens C, Phillips ES, Hanson MA &amp; Lillycrop KA. Dietary protein restriction of pregnant rats in the F0 generation induces altered methylation of hepatic gene promoters in the adult male offspring in the F1 and F2 generations. 2007. Br J Nutr 97(3): 435-9 {{DOI|10.1017/S0007114507352392}} {{PMID|17313703}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact mechanism of this situation has yet to be elucidated; however, direct transmission is a distinct possibility, meaning the epigenetic marks were preserved during [[spermatogenesis]] and [[oogenesis]], when they are normally erased.

== Models used in nutriepigenomic studies ==
Most research to date use common rodent models to investigate the role of nutrition on [[phenotype]].&lt;ref name="Simmons"/&gt; Popular areas to investigate include IUGR studies, whereby rodents, and sometimes sheep, are subjected to a variety of nutritional conditions.  A model for studying IUGR in rodent was developed by Simmons ''et al.'' (2010) and is used to investigate type II diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;Boloker J, Gertz SJ &amp; Simmons RA. Gestational diabetes leads to the development of diabetes in adulthood in the rat. 2002. Diabetes. 51(5): 1499-1506 {{PMID|11978648}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The maternal rats have their uterine arteries ligated, causing altered use of glucose and insulin in the fetus and can therefore serve as a model for diabetes. These growth-retarded rats were found to be highly similar to human fetuses, as they both display symptoms such as lowered glucose and insulin levels.  [[Gestational diabetes]] may also be studied through chemical induction using [[streptozotocin]] treatment of the pregnant rats.&lt;ref name="Fernandez"&gt;Fernandez-Twinn DS &amp; Ozanne SE. Early life nutrition and metabolic programming. Ann N Y Acad Sci. Epub ahead of print 2010 Nov 11 {{PMID|21070247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streptozotocin can cause destruction of the beta cells within the pancreas depending on the concentration given.

The predominant means of investigating nutriepigenetics involves varying the nutritional conditions to which a subject is exposed to and monitoring the effects thereafter.  Restricting caloric and protein intake are the two most common methods.&lt;ref name="Fernandez"/&gt; A pregnant rodent may have their caloric intake reduced up to 30-50% of normal intake.  Protein restricted rodents are given 8-9% [[casein]], as opposed to control rats that are fed 20% casein. Micronutrients, such as zinc and iron, may also be restricted to investigate the effects on offspring. Additionally, rats fed diets lacking or including methyl donors are often used to study the effects of diet on epigenomics, as variations within the methylation of DNA are common means of silencing or expressing genes.&lt;ref&gt;Niculescu, MD &amp; Zeisel, SH. Diet, methyl donors and DNA methylation: interactions between dietary folate, methionine and choline. 2002. J Nutr. 132, 23335-23355 {{PMID|12163687}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supplementing maternal mice with folic acid, [[vitamin B12]], choline and [[betaine]] leads to increased levels of DNA methylation at CpG sites and causes a coat color change.&lt;ref&gt;Waterland, R. A. &amp; Jirtle, R. L. Transposable elements: targets for early nutritional effects on epigenetic gene regulation. 2003. Mol. Cell. Biol. 23, 5293–5300 {{DOI|10.1128/MCB.23.15.5293-5300.2003}} {{PMID|12861015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an example of epigenetically modifiable loci called a “metastable epiallele”, of which only a few have been identified.  The above is an example of the “agouti” gene locus, whereby the insertion of a [[transposable element]] upstream to the Agouti gene is hypermethylated from the supplementation and causes a change in the mice's coat color. Diets containing higher carbohydrate and fat content attempt to mimic typical Western-style diets may also be used in nutriepigenetic studies.&lt;ref name="Simmons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernandez"/&gt;  Another method used is “catch-up”, where offspring of rats born to mothers subjected to various diets are subsequently cross-fostered to mothers fed normal diets.&lt;ref name="Fernandez"/&gt;

== Future directions ==
The possibilities of utilizing nutriepigenomics for intervention are quite expansive.  This can include preventative therapies, such as providing an optimal regime for nutrition during pregnancy and lactation.&lt;ref name="Fernandez"/&gt;  It is already common place for pregnant mothers to supplement their diets with choline and folate to prevent the development of neurological disabilities in the fetus.

[[Image:FAS Choline.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The nutriepigenetic pathway of maternal choline-deficient diets helps to elucidate the development of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pregnant rodents fed diets low in choline were found to give rise to offspring with diminished neurological capacity. This is similar to pregnant rodents whom were fed ethanol and were found to have alterations in the metabolism of 1-carbon compounds. This leads to diminished levels of methyl donors available for methylating DNA; thus allowing for overexpression of normally silenced genes causing neurological defects in their offspring.|The nutriepigenetic pathway of maternal choline-deficient diets helps to elucidate the development of fetal alcohol syndrome]]

A highly specific diet, termed an "EpiG diet," may be employed for an individual believed to be at higher risk of developing a metabolic disorder.&lt;ref name="Gallou"/&gt; These diets may include supplementation with methyl donors, such as folate. There are also many other natural compounds, such as [[resveratrol]], [[curcumin]] and green tea that have been termed “epigenetic modifiers”, as they have anti-cancer capabilities in addition to being used as treatments for metabolic diseases.&lt;ref name="Sziv"&gt;Sziv KS, Ndlovu MN, Haegeman G &amp; Vanden Berghe W . Nature or nurture: let food be your epigenetic medicine in chronic inflammatory disorders. 2010. Biochem. Pharmacol. 80(12):1816-32 {{DOI|10.1016/j.bcp.2010.07.029}} {{PMID|20688047}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the functions of these compounds still require long-term studies to evaluate their effect over time.

There also exists potential for therapeutic treatments that may correct metabolic disorders, such as type II diabetes.&lt;ref name="Fernandez"/&gt;  Components of garlic and [[cruciferous vegetables]] are known to possess [[HDAC inhibitors]] that modify the acetylation of histone proteins and may contain a protection against cancer.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;  These same compounds have also been implicated in [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) and [[colon cancer]], as they may modify the histones normally implicated in these diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett M, Bermingham E, McNabb W, Bassett S, Armstrong K, Rounce J &amp; Roy N. Investigating micronutrients and epigenetic mechanisms in relation to inflammatory bowel disease. 2010. Mutat Res. 690(1): 71-80 {{DOI|10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2010.02.006}} {{PMID|20188748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elucidation of disease pathways is another future direction for nutriepigenomic studies.  For example, choline-deficient diets and alcohol metabolism during pregnancy may have very similar metabolic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Zeisel S. What Choline Metabolism Can Tell Us About the Underlying Mechanisms of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. 2011 Mol Neurobiol 2011 Jan 25 epub {{DOI|10.1007/s12035-011-8165-5}} {{PMID|21259123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, animal studies using choline-restricted diets may assist in investigations of [[fetal alcohol spectrum disorders]].

When compared to studies of maternal transmission, investigations into the role of paternal diets are lacking.  A review demonstrated the nutrition of both parents do in fact play a role in determining the health of their offspring.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;Ferguson-Smith, AC &amp; Patti, ME. You are what your dad ate. Cell Metab. 2011. 13(2):115-7 {{DOI|10.1016/j.cmet.2011.01.011}} {{PMID|21284975}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[germ-line]] study reported paternal rats fed a high-fat diet led to insulin dysfunction in the F1 offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, S.F., Lin, R.C., Laybutt, D.R., Barres, R., Owens, J.A., and Morris, M.J. Chronic high-fat diet in fathers programs β-cell dysfunction in female rat offspring. 2010. Nature 467, 963–966 {{DOI|10.1038/nature09491}} {{PMID|20962845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While this likely occurs via epigenetic modifications similar to those postulated in the maternal diets, the exact mechanism remains to be defined.  Assessing the role of epigenetic mechanisms may be easier using paternal inheritance, as sperm transmits epigenetic and genetic information, whereas the female cells also transmit [[mitochondrial DNA]].&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Edema|Swelling]] (especially in the hands and face) was originally considered an important sign for a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. However, because swelling is a common occurrence in pregnancy, its utility as a distinguishing factor in pre-eclampsia is not high. [[Pitting edema]] (unusual swelling, particularly of the hands, feet, or face, notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on) can be significant, and should be reported to a health care provider.

In general, none of the signs of pre-eclampsia are specific, and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice. Further, a symptom such as epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn. Diagnosis, therefore, depends on finding a coincidence of several pre-eclamptic features, the final proof being their regression after delivery.

==Causes==
There is no definitive known cause of pre-eclampsia, though it is likely related to a number of factors. Some of these factors include:&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; 
* Abnormal [[placentation]] (formation and development of the placenta) 
* Immunologic factors
* Prior or existing maternal pathology—pre-eclampsia is seen more at a higher incidence in individuals with pre-existing [[hypertension]], obesity, [[antiphospholipid antibody syndrome]], and those with history of pre-eclampsia
* Dietary factors, e.g. calcium supplementation in areas where dietary calcium intake is low has been shown to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; 
* Environmental factors, e.g. air pollution&lt;ref name=EHP&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jun Wu |author2=Cizao Ren |author3=Ralph J. Delfino |author4=Judith Chung |author5=Michelle Wilhelm |author6=Beate Ritz |title=Association Between Local Traffic-Generated Air Pollution and Pre-eclampsia and Preterm Delivery in the South Coast Air Basin of California |publisher=Environmental Health Perspectives |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/0800334/0800334.pdf |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719065531/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/0800334/0800334.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those with long term [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] have a risk 7 to 8 times higher than those without.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bramham|first=K|author2=Parnell, B |author3=Nelson-Piercy, C |author4=Seed, PT |author5=Poston, L |author6= Chappell, LC |title=Chronic hypertension and pregnancy outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Apr 15, 2014|volume=348|page=g2301|pmid=24735917 |pmc=3988319 |doi=10.1136/bmj.g2301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physiologically, research has linked pre-eclampsia to the following physiologic changes: alterations in the interaction between the maternal immune response and the placenta, placental injury, [[endothelial]] cell injury, altered vascular reactivity, oxidative stress, imbalance among [[vasoactive]] substances, decreased intravascular volume, and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mustafa|first=Reem|author2=Ahmed, Sana |author3=Gupta, Anu |author4= Venuto, Rocco C. |title=A Comprehensive Review of Hypertension in Pregnancy|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|year=2012|volume=2012|pages=1–19|doi=10.1155/2012/105918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exact cause of pre-eclampsia remains unclear, there is strong evidence that a major cause predisposing a susceptible woman to pre-eclampsia is an abnormally implanted placenta.&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; This abnormally implanted placenta may result in poor uterine and placental perfusion, yielding a state of hypoxia and increased oxidative stress and the release of anti-angiogenic proteins along with inflammatory mediators into the maternal plasma.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; A major consequence of this sequence of events is generalized [[endothelial]] dysfunction.&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt; The abnormal implantation may stem from the maternal [[immune system]]'s response to the placenta, specifically a lack of established [[immunological tolerance in pregnancy]]. Endothelial dysfunction results in hypertension and many of the other symptoms and complications associated with pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt; Those with pre-eclampsia may have a lower risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Innes, KE|author2=Byers, TE|year=1999|title=Preeclampsia and breast cancer risk|journal=Epidemiology|pages=722–32|jstor=3703514|pmid=10535787|volume=10|doi=10.1097/00001648-199911000-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Placental abnormalities such as placental ischemia.

==Pathogenesis==
Although much research into mechanism of pre-eclampsia has taken place, its exact pathogenesis remains uncertain. Pre-eclampsia is thought to result from an abnormal placenta, the removal of which ends the disease in most cases.&lt;ref name=Al2014 /&gt; During normal pregnancy, the placenta vascularizes to allow for the exchange of water, gases, and solutes, including nutrients and wastes, between maternal and fetal circulations.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; Abnormal development of the placenta leads to poor placental perfusion. The placenta of women with pre-eclampsia is abnormal and characterized by poor trophoblastic invasion.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; It is thought that this results in oxidative stress, hypoxia, and the release of factors that promote endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and other possible reactions.&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DrifeMagowan&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Drife | first1 = James O. | last2 = Magowan | first2 = Brian. | title = Clinical obstetrics and gynecology | year = 2004 | publisher = Saunders | location = Edinburgh, New York | isbn = 0-7020-1775-2 | pages = 367–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia are associated with general endothelial dysfunction, including vasoconstriction and end-organ ischemia.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; Implicit in this generalized endothelial dysfunction may be an imbalance of [[angiogenic]] and [[anti-angiogenic]] factors.&lt;ref name=Al2014 /&gt; Both circulating and placental levels of [[soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]] (sFlt-1) are higher in women with pre-eclampsia than in women with normal pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; sFlt-1 is an anti-angiogenic protein that antagonizes [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[placental growth factor]] (PIGF), both of which are proangiogenic factors.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Soluble [[endoglin]] (sEng) has also been shown to be elevated in women with pre-eclampsia and has anti-angiogenic properties, much like sFlt-1 does.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt;

Both sFlt-1 and sEng are upregulated in all pregnant women to some extent, supporting the idea that hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and placentation involves a degree of [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|maternal immune tolerance]] for a foreign placenta, it is not surprising that the maternal immune system might respond more negatively to the arrival of some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled [[spiral arteries]] in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to upregulated sFlt-1 and sEng.

Oxidative stress may also play an important part in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the enzyme [[xanthine oxidase]] (XO) and this enzyme mainly occurs in the liver. One hypothesis is that the increased purine catabolism from placental hypoxia results in increased ROS production in the maternal liver and release into the maternal circulation that causes endothelial cell damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McMaster-Fay RA | title = Pre-eclampsia: a disease of oxidative stress resulting from the catabolism of DNA (primarily fetal) to uric acid by xanthine oxidase in the maternal liver; a hypothesis. | journal = Bioscience Hypotheses | year = 2008 | volume = 1 | pages = 35–43 | doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abnormalities in the maternal [[immune system]] and insufficiency of [[gestational immune tolerance]] seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward [[T helper cell|Th&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; responses]] and the production of [[Interferon gamma|IFN-γ]]. The origin of IFN-γ is not clearly identified and could be the [[natural killer cell]]s of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of [[T helper cells]], alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of [[regulatory T cell]]s in pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Laresgoiti-Servitje"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laresgoiti-Servitje E, Gómez-López N, Olson DM | title = An immunological insight into the origins of pre-eclampsia | journal = Hum Reprod Update | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 510–24 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20388637 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq007 | url = http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/5/510?etoc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers.&lt;ref name="Laresgoiti-Servitje" /&gt; It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal [[Nucleated red blood cell|erythroblasts]] as well as [[cell-free fetal DNA]] are increased in the maternal circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia. These findings have given rise to the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is a disease process by which a placental lesion such as hypoxia allows increased fetal material into the maternal circulation, that in turn leads to an [[immune response]] and endothelial damage, and that ultimately results in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.

One hypothesis for vulnerability to pre-eclampsia is the maternal-fetal conflict between the maternal organism and fetus.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Redman CW, Sargent IL | title = Latest Advances in Understanding Preeclampsia | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5728 | pages = 1592–94 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15947178 | pmc = | doi = 10.1126/science.1111726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first trimester trophoblasts enter the spiral arteries of the mother to alter the spiral arteries and thereby gain more access to maternal nutrients.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt; Occasionally there is impaired trophoblast invasion that results in inadequate alterations to the uterine spiral arteries.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt; It is hypothesized that the developing embryo releases biochemical signals that result in the woman developing hypertension and pre-eclampsia so that the fetus can benefit from a greater amount of maternal circulation of nutrients due to increased blood flow to the impaired placenta.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt; This results in a conflict between maternal and fetal fitness and survival because the fetus is invested in only its survival and fitness while the mother is invested in this and subsequent pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt;

Another evolutionary hypothesis for vulnerability to pre-eclampsia is the idea of ensuring pair-bonding between the mother and father and paternal investment in the fetus.&lt;ref name="Davis2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = J.

In normal early embryonic development, the outer epithelial layer contains cytotrophoblast cells, a stem cell type found in the trophoblast that later differentiates into the fetal placenta. These cells differentiate into many placental cells types, including extravillous trophoblast cells. Extravillous trophoblast cells are an invasive cell type which remodel the maternal spiral arteries by replacing the maternal epithelium and smooth muscle lining the spiral arteries causing artery dilation. This prevents maternal vasoconstriction in the spiral arteries and allows for continued blood and nutrient supply to the growing fetus with low resistance and high blood flow.&lt;ref name="Chen D., Wang W. 2013 1–11"/&gt;

In pre-eclampsia, abnormal expression of chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC) in placental cell lines reduces extravillus trophoblast migration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xie L. |author2=Mouillet J.-F. |author3=Cu T. |author4=Parks W.

Testing for pre-eclampsia is recommended throughout [[pregnancy]] via measuring a woman's blood pressure.&lt;ref name=USPSTF2017/&gt;

===Diagnostic criteria===
Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed when a pregnant woman develops:&lt;ref name="Harrison's"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Longo | first1 = Dan L. (Dan Louis) | title = Harrison's principles of internal medicine | year = 2012 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6 | pages = 55–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blood pressure ≥140 mmHg systolic or ≥90 mmHg diastolic on two separate readings taken at least four to six hours apart after 20 weeks' gestation in an individual with previously normal blood pressure.
* In a woman with essential hypertension beginning before 20 weeks' gestational age, the diagnostic criteria are: an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥30 mmHg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥15 mmHg.
* [[Proteinuria]] ≥ {{convert|0.3|g|mg}} or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample or a SPOT urinary protein to creatinine ratio ≥0.3 or a urine dipstick reading of 1+ or greater (dipstick reading should only be used if other quantitative methods are not available).&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt;

Suspicion for pre-eclampsia should be maintained in any pregnancy complicated by elevated blood pressure, even in the absence of proteinuria. Ten percent of individuals with other signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia and 20% of individuals diagnosed with eclampsia show no evidence of proteinuria.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; In the absence of proteinuria, the presence of new-onset [[hypertension]] (elevated blood pressure) and the new onset of one or more of the following is suggestive of the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia:&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; 
* Evidence of kidney dysfunction ([[oliguria]], elevated [[creatinine]] levels)
* Impaired liver function (noted by [[liver function tests]])
* [[Thrombocytopenia]] (platelet count &lt;100,000/microliter)
* [[Pulmonary edema]]
*[[Peripheral edema|Ankle edema]] (pitting type)
* Cerebral or visual disturbances

Pre-eclampsia is a progressive disorder and these signs of organ dysfunction are indicative of severe pre-eclampsia. A systolic blood pressure ≥160 or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 and/or proteinuria &gt;5g in a 24-hour period is also indicative of severe pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; Clinically, individuals with severe pre-eclampsia may also present [[Epigastrium|epigastric]]/right upper quadrant abdominal pain, headaches, and vomiting.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; Severe pre-eclampsia is a significant risk factor for intrauterine fetal death.

A rise in baseline blood pressure (BP) of 30 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]] systolic or 15 mmHg diastolic, while not meeting the absolute criteria of 140/90, is important to note but is not considered diagnostic.

===Predictive tests===
There have been many assessments of tests aimed at predicting pre-eclampsia, though no single biomarker is likely to be sufficiently predictive of the disorder.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Predictive tests that have been assessed include those related to placental perfusion, vascular resistance, kidney dysfunction, [[endothelial]] dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Examples of notable tests include:
* Doppler [[ultrasonography]] of the uterine arteries to investigate for signs of inadequate placental perfusion. This test has a high negative predictive value among those individuals with a history of prior pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt;
* Elevations in serum uric acid ([[hyperuricemia]]) is used by some to "define" pre-eclampsia,&lt;ref name="al. 2010"/&gt; though it has been found to be a poor predictor of the disorder.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; Elevated levels in the blood ([[hyperuricemia]]) are likely due to reduced uric acid clearance secondary to impaired kidney function.
* [[Angiogenic]] proteins such as [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[placental growth factor]] (PIGF) and anti-angiogenic proteins such as [[soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]] (sFlt-1) have shown promise for potential clinical use in diagnosing pre-eclampsia, though evidence is sufficient to recommend a clinical use for these markers.&lt;ref name="al. 2010"/&gt;
* Recent studies have shown that looking for [[podocyte]]s (specialized cells of the kidney) in the urine has the potential to aid in the prediction of pre-eclampsia. Studies have demonstrated that finding podocytes in the urine may serve as an early marker of and diagnostic test for pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craici|first=IM |author2=Wagner, SJ |author3=Bailey, KR |author4=Fitz-Gibbon, PD |author5=Wood-Wentz, CM |author6=Turner, ST |author7=Hayman, SR |author8=White, WM |author9=Brost, BC |author10=Rose, CH |author11=Grande, JP |author12=Garovic, VD|title=Podocyturia predates proteinuria and clinical features of preeclampsia: longitudinal prospective study.|journal=Hypertension|date=Jun 2013|volume=61|issue=6|pages=1289–96|pmid=23529165|doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.01115|pmc=3713793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News - Pre-eclampsia predicted using test during pregnancy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15694021|title=BBC News – Pre-eclampsia predicted using test during pregnancy|work=|accessdate=2011-11-22|date=2011-11-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118120704/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15694021|archivedate=2011-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mechanisms and Management of Hypertension in Pregnant Women."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:21656283 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416082731/http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:21656283 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-16 |title=Mechanisms and Management of Hypertension in Pregnant Women. |work= |accessdate=2011-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential diagnosis==

Pre-eclampsia can mimic and be confused with many other diseases, including chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, primary seizure disorders, gallbladder and [[pancreatic disease]], immune or [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[antiphospholipid syndrome]] and [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]. It must be considered a possibility in any pregnant woman beyond 20 weeks of gestation. It is particularly difficult to diagnose when pre-existing conditions such as [[hypertension]] are present.&lt;ref name=AMN1&gt;{{cite web | title =Pre-eclampsia-Eclampsia | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work =Diagnosis and management of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia | url=http://www.health.am/gyneco/more/pre-eclampsia_eclampsia/ | year = 2003 | accessdate=2005-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with [[acute fatty liver of pregnancy]] may also present with elevated blood pressure and protein in the urine, but differ by the extent of liver damage. Other disorders that can cause high blood pressure include [[Hyperthyroidism|thyrotoxicosis]], [[pheochromocytoma]], and [[Substance abuse|drug misuse]].&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;

==Prevention==
Preventive measures against pre-eclampsia have been heavily studied. Because the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia is not completely understood, prevention remains a complex issue. Below are some of the currently accepted recommendations.

===Diet===
Supplementation with a balanced protein and energy diet does not appear to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ota|first1=E|last2=Hori|first2=H|last3=Mori|first3=R|last4=Tobe-Gai|first4=R|last5=Farrar|first5=D|title=Antenatal dietary education and supplementation to increase energy and protein intake.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2 June 2015|issue=6|pages=CD000032|pmid=26031211|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000032.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there is no evidence that changing [[salt]] intake has an effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duley L, Henderson-Smart D, Meher S | title = Altered dietary salt for preventing pre-eclampsia, and its complications. | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | page = CD005548 | date =October 19, 2005 | pmid = 16235411 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplementation with [[antioxidant]]s such as vitamin C, D and E has no effect on pre-eclampsia incidence;&lt;ref name="NEJM2006-Rumbold"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rumbold AR, Crowther CA, Haslam RR, Dekker GA, Robinson JS | title = Vitamins C and E and the risks of pre-eclampsia and perinatal complications | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = 17 | pages = 1796–806 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16641396 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa054186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|title=WHO recommendations for prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.|date=2011|isbn=978-92-4-154833-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, supplementation with vitamins C, E, and D is not recommended for reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Calcium]] supplementation of at least 1 gram per day is recommended during pregnancy as it prevents pre-eclampsia where dietary calcium intake is low, especially for those at high risk.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmeyr|first1=GJ|last2=Lawrie|first2=TA|last3=Atallah|first3=AN|last4=Duley|first4=L|last5=Torloni|first5=MR|title=Calcium supplementation during pregnancy for preventing hypertensive disorders and related problems.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jun 24, 2014|volume=6|pages=CD001059|pmid=24960615|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001059.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low [[selenium]] status is associated with higher incidence of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name="pmid14634566"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rayman MP, Bode P, Redman CW | title = Low selenium status is associated with the occurrence of the pregnancy disease pre-eclampsia in women from the United Kingdom | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 189 | issue = 5 | pages = 1343–49 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14634566 | doi = 10.1067/S0002-9378(03)00723-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aspirin===
Taking [[aspirin]] is associated with a 1 to 5% reduction in pre-eclampsia and a 1 to 5% reduction in premature births in women at high risk.&lt;ref name=Hend2014/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17443552"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duley L, Henderson-Smart DJ, Meher S, King JF | title = Antiplatelet agents for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = CD004659 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17443552 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004659.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends low-dose aspirin for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in women at high risk and recommends it be started before 20 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] recommends a low-dose regimen for women at high risk beginning in the 12th week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsaspg.htm |title=Low-Dose Aspirin Use for the Prevention of Morbidity and Mortality From Preeclampsia |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=Sep 2014 |website= |publisher=United States Preventive Services Task Force |accessdate=17 Sep 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917203610/http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsaspg.htm |archivedate=2014-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits are less if started after 16 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberge|first1=S|last2=Nicolaides|first2=K|last3=Demers|first3=S|last4=Hyett|first4=J|last5=Chaillet|first5=N|last6=Bujold|first6=E|title=The role of aspirin dose on the prevention of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=February 2017|volume=216|issue=2|pages=110–120.e6|pmid=27640943|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2016.09.076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical activity===
There is insufficient evidence to recommend either exercise&lt;ref name="Cochrane2006-Meher-exercise"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meher S, Duley L | title = Exercise or other physical activity for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = CD005942 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16625645 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005942 | editor1-last = Meher | editor1-first = Shireen }}&lt;/ref&gt; or strict bedrest&lt;ref name="Cochrane2006-Meher-rest"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meher S, Duley L | title = Rest during pregnancy for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications in women with normal blood pressure | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = CD005939 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16625644 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005939 | editor1-last = Meher | editor1-first = Shireen }}&lt;/ref&gt; as preventive measures of pre-eclampsia.

===Smoking cessation===
In low-risk pregnancies, the association between cigarette [[smoking]] and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia has been consistent and reproducible across epidemiologic studies. High-risk pregnancies (those with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or multifetal gestation) showed no significant protective effect. The reason for this discrepancy is not definitively known; research supports speculation that the underlying pathology increases the risk of pre-eclampsia to such a degree that any measurable reduction of risk due to smoking is masked.&lt;ref name="pmid18566591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeyabalan A, Powers RW, Durica AR, Harger GF, Roberts JM, Ness RB | title = Cigarette Smoke Exposure and Angiogenic Factors in Pregnancy and Preeclampsia | journal = Am. J. Hypertens. | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 943–47 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18566591 | pmc = 2613772 | doi = 10.1038/ajh.2008.219 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the damaging effects of smoking on overall health and pregnancy outcomes outweighs the benefits in decreasing the incidence of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; It is recommended that smoking be stopped prior to, during and after pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitworth|first=M|author2=Dowswell, T|title=Routine pre-pregnancy health promotion for improving pregnancy outcomes.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Oct 7, 2009|issue=4|page=CD007536|pmid=19821424|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007536.pub2|pmc=4164828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
The definitive treatment for pre-eclampsia is the delivery of the baby and placenta. The timing of delivery should balance the desire for optimal outcomes for the baby while reducing risks for the mother.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; The severity of disease and the maturity of the baby are primary considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles R.B. Beckmann ... [et al.]; American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|title=Obstetrics and gynecology.|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=0781788072|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; These considerations are situation-specific and management will vary with situation, location, and institution. Treatment can range from expectant management to expedited delivery by [[Labor induction|induction of labor]] or [[Caesarean section]], in addition to medications. Important in management is the assessment of the mothers organ systems, management of severe hypertension, and prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Separate interventions directed at the baby may also be necessary. Bed rest has not been found to be useful and is thus not routinely recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCall|first1=CA|last2=Grimes|first2=DA|last3=Lyerly|first3=AD|title="Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=June 2013|volume=121|issue=6|pages=1305–8|pmid=23812466|doi=10.1097/aog.0b013e318293f12f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood pressure===
The World Health Organization recommends that women with severe [[hypertension]] during pregnancy should receive treatment with anti-hypertensive agents.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Severe hypertension is generally considered systolic BP of at least 160 or diastolic BP of at least 110.&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt; Evidence does not support the use of one anti-hypertensive over another.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; The choice of which agent to use should be based on the prescribing clinician's experience with a particular agent, its cost, and its availability.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Diuretics are not recommended for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; [[Labetalol]], [[Hydralazine]] and [[Nifedipine]] are commonly used antihypertensive agents for [[Hypertensive disease of pregnancy|hypertension in pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[Angiotensin II receptor blocker|angiotensin receptor blockers]] are contraindicated as they affect fetal development.&lt;ref name="Harrison's" /&gt;

The goal of treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is to prevent cardiovascular, kidney, and cerebrovascular complications.&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt; The target blood pressure has been proposed to be 140–160 mmHg systolic and 90–105 mmHg diastolic, although values are variable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvog-documenten.nl/uploaded/docs/Hypertensieve%20aandoeningen/Hypertensive_disorders_in_pregnancy%5B1%5D.pdf Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy.

===Prevention of eclampsia===
The intrapartum and postpartum administration of magnesium sulfate is recommended in severe pre-eclampsia for the prevention of [[eclampsia]].&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Further, magnesium sulfate is recommended for the treatment of eclampsia over other anticonvulsants.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Magnesium sulfate acts by interacting with [[NMDA receptor]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison's" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Pre-eclampsia affects approximately 2–8% of all pregnancies worldwide,&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (WHO). World health report 2005: make every mother and child count. Geneva: WHO; 2005, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of pre-eclampsia has risen in the U.S. since the 1990s, possibly as a result of increased prevalence of predisposing disorders, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;

Pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide.&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt; Nearly one-tenth of all maternal deaths in Africa and Asia and one-quarter in Latin America are associated with hypertensive diseases in pregnancy, a category that encompasses pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt;

[[Eclampsia]] is a major complication of pre-eclampsia. Eclampsia affects 0.56 per 1,000 pregnant women in developed countries and almost 10 to 30 times as many women in low-income countries as in developed countries.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;

==Complications==
Complications of pre-eclampsia can affect both the mother and the fetus. Acutely, pre-eclampsia can be complicated by [[eclampsia]], the development of [[HELLP syndrome]], hemorrhagic or ischemic [[stroke]], liver damage and dysfunction, [[acute kidney injury]], and [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS).&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt;

Pre-eclampsia is also associated with increased frequency of [[Caesarean section]], [[Preterm birth|preterm delivery]], and [[placental abruption]]. Furthermore, an elevation in blood pressure can occur in some individuals in the first week postpartum attributable to volume expansion and fluid mobilization.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; Fetal complications include fetal growth restriction and potential fetal or perinatal death.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt;

Long-term, an individual with pre-eclampsia is at increased risk for recurrence of pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.

===Eclampsia===
[[Eclampsia]] is the development of new [[convulsion]]s in a pre-eclamptic patient that may not be attributed to other cause. It is a sign that the underlying pre-eclamptic condition is severe and is associated with high rates of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Warning symptoms for eclampsia in an individual with current pre-eclampsia may include headaches, visual disturbances, and right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain, with a headache being the most consistent symptom.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= F. Gary Cunningham, et al. (editors) |title=Williams Obstetrics|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0071497015|edition=23rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magnesium sulfate]] is used to prevent convulsions in cases of severe pre-eclampsia.

===HELLP Syndrome===
[[HELLP syndrome]] is defined as [[hemolysis]] (microangiopathic), elevated liver enzymes (liver dysfunction), and low platelets ([[thrombocytopenia]]). This condition may occur in 10–20% of patients with severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; and is associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In 50% of instances, HELLP syndrome develops preterm, while 20% of cases develop in late gestation and 30% during the post-partum period.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;

===Long term===
There is also an increased risk for cardiovascular complications, including hypertension and ischemic heart disease, and kidney disease.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; Other risks include [[stroke]] and [[Venous thrombosis|venous thromboembolism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellamy L, Casas JP, Hingorani AD, Williams DJ |title=Pre-eclampsia and risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in later life: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7627 |page=974 |year=2007 |pmid=17975258 |pmc=2072042 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39335.385301.BE |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McDonald SD, Malinowski A, Zhou Q, Yusuf S, Devereaux PJ |title=Cardiovascular sequelae of preeclampsia/eclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analyses |journal=Am.

Lowered blood supply to the fetus in pre-eclampsia causes lowered nutrient supply, which could result in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight.&lt;ref name="Chen D., Wang W. 2013 1–11"/&gt; The fetal origins hypothesis states that fetal undernutrition is linked with coronary heart disease later in adult life due to disproportionate growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barker D.

Because pre-eclampsia leads to a mismatch between the maternal energy supply and fetal energy demands, pre-eclampsia can lead to IUGR in the developing fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sharma D. |author2=Shastri S. |author3=Sharma P. | year = 2016 | title = Intrauterine Growth Restriction: Antenatal and Postnatal Aspects | url = | journal = Clinical Medicine Insights: Pediatrics | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 67–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants suffering from IUGR are prone to suffer from poor neuronal development and in increased risk for adult disease according to the Barker hypothesis. Associated adult diseases of the fetus due to IUGR include, but are not limited to, coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cancer, osteoporosis, and various psychiatric illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Calkins K., Devaskar S. U. | year = 2011 | title = Fetal origins of adult disease | url = | journal = Current Problems in Pediatric &amp; Adolescent Health Care | volume = 41 | issue = 6| pages = 158–76 | doi=10.1016/j.cppeds.2011.01.001| pmc = 4608552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of pre-eclampsia and development of placental dysfunction has also been shown to be recurrent cross-generationally on the maternal side and most likely on the paternal side. Fetuses born to mothers that were born small for gestational age (SGA) were 50% more likely to develop pre-eclampsia while fetuses born to both SGA parents were three-fold more likely to develop pre-eclampsia in future pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wikström A.

==History==
The word eclampsia is from the Greek term for [[lightning]].&lt;ref name=Em2006/&gt; The first known description of the condition was by [[Hippocrates]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name=Em2006/&gt;

An outdated medical term for pre-eclampsia is [[wikt:toxemia|toxemia]] of pregnancy, a term that originated in the mistaken belief that the condition was caused by [[toxins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601156/toxemia-of-pregnancy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328201744/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601156/toxemia-of-pregnancy |archivedate=2014-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
{{anchor|paternal tolerance}} 
Some studies have suggested the importance of a woman's [[Immune tolerance|immunological tolerance]] to her baby's father, as the baby and father share genetics. There is tentative evidence that ongoing exposure either by vaginal or oral sex to the same semen that resulted in the pregnancy decreases the risk of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=SeminalPriming&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson SA, Bromfield JJ, Tremellen KP | title = Seminal 'priming' for protection from pre-eclampsia-a unifying hypothesis | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 253–65 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12896827 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As one early study described, "although pre-eclampsia is a disease of first pregnancies, the protective effect of multiparity is lost with change of partner".&lt;ref name=Dekk9618714&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dekker GA, Robillard PY, Hulsey TC | title = Immune maladaptation in the etiology of pre-eclampsia: a review of corroborative epidemiologic studies | journal = Obstetrical &amp; Gynecological Survey | volume = 53 | issue = 6 | pages = 377–82 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9618714 | doi = 10.1097/00006254-199806000-00023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also concluded that although women with changing partners are strongly advised to use condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, "a certain period of sperm exposure within a stable relation, when pregnancy is aimed for, is associated with protection against pre-eclampsia".&lt;ref name="Dekk9618714"/&gt;

Several other studies have since investigated the decreased incidence of pre-eclampsia in women who had received blood transfusions from their partner, those with long preceding histories of sex without barrier contraceptives, and in women who had been regularly performing [[oral sex]].&lt;ref name=Elizabeth_Bonney&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bonney EA | title = Preeclampsia: A view through the danger model | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 76 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 68–74 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17482268 | pmc = 2246056 | doi = 10.1016/j.jri.2007.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having already noted the importance of a woman's immunological tolerance to her baby's paternal genes, several Dutch reproductive biologists decided to take their research a step further. Consistent with the fact that human immune systems tolerate things better when they enter the body via the mouth, the Dutch researchers conducted a series of studies that confirmed a surprisingly strong correlation between a diminished incidence of pre-eclampsia and a woman's practice of oral sex, and noted that the protective effects were strongest if she swallowed her partner's semen.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth_Bonney"/&gt;&lt;ref name = mattar_sexual_behavior&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattar R, Soares RV, Daher S | title = Sexual behavior and recurrent spontaneous abortion | journal = International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 154–55 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15694097 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2004.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A team from the [[University of Adelaide]] has also investigated to see if men who have fathered pregnancies which have ended in [[miscarriage]] or pre-eclampsia had low seminal levels of critical immune modulating factors such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-beta]]. The team has found that certain men, dubbed "dangerous males", are several times more likely to father pregnancies that would end in either pre-eclampsia or [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="SeminalPriming"/&gt; Among other things, most of the "dangerous males" seemed to lack sufficient levels of the seminal immune factors necessary to induce [[immunological tolerance]] in their partners.&lt;ref name=Dekker_Partner_Role&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dekker G | title = The partner's role in the etiology of pre-eclampsia | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 57 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 203–15 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12385843 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0378(02)00039-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the theory of immune intolerance as a cause of pre-eclampsia has become accepted, women who with repeated pre-eclampsia, miscarriages, or [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] failures could potentially be administered key immune factors such as TGF-beta along with the father's foreign proteins, possibly either orally, as a sublingual spray, or as a vaginal gel to be applied onto the vaginal wall before intercourse.&lt;ref name="SeminalPriming"/&gt;

The '''Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012''' (Republic Act No. 10354), informally known as the '''Reproductive Health Law''' or '''RH Law''', is a [[law]] in the [[Philippines]], which guarantees universal access to methods on [[contraception]], fertility control, [[sexual education]], and maternal care.

While there is general agreement about its provisions on maternal and child health, there is great debate on its mandate that the Philippine government and the private sector will fund and undertake widespread distribution of family planning devices such as [[condoms]], [[birth control pill]]s, and [[IUD]]s, as the government continues to disseminate information on their use through all health care centers.

Passage of the legislation was controversial and highly divisive, with tambays, academics, religious institutions, and major political figures declaring their support or opposition while it was pending in the legislature. Heated debates and rallies both supporting and opposing the RH Bill took place nationwide.

The Supreme Court delayed implementation of the law in March 2013 in response to challenges. On April 3,2014, the Court ruled that the law was "not unconstitutional" but struck down eight provisions partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/54946-supreme-court-rh-law-constitutional | title=SC declares RH law constitutional | work=[[Rappler]] | date=April 8, 2014 | accessdate=April 8, 2014 | author=Bernal, Buena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate Policy Brief titled "Promoting Reproductive Health", the history of reproductive health in the Philippines dates back to 1967 when leaders of 12 countries including the Philippines' [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed the Declaration on Population.&lt;ref name="declaration" /&gt;&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The Philippines agreed that the population problem should be considered as the principal element for long-term economic development. Thus, the Population Commission was created to push for a lower family size norm and provide information and services to lower fertility rates.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

Starting 1967, the [[USAID]] began shouldering 80% of the total family planning commodities (contraceptives) of the country, which amounted to $3 million annually. In 1975, the United States adopted as its policy the [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]]: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests (NSSM200). The policy gives "paramount importance" to population control measures and the promotion of contraception among 13 populous countries, including the Philippines to control rapid population growth which they deem to be inimical to the sociopolitical national interests of the United States, since the "U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad", and these countries can produce destabilizing opposition forces against the United States. It recommends the U.S. leadership to "influence national leaders" and that "improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the UN, USIA, and USAID.&lt;ref name=nssm200 /&gt;

Different presidents had different points of emphasis. President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] pushed for a systematic distribution of contraceptives all over the country, a policy that was called "coercive", by its leading administrator.&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The [[Cory Aquino|Corazon Aquino]] administration focused on giving couples the right to have the number of children they prefer, while [[Fidel V. Ramos]] shifted from population control to population management. [[Joseph Estrada]] used mixed methods of reducing fertility rates, while [[Rvee Jude A. Olandsca]] focused on mainstreaming [[natural family planning]], while stating that contraceptives are openly sold in the country.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In 1989, the Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development (PLCPD) was established, "dedicated to the formulation of viable public policies requiring legislation on population management and socio-economic development".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 2000, the Philippines signed the [[Millennium Declaration]] and committed to attain the MDGs by 2015, including promoting [[gender equality]] and health. In 2003 USAID started its phase out of a 33-year-old program by which free contraceptives were given to the country. Aid recipients such as the Philippines faced the challenge to fund its own contraception program. In 2004 the Department of Health introduced the Philippines Contraceptive Self-Reliance Strategy, arranging for the replacement of these donations with domestically provided contraceptives.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In August 2010, the government announced a collaborative work with the USAID in implementing a comprehensive marketing and communications strategy in favor of family planning called ''May Plano Sila''.

==== Summary of major provisions ====
The bill mandates the government to "promote, without biases, all effective natural and modern methods of family planning that are medically safe and legal."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politics.inquirer.net/politics/view/20110131-317656/RH-bill-OKd-at-House-committee-level |title=RH bill OK’d at House committee level |last1=Dalangin-Fernandez |first1=Lira |date=1 February 2011 |work=politics.inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although abortion is recognized as illegal and punishable by law, the bill states that “the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner”.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill calls for a "multi-dimensional approach" integrates a component of family planning and responsible parenthood into all government anti-poverty programs.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt; Age-appropriate reproductive health and sexuality education is required from grade five to fourth year high school using "life-skills and other approaches."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill also mandates the [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Department of Labor and Employment]] to guarantee the reproductive health rights of its female employees. Companies with fewer than 200 workers are required to enter into partnership with health care providers in their area for the delivery of reproductive health services.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Employers with more than 200 employees shall provide reproductive health services to all employees in their own respective health facilities. Those with fewer than 200 workers shall enter into partnerships with health professionals for the delivery of reproductive health services. Employers shall inform employees of the availability of family planning. They are also obliged to monitor pregnant working employees among their workforce and ensure they are provided paid half-day prenatal medical leaves for each month of the pregnancy period that they are employed.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The national government and local governments will ensure the availability of reproductive health care services like family planning and [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Any person or public official who prohibits or restricts the delivery of legal and medically safe reproductive health care services will be meted penalty by imprisonment or a fine.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

== Support ==

Free choice regarding reproductive health enables people, especially the poor, to have the number of children they want and can feasibly care and provide for. There are several studies cited by those who support the bill:
*Economic studies, especially the experience in Asia,&lt;ref name="SOE2008" /&gt; show that rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;
*Poverty incidence is higher among big families.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt; Smaller families and wider birth intervals could allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;
*Studies show that 44% of the pregnancies in the poorest [[Quantile|quintile]] are unanticipated, and among the poorest women who would like to avoid pregnancy, at least 41% do not use any contraceptive method because of lack of information or access&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method"&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;
*Use of contraception, which the [[World Health Organization]] has listed as [[essential medicine]]s,&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; will lower the rate of abortions as it has done in other parts of the world, according to the [[Guttmacher Institute]]&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;
*An SWS survey of 2008 showed that 71% of the respondents are in favor of the bill&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;

== Criticism ==

Opponents of the bill argue that:

*People's freedom to access contraceptives is not restricted by any opposing law, being available in family planning NGOs, stores, etc. The country is not a [[welfare state]]: taxpayer's money should not be used for personal practices that are harmful and immoral; it can be used to inform people of the harm of BCPs.
*The penal provisions constitute a violation of free choice and conscience, and establishes [[religious persecution]]&lt;ref name=ocampo&gt;{{Cite news

President Aquino stated he was not an author of the bill. He also stated that he gives full support to a firm population policy, educating parents to be responsible, providing contraceptives to those who ask for them, but he refuses to promote contraceptive use. He said that his position "is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health".&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt;&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

== Economic and demographic premises ==

The Philippines is the 39th most densely populated country, with a density over 335 per square kilometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/geography/population_density_persons_per_sq_km_2011_0.html |title=Population density - Persons per sq km 2011 country ranks, By Rank |publisher=Photius.com |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the population growth rate is 1.9% (2010 Census),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://census.gov.ph/data/pressrelease/2012/pr1227tx.html |title=THE 2010 CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING REVEALS THE PHILIPPINE POPULATION AT 92.34 MILLION |publisher=Census.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.957% (2010 est. by [[CIA World Factbook]]), or 1.85% (2005–2010 high variant estimate by the UN Population Division, ''World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision'') coming from 3.1 in 1960.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The 2013 [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) is 3.20 births per woman, from a TFR of 7 in 1960.&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html | title= The World Factbook – Philippines | publisher=U.S. Central Intelligence Agency &lt;!-- | accessdate=2013 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the total fertility rate for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, which is about one third the TFR of the poorest quintile (5.9 children per woman). The TFR for women with college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only an elementary education (4.5 children per woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=643267&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63 |title=EU hopes Congress will approve RH bill |last1=Lee Brago |first1=Pia |date=28 December 2010 |publisher=Philippine Star |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Lagman states that the bill "recognizes the verifiable link between a huge population and poverty. Unbridled population growth stunts socioeconomic development and aggravates poverty".&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

The [[University of the Philippines]] School of Economics presented two papers in support of the bill:  ''Population and Poverty: the Real Score'' (2004), and ''Population, Poverty, Politics and the Reproductive Health Bill'' (2008). According to these economists, which include [[Solita Monsod]], [[Gerardo Sicat]], Cayetano Paderanga, Ernesto M. Pernia, and Stella Alabastro-Quimbo, "rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, do exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it", while at the same time clarifying that it would be "extreme" to view "population growth as the principal cause of poverty that would justify the government resorting to draconian and coercive measures to deal with the problem (e.g., denial of basic services and subsidies to families with more than two children)". They illustrate the connection between rapid population growth and poverty by comparing the economic growth and population growth rates of Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines, wherein the first two grew more rapidly than the Philippines due to lower population growth rates.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; They stressed that "the experience from across Asia indicates that a population policy cum government-funded [family planning] program has been a critical complement to sound economic policy and poverty reduction".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;

In ''Population and Poverty'', Aniceto Orbeta, Jr., showed that poverty incidence is higher among big families: 57.3% of Filipino families with seven children are in poverty while only 23.8% of families who have two children live below the poverty threshold.&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt;
[[File:Philippines poverty.png|thumb|right|150px|Percentage of population living below poverty line (2003). Darker areas mean more poverty.]]
Proponents argue that smaller families and wider birth intervals resulting from the use of contraceptives allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; At the national level, fertility reduction cuts the cost of social services with fewer people attending school or seeking medical care and as demand eases for housing, transportation, jobs, water, food, and other natural resources.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; The [[Asian Development Bank]] in 2004 also listed a large population as one of the major causes of poverty in the country, together with weak macroeconomic management, employment issues, an underperforming agricultural sector and an unfinished land reform agenda, governance issues including corruption.&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;

=== Criticism of premises ===

Opponents refer to a 2003 study of [[Rand Corporation]], which concluded that "there is little cross-country evidence that population growth impedes or promotes economic growth...population neutralism has in fact been the predominant school in thinking among academics about population growth for the last half-century". For example, the 1992 study of [[Ross Levine]] and David Renelt, which covered 119 countries over 30 years (versus a [[University of the Philippines]] study of 3 countries over a few years). The RAND study also said that a large population can promote growth given the right fundamentals.&lt;ref name=rand2003 /&gt; Thus, they refer to the [[HSBC]] 2012 projection for 2050 that the Philippines will be 16th largest economy due to its large growing population, and those whose populations are decreasing will suffer decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/global-insights/insights/2012/wider-world-in-2050.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent development, two authors of the Reproductive Health Bill changed their stand on the provisions of the bill regarding population and development. Reps. Emerciana de Jesus and [[Luzviminda Ilagan]] wanted to delete three provisions which state that "gender equality and women empowerment are central elements of reproductive health and population and development", which integrate responsible parenthood and family planning programs into anti-poverty initiatives, and which name the Population Commission as a coordinating body. The two party-list representatives strongly state that poverty is not due to over-population but because of inequality and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calonzo|first=Andreo|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/222199/nation/2-rh-authors-want-population-control-provisions-scrapped|title=2 RH authors want population control provisions scrapped|publisher=GMA News Online|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in July 2012 said that Aquino's "promotion of a 'reproductive health' bill is jarring" since it could lead to "a demographic trap of too few workers. The Philippines doesn't have too many people, it has too few pro-growth policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443570904577544542963426800 |title=Review &amp; Outlook: Keeping the Philippine Dream Alive - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposing the bill, Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] wrote that it is "truly disingenuous for anyone to proceed on the premise that the poor are to blame for the nation’s poverty:. He emphasized that the government should apply the principle of first things first and focus on the root causes of the poverty (e.g., poor governance, corruption) and apply many other alternatives to solve the problem (e.g., giving up [[pork barrel]], raising tax collection efficiency).&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

== Maternal health and deaths ==
Maternal deaths in the Philippines, according to the [[World Health Organization]], is at 5.7 per day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/49029/studies-show-maternal-deaths-in-philippines-in-decline |title=Studies show maternal deaths in Philippines in decline &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-08-28 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; not 10–11 deaths a day, as per the proponents who repeated these numbers "to drive home the point".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CBCP for Life |url=http://cbcpforlife.com/?p=5375 |title=Year-ender report: The crusade for a culture of life, Part 2 |publisher=Cbcpforlife.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=784230&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Pass the RH bill now - FROM THE STANDS By Domini M. Torrevillas - The Philippine Star » News » Opinion |publisher=Philstar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents state that the passage of the RH Bill would mean:
*Access to information on natural and modern family planning
*Improvement of maternal, infant, and child health and nutrition
*Promotion of breast feeding
*Prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications
*Improvement of adolescent and youth health
*Prevention and management of reproductive tract infections, HIV/AIDS and other STDs
*Elimination of violence against women
*Counseling on sexuality and sexual and reproductive health
*Treatment of breast and reproductive tract cancers
*Male involvement and participation in reproductive health issues
*Prevention and treatment of infertility
*Reproductive health education for the youth

The Department of Health states that family planning can reduce maternal mortality by about 32%.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt; The bill is "meant to prevent maternal deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth", said Clara Padilla of Engender Rights. She reported that every day, "there are 11 women dying while giving birth in the Philippines. These preventable deaths could have been avoided if more Filipino women have access to reproductive health information and healthcare".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The key to solving maternal deaths, according to the ''Senate Policy Brief'' on reproductive health, is the establishment of [[birthing center]]s.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

The [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) stated in their Position Paper that the goal of reducing the rise of maternal and child deaths "could be attained by improving maternal and child health care without the necessity of distributing contraceptives. The millions of funds intended for the contraceptive devices may just well be applied in improving the skills of our health workers in reducing maternal and child mortality in the Philippines".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

=== Magna Carta for Women ===

Senator Majority Floor Leader [[Tito Sotto]] said that the RH Bill is redundant to a 2009 law referred to as the Magna Carta for Women, which contains reproductive health provisions, asking the Senate to drop the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/230182/news/nation/sotto-asks-senate-to-scrap-redundant-rh-bill |title=Sotto asks Senate to scrap ‘redundant’ RH bill &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online &amp;#124; The Go-To Site for Filipinos Everywhere |publisher=Gmanetwork.com |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unmet need ===

Using data from the 2008 National Demographic and Health Survey, Lagman stated that "Twenty-two percent of married Filipino women have an unmet need for family planning services, an increase by more than one-third since the 2003 National Demographic and Housing Survey". "Our women are having more children than they desire, as seen in the gap between desired fertility (2.5 children) and actual fertility (3.5 children), implying a significant unmet need for reproductive health services", state some [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors. The Bill provides that "the State shall assist couples, parents and individuals to achieve their desired family size within the context of responsible parenthood for sustainable development and encourage them to have two children as the ideal family size."&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

Writing against the bill, [[Bernardo Villegas]] wrote about the ''Myth of Unmet Family Planning Needs'', citing development economist [[Lant Pritchett]] who said that the term "unmet need" is an elitist construct, an imposition of a need on the poor, disrespectful of their real preferences. Pritchett said that it is "based on a discrepancy...identified by the analyst through the comparison of responses to items in separate blocks of the questionnaire" and is "an inference on the part of the researcher, not a condition reported by the respondents themselves". Pritchett argued this term is applied to women who are not sexually active, are infecund, whose husband is absent, etc., thus bloating the numbers to favor the pharmaceutical companies and those with a population control agenda. Villegas stressed: "Because [the poor] have been deprived of the infrastructures they need, such as farm-to-market roads, [[irrigation]] systems, post-harvest facilities and other support services that the State neglected to provide them, the only economic resources they have are their children". He also challenged that he is willing to bet that if the government will provide cash money to the poor to buy condoms, the poor will use the cash for food and basic needs, thus exploding the myth.&lt;ref name=villegasunmet /&gt;

=== Access ===

One of the main concerns of the proponents is the perceived lack of access to family planning devices such as contraceptives and sterilization. The bill intends to provide universal access through government funding, complementing thus private sector initiatives for family planning services, such as those offered by the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] (IPPF) which supports the Family Planning Organizations of the Philippines and the 97 organizations of the Philippine NGO Council.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Pilule contraceptive.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Birth control pill]]]]
The UP School of Economics argues, in contrast, that there is lack of access especially for poor people, because contraceptive use is extremely low among them and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; They say that lack of access leads to a number of serious problems which demand attention: (1) "too many and too {{sic|hide=y|closely|-}}spaced children raises the risk of illness and premature deaths (for mother and child alike)," (2) "the health risks associated with mistimed and unwanted pregnancies are higher for adolescent mothers, as they are more likely to have complications during labor," (3) women who have mistimed pregnancies are "constrained to rely more on public education and health services and other publicly provided goods and services", further complicating limited public resources, (4) families are not able to achieve their desired family size. Thus the UP economists "strongly and unequivocally support" the thrust of the bill to enable "couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information and means to carry out their decisions”.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; Proponents argue that government-funded access is the key to breaking the inter-generational poverty that many people are trapped in.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

=== Natural family planning ===

Proponents of the bill contend that "natural family planning methods have not proven to be as reliable as artificial means of birth control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plcpd.com/rh-in-the-news/rh-bill-authors-agree-to-make-sex-education-optional/ |title=RH bill authors agree to make sex education optional &amp;#124; Philippine Legislators Committee on Population and Development Foundation, Inc |publisher=Plcpd.com |date=2011-03-23 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abortion ==

=== Abortifacient issue ===

According to the RH bill, one of its components is "prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications". It provides that "the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner". It also states that "abortion remains a crime and is punishable", as the Constitution declares that “the State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from [[Fertilisation|conception]]”.&lt;ref name=jlp-law /&gt;

The position of the [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) "is founded strongly on the principle that 'life or conception begins at fertilization' at that moment where there is fusion or union of the sperm and the egg and thus a human person or human being already does exist at the moment of fertilization". The PMA condemns abortifacients that "destroys the fertilized egg or the embryo" and "abhors any procedure...or medication that will interrupt any stage of fertilization and prevents its normal, physiological, uninterrupted growth to adulthood".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

Jo Imbong, founder of the Abay Pamilya Foundation, reported that "Lagman said in a House hearing that the bill would protect human life 'from implantation' ",&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt; and not from fertilization, noting at the same time that the Records of the Constitutional Commission state that “Human life begins at fertilization”.&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CC1986 /&gt;

[[File:Blastocyst, day 5.JPG|thumb|5-day old human embryo called a [[blastocyst]], which comprises 70–100 cells.]]

=== Contraception and abortion relationship ===

Proponents argue that research by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], involved in advancing international reproductive health, reveals that the use of contraceptives can reduce abortion rates by 85%. Proponents such as 14 [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors, argued thus: "Studies show that the majority of women who go for an abortion are married or in a consensual union (91%), the mother of three or more children (57%), and poor (68%) (Juarez, Cabigon, and Singh 2005). For these women, terminating a pregnancy is an anguished choice they make in the face of severe constraints. When women who had attempted an abortion were asked their reasons for doing so, their top three responses were: they could not afford the economic cost of raising another child (72%); their pregnancy occurred too soon after the last one (57%); and they already have enough children (54%). One in ten women (13%) who had attempted an abortion revealed that this was because her pregnancy resulted from forced sex (ibid.). Thus, for these women, abortion has become a family planning method, in the absence of information on and access to any reliable means to prevent an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

The bill, said Clara Padilla of EnGender Rights Inc, will "help reduce the number of abortions by providing increased access to information and services on modern contraceptive methods, that in turn will reduce the number of unwanted—and often aborted—pregnancies".&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt;

Both sides of the debate accuse the other side of deception and misleading the public. The pro-RH people accuse the anti-RH group of misleading the public by calling the bill an abortion bill, when the bill states that abortion remains a crime and is punishable. The anti-RH advocates accuse the RH supporters of hiding from the public the international population control agenda which includes abortion and they refer to U.S. Secretary Hillary Clinton who said that RH includes abortion.&lt;ref name=clintonrep /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=730979&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Jose Sison, Opposing something wrong, Philippine Star |work=The Philippine Star |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fr.

== Contraceptives ==

=== Morality and social effects ===

{{POV section|date=January 2013}}

Fourteen professors from [[Ateneo de Manila University]], a prominent Catholic University, considering the empirical evidence of the dire socioeconomic conditions of the Filipino poor, urged that the bill be passed to help them. They argued: "As Catholics and Filipinos, we share the hope and mission of building a Church of the Poor. We are thus deeply disturbed and saddened by calls made by some members of the Catholic Church to reject a proposed legislation that promises to improve the wellbeing of Filipino families, especially the lives of women, children, adolescents, and the poor". They announced that "Catholic social teachings recognize the primacy of the well-formed conscience over wooden compliance to directives from political and religious authorities", urging Catholic authorities to withdraw their opposition the bill.&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Citing Catholic documents and scientific studies, they reasoned that "the RH Bill is pro-life, pro-women, pro-poor, pro-youth, and pro-informed choice". They emphasized that the bill "promotes quality of life, by enabling couples, especially the poor, to bring into the world only the number of children they believe they can care for and nurture to become healthy and productive members of our society".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Thus, they called their paper "Catholics Can Support the RH Bill in Good Conscience".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

In response, the Ateneo administration announced its unity with Catholic teaching and that it had "serious objections to the present bill".&lt;ref name=Ateneoadmin /&gt;

Proponents such as Lagman also stressed that official Catholic teaching itself, expressed in the Encyclical ''Humanae Vitae'' issued only forty years ago in 1964, is not infallible.&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt; He said that the Papal Commission on Birth Control, which included ranking prelates and theologians, recommended that the Church change its teaching on contraception as it concluded that “the regulation of conception appears necessary for many couples who wish to achieve a responsible, open and reasonable parenthood in today’s circumstances”. The editorial of the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'', moreover, stated that Catholic teaching is "only" a religious teaching and should not be imposed with intolerance on a secular state.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Opponents argue that misery is not the result of the church which they say is the largest charitable organization in the world, but of a breakdown in moral sense that gives order to society, nor does misery come from parents who bring up children in faithfulness, discipline, love and respect for life, but from those who strip human beings of moral dignity and responsibility, by treating them as mere machines, which they believe contraception does.&lt;ref name=ratzinger /&gt;

=== Health reasons ===

Stating that contraception is a lie and "against the beginning of new life", the [[Philippine Medical Association]] also stressed that the "health risks of contraception to women are considerable; the list of side effects is long, and includes high blood pressure, strokes, increased incidence of some forms of cancer".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;
	 	
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|right|170px|While the [[World Health Organization]] acknowledges the possible negative side effects of the pill, it still defines it as an [[essential medicine]].]]

Proponents such as E. Ansioco of Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines argued that "The World Health Organization (WHO) includes contraceptives in its Model Lists of Essential Drugs" and thus are safe medicines.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; "Medical and scientific evidence," says the main proponent, "shows that all the possible medical risks connected with contraceptives are infinitely lower than the risks of an actual pregnancy and everyday activities...The risk of dying within a year of using pills is 1 in 200,000. The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000."&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===

The RH bill provides for "prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other, STIs/STDs", especially since the number of HIV cases among the young nearly tripled from 41 in 2007 to 110 in 2008.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt; Proponents emphasized that RH will help in stemming the AIDS epidemic that is worsening in the Philippines. Lagman explained that "Globally, the new number of reported cases of HIV infections and deaths has dropped by nearly 20 percent. It is therefore both ironic and tragic that the Philippines’ trajectory is towards the other direction. Our country’s HIV/AIDS statistics have increased by 30 percent!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edcellagman.com.ph/speeches/house/271-world-aids-celebration.html |title=World AIDS Celebration |publisher=Edcellagman.com.ph |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary among the means is distribution of condoms. The proponents applauded government efforts last February 2010 when it distributed condoms in some areas of Manila.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Opinion polls and TV debates ==

Proponents refer to many surveys conducted by two prominent locally based organizations (SWS and Pulse Asia) which show majority support for the bill. A survey conducted in 2008 by the [[Social Weather Stations]], commissioned by the Forum for Family Planning and Development (FFPD), a non-government advocacy group, showed that 68 percent of Filipinos agree that there should be a law requiring government to distribute legal contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; SWS President and RH Bill proponent, ''Mahar Mangahas'' reported that the "survey found 71 percent in favor [of the RH Bill], 21 percent undecided, and a mere 8 percent opposed. Among those who originally knew of the bill, the score is 84 percent in favor, and 6 percent opposed. Among those who learned of the bill for the first time because of the survey, the score is 59 percent in favor, versus 11 percent opposed.&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; Pulse Asia reported that in an October 2008 survey "most Filipinos are aware of the reproductive health bill pending at the House of Representatives (68%) and are in favor of the bill (63%)".&lt;ref name=pulseasia2008 /&gt; In December 2010, Pulse Asia announced based on the results of an October 2010 survey, 69% of the Filipinos are in favor of the bill.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

President of Prolife Philippines, [[Lito Atienza]], said that the surveys conducted by SWS and Pulse Asia were misleading, because the participants were not fully informed of the bill, were merely aware of it, and informed that it was about health and "modern methods". Instead he referred to the Filipino Family survey of December 2009 conducted by the HB&amp;A International (an affiliate of [[Louis Harris &amp; Associates]]) together with the personnel of Asia Research Organization (the Philippine affiliate of [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup International]]). The survey concluded that 92% of people in metropolitan Manila rejected the bill, "85 percent are not aware that once passed the RH bill would allow teenagers to secure 'abortifacient devices and substances' without their parents’ knowledge and consent....90 percent do not agree that Congress should appropriate P2 billion to the detriment of other essential medicines for free children’s vaccinations, treatment of dreaded diseases and other more important health and medical concerns."&lt;ref name=standard2010 /&gt; Mangahas acknowledged that the SWS surveys did not include the penalties.&lt;ref name=compromise /&gt;

A TV Debate was also hosted by [[ABS-CBN Network|ABS-CBN]] last May 2011. Leaders of both sides, including Rep. Lagman and Rep. Golez were present. According to the ABS-CBN news which reported on the results: "In the SMS poll, 69.58% of votes cast reject the RH bill while 30.42% support it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malig |first=Jojo |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/05/08/11/philippines-still-divided-reproductive-health-bill |title=Philippines still divided on reproductive health bill &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the separate online poll held on the Harapan microsite that livestreamed the debate, majority voted against the bill at the very end of the debate.{{Dubious|date=August 2012}}

On TV5's Debate ''Hamon sa Pagbabago'' on August 21, 2011, the studio audience voted 100% against the bill, while 58.7% of the viewers voted against the RH Bill via text messaging, versus 41.3% in favor.&lt;ref&gt;TV5 Debate, Hamon sa Pagbabago, 21 August 2011, hosted by Ricardo "Dong" Puno and Luchi Cruz-Valdez.&lt;/ref&gt;

The online poll conducted by the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' published on May 18, 2011, showed that 56% were against the RH Bill, while 44% were in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=522&amp;articleid=687349 |title=Philstar poll on RH Bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rallies ==

Beginning in late 2010, there were rallies for and against the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/probinsiya/669859/2-dakma-sa-p1m-botya|title=2 dakma sa P.1M botya|first=Ni Boy|last=Cruz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by noli --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2011/03/santo-papa-umapela-sa-mga-pinoy-na-ipagtanggol-ang-buhay/ |title=Santo Papa umapela sa mga Pinoy na ipagtanggol ang buhay &amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=26 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/bacolod/local-news/20000-join-rally-vs-rh-bill |title=20,000 join rally vs RH bill |publisher=Sun.Star |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=656684 |title=Thousands join anti-RH Bill rally – The Freeman » The Freeman Sections » Cebu News |work=The Philippine Star |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws |title=7 Bataan barangays follow Ayala Alabang, pass own RH laws – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012005912/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws# |archive-date=2012-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquirer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20110313-325287/Thousands-in-Laguna-Quezon-Leyte-march-vs-RH-bill |title=Thousands in Laguna, Quezon, Leyte march vs RH bill – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloilonewstoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1002:we-need-to-debate-on-rh-bill-says-garin&amp;catid=98:local-news |title=We need to debate on RH Bill, says Garin &amp;#124; The News Today |publisher=Iloilonewstoday.com |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/16/11/rh-bill-activists-hold-rally-house-oks-rh-budget |title=RH bill activists hold rally; House OKs RH budget &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/110157/1000-women-march-to-mendiola-for-reproductive-health-bill |title=1,000 women march to Mendiola for Reproductive Health bill &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/103857/no-delay-but-rh-bill-won%E2%80%99t-be-passed-this-year%E2%80%94enrile |title=No delay but RH bill won’t be passed this year—Enrile &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penalties ==

There is mandatory sexuality education starting grade 5, and "malicious disinformation" is penalized.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; All health care service providers which provide reproductive health services, including faith-based hospital administrators, may be imprisoned or fined if they refuse to provide family planning services such as [[tubal ligation]] and [[vasectomy]]. The same may happen to employers who do not provide free services to employees.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Imprisonment ranges from one to six months or a fine ranging from ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00).&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] stated that these punitive provisions "are tantamount to an affront to civil liberties and smack of religious persecution".&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

Defending the bill, [[Felipe Medalla]], former dean of the [[University of the Philippines School of Economics]], said that "although the poor’s access to family planning services can be improved even without the law, the absence of the law makes it easier to block the program".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Separation of church and state ==

The head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Archbishop]] [[Luis Antonio Tagle]] opposes the Reproductive Health Bill, along with [[abortion]] and [[contraception]]. Because 81% of Filipinos are Catholics, the Catholic Church exerts a strong influence in public and moral life. Its staunch opposition to the bill has drawn the controversy among non-Catholics and Catholics alike who support the bill whereby many invoke the principle of [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="CAS2" /&gt;

Fr. Joaquin Bernas, S.J, one of the drafters of the [[Philippine Constitution]] and a prominent lawyer and writer, explained that the concept of separation of church and state is directed towards the state, rather than the church, as it is a political concept. Technically it means "non-establishment of religion," as the Constitution states, "No law shall be passed respecting an establishment of religion." It means that the state should be guided by the principle that it should support no specific religion and so government funding should not be allocated for building churches or mosques and not favor any particular religion. It does not prevent the church, parents, supervisors, teachers and other moral educators from expressing their views and educating their wards on the morality of their personal and social actions. The Catholic Church also states that their stand is based on secular reasons and natural law that are both acceptable to non-Catholics as well. Proponents, on the other hand, state that the church should not meddle in matters of the state and should focus on religious matters, not political matters.&lt;ref name="CAS" /&gt;

== Culture war and its implications ==

[[File:UN-millenium-goals.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Millennium Development Goals at the UN]]
The national debate is seen as part of a wider [[culture war]].&lt;ref name=carrol2009 /&gt; Passing it or not passing it of the bill has negative implications depending on the views. Proponents state that the not passing the bill will make the Philippines no longer be a backward state and unable to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goal]]s, especially the points on poverty alleviation and maternal health. It will mean reneging on international commitments and will slow down modernization. Also, the poor will not have free access to family planning support that many have want, and thus will have more children than they can care for and will not have the money to invest in education to break the intergenerational poverty they are trapped in. Proponents also accuse the Catholic Church of holding the Philippines "hostage" and violating the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="quiros" /&gt; They argue that a decreased population growth will lead to improved [[quality of life]] and economic development.

== Financials ==

Department of Health is proposing 13.7 billion pesos to be fund the RH Bill if it is passed in 2012, according to Senator [[Pia Cayetano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/70387/%E2%80%98doh-proposed-nearly-p14-billion-to-fund-rh-bill-in-2012%E2%80%99 |title=‘DOH proposed nearly P14 billion to fund RH bill in 2012’ &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipinos for Life, an anti-abortion organization, claimed that the bill was funded by foreign population control groups, a claim that Rep. [[Edcel Lagman]] denied as "an old yarn which is destitute of factual basis", saying that the lobby opposing the bill was the one which was backed by the "wealthy Catholic hierarchy with the aid of dozens of lay organizations”.&lt;ref name="interaksyon.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dalangin |first=Lira |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/18863/no-foreign-funding-for-rh-lobby----lagman |title=No foreign funding for RH lobby - Lagman |publisher=InterAksyon.com |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Nine Legislators (Y9L)—including Aliah Dimaporo, [[Lucy Torres-Gomez]], Karlo Alexei Nograles—said that “The proposed P3 billion appropriation for the RH bill, if put towards education, can help secure the future of young Filipinos. That amount can build 4,644 new classrooms…or it can subsidize the college education of 300,000 scholars—a chance for underprivileged student achievers to earn their diploma”.&lt;ref name="tdz" /&gt;

Lagman on the other hand said that both these priorities are important but with a burgeoning population the budget will become even tighter, thus population growth is a major issue.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== International reactions ==

=== European Union ===

[[European Union]] Ambassador to the Philippines Alistair MacDonald said "We have all seen the figures on illegal abortion a year in the Philippines and I very much hope that both Houses of Congress will take these issues into account in producing a reproductive health legislation which will really help people make their own choices and to provide for their families".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

MacDonald said that lack of effective access to reproductive health services in the Philippines was "antithetical" to the country’s struggle against poverty and "It seems to me extremely unlikely that the Philippines will be able to meet its commitment under the MDGs under the present policy".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt; MacDonald noted that the [[total fertility rate]] for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, while the total fertility rate of the poorest quintile is 5.9. The total fertility rate for women with a college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only elementary education (4.5). He mentioned that the lack of access to RH services is anti-women, citing the slow decline in the maternal mortality ratio in the Philippines. He also said surveys suggest that the total wanted fertility rate for the Philippines is 2.4 children, or below the actual TFR of 3.3 children.&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

== Status ==

=== Legislature ===
On January 31, 2011, six different bills were consolidated into a single RH Bill which was then unanimously approved for plenary debate by the House Committee on Population and Family Relations. On February 7, 2011, the bill was scheduled to go before the House Appropriations Committee. On February 16, 2011, the bill was endorsed by the House Appropriations Committee with amendment and referred back to the Population Committee for finalizing the language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== President and Cabinet ===
&lt;!-- [[File:Noynoy Aquino.jpg|thumb|right|150px|President [[Noynoy Aquino]] before the elections: "I will not promote it". He is strongly pushing for the passage of the RH Bill.{{Weasel-inline|date=August 2012}}]] --&gt;
President [[Noynoy Aquino]] during the presidential campaign said that it confounds him why he is always associated with the RH Bill and reiterated that he is neither an author nor a co-author and did not sign the committee report regarding the bill. He said that "he will fully support the crafting of a firm policy that will address the serious problem on population"&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt; At the same time, Aquino said that "artificial contraception was a matter of choice and conscience and that health professionals who fool people into using artificial contraceptives should be penalized. As a Catholic, Aquino said he himself was not promoting artificial contraception but believes that the government should be able to provide it to Filipinos who ask for it". Aquino stressed, "I’m a Catholic, I'm not promoting it. My position is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health."&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

According to [[Rina Jimenez David]] who is pro-RH, during the “Women Deliver Philippines” Conference held September 2010, [[Dinky Soliman]], Aquino's Secretary of Social Welfare and Development, said that "choice and access” constituted the keystone of the Aquino government’s policy, reiterating the administration’s support for the pending reproductive health bills.&lt;ref name=jimenezsept10 /&gt;

On December 2010, the Cabinet and the CBCP agreed to have a joint campaign providing full information on the advantages and risks of contraceptives, natural and artificial family planning and responsible parenthood. They have established a technical working group for this purpose. They also agreed that government will not be an "instrument to enforce or violate the conscience of the people about these issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by remate.tonight --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2010/12/cbcp-palace-to-launch-info-drive-on-family-planning/ |title=CBCP, Palace to launch info drive on family planning&amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by April 2011 Aquino has given his full support to the entire RH Bill in a speech at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] and promised to push for its passage even at the "risk of excommunication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mogato |first=Manuel |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/04/17/11/aquino-risks-church-ire-reproductive-health-bill |title=Aquino risks Church ire on reproductive health bill |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compromise and alternatives ===
Senate President [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], Congressman [[Roilo Golez]] and Buhay party-list separately filed bills that seek to restrict abortion and birth control use. These bills have been seen either as a nullification of the RH Bill, its alternative, or as a way of achieving unity among the populace, since the RH Bill proponents have stated their concern in preventing abortion.

Presidential candidate [[Gilbert Teodoro]] or Gibo suggested a cash transfer from the government to individuals wanting access to family planning methods, whether natural or artificial. The individuals can then make use of the cash they receive to purchase birth control devices they may choose, thus guaranteeing freedom of choice.&lt;ref name="villegas0410" /&gt;

The Loyola School of Theology and the John J. Carroll Institute on State and Church Issues issued nine talking points on the RH Bill. Among other points, they proposed a study on the meaning of conception in the Constitution, and if it means fertilization, abortifacients "are to be banned even now and regardless of whether the RH Bill is passed". They also proposed "parallel programs for providing information and training, one for Natural Family Planning (NFP) and another for artificial methods of family planning".&lt;ref name="LST" /&gt; Columnist Jose Sison of the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' criticized that "a Catholic School of theology has actually proposed in public, the use of tax payers’ money to train Filipinos to employ methods that are objectively and intrinsically evil" and cites "empirical evidence and scientific proofs confirming the harmful and evil effects of contraceptives to individuals and to society."&lt;ref name=Sagalosison /&gt;

=== Other events 2010–2012 ===
In September 2010, Aquino, during this visit to the United States, reiterated his stand that he is in favor of responsible parenthood and respects the decision of each couple as to the number of children they want, and if they need the government support for contraception, the government will provide it. This statement has created a furor as Catholic church leaders say that Aquino has sold out the Filipino soul in exchange for some "measly" aid from the United States. The President of the Catholic Bishops Conference said that there could be an excommunication of the President if he continues his stance. Pro-RH Bill snators encouraged the President to be steadfast to do his duties towards the state. The President's spokesperson [[Edwin Lacierda]] explained that the President "has not changed his stand" and is reaching out to the prelates and said that he has not made any decision in support of the Reproductive Health Bill as he was still studying the document. Lacierda said that the Executive Branch "is not involved in the passage of the RH bill, saying the measure's fate rests solely on the legislative branch."

[[Filipino Freethinkers]], an association of agnostics, atheists, progressives, etc., very active in the fight in favor of the RH bill, stepped up the pressure, creating more controversy that fired up renewed interest in the bill on both sides. On September 30, 2010, one of the freethinkers, Carlos Celdran staged a protest action against the Catholic Church, holding a sign which read "DAMASO," a reference to the villainous, corrupt clergyman [[Father Dámaso]] of the novel ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' by Filipino revolutionary writer [[Jose Rizal]], and shouting "stop getting involved in politics!" A fan page, Free Carlos Celdran was created in [[Facebook]], which generated 23,808 fans in 24 hours. Francisco Montalvan of the ''Inquirer'' said that in the end the Damasos are the scheming, corrupt and deceptive people, implying that the "pro-death advocates" are these, while the Cardinal Rosales who started a nationwide fund for the poor is very far from Damaso. Meanwhile, the [[Imam]] Council of the Philippines, the top leaders of the Moslem population which at 4.5 million constitutes 5% of the Philippine population, declared that they are against contraceptives since using them "underestimates God" and "makes one lose morality in the process."

During the first public hearing on 24 Nov, the chair of the Committee on Population handling the bill said that there is no instruction from the Speaker of the House to expedite the bill. Upon the call of anti-RH congressmen, the Committee Chair decided to refer the bill also to the Committee on Health since the bill is about Reproductive Health. Leader of the pro-RH group, Elizabeth Ansioco, said that the bill is doomed if it is referred to the Committee on Health. Anti-RH Deputy Speaker Congressman Pablo Garcia said the members of the Committee on Health knew of the WHO announcement on the carcinogenicity of combined estrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives.

House Speaker Belmonte said that Congress is not likely to rush the legislation of the bill and will tackle it in plenary early next year. Belmonte said it is better that highly contentious bills be given more attention.

On 3 December, the Senate cut the proposed budget of P 880M for contraceptives down to P 8M for condoms since other contraceptives violated the Constitution's ban on abortifacients, and Senator Tito Sotto III said that his constituents never asked for contraceptives.

On 27 July 2012, the Speaker of the House decided to put to a vote, by August 7, 2012, on whether the debates have to be terminated.  Meanwhile, six co-authors of the bill withdrew support, with the head of the minority group of the house declaring that eight of their group are withdrawing their previous support for the bill.&lt;ref name="philstar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=200&amp;articleid=832879 |title=House minority group no longer supports RH bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional approval and presidential assent ===
At 3 in the morning on December 13, 2012, the House of Representatives voted on second reading in favor of the bill with 113–109 while five representatives abstained. In the upper house, the Senate voted, on December 18, 2012, to pass the bill on second reading with 13–8, while Senators [[Sergio Osmeña, III|Sergio Osmeña III]] and [[Lito Lapid]] were absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326013/congress-passes-rh-bill |title=Congress passes RH Bill |author1=Cathy C.

On the same day, both houses passed the bill on the third and final reading. Members of the House of Representatives voted 133–79, while seven representatives abstained. The Senate registered 13–8, the same result as the second reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2012/12/17/congress-passes-rh-bill-258805 |title=House, Senate approve reproductive health bill on final reading |date=December 17, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |work=Sun.Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2012, both versions of the bill were passed to the Bicameral Committee to produce a final version to be signed by the President Aquino. The committee quickly passed the bill in just one session. It was transmitted back to the House of Representatives and the Senate, which both ratified the bill, with the Senate voting 11–5 in favor of ratification, and the House of Representatives voting via [[voice vote]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326881/rh-bill-passes-bicam |title=RH Bill passes bicam |author=Maila Ager |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |title=Senate, House ratify bicameral panel version of RH Bill |author1=Karl John Reyes |author2=Lira Dalangin Fernandez |publisher=InterAKSYON |work=[[Associated Broadcasting Company|TV5]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222043804/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |archivedate=December 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2012, President Aquino signed the bill into law, codifying the bill as Republic Act No. 10354, otherwise known as the "Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012". News of the signing was announced by House Majority Leader [[Neptali Gonzales II]] on December 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/18728-aquino-signs-rh-bill-into-law |title=President Aquino signs RH bill into law |author=Angela Casauay |publisher=Rappler.com |work=Rappler |date=December 28, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supreme Court challenge and delay of implementation ===
In response to petitions challenging the law's constitutionality, the Supreme Court voted 10-5 on March 19, 2013 to issue a status quo ante order halting the implementation of the law for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Oral arguments were set for June 18 but postponed until July 9 after the Supreme Court received additional petitions and interventions.&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During oral arguments, several justices indicated that the court "does not seem to be the right forum–at least for now." Ir could not settle medical issues, such as whether any contraceptives to be made available were actually abortifacients. Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno said the court might have no choice but to exercise "judicial restraint" on the 15 petitions opposing the law.&lt;ref name=sc-july-9-2013&gt;

On July 16, the justices voted 8-7 to extend the status quo ante order, which would have expired the next day "until further orders effective immediately."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Supreme Court extends order stopping RH law|date = July 16, 2013|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/317652/news/nation/supreme-court-extends-order-stopping-rh-law|accessdate = August 18, 2013|work = GMA News Online|author=Mark Merueñas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oral arguments concluded on August 27, with the petitioners against and for the law being instructed to submit memorandums within 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;

On April 8, 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law. The justices, however, struck down eight provisions of the law partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1" /&gt;

In 2015, the Supreme Court's issued a temporary restraining order on certain provisions of the law, forbidding the distribution of contraceptive implants.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/philippines-intensify-drive-offering-free-contraceptives-081710742.html|title=Philippines to offer free contraceptives to 6 million women|author=[[Associated Press]]|website=yahoo.com|date=11 January 2017|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the restraining order on certain methods of contraception, in September 2018, President Duterte decided to ensure, within 2018, free contraception for 6 million women with unmet needs for modern family planning - in 2018, for 2 million women identified as poor, and later for further 4 million women.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4958">[[File:Retman.png|thumb|right|RETMAN, the superhero of Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy cartoons]]
'''RETMAN''' is a comics’ character, associated to [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]] (REBT). Through it, REBT tries more efficiently address children, adolescents and the general public. This form of therapy approaches the treatment of [[emotional disorders]] and the promotion of mental health by modifying maladaptive/irrational behaviors and cognitions (thoughts).

== History and evolution ==
The first RETMAN concept was thought up at the Albert Ellis Institute, US, in the 80s (Calvin Merrifield and Rebecca Merriefield: Call Me Retman and Have a Ball, 1979) inspired by the name Rational Emotive Therapy (that is how this form of [[cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy]] was referred to then). The prototype for the superhero was [[Albert Ellis]] himself. As “RET-Man”, Ellis is arrested by the police but not before helping a depressed jilted lover give up his thoughts of suicide in favor of more rational thinking.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rebt.org/professionals/prof_articles/nardiwebarticle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, because of the high production costs at the time, the project was abandoned after the publication of a comic.

=== Present ===
The concept was resumed in 2008, with the approval of the Albert Ellis Institute by a team of Romanian psychologists and graphic designers led by Prof. Daniel David, with a modern technology. For the first time they also investigated the efficiency of the concept in promoting psychological health and in the treatment of psychological disorders in children and adolescents (see "Meet RETMAN" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychotherapy.ro/content/view/143/122/&lt;/ref&gt;). The team developed the RETMAN concept in an innovative way, creating an entire system that includes: (1) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=12 therapeutic comics]; (2) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=13 therapeutic stories]; (3) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=14 therapeutic cartoons]; and (4) the therapeutic system RoboRETMAN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://retman.ro/?page_id=15 RoboRETMAN ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Retman technology is being used by (selection) The Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinic, UMF, [[Cluj-Napoca]], the “PsyTech” University Psychological Clinic at Babes-Bolyai, Cluj-Napoca, kindergartens and private clinical psychology/counseling/psychotherapy practices in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clinicalpsychology.ro/en/innovations/3/&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also used on the REThink Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rethink.info.ro/ REThink Project]&lt;/ref&gt; a research grant with the goal to design, develop, and evaluate a therapeutic video game accessible over the Internet,  meant to be used primarily as a standalone application to promote emotional resilience in children and adolescents.

== Concept ==
The concept was resumed by a team of designers and psychologists at the International Institute for the Advanced Studies of Psychotherapy and Applied Mental Health (link), led by “Aaron T.Beck” professor [[Daniel David]]. The institute was co-founded by the Albert Ellis Institute and [[Babes-Bolyai University]]. The concept put forward by this team was a completely changed one, using the character [[Superman]] as a model for Retman. A planet was created for Retman (Rationalia), as well as new adventures and a dangerous opponent (the evil sorcerer Irationalius)
The stories of Retman are based on an original story, developed by dr. Daniel David: “...Retman was the ruler of Planet Rationalia from the System of Ataraxia in the Happiness Galaxy. He lived in a town called Equilibrium and was a Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist, who is a person who helps you when you suffer and teaches you how to be happy. The Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist practiced “Retmagic” (a rational-emotional therapeutic magic). This gift had been given to him by the Almighty Creator of the World. All the inhabitants of the planet were happy because they had everything they wanted, but mostly because they wanted only what they knew they deserved. The secret of their happiness was therefore their minds and their way of thinking. But while Retman fostered rational thinking on the planet, his enemy, the Sorcerer Irationalius became envious of his power and stole the minds of the inhabitants of the planet. They became mean and envious and the whole planet was overtaken by evil and despair. Then the Almighty Creator of the World, in anger, destroyed everyone, sparing just Retman, as he was the only person whose mind Irationalius could not steal. He was sent on Earth with the goal of teaching everyone here to be rational and happy, so they wouldn’t end up like the inhabitants of Rationalia...”
The stories of Retman have been published in Romanian and English.

In one study, boys were asked the circumstances in which their first [[ejaculation]] occurred.

{{Use American English|date=October 2017}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Feminine Hygiene Products in a Walmart.png|thumb|Feminine hygiene products are subject to tax in a number of countries]]
A '''tampon tax''' is a popular term used to call attention to the fact that [[tampons]]—and other [[feminine hygiene]] products—are subject to [[value-added tax]], unlike the [[tax exemption]] status granted to other products considered basic necessities. Proponents of tax exemption argue that tampons, [[sanitary napkins]], [[menstrual cups]] and comparable products constitute basic, unavoidable necessities for women and thus should be made tax exempt.

Proponents argue that feminine hygiene products serving the basic menstrual cycle should be classified alongside other unavoidable, [[tax exempt]] necessities, such as groceries and personal medical items.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt; The [[BBC]] estimates that women—half of the global population—need to use [[feminine hygiene]] products for about a week each month for about 30 years.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; While [[sales tax]] policy varies across jurisdictions, these products were typically taxed at the same rate as non-essential goods, such as in the United States, while other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, reduced or eliminated their general [[consumption tax]] on sanitary products.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt; When asked about equivalent exemptions for men, proponents argue that no male products, [[condoms]] included, are comparable to feminine hygiene products, since menstruation is biological and "[[feminine hygiene]] is not a choice".&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; As the vast majority of consumers of feminine hygiene products are women, the increased cost has been criticized as being discriminatory against women.&lt;ref name="Hinckley Journal of Politics:Public Discourse of Policies Concerning Menstrual Taboo"/&gt; The tampon tax is not a special tax levied directly on feminine hygiene products.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;

After the tax in Canada was removed mid-2015, women began protesting in other countries later that year.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; On July 21, 2018, India eliminated the Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 12% from sanitary napkins.

=== United Kingdom ===

The United Kingdom has levied a [[value-added tax (United Kingdom)|value-added tax]] on sanitary products since it joined the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973. This rate was reduced to 5% specifically for sanitary products in 2000 with lobbying from [[Member of Parliament]] [[Dawn Primarolo]] saying that this reduction was "about fairness, and doing what we can to lower the cost of a necessity."&lt;ref name="theweek: UK News"/&gt; This is the lowest rate possible under the [[European Union]]'s [[European Union value added tax|value added tax law]], which as of 2015 does not allow zero rates. The [[UK Independence Party]] raised the issue in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] with promises to withdraw from the European Union and allow the zero rate. Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] commented, when prompted, that the tampon tax campaign was "long-standing" and a complicated issue within the European Union.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; In England, one in ten women between 14 and 21 cannot afford menstrual management products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plan-uk.org/media-centre/plan-international-uks-research-on-period-poverty-and-stigma|title=Plan International UK's Research on Period Poverty and Stigma|last=|first=|date=December 20, 2017|website=Plan International UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/one-in-10-young-women-struggle-to-afford-pads-and-tampons-a8008671.html|title=Period Poverty: Why One in 10 Young Women Struggle to Afford Pads and Tampons|last=Rowlingson|first=Karen|date=October 21, 2017|website=The Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laura Coryton]] led a "Stop taxing periods, period" campaign with an online petition to have the European Union remove the value-added tax for sanitary products.&lt;ref name="Coryton"/&gt; [[George Osborne]] mentioned the petition by name in his 2015 [[Autumn Statement]] pledge to end the tampon tax at the European Union level. The petition platform's CEO cited the campaign as an example of successful [[clicktivism]],&lt;ref name="Clicktivism"/&gt; with over 320,000 signatures.&lt;ref name="BBC: wiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind_student"/&gt; In March 2016, Parliament created legislation to eliminate the tampon VAT.&lt;ref name="Ind_Cameron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC: wiki"/&gt; It was expected to go into effect by April 2018 but did not do so; several British women protested for it publicly while displaying blood stains from their periods.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; On the 3rd October 2018, new EU VAT rules that will allow the UK to stop taxing sanitary products were approved by the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobarik: UK one step closer to ending the tampon tax |url= http://conservativeeurope.com/news/mobarik-uk-a-step-closer-to-ending-the-tampon-tax|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament|date=3 October 2018|author=Nosheena Mobarik }}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Scotland====

In July 2017, a pilot program began in Scotland to have free sanitary products available at schools and food banks for women who cannot afford them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/access-sanitary-products-aberdeen-pilot-evaluation-report/pages/2/|title=Access to sanitary products Aberdeen pilot: evaluation report - gov.scot|website=www.gov.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot scheme was launched for six months in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], with £42,500 of funding from the devolved [[Scottish Government]] in order to address the growing scandal of "period poverty". It was believed 1,000 girls would benefit from the scheme, as there were reports of teenage girls using tissues, toilet roll, torn T-shirts and even newspaper as makeshift sanitary products, with some girls even skipping school altogether. It was decided to launch the scheme to improve attainment and school attendance, as well as improve confidence amongst teenage girls during their period; and Scotland is believed to be the first country in the world to give out free sanitary products as part of a government-sponsored initiative.

Further to this half year pilot program, Scotland's opposition Labour Party intends to introduce a bill to make this permanent. Scotland is the first country to ban period poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-hampshire-43148080/period-poverty-helping-homeless-and-vulnerable-women |title=Period poverty: Helping homeless and vulnerable women - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2018-02-26 |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the WHO and UNICEF showed that one out of five women in Scotland have been forced to improvise with items including toilet paper and old clothes due to the high cost of commercial products.

In the United States, almost all states tax "tangible individual property" but exempt non-luxury "necessities": groceries, [[medical prescription|prescriptions]], [[prosthetics]], agriculture supplies, and sometimes clothes—the exemptions vary between states.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; Five states do not have a state sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon), and {{As of|2018|11|lc=yes}}, ten states specifically exempted essential hygiene products (Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, and Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/these-are-the-u-s-states-that-tax-women-for-having-per-1793848102|title=These are the U.S. states that tax women for having periods|last=Hillin|first=Taryn|work=Splinter|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ktnv.com/news/national/democracy-2018/election-results-2018-nevada-ballot-questions-1-6|title=Election Results 2018: Nevada Ballot Questions 1-6|work=KNTV|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., most states charge sales tax for women's pads and tampons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten states have dropped the tampon tax — Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida, according to NPR and CNN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diaz |first=Andrea |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/07/health/nevada-tampon-tax-repealed-trnd/index.html |title=Nevada becomes the 10th state to eliminate 'pink tax' on menstrual products |publisher=CNN |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven other states have introduced such legislation, most recently Nebraska, Virginia and Arizona. In January 2018, California rejected a proposal to eliminate tampon tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=2 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many federal assistance programs such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and WIC (Women, Infants and Children) don’t allow the use of an EBT for products such as pads or tampons despite the products' classification as medical devices.  The IRS does not classify female products as medical devices, thus blocking women from buying them with pre-tax dollars in both flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2018/08/14/lack-feminine-hygiene-products-keeps-girls-out-school/948313002/|title=Teen girls are missing school because they don't have access to feminine hygiene products|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some changes to the tampon taxes but most of these changes are state level or by city. On a smaller scale, individual cities have also changed their laws in favor of eliminating the tampon tax. 

==== California ====
California Assemblywoman [[Cristina Garcia (politician)|Cristina Garcia]] reported that California women each pay roughly [[US$]]7 per month over 40 years, constituting US$20 million in annual taxes. Garcia and [[Ling Ling Chang]] proposed a bill to remove the tampon tax in early 2016. At this period, only a handful of the country's states exempted tampons, and several others had no state sales tax. Garcia held that women were taxed "for being women" and bore an economic burden for having no other choice but to buy these products. Garcia and Chang added that the tax was "regulatory discrimination" that disproportionately affected poor women and women of color, and that it likely persisted due to [[taboo|social taboos]] against discussing menstruation.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; Both houses of the [[California State Legislature]] voted to exempt tampons from taxation in June 2016,&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt; but the bill was vetoed by the state's governor, [[Jerry Brown]], three months later.&lt;ref name="Reuters: Cali veto"/&gt;

California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed AB-1561 due to the potential loss of money in taxing feminine hygiene products. In response, Cristina Garcia co-authored AB-0479: Common Cents Tax Reform Act with Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, which is a new measure outlining a solution to offset the feminine product and diaper tax exemption by increasing the tax on hard liquor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/13/theres-no-happy-hour-for-menstruation-tax-liquor-instead-of-tampons-lawmakers-say/?utm_term=.f1b7dfe6354e|title='There's no happy hour for menstruation': Tax liquor instead of tampons, lawmakers say|last=Phillips|first=Kristine|date=March 13, 2017|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 California State Legislature passed AB 10 requiring public middle schools and high schools where at least 40% of students meet the federal poverty level to stock half of the restrooms with free tampons and sanitary napkins. The law was passed in an effort to eliminate the cost burden and keep low-income students in schools during their menstrual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB10|title=Bill Text  - AB-10 Feminine hygiene products: public school restrooms.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/TA/AC/PL/tier1.asp|title=Tier I Schools - Persistently Lowest-Achieving Schools (CA Dept of Education)|website=www.cde.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies involved in supplying the necessary feminine hygiene products (tampons and pads) for complete menstrual care in the restrooms of schools include WAXIE and Hospeco. They also supply various options for menstrual product dispensers that have a time delay mechanism to prevent products from being overused and/or abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.waxie.com/ab10-menstrual-care|title=AB10 Menstrual Care {{!}} Waxie Sanitary Supply|last=Supply|first=WAXIE Sanitary|website=info.waxie.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hospeco.com/assets/user/documents/HSC_school_rules_L-HSC-0113-S_online.pdf|title=Do you know the new school rules?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hospeco.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New York ====
In July 2016, New York State exempted feminine hygiene products from taxation, reducing the state's tax revenue by an estimated US$10 million annually.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY" /&gt; Connecticut and Illinois also removed their tax in 2016, with Florida following suit in 2017.&lt;ref name="BBC_Why" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff_Florida" /&gt;

==== New Jersey ====
A 2018 empirical study on New Jersey's 2005 tax break on menstrual products found that "repealing tampon taxes removes an unequal tax burden and could make menstrual hygiene products more accessible for low-income consumers."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cotropia|first=Christopher Anthony|last2=Rozema|first2=Kyle|date=2017|title=Who Would Benefit from Repealing Tampon Taxes? Empirical Evidence from New Jersey|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2999970|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|language=en|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2999970|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study utilized data from more than 16,000 purchases in 2004-2006 made in New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, using these latter nearby states as the control group. Through a differences-in-differences approach, they found that after the repeal, consumer prices on menstrual products decreased by 7.3%, relative to the control states. This was greater than the 6.9% sales tax, suggesting that the consumers benefitted from the tax break. Upon further analysis, the study also found that the decrease in consumer prices was greater for low-income consumers than high-income consumers (3.9% decrease versus 12.4% decrease).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This suggests that low-income consumers received the most benefit from the tax break, while high-income consumers shared the benefit with producers of menstrual products.

== Activism ==

Supporters of the exemption of said taxes are calling their efforts "menstrual equity", explaining it as a social movement that strives for feminine products like tampons to be considered necessities. Things that are considered necessities, for example toilet paper, are not taxed. Activists are often being led by members of government. Councilwomen Julissa Ferreras-Copeland led a movement with a tampon tax pilot project ultimately providing free pads and tampons at a local high school in Queens, New York. Ferreras-Copeland's effort has now been expanded into 25 different schools around New York City. Other democrats including Ydanis Rodriguez and council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito are advocating for state legislature to stop taxing sanitary products. 

Free the Tampon, an advocate for free menstrual products estimates that it would cost less than $5 a year per user to provide tampons and pads in restrooms at schools and businesses. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/new-york-city-bill-to-call-for-free-tampons-in-public-restrooms-shelters-and-jails/|title=New York City Bill to Call for Free Tampons in Public School Restrooms, Shelters and Jails|last=Rabin|first=Roni Caryn|work=Well|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;) is the delivery of [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] services over [[telecommunication network]]s and the internet. Most types of [[Service (economics)|services]] fall into two categories: clinical assessment (the patient's functional abilities in his or her environment), and [[medical therapy|clinical therapy]]. Some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are: [[neuropsychology]], [[speech-language pathology]], [[audiology]], [[occupational therapy]], and [[physical therapy]]. Telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a [[clinic]] because the patient has a [[disability]] or because of travel time. Telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance.

Most telerehabilitation is highly visual. As of 2006 the most commonly used modalities are via [[webcam]]s, [[videoconferencing]], [[phone line]]s, [[videophone]]s and webpages containing [[rich Internet applications]]. The visual nature of telerehabilitation technology limits the types of rehabilitation services that can be provided. It is most widely used for [[neuropsychological rehabilitation]]; fitting of rehabilitation equipment such as [[wheelchair]]s, [[Brace (orthopaedic)|braces]] or [[artificial limb]]s; and in speech-language pathology. Rich internet applications for neuropsychological rehabilitation (aka [[cognitive rehabilitation]]) of cognitive impairment (from many etiologies) was first introduced in 2001. This endeavor has recently (2006) expanded as a [[teletherapy]] application for cognitive skills enhancement programs for school children. [[Tele-audiology]] (hearing assessments) is a growing application. As of 2006, telerehabilitation in the practice of occupational therapy and physical therapy are very limited, perhaps because these two disciplines are more "hands on".

Two important areas of telerehabilitation research are (1) demonstrating equivalence of assessment and therapy to in-person assessment and therapy, and (2) building new data collection systems to digitize information that a therapist can use in practice. Ground-breaking research in [[telehaptics]] (the sense of touch) and virtual reality may broaden the scope of telerehabilitation practice, in the future.

In the United States, the [[National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research]]'s (NIDRR)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031011114426/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr |date=2003-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; supports research and the development of telerehabilitation. NIDRR's grantees include the "Rehabilitation Engineering and Research Center" (RERC) at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]], the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington DC. Other federal funders of research are the Veterans Administration, the Health Services Research Administration in the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense. Outside the United States, excellent research is conducted in Australia and Europe.

As of 2006, only a few health insurers in the United States will [[reimburse]] for telerehabilitation services. If the research shows that [[tele-assessment]]s and [[tele-therapy]] are equivalent to clinical encounters, it is more likely that [[insurer]]s and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] will cover telerehabilitation services.

==History==
In 1999, D.M. Angaran published "Telemedicine and Telepharmacy: Current Status and Future Implications" in the [[American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy]]. He provided a comprehensive history of [[telecommunications]], the [[internet]] and [[telemedicine]] since the 1950s. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) and the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) spearheaded the technology in the [[United States]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[space program]]; both agencies continue to fund advances in telemedicine.

Three early adopters of telemedicine were [[state penitentiary system]]s, [[rural health care system]]s, and the [[radiology]] profession. Telemedicine makes business sense for the states because they do not have to pay for security escorts to have a [[prison]]er receive care outside the prison.

Rural telemedicine in the United States is heavily subsidized through federal agency [[Grant (money)|grants]] for telecommunications operations. Most of this funding comes through the [[Health Services Research Administration]] and the [[Department of Commerce]]. Some state [[universities]] have obtained state funding to operate [[tele-clinic]]s in rural areas. As of 2006, few (if any) of these programs are known to financially break-even, mostly because the Medicare program for people over age 65 (the largest payer) is very restrictive about paying for telehealth.

In contrast, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] is relatively active in using telemedicine for people with disabilities. There are several programs that provide annual physical exams or monitoring and consultation for veterans with spinal cord injuries. Similarly, some state [[Medicaid]] programs (for poor people and people with disabilities) have pilot programs using telecommunications to connect rural practitioners with subspecialty therapists. A few [[school district]]s in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Hawaii]] offer school-based rehabilitation therapy using therapy assistants who are directed by a remote therapist. The [[MedStar National Rehabilitation Hospital|National Rehabilitation Hospital]] in [[Washington DC]] and [[Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute]] in [[Minneapolis]] provided assessment and evaluations to patients living in [[Guam]] and [[American Samoa]]. Cases included post-[[stroke]], post-[[polio]], [[autism]], and wheel-chair fitting.

An argument can be made that "telerehabilitation" began in 1998 when NIDRR funded the first RERC on tele-rehabilitation. It was awarded to a consortium of biomedical engineering departments at the National Rehabilitation Hospital and [[The Catholic University of America]], both located in Washington, DC; the Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute in Minnesota; and the [[East Carolina University]] in [[North Carolina]]. Some of this early research work, and its motivation, is reviewed in Winters (2002). The [[State of Science Conference]] held in 2002 convened most of military and civilian clinicians, engineers, and government officials interested in using telecommunications as a modality for rehabilitation assessment and therapy; a summary is provided in Rosen, Winters &amp; Lauderdale (2002). The conference was attended by the incoming president of the [[American Telemedicine Association]] (ATA). This led to an invitation by ATA to the conference attendees to form a special interest group on telerehabilitation. NIDRR funded the second 5-year RERC on telerehabilitation in 2004, awarding it to the University of Pittsburgh. This RERC was renewed in 2010.

In 2001, O. Bracy, a neuropsychologist, introduced the first web based, rich internet application, for the telerehabilitation presentation of cognitive rehabilitation therapy. This system first provides the subscriber clinician with an economical means of treating their own patients over the internet. Secondly, the system then provides, directly to the patient, the therapy prescription set up and controlled by the member clinician. All applications and response data are transported via the internet in real time. The patient can login to do their therapy from home, the library or anywhere they have access to an internet computer. In 2006, this system formed the basis of a new system designed as a cognitive skills enhancement program for school children. Individual children or whole classrooms can participate in this program over the internet.

In 2006, M.J. McCue and S.E. Palsbo published an article in the [[Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare]] that explored how telemedicine can become a profitable business for hospitals. They argue that telerehabilitation should be expanded so that people with disabilities and people in pain (perhaps after [[hip-replacement surgery]] or people with [[arthritis]]) can get the rehabilitative therapy they need. It is unethical to limit paymente for telerehabilitation services only to patients in rural areas.

Research in telerehabilitation is in its infancy, with only a handful of equivalence trials. As of 2006, most peer-reviewed research in telemedicine are case reports of pilot programs or new equipment. Rehabilitation researchers need to conduct many more controlled experiments and present the evidence to clinicians (and payers) that telerehabilitation is clinically effective. The discipline of speech-language pathology is far head of occupational therapy and physical therapy in demonstrating equivalence over various types of telecommunications equipment.

== Technologies ==

# [[Plain old telephone service]] (POTS) with [[videophone]]s/phones in telerehabilitation
#: There are several types of connections used with real time exchanges. Plain old telephone service (POTS) uses standard [[analog transmission|analog]] [[telephone line]]s. Videophones are used with POTS lines and include a [[camera]], [[Display device|display screen]], and [[telephone]]. Videophones use telephone lines that are available in most homes, so are easy to set up; however small display screens make them problematic for individuals with vision problems. This can be solved by using a large screen or [[television]] as a screen.
# [[Videotelephony]]/Videotelephony in telerehabilitation
#:The use of improved quality video-assisted telecommunication devices, such as [[videoconferencing]], [[webcam]]s and [[telepresence]] to assist in treatments.
# [[Virtual reality]]/[[Virtual reality in telerehabilitation]]
#: Virtual reality in telerehabilitation is one of the newest tools available in that area. This computer technology allows the development of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] virtual environments.
# Motion technology/Motion technology in telerehabilitation
# Web-based approaches/Web-based approaches in telerehabilitation
#: Applications that run over the internet, just as if they were installed in your computer (called Rich Internet Applications), represent a new direction in software development. A person subscribes to the website rather than purchase the software. Any updates or changes to the software system are instantly available to all subscribers. The applications can be accessed from any location where one has access to an internet connected computer. Likewise, a patient's data is accessible from where ever the therapist is located. Neither the application nor the patient's data is tied to one computer.

===Speech-language pathology===
The clinical services provided by speech-language pathology readily lend themselves to telerehabilitation applications due to the emphasis on auditory and visual communicative interaction between the client and the clinician. As a result, the number of telerehabilitation applications in speech-language pathology tend to outnumber those in other allied health professions. To date, applications have been developed to assess and/or treat acquired adult [[speech and language disorders]], [[stuttering]], [[voice disorders]], speech disorders in children, and [[swallowing dysfunction]]. The technology involved in these applications has ranged from the simple telephone (Plain Old Telephone System – POTS) to the use of dedicated Internet-based videoconferencing systems.

Early applications to assess and treat acquired adult speech and language disorders involved the use of the telephone to treat patients with aphasia and motor speech disorders (Vaughan, 1976, Wertz, et al., 1987), a computer controlled video [[laserdisc]] over the telephone and a [[closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]] television system to assess speech and language disorders (Wertz et al., 1987), and a satellite-based videoconferencing system to assess patients in rural areas (Duffy, Werven &amp; Aronson, 1997). More recent applications have involved the use of sophisticated Internet-based videoconferencing systems with dedicated [[software]] which enable the assessment of language disorders (Georgeadis, Brennan, Barker, &amp; Baron, 2004, Brennan, Georgeadis, Baron &amp; Barker, 2004) and the assessment and treatment of motor speech disorders (Hill, Theodoros, Russell, Cahill, Ward, Clark, 2006; Theodoros, Constantinescu, Russell, Ward, Wilson &amp; Wootton, in press) following [[brain impairment]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. Collectively, these studies have revealed positive treatment outcomes, while assessment and diagnoses have been found to be comparable to face-to-face evaluations.

The treatment of stuttering has been adapted to a telerehabilitation environment with notable success. Two Australian studies (Harrison, Wilson &amp; Onslow, 1999; Wilson, Onslow &amp; Lincoln, 2004) involving the distance delivery of the [[Lidcombe program]] to children who stutter have utilized the telephone in conjunction with [[offline]] video recordings to successfully treat several children. Overall, the parents and children responded positively to the program delivered at a distant. Using a high speed videoconferencing system link, Sicotte, Lehoux, Fortier-Blanc and Leblanc (2003) assessed and treated six children and adolescents with a positive reduction in the frequency of dysfluency that was maintained six months later. In addition, a videoconferencing platform has been used successfully to provide follow-up treatment to an adult who had previously received intensive therapy (Kully, 200).

Reports of telerehabilitation applications in [[paediatric]] speech and language disorders are sparse. A recent Australian pilot study has investigated the feasibility of an Internet-based assessment of speech disorder in six children (Waite, Cahill, Theodoros, Russell, Busuttin, in press). High levels of agreement between the online and face-to-face clinicians for [[single-word articulation]], [[speech intelligibility]], and [[oro-motor task]]s were obtained suggesting that the Internet-based protocol had the potential to be a reliable method for assessing paediatric speech disorders.

Voice therapy across a variety of types of voice disorders has been shown to be effectively delivered via a telerehabilitation application. Mashima et al. (2003) using PC based videoconferencing and speech analysis software compared 23 patients treated online with 28 persons treated face-to-face. The authors reported positive post treatment results with no significant difference in measures between the traditional and videoconferencing group, suggesting that the majority of traditional voice therapy techniques can be applied to distance treatment.

Although obvious limitations exist, telerehabilitation applications for the assessment of swallowing function have also been used with success. Lalor, Brown and Cranfield (2000) were able to obtain an initial assessment of the nature and extent of swallowing dysfunction in an adult via a videoconferencing link although a more complete evaluation was restricted due to the inability to physically determine the degree of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] movement. A more sophisticated telerehabilitation application for the assessment of swallowing was developed by Perlman and Witthawaskul (2002) who described the use of real-time videofluoroscopic examination via the Internet. This system enabled the capture and display of images in real-time with only a three to five second delay.

There continues to be a need for ongoing research to develop and validate the use of telerehabilitation applications in speech-language pathology in a greater number and variety of adult and paediatric communication and swallowing disorders.

'''Translational research informatics''' ('''TRI''') is a sister domain to or a sub-domain of [[biomedical informatics]] or [[medical informatics]] concerned with the application of [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] theory and methods to [[translational research]]. There is some overlap with the related domain of [[clinical research informatics]], but TRI is more concerned with enabling multi-disciplinary research to accelerate clinical outcomes, with [[clinical trials]] often being the natural step beyond translational research. 

[[Translational research]] as defined by the National Institutes of Health includes two areas of translation. One is the process of applying discoveries generated during research in the laboratory, and in preclinical studies, to the development of trials and studies in humans. The second area of translation concerns research aimed at enhancing the adoption of best practices in the community. Cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies is also an important part of translational research.

== Overview ==

Translational research informatics can be described as "an integrated software solution to manage the: (i) logistics, (ii) data integration, and (iii) collaboration, required by translational investigators and their supporting institutions". It is the class of informatics systems that sits between and often interoperates with: (i) [[health information technology]]/[[electronic medical record]] systems, (ii) [[CTMS]]/[[clinical research informatics]], and (iii) [[statistical analysis]] and [[data mining]]. 

Translational research informatics is relatively new, with most CTSA awardee academic medical centers actively acquiring and integrating systems to enable the end-to-end TRI requirements. One advanced TRI system is being implemented at the [[Windber Research Institute]] in collaboration with GenoLogics and [[InforSense]]. Translational Research Informatics systems are expected to rapidly develop and evolve over the next couple of years.

It has been practiced in Africa ([[Mozambique]], [[South Africa]]&lt;ref name=jwh/&gt;), Asia ([[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]]&lt;ref name=jwh&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hull |first1=T |last2=Hilber |first2=AM |last3=Chersich |first3=MF |last4=Bagnol |first4=B |last5=Prohmmo |first5=A |last6=Smit |first6=JA |last7=Widyantoro |first7=N |last8=Utomo |first8=ID |last9=François |first9=I |last10=Tumwesigye |first10=NM |last11=Temmerman |first11=M |last12=WHO GSVP Study |first12=Group. |title=Prevalence, motivations, and adverse effects of vaginal practices in Africa and Asia: findings from a multicountry household survey. |journal=Journal of women's health (2002) |date=July 2011 |volume=20 |issue=7 |pages=1097-109 |doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.2281 |pmid=21668355|display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Central America]] (among the [[Q'eqchi' people]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjqgBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA56|title=Q’eqchi’ Maya Reproductive Ethnomedicine|publisher=Spring|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

It has become a fad for women in the Western world. It is described in spas as an [[Traditional Korean medicine|ancient Korean treatment]] for reproductive organ ailments and is claimed to have other benefits. There is no empirical evidence supporting any of these claims.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"/&gt;

==Prevalence==
According to a study on [[vagina]]l practices by the [[World Health Organization]] published in 2011, one of the ways in which women practice vaginal care is by "Vaginal steaming or smoking: the 'steaming' or 'smoking' of the vagina, by sitting above a source of heat (fire, coals, hot rocks) on which water, herbs, or oils are placed to create steam or smoke".&lt;ref name=jwh/&gt; For that study, over 4,000 women in  Tete (Mozambique), KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa), Yogyakarta (Indonesia), and Chonburi (Thailand) were asked about their vaginal care. When it came to vaginal steaming/smoking, very different results were obtained, and very different reasons were given: in Chonburi, 67% of women reported having performed vaginal steaming or smoking, "which they associated with  maintaining  wellness  and  feminine  identity", especially after [[Postpartum period|having given birth]] (85.5%). In Tete, only 10% of women practiced steaming or smoking, "mostly intended to enhance male sexual pleasure by causing vaginal tightening (64.1% of users) and drying (22.9%)". In the two African locations, 37–38% of women said they practiced it to enhance "male sexual pleasure"; in the two Asian ones, 0% gave that answer. Conversely, of the Asian women 26% reported their "feminine identity" was a reason, compared to 0% of the African women.&lt;ref name=jwh/&gt;

==Risks==
[[Side effect]] and potential dangers include: [[allergic reactions]], [[second-degree burns]] if the steam is too close,&lt;ref name=LiveScience/&gt; and [[vaginal infection]]s.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunter/&gt;

==Society and culture==
===Marketing===
Vaginal steaming is marketed with pseudoscientific notions of "balancing" female hormones and "revitalizing" the [[uterus]] or vagina.&lt;ref name=LiveScience/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/30/sorry-gwyneth-paltrow-but-steaming-your-vagina-is-a-bad-idea|title=Sorry, Gwyneth Paltrow, but steaming your vagina is a bad idea|work=The Guardian|date=30 January 2015|accessdate=9 March 2017|last=Robinson|first=Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunter&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gunter |first1=Jen |title=Gwyneth Paltrow says steam your vagina, an OB/GYN says don’t |url=https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2015/01/27/gwyneth-paltrow-says-steam-your-vagina-an-obgyn-says-dont/ |work=Dr. Jen Gunter Wielding the Lasso of Truth |date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also claimed to: reduce the discomfort, bloating and tiredness associated with [[menstruation]], regulate irregular [[menstrual cycle]]s, treat [[Vaginal yeast infection|yeast infections]], decrease the menstrual blood flow, increase fertility, relieve symptoms of [[menopause]], treat [[endometriosis]], speed up the after-birth healing process.  There is no evidence for any of those claims.&lt;ref name=LiveScience/&gt; 

It is also marketed as "cleaning" the vagina, which it does not do, and which is not necessary.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunter/&gt;

The marketing and perception of vaginal steaming falls within a mix of ideologies including [[post-feminist]], [[new age]], and inherently [[sexist]] notions in which the female body is on the one hand a dirty, defective thing, yet one that a woman can "optimize" to become "goddess-like".&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite article|title='Basically, it's sorcery for your vagina': unpacking Western representations of vaginal steaming |first1=Tycho |last1=Vandenburg |first2=Virginia |last2=Braun |work=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality |volume=19 |number=4 |year=2017|pmid=27719108}} (taking as its title one observer's characterization{{snd}}"Basically, it's sorcery for your vagina") {{cite article|title=I Went To A Spa For My Uterus And This Is My Story |work=Fast Company |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3041307/body-week/i-went-to-a-spa-for-my-uterus-and-this-is-my-story |last=Beck|first=Laura Hopper |date=January 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
