The '''Arecibo message''' is a 1974 [[interstellar radio message]] carrying basic information about humanity and Earth sent to [[Great Globular Cluster in Hercules|globular star cluster M13]] in the hope that [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrial intelligence]] might receive and decipher it. The message was [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] into space a single time via [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] [[radio waves]] at a ceremony to mark the remodeling of the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]] in [[Puerto Rico]] on 16 November 1974.&lt;ref name="phoneet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Nov99/Arecibo.message.ws.html |title=Cornell News: It's the 25th anniversary of Earth's first (and only) attempt to phone E.T. |date=Nov 12, 1999|accessdate=2008-03-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802005337/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Nov99/Arecibo.message.ws.html |archivedate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170628"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Steven |title=Greetings, E.T.

The "ones" and "zeros" were transmitted by frequency shifting at the rate of 10 bits per second. The total broadcast was less than three minutes.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay M. Pasachoff|title=Chapter 20: Life in the Universe|work=Williams.edu|url=http://www.williams.edu/Astronomy/jay/ETU5/chapter20_5th.html| accessdate=2007-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number 1,679 was chosen because it is a [[semiprime]] (the product of two [[prime number]]s), to be [[raster scan|arranged rectangularly]] as 73 rows by 23 columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=John |title=Self-Decoding Messages - The Arecibo Message |url=https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/circulos_cultivos/chilbolton01.htm |website=bibliotecapleyades.net |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:File:AreciboMessageShifted.svg|The alternative arrangement]], 23 rows by 73 columns, produces an unintelligible set of characters (as do all other X/Y formats). The message forms the image shown on the right when translated into graphics, characters, and spaces.&lt;ref name=cassiday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.utah.edu/~cassiday/p1080/lec08.html|title=The Arecibo Message|last=Cassiday|first=George|accessdate=12 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Frank Drake]], then at [[Cornell University]] and creator of the [[Drake equation]], wrote the message with help from [[Carl Sagan]], among others.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt; The message consists of seven parts that encode the following (from the top down):&lt;ref name=cassiday/&gt;
#The numbers one (1) to ten (10) (white)
#The [[atomic numbers]] of the elements [[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[phosphorus]], which make up [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) (purple)
#The [[formula]]s for the [[sugar]]s and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] in the [[nucleotides]] of DNA (green)
#The number of nucleotides in DNA, and a graphic of the double helix structure of DNA (white &amp; blue)
#A graphic figure of a human, the dimension (physical height) of an average man, and the human population of Earth (red,  blue/white, &amp; white respectively)
#A graphic of the [[Solar System]] indicating which of the planets the message is coming from (yellow)
#A graphic of the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]] and the dimension (the physical diameter) of the transmitting antenna dish (purple, white, &amp; blue)

Since it will take nearly 25,000 years for the message to reach its intended destination (and an additional 25,000 years for any reply), the Arecibo message is viewed as a demonstration of human technological achievement, rather than a real attempt to enter into a conversation with extraterrestrials. In fact, the core of M13, to which the message was aimed, will no longer be in that location when the message arrives.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt; However, as the [[proper motion]] of M13 is small, the message will still arrive near the center of the cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science20.com/comments/28100/In_regard_to_the_email_from |title=In regard to the email from |author=Dave Deamer |date=December 4, 2009 |publisher=Science 2.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Cornell News'' press release of November 12, 1999, the real purpose of the message was not to make contact but to demonstrate the capabilities of newly installed equipment.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt;

On 16 November 2018, [[Google]] released a Doodle to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=44th Anniversary of Arecibo Message #GoogleDoodle|url=https://g.co/doodle/7vsgsf|work=[[Google]]}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==

===Numbers===
[[Image:Arecibo message part 1.png|Part 1 — The numbers from 1 to 10|right]]

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9  10
 ----------------------
 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 00 00 00
 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 00 00 10
 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 01 11 01
 X X X X X X X X  X  X &lt;-least-significant-digit marker

The numbers from [[1 (number)|1]] to [[10 (number)|10]] appear in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] format (the bottom row marks the beginning of each number).

Even assuming that recipients would recognize binary, the encoding of the numbers may not be immediately obvious because of the way they have been written. To read the first seven digits, ignore the bottom row, and read them as three binary digits from top to bottom, with the top digit being the most significant. The readings for 8, 9 and 10 are a little different, as they have been given an additional column next to the first (to the right in the image). This is intended to show that numbers too large to fit in a single column can be written in several contiguous ones, where the additional columns do not have the least-significant-digit marker.

=== DNA elements ===

The numbers 1, 6, 7, 8, and 15 appear. These are the [[atomic numbers]] of [[hydrogen]] (H), [[carbon]] (C), [[nitrogen]] (N), [[oxygen]] (O), and [[phosphorus]] (P), the components of DNA.

The [[nucleotides]] are described as sequences of the five atoms that appear on the preceding line. Each sequence represents the [[molecular formula]] of the nucleotide as incorporated into DNA (as opposed to the free form of the nucleotide).

For example, deoxyribose (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O in DNA, C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; when free), the nucleotide in the top left in the image, is read as:

 11000
 10000
 11010
 XXXXX
 -----
 75010

i.e., 7 atoms of hydrogen, 5 atoms of carbon, 0 atoms of nitrogen, 1 atom of oxygen, and 0 atoms of phosphorus.

DNA double [[helix]]; the vertical bar represents the number of nucleotides. The value depicted is around 4.3 billion, which was believed to be the case in 1974 when the message was transmitted. It is currently thought that there are about 3.2 billion base pairs in the human [[genome]].

===Humanity===

 1110 (binary) = 14 (decimal)

 000011 111111 110111 111011 111111 110110 (binary)
 = 4,292,853,750 (decimal)

The element in the center represents a human. The element on the left (in the image) indicates the average height of an adult male: {{cvt|1.764|m|ftin|1}}. This corresponds to the horizontally written binary 14 multiplied by the [[wavelength]] of the message (126&amp;nbsp;mm). The element on the right depicts the size of human population in 1974, around 4.3&amp;nbsp;billion (which, coincidentally, is within 0.1% of the number of DNA nucleotides). In this case, the number is oriented in the data horizontally rather than vertically. The least-significant-digit marker is in the upper left in the image, with bits going to the right and more significant digits below.

===Planets===
[[Image:Arecibo message part 6.png|Part 6 — The Sun and the planets|left]]

The [[solar system]], showing the [[Sun]] and the planets in the order of their position from the [[Sun]]: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and [[Pluto]]. (Pluto has since been [[Pluto#IAU classification|reclassified]] as a [[dwarf planet]] by the [[International Astronomical Union]], but it was still considered a planet at the time the message was transmitted.)

The Earth is the third planet from the [[Sun]]; its graphic is shifted up to identify it as the planet from which the signal was sent. Additionally, the human figure is shown just above the Earth graphic.

In addition to showing position, the graphic provides a general, not-to-scale size reference of each planet and the Sun.

===Telescope===
[[Image:Arecibo message part 7.png|Part 7 — The Arecibo radio telescope|left]]

 bottom two rows:

 &lt;--- 111110X ---&gt;

 100101 111110 (binary) = 2,430 (decimal)

{{clr}}

The last part represents the [[Arecibo radio telescope]] with its [[diameter]]: 2,430 multiplied by the wavelength gives {{cvt|306.18|m|ftin|0}}. In this case, the number is oriented horizontally, with the least-significant-digit marker to the lower right in the image. The part of the image that looks like a letter "M" is there to demonstrate to the reader of the message that the curved line is a [[paraboloid]] mirror.

{{Criminal law}}
An '''assault''' is the act of inflicting physical harm or unwanted physical contact upon a person or, in some specific legal definitions, a threat or attempt to commit such an action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/assault-and-battery-overview.html|title=Assault and Battery Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=criminal.findlaw.com|publisher=|access-date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is both a [[crime]] and a [[tort]] and, therefore, may result in either criminal and/or civil liability. Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and [[Assault (tort)|tort law]]. 

Traditionally, [[common law]] legal systems had separate definitions for assault and '''[[Battery (crime)|battery]]'''. When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into '''assault and battery''', which then became widely referred to as "assault". The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery. The legal systems of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Scots law]] have never distinguished assault from battery.

Legal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity. In the [[United States]], an assault can be charged as either a [[misdemeanor]] or a [[felony]]. In [[England and Wales]] and [[Australia]], it can be charged as either [[common assault]], [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (ABH) or [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH). [[Canada]] also has a three-tier system: assault, [[assault causing bodily harm]] and [[aggravated assault]]. Separate charges typically exist for [[sexual assault]]s, [[affray]] and [[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty|assaulting a police officer]]. Assault may overlap with an [[attempt]]ed crime; for example an assault may be charged as an [[attempted murder]] if it was done with intent to kill.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Related definitions==

===Battery===
In jurisdictions that make a distinction between the two, assault usually accompanies [[Battery (crime)|battery]] if the assailant both threatens to make unwanted contact and then carries through with this threat. See [[common assault]]. The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act&lt;ref&gt;An act is volitional if it is purposeful and deliberate as opposed to reflexive or involuntary (see Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams, ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2012) at p 901. For example. a person who has restless leg syndrome kicks his wife while asleep. The contact, although, harmful, would not constitute battery because the act was not wilful.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact.&lt;ref&gt;A criminal battery may also be committed if the harmful or offensive contact is due to the criminal negligence of the defendant.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting them is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person, and is an assault if the rock misses.

===Aggravated assault===
[[Aggravation (legal concept)|Aggravated]] assault is, in some jurisdictions, a stronger form of assault, usually using a [[deadly weapon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crime in the United States 2010: Aggravated Assault |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/violent-crime/aggravatedassaultmain}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to:
* cause serious bodily injury to another person with a deadly weapon&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Dennis|last2=William|first2=Glanville|title=Textbook of Criminal Law|publisher=London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have sexual relations with a person who is under the age of consent
* cause bodily harm by recklessly operating a [[motor vehicle]] during [[road rage]]; often referred to as either '''vehicular assault''' or '''aggravated assault with a motor vehicle.'''

Aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants.

Although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault:

===Consent===
Exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as [[de minimis]] harm. Assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on, or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others.

[[consent (criminal law)|Consent]] may be a complete or partial defense to assault. In some jurisdictions, most notably England, it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe, as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault.&lt;ref&gt;(RvG ref 6. 1980): see{{cite web|url=http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non+Fatal+Assaults/Consent+R+v+Brown.htm |title=R v Brown (1993) 2 All ER 75 |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016125514/http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non%20Fatal%20Assaults/Consent%20R%20v%20Brown.htm |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic sexual activity]], the most notable case being the [[Operation Spanner]] case. Legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery, activities within the rules of a game ([[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], or [[contact sports]]), bodily adornment (''R v Wilson'' [1996] Crim LR 573), or horseplay (''R v Jones'' [1987] Crim LR 123). However, any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent. In Scottish law, consent is not a defense for assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotHC/1975/1975_JC_30.html|title=''Smart v. H. M. Advocate'', [1975&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ScotHC HCJ_1, 1975 SLT 65, 1975 JC 30.|author=|date=|website=bailii.org|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and other official acts===
[[Police officers]] and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an [[arrest]] or generally carrying out their official duties. Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary.

===Punishment===
In some jurisdictions such as [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[judicial corporal punishment]] is part of the [[legal system]]. The officers who administer the punishment have [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] from prosecution for assault.

In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, [[Corporal punishment in the home#Where corporal punishment in the home is lawful|corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian]] is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable. What constitutes "reasonable" varies in both statutory law and [[case law]]. Unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for [[child abuse]].

Many countries, including some US states, also permit the use of corporal punishment for [[School corporal punishment|children in school]]. In [[English law]], s.&amp;nbsp;58 [[Children Act 2004]] limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s.&amp;nbsp;39 [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

===Prevention of crime===
This may or may not involve self-defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.

===Defense of property===
Some jurisdictions allow force to be used in [[Defence of property|defense of property]], to prevent damage either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] it may be argued that the defendant has a ''lawful excuse'' to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]) subject to the need to deter [[vigilante]]s and excessive self-help. Furthermore, some jurisdictions, such as Ohio, allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder. The resident merely needs to assert to the court that they felt threatened by the intruder's presence.

This defense is not universal: in New Zealand (for example) homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Regional details==

===Canada===
Assault is an offence under s. 265 of the  Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].&lt;ref name=1985-46&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |title=CanLII - Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46 |publisher= |accessdate=10 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430001252/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |archivedate=30 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wide range of the types of assault that can occur. Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent. It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person. An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force. It can be an assault to "tap", "pinch", "push", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.

The potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed. The Criminal Code defines assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence). Police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt; This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.

Some variations on the ordinary crime of assault include:

* Assault: The offence is defined by section 265 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assault with a weapon: Section 267(a) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assault causing bodily harm: See [[assault causing bodily harm]] Section 267(b) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Aggravated assault: Section 268 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assaulting a peace officer, etc.: Section 270 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Sexual assault: Section 271 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Sexual assault with a weapon or threats or causing bodily harm: Section 272 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Aggravated sexual assault: See [[aggravated sexual assault]].

An individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, or any sexual assault. Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon). A person cannot consent to serious bodily harm.

===India===
The Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://devgan.in/ipc/chapter_16.php#s351|title=Indian Penal Code Chapter XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; sections 351 through 358.
{{Quotation|Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.|s.351 of the Indian Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|title=Vakil No1.com - "Indian Penal Code"|accessdate=2 Mar 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205035155/http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|archive-date=5 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Code further explains that "mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give to their gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault". Assault is in Indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force (with criminal force being described in s.350). The attempt itself has been made an offence in India, as in other states.

===Nigeria===
The Criminal Code Act (chapter 29 of Part V; sections 351 to 365) creates a number of offences of assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2029|title=Criminal Code Act-PartV|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assault is defined by section 252 of that Act. Assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment; assault with "intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her" or who indecently assaults another, or who commits other more-serious variants of assault (as defined in the Act) are guilty of a felony, and longer prison terms are provided for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2025|title=Criminal Code Act-PartV|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Islands===
'''Marshall Islands'''

The offence of assault is created by section 113 of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cc94/ Criminal Code [31 MIRC Ch 1&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413025838/http://www.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cc94/ |date=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person is guilty of this offence if they unlawfully offer or attempt, with force or violence, to strike, beat, wound, or do bodily harm to, another.

===Republic of Ireland===
Section 2 of the [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]] creates the offence of assault, and section 3 of that Act creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

===South Africa===
[[South African law]] does not draw the distinction between assault and battery. ''Assault'' is a [[common law crime]] defined as "unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another, or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him". The law also recognises the crime of ''assault with intent to cause [[grievous bodily harm]]'', where grievous bodily harm is defined as "harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Milton |title=South African Criminal Law and Procedure: Common-law crimes |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta &amp; Co |year=1996 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-7021-3773-0 |pages=405–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common law crime of ''[[indecent assault]]'' was repealed by the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]], and replaced by a statutory crime of ''[[sexual assault]]''.

===United Kingdom===

For the meaning of "assault" in this provision, see Logdon v. DPP [1976] Crim LR 121, [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|DC]]. This offence was abolished and replaced by the [[Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005]].

It related to officers of the [[Serious Organized Crime Agency]] and was repealed when that agency was abolished.

====England and Wales====
{{See also|Battery (crime)#England and Wales}}

English law provides for two offences of assault: [[common assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]]. Assault (or common assault) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. ''Violence'' in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile. Confusingly, the terms "assault" and "common assault" often encompass the separate offence of [[battery (crime)|battery]], even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

A [[common assault]] is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty. Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the [[Crown Court]]). Additionally, if a Defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the Defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.

=====Aggravated assaults=====
An assault which is aggravated by the scale of the injuries inflicted may be charged as offences causing "actual bodily harm" (ABH) or, in the severest cases, "[[grievous bodily harm]]" (GBH).
;[[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]]: The offence of is created by section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;Inflicting [[grievous bodily harm]]: Also referred to as "malicious wounding" or "unlawful wounding". This offence is created by section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.
;Causing grievous bodily harm with intent: Also referred to as "wounding with intent". This offence is created by section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

Other aggravated assault charges refer to assaults carried out against a specific target or with a specific intent:
;Assault with intent to rob: The penalty for [[assault with intent to rob]], a common law offence, is provided by section 8(2) of the [[Theft Act 1968]].
;Racially or religiously aggravated common assault: This offence is created by section 29(1)(c) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].
;Racially or religiously aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm: This offence is created by section 29(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].
;Assault with intent to resist arrest: The offence of [[assault with intent to resist arrest]] is created by section 38 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;[[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty]]: Section 89(1) of the [[Police Act 1996]] provides that it is an offence for a person to assault either:
:*a [[constable]] acting in the execution of his duty; or
:*a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.
;Assaulting a traffic officer: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/18/section/10 section 10(1)] of the [[Traffic Management Act 2004]].
;Assaulting a person designated or accredited under sections 38 or 39 or 41 or 41A of the Police Reform Act 2002: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/section/46 section 46(1)] of the [[Police Reform Act 2002]]. Those sections relate respectively to persons given police powers by a chief police officer, detention contractors retained by police, accredited contractors under a community safety accreditation scheme, and weights and measures inspectors.
;Assault on a prison custody officer: This offence is created by section 90(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]] (c.53).
;Assault on a secure training centre custody officer: This offence is created by section 13(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] (c.33).
;Assault on officer saving wreck: This offence is created by section 37 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;Assaulting an officer of the court: This offence is created by section 14(1)(b) of the [[County Courts Act 1984]].
;Cruelty to persons under sixteen: Section 1(1) of the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]] provides that it is an offence for a person who has attained the age of sixteen years, and who has responsibility for a child or young person under that age, to, amongst other things, wilfully assault that child or young person, or to cause or procure that child or young person to be assaulted, in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health.
;Sexual assault: The offence of [[Sexual assault#England and Wales|sexual assault]] created by section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. It is not defined in terms of the offences of common assault or battery. It instead requires intentional touching and the absence of a reasonable belief in consent.

====Scotland====
In [[Scots Law]], assault is defined as an "attack upon the person of another".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Criminal Law'' (5th edn, 1948) p.155&lt;/ref&gt; There is no distinction made in Scotland between assault and battery (which is not a term used in Scots law), although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a ''physical'' attack on another's person, as demonstrated in ''Atkinson v. [[Lord Advocate|HM Advocate]]''&lt;ref&gt;1987 SCCR 534&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a [[ski mask]]. The court said:

{{quote|[A]n assault may be constituted by threatening gestures sufficient to produce alarm|Atkinson v. HM Advocate (1987)}}

Scottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or ''Hamesuken'' (to assault a person in their own home). The ''[[mens rea]]'' for assault is simply "evil intent",&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, op. cit, p.155; Smart v. HM Advocate 1975 JC 30&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been held to mean no more than that assault "cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently" as upheld in ''[[Lord Advocate's Reference]] No 2 of 1992'' where it was found that a "hold-up" in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.

It is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of their duty, under  Section 90, Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 (previously Section 41 of the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]]) which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of their duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of their duty.

====Northern Ireland====
Several offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland. The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] creates the offences of:
* Common assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 42;
* Aggravated assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 43
* Common assault: under section 47
* Assault occasioning actual bodily harm: under section 47
The [[Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968]] creates the offences of:
* Assault with intent to resist arrest: under section 7(1)(b); this offence was formerly created by s.38 of the OAPA 1861.

That Act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'. under section 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998]] (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

=== Australia ===
The term 'assault', when used in legislation, commonly refers to both common assault and battery, even though the two offences remain distinct. Common assault involves intentionally or recklessly causing a person to apprehend the imminent infliction of unlawful force, whilst battery refers to the actual infliction of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|431|2004|litigants=Darby v DPP |parallelcite=(2004) 61 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 558 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state has legislation relating to the act of assault, and offences against the act that constitute assault are heard in the Magistrates Court of that state or indictable offences are heard in a District or Supreme Court of that State. The legislation that defines assault of each state outline what the elements are that make up the assault, where the assault is sectioned in legislation or criminal codes, and the penalties that apply for the offence of assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/4274/assault-laws-in-australia-definitions-and-defences.aspx|title=Assault Laws in Australia: Definitions and Defences|website=www.findlaw.com.au|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, the Crimes Act 1900&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900}}.&lt;/ref&gt; defines a range of assault offences deemed more serious than common assault and which attract heavier penalties. These include:

====Assault with further specific intent====
* Acts done to the person with intent to murder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wounding or grievous bodily harm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use or possession of a weapon to resist arrest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|33B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assault causing certain injuries====
* Actual bodily harm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|59}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the term is not defined in the ''Crimes Act'', but case law indicates actual bodily harm may include injuries such as bruises and scratches,&lt;ref name="AustLII"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|305|2009|litigants=R v McIntyre |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as psychological injuries &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|442|2005|litigants=Li v R |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; if the injury inflicted is more than merely transient (the injury does not necessarily need to be permanent)&lt;ref&gt;''R v Donovan'' [1934] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 498; [http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/cases/NZPoliceLawRp/1934/8.pdf (1934) 5 New Zealand Police Law Reports 247].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Felony Sentences in State Courts.pdf|thumb|Felony Sentences in State Courts, study by the United States Department of Justice.]]

In the United States,{{where|date=September 2018}}&lt;!-- federal? some states? all states and territories? including Louisiana which did not incorporate English common law? --&gt; assault may be defined as an attempt to commit a [[battery (crime)|battery]]. However, the crime of assault can encompass acts in which no battery is intended, but the defendant's act nonetheless creates reasonable fear in others that a battery will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are the Crimes of Assault and Battery|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/assault-and-battery|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault is typically treated as a [[misdemeanor]] and not as a [[felony]] (unless the victim is a [[Police|law enforcement]] officer){{fact|date=September 2018}}, or in New York State for example if the offender is a repeat offender. As a misdemeanor, however, it can still result in incarceration and in a criminal record. The more serious crime of aggravated assault is treated as a felony.

Four elements were required at [[common law]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atoki|first1=Morayo|title=Assault and S 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law|date=1995|volume=59|issue=3|page=301|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002201839505900307}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The apparent, present ability to carry out;
# An unlawful attempt;
# To commit a violent injury; 
# Upon another.

Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person. The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault. In common law states an assault is not committed by merely, for example, swearing at another; without threat of battery, there can be no assault.

As the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice. These four elements were eventually codified in most states.

Laws on assault vary by state. Since each state has its own criminal laws, there is no universal assault law. Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[menacing]], [[intimidation]], [[reckless endangerment]], etc. in another state. Modern American statutes may define assault as including:
* an attempt to cause or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another

The laws on assault differ significantly from state to state as demonstrated below.

In [[Kansas]] the law on assault states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_21/Article_34/ |title=KS Statutes: Ch 21 Article 34: Crimes Against Persons |date=2007-11-14 |access-date=2016-09-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114225316/http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_21/Article_34/ |archivedate=14 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Assault is intentionally placing another person in reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.}}

In [[New York State]], assault (as defined in the New York State Penal Code Article 120)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/120.05|title=Article 120 - NY Penal Law - Assault Menacing Stalking - Law|publisher=New York State Senate|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires an actual injury. Other states define this as battery; there is no crime of battery in New York. However, in New York if a person threatens another person with imminent injury without engaging in physical contact, that is called "menacing". A person who engages in that behavior is guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree (a [[misdemeanor|Class A misdemeanor]]; punishable with up to one year [[incarceration]], [[probation]] for an extended time, and a permanent [[criminal record]]) when they threaten to cause physical harm to another person, and guilty of aggravated harassment in the first degree (a [[Class E felony]]) if they have a previous conviction for the same offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-240-30.html|title=New York Consolidated Laws, Penal Law - PEN § 240.30 - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=findlaw.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-harassment-laws.html|title=New York Harassment Laws - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=findlaw.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/opinion/when-is-a-threat-a-criminal-act.html|title=Opinion - When Is a Threat a Criminal Act?|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.new-york-lawyers.org/second-degree-aggravated-harassment.html|title=Second Degree Aggravated Harassment|author=|date=|website=The Law Office of Crotty &amp; Saland|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York also has specific laws against [[hazing]], when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization.

[[North Dakota]] law states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t12-1c17.pdf?20130902151232|title=North Dakota Century Code t12.1c17|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Simple assault.

In [[Tennessee]] assault is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/tncode/|title=LexisNexis® Custom Solution: Tennessee Code Research Tool|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*(2) Intentionally or knowingly causes another to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury; or
*(3) Intentionally or knowingly causes physical contact with another and a reasonable person would regard the contact as extremely offensive or provocative.}}}}

States vary on whether it is possible to commit an "attempted assault" since it can be considered a double [[inchoate offense]].

In some states, [[consent (criminal law)|consent]] is a complete defense to assault. In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a ''petty misdemeanor''.

Furthermore, the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be human. Thus, there is no assault if an ox gores a man. However, the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act|Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004]] treats the [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances. See [http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/unbornvictims/UVVAEnrolled.pdf H.R. 1997 / P.L. 108-212].

Some possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are:
* A defendant could argue that since they were drunk, they could not form the [[specific intent]] to commit assault. This defense would most likely fail, however, since only involuntary [[intoxication defense|intoxication]] is accepted as a defense in most American jurisdictions.
* A defendant could also argue that they were engaged in mutually consensual behavior.

===Ancient Greece===
Assault in Ancient Greece was normally termed [[hubris]]. Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening [[pride]], self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution. In Ancient Greece, "hubris" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well. It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.

Violations of the law against hubris included, what would today be termed, assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.&lt;ref&gt;MacDowell (1976) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first, Meidias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against Konon) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.

Hubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens. It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world. That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved. The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, "outrageous treatment", in general.

The meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws. Such an act may be referred to as an "act of hubris", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic. [[Atë]], Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of their hubris, or great pride, that leads to their death or downfall.

Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (timē) and shame. The concept of timē included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honor is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of "insolence, contempt, and excessive violence".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37754">'''Communicative ecology''' is a conceptual model used in the field of media and communications research. 

The model is used to analyse and represent the relationships between [[social interaction]]s, [[discourse]], and communication [[Media (communication)|media]] and technology of individuals, collectives and networks in physical and digital environments. Broadly, the term communicative ecology refers to "the context in which [[communication]] processes occur" [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007, p. 9)]]. These processes are seen to involve people communicating with others in their [[social network]]s, both face-to-face and using a mix of media and communication technologies [[#Tacchi2003|(Tacchi, Slater &amp; Hearn, 2003)]] [[#Tacchi2007|(Tacchi, et al. 2007)]]. 

== Rationale ==
The communicative ecology model enables researchers to take a holistic approach to understanding the dynamic interrelationships between social dimensions, discourse and communications technology in both physical and digital environments. The use of an ecological metaphor markedly expands the potential sphere of inquiry for communications and media research. It shifts the focus away from studies focusing on single communications devices or applications, for example the mobile telephone or email, towards whole system interactions. Consequently, it extends the possibility of research into population change and lifecycles, spatiotemporal dynamics, networks and clusters, and power relations within the frame of a communicative ecology. Also, as ecologies are not isolated entities, further questions regarding the similarities, differences, interrelationships and transactions between ecologies can be examined. A richer understanding can then be derived from micro and macro level analysis of the social and cultural context of communication [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]].

The concept of communicative ecology has emerged amidst concerns that studies attempting to identify causal relationships between discrete technologies and social impacts neglect variables that are salient to the successful implementation and uptake of technologies ''in situ'' [[#Dourish2004|(Dourish, 2004)]]. This mirrors the way in which the biological field of [[ecology]] emerged from the perceived inadequacies of studies of single species of flora and fauna. In a similar way, researchers who use the communicative ecology framework argue that media technologies should not be examined independent of their context of use. They assert that [[new media]] must be both studied and designed with reference to the users' wider set of social relationships, the nature of the communication itself and other media in use. Through use of [[ethnography|ethnographic approaches]] a richer, more nuanced understanding of the communicative system of a given setting is able to be developed.

New media are usually introduced into existing communication structures and must compete for attention in relation to the users' existing portfolio of communication tools. Consequently, if a new communication technology does not complement or enhance the existing toolset it risks rejection. The communicative ecology model allows researchers to examine how a new form of media or technology may or may not be integrated into existing communication patterns [[#Tacchi2006|(Tacchi, 2006)]].

However, the potential utility of the communicative ecology model is far broader than this. Any new form of social intervention, content or technology must be locally appropriate for it to succeed [[#Tacchi2006|(Tacchi, 2006)]]. Hence, the communicative ecology framework is useful for [[human-computer interaction]] designers, content creators, and in [[urban informatics]], [[urban planning]], [[community development]] and [[education]] when seeking opportunities to enhance or augment local, social, and communication practices.

==History and usage==
The concept of communicative ecology is derived from Altheide's "ecology of communication" [[#Altheide1994|(1994;]][[#Altheide1995|1995)]]. Altheide developed this concept to examine the mutually influential relationships between information technology, communication formats and social activities, within the context of people's social and physical environments, as they define and experience them. The concept is influenced by [[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan's]] [[#McLuhan1962|(1962)]] research on [[media ecology]], which demonstrates that new media and technology can influence communicative content, and also the [[symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] perspective of communication as embedded in context [[#Barnlund1979|(Barnlund, 1979]]). Altheide considers ecology of communication to be a fluid construct that can be used as a frame to investigate the ways in which social activities are being created and modified through the use of technologies that, in turn, give rise to new communication formats. He is particularly interested in the relationship between social activities and technologies for surveillance and control.

The communicative ecology concept has been further developed for use in studies of information and communication technologies (ICT) initiatives in developing nations [[#Slater2002|(Slater, Tacchi &amp; Lewis, 2002)]]. A guide to the study of communicative ecologies using the ethnographic action research method, developed with the support of UNESCO, has spawned a proliferation of empirical research [[#Tacchi2007|(Tacchi et al., 2007)]] [[#Tacchi2003|(Tacchi, Slater &amp; Hearn, 2003)]]. Many of these investigations have focused on ICT for development projects associated with community technology centres and local information networks in South Asian and African nations [[#Slater2002|(Slater et al., 2002;]][[#Slater2004|Slater &amp; Tacchi, 2004;]][[#Pringle2004|Pringle, Bajracharya, &amp; Bajracharya, 2004;]][[#Sharma2005|Sharma, 2005;]][[#Nair2006|Nair, Jennaway &amp; Skuse, 2006;]][[#Rangaswamy2007|Rangaswamy, 2007)]]. In these studies, local community members are often engaged as active participants in a research and project development process that provides opportunities for them to gain the ICT literacy skills necessary to create locally meaningful content [[#Subramanian2004|(Subramanian, Nair &amp; Sharma, 2004;]][[#Tacchi2005a|Tacchi, 2005a]], [[#Tacchi2007|2007;]][[#TacchiWatkins2007|Tacchi &amp; Watkins, 2007)]]. Many of these research activities investigate and support interventions that aim to alleviate poverty [[#Slater2005|(Slater &amp; Kwami, 2005)]], educate [[#Subramanian2005|(Subramanian, 2005)]] and promote the [[digital inclusion]] necessary for citizens to actively participate in civic life and have their voices heard [[#Tacchi2005b|(Tacchi, 2005b;]][[#Skuse2007|Skuse &amp; Cousins, 2007]], [[#Skuse2008|2008;]][[#SkuseFildes2007|Skuse, Fildes, Tacchi, Martin &amp; Baulch, 2007;]]. Some studies have reported on the use of a particular ICT, for example [[community radio]] [[#Tacchi2005c|(Tacchi, 2005c)]] or [[mobile phone]]s [[#Horst2006|(Horst &amp; Miller, 2006;]][[#Miller2007|Miller, 2007)]], in relation to broader communication patterns.

More recently, the communicative ecology framework has been extended in studies of the nature of media use to support social networks in [[urban village]]s and inner-city apartment buildings [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]]. This paper introduced the concept of dimensions to the communicative ecology model. [[#Button2007|Button and Partridge (2007)]] used the model to examine the online communicative ecology of neighbourhood websites. The model has also been used to investigate how students communicate and reflect on their learning [[#Berry2006|(Berry &amp; Hamilton, 2006)]].

A special issue of the Electronic Journal of Communication showcased the versatility of the communicative ecology approach [[#HearnFoth2007|(Hearn &amp; Foth, 2007)]]. In this issue, [[#Allison2007|Allison (2007)]] looked at the communicative ecology from the perspective of the individual, whereas [[#Wilkin2007|Wilkin, Ball-Rokeach, Matsaganis and Cheong (2007)]] used a panoptic perspective to compare the ecologies of geo-ethnic communities. [[#Peeples2007|Peeples and Mitchell (2007)]] used the model to explore the social activity of protest. [[#Powell2007|Powell (2007)]] focused on a particular medium, public internet access, in an urban context. [[#Shepherd2007|Shepherd, Arnold, Bellamy and Gibbs (2007)]] extended the concept to attend to the material and spatial aspects of the communicative ecology of the domestic sphere.

The term "communicative ecology" has also been used in other studies with various interpretations. [[interactional sociolinguistics|Interactional sociolinguists]] use the term to describe the local communicative environment of a particular setting in which discourse is contextualised. Using methods drawn from [[linguistic anthropology]], their research begins with a period of ethnography in which a rich understanding of the local communicative ecology is formed. Discourse is then analysed in relation to this ecological context [[#Gumperz1999|(Gumperz, 1999)]]. [[#Roberts2005|Roberts (2005)]] describes a communicative ecology as comprising the identity of participants, the topics of communication and the ways in which things are communicated, including tone of voice, directness, etc. [[#Beier2001|Beier (2001)]] draws on [[Dell Hymes|Hymes']] [[#Hymes1974|(1974)]] work in [[ethnography of communication]] and uses the concept to understand the range of communicative practices of the Nanti people as a system of interaction.

From an [[applied linguistics]] perspective, [[#McArthur2005|McArthur (2005)]] describes a communicative ecology as embracing the nature and evolution of language, media and communication technologies. He uses the term to discuss the interactions between the world's languages and communication technologies. [[#Wagner2004|Wagner (2004)]] uses the term to refer to the deep structures of meaning and communicative action that human language shares with other species, particularly the [[bonobo]]. In cultural studies of terrorism, [[#White2003|White (2003)]] uses the term to describe the interchange of signs within interacting networks of individuals and collectives.

In their study of [[computer-mediated communication]] in the workplace, [[#Yates2003|Yates, Orlikowski and Woerner (2003)]] draw upon [[#Erickson2000|Erickson's (2000)]] work on genre ecologies to suggest a communicative ecology can be identified by the types and frequencies of communicative practices, such as email threading activities. Their version of communicative ecology is influenced by members of a workplace engaging in common activities, the length of time over which interaction takes place, whether communication media is synchronous or asynchronous and members' linguistic or cultural background.

There is not a single, agreed upon communicative ecology model, rather, this section highlights that there are various approaches to understanding and applying the model in various contexts. Furthermore, concepts that bear some similarity to communicative ecology include [[actor-network theory]] [[#Latour2005|(Latour, 2005)]], [[Scandinavian activity theory|activity theory]] [[#Nardi1996|(Nardi, 1996)]] the communication infrastructure model [[#Ball-Rokeach2001|(Ball-Rokeach, Kim &amp; Matei, 2001)]] and the personal communication system [[#Boase2008|(Boase, 2008)]].

==Characteristics==
Often in sociological literature, an ecology is seen to be anchored in a geographical area of human settlement. In the case of a communicative ecology, while the majority of studies have been conducted in physical environments, it is also possible to use the framework to examine ecologies grounded in an online environment. In many cases, communicative ecologies move seamlessly across both kinds of settings. For example, settings may include both public and private spaces, transport infrastructure and websites, in any combination.

Different settings have distinct affordances that may facilitate or hinder communication within an ecology. In a physical setting this might mean a neighbourhood has several coffee shops and parks where residents can interact. In an online setting, certain design features may enable certain types of communication and constrain others. For example, discussion boards facilitate one-to-many or many-to-many collective forms of communication but not one-to-one or peer-to-peer style networked communication that would be better served by [[short message service|SMS]] or [[Instant messaging &amp; messengers|instant messaging]] [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]].

Similar to biological ecologies, communicative ecologies have lifecycles. They can be described as new or well-established, active or dormant, or in a period of growth or decline. For example, residents of a new master-planned housing estate will have a young communicative ecology that is in a period of growth but may need cultivation in order to become active. In this case, sociocultural animation of the ecology may be required for it to become socially sustainable [[#Tacchi2003|(Tacchi et al., 2003)]].

Communicative ecologies can be conceived as having three layers and differing across several spectral dimensions. The nature of a communicative ecology changes as its members engage in and transition between different types of activities.

===Layers===
A communicative ecology has three layers: social, discursive and technological [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]]. These layers are seen to be intricately entwined and mutually constitutive, rather than discrete, hierarchical or as having unidirectional causal relationships. While it is challenging to consider each layer in isolation, analysing each layer independently can be a beneficial preliminary step prior to the examination of the complex, mutual shaping relationships that form part of the holistic view of a communicative ecology.

The social layer refers to people and the various social structures with which they identify themselves, ranging from informal personal networks to formal institutions. For example, this may include groups of friends, formal community organisations and companies. The discursive layer refers to the themes or content of both mediated and unmediated communication. The technological layer comprises communication media and technologies. This includes both traditional media, such as newspapers and television, and new media including mobile phones and social networking sites. The devices and applications within this layer are differentiated according to the communication model they facilitate. For example, collective communication is made possible through one-to-many or many-to-many forms of media, such as television or online discussion boards, whereas networked communication can be enabled through one-to-one or peer-to-peer media, including instant messaging or SMS [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]].

The layered nature of the communicative ecology framework enables the investigation of research questions surrounding the media preferences of diverse individuals and groups and how these choices influence their relationships. It also allows researchers to explore the nature of discourse between individuals and within groups, and how communication changes according to the nature of people's relationships with one another. The communicative ecology model is also useful for considering how different topics of communication affect choice of media and how different media shape communicative content.

===Dimensions===
Communicative ecologies vary across several spectral dimensions. The dimensions identified to date, include networked/collective, global/local and online/offline [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]]. The dimensional properties of communicative ecologies allow researchers to consider both the relative strength of each characteristic, and also how individuals and the ecology itself transitions fluidly between dimensions.

For example, researchers can question how an individual or group's choice of media changes as they transition between networked and collective forms of interaction. They may also consider how different media may facilitate or constrain either networked or collective interaction. If interested in the global or local characteristics of an ecology, researchers may examine how communication with proximate others may be mediated differently from communication with others in distant locales. They could also explore which communication topics are more likely to occur at the local level rather than within globally distributed social networks. As users of new technologies now move seamlessly between what was formerly constituted as online and offline domains, researchers may use the communicative ecology model to address questions of how and why people choose certain assemblages of online and offline media to achieve particular communicative goals. Investigation of how the nature of discourse may affect the choice of online or offline modes of interaction is also possible.

Communicative ecologies can also be characterised across several other dimensions. One example is the private/public dimension. People may choose to interact and communicate with each other in private settings, such as their home or via email, or in more public settings, such as a restaurant or chat room.

===Types of activity===
The nature of an individual's communicative ecology changes as they transition between types of activity. For example, they may choose to use different media when communicating with colleagues as compared to planning an evening out with friends. Similarly, a workplace's communicative ecology may differ from that of a tennis club or a loosely joined network of environmental activists.

The activities of everyday life can be grouped into various types. Five example categories are as follows. The first three are derived from [[#Stebbins2007|Stebbins's (2007)]] typology of leisure activities.

# Casual leisure (e.g. dinner with friends, seeing a movie)
# Serious leisure (e.g. volunteering, amateur car racing)
# Project-based leisure (e.g. short hobby-based education courses, one-off participation in a fun run)
# Domestic/personal work (e.g. housework, grocery shopping, personal grooming)
# Work/formal education (e.g. job, school attendance)

These groupings enable exploration of the patterns of social interactions, topics of communication and media applications that may be specific to an activity type.

==Scope, resolution and granularity==
The study of a communicative ecology requires decisions to be made concerning the scope of both data collection and analysis. Prior to data collection, a decision must be made as to the investigative frame of the study, whereas decisions regarding the analytical scope of a study may be made after a rich picture of the ecology has emerged.

While an ecological study aims to be holistic, an appropriate frame for the study must be decided upon at the outset. The scope of communicative ecology research settings is generally restricted to a bounded geographical space. It has been proposed that the communicative ecology framework is suited to studies at the level of the dwelling, neighbourhood, suburb or city [[#HearnFoth2007|(Hearn &amp; Foth, 2007)]]. However, it is also suitable for studies of communicative ecologies that are grounded in online environments. In this case, the setting could be limited to one or several websites [[#Button2007|(Button &amp; Partridge, 2007)]].

Temporal considerations may also shape data collection procedures. For example, an ecology could be examined at a single point of time or longitudinally. It is possible that the nature of a communicative ecology may also vary according to time of day, week or season.

The analysis of a communicative ecology can occur at both macro and micro levels within this spatiotemporal frame. It can help to think of a communicative ecology as a map and its edges as the frame. We can increase the resolution of certain features by using a magnifying glass. By stepping away from the map, we can increase the granularity of our view and see how features interrelate with the ecology as a whole. In this way, the interrelationships between agents are not ignored, as they may be in studies that focus on single communication devices or applications, but may be temporarily set aside while other features are examined more closely. By viewing the map as a whole first, the researcher may be able to make better analytical choices than was possible prior to data collection.

Some possible methods for delimiting the analytical scope of a communicative ecology study include using features of a layer or another characteristic. For example, the analysis could be delimited to examining the ecology of an individual, a small social network or group, or by certain demographic characteristics. It could focus on the ecology of a specific theme of communication, form of media or technology, setting or activity. Alternatively, it could investigate a single dimension of a communicative ecology, for example, only local or public forms of communication.

==Perspective==
Communicative ecology researchers speak in terms of "mapping" the ecology. This term may be misleading as it could appear to indicate the creation of cartographic renderings of the communicative ecology as it relates to its locality. Mapping the ecology, in the main, refers to drawing conceptual maps and creating or collecting oral or written descriptions of the phenomena that constitute the communicative ecology.

There are two primary perspectives taken to communicative ecology research that are loosely correlative with the [[emic and etic]] positions taken in classic ethnographic studies. A researcher can work from the outside of the ecology looking in with the aim of creating a holistic overview. Alternatively, they can position themselves within the communicative ecology with the aim of looking at it from the participants' points of view. The external view is useful if a comparison between local systems is desired. A centric view is better suited to understanding how people construct and make sense of their communicative ecology.

The choice of perspective may enhance or limit the utility of the data. For example, a birds-eye view may fail to capture significant individual differences in the experience of a communicative ecology, such as those brought about by differing wealth or literacy levels. Ideally, communicative ecology research should use a variety of perspectives in order to obtain a more complete representation and deeper understanding.

==Associated research approaches and methods==
The study of communicative ecologies is commonly associated with a research approach known as ethnographic action research. This approach combines ethnographic methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews, with participatory methods and action research. The ethnographic methods enable researchers to develop a rich understanding of the meanings derived from media and communication technologies. The action research methods allow the study to be located in not only communication theory, but also grassroots communication practice. In this approach, participants can act as co-investigators in cycles of inquiry, action and reflection and researchers are able to give back in a way that will develop the communicative ecology. In this way, ethnographic action research is suited to both research and project development agendas [[#Tacchi2006|(Tacchi, 2006)]].

A '''complaint system''' (also known as a '''conflict management system''', '''internal conflict management system''', '''integrated conflict management system''',&lt;ref&gt;See Lynch, below{{full|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''dispute system''') is a set of procedures used in organizations to address complaints and resolve disputes. Complaint systems in the US have undergone several innovations especially since about 1970 with the advent of extensive workplace regulation. Notably in many countries, conflict management channels and systems have evolved from a major focus on labor-management relations to a much wider purview that includes [[labor union|unionized]] workers and also managers, non-union employees, professional staff, students, trainees, vendors, donors, customers, etc.

==History==

There is a substantial early history of scholarly work on [[due process]], and union and non-union [[grievance]] procedures within organizations. This work focused primarily on [[rights]]-based [[conflict resolution]] between union and non-union workers and their managers. Scholarly work has evolved to cover both a wider range of conflict management channels, and, also, a much wider range of disputants.

In the 1970s and 1980s much interest arose in the United States, in dealing with conflict informally as well as formally, and in learning from conflict and managing conflict. In contemporary language, these discussions centered on the "interests" of all who would consider themselves stake-holders in a given conflict—and on systems change—as well as resolving grievances.

These discussions led to questions of how to think about complaint systems and how to link different conflict management offices and processes within an organization. Papers by Ronald Berenbeimmason djordje bentions.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Berenbeim, Non-union Complaint Systems: A Corporate Appraisal (NY: The Conference Board, Report No 770, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Rowe, PhD, "Are You Hearing Enough Employee Concerns?" with Michael Baker, in Harvard Business Review, Vol. 62, No. 3, (May–June, 1984), pp. 127–136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Rowe, "The Non-Union Complaint System at MIT: An Upward-Feedback Mediation Model," in Alternatives to the High Cost of Litigation, Vol. 2, No. 4, (April, 1984), pp. 10–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many authors extended the work of Berenbeim, Rowe, and Rowe and Baker, on the topic of internal complaint systems. They included: Douglas M. McCabe,&lt;ref&gt;"Corporate Non-union Complaint Procedures and Systems" (NY: Praeger, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William L. Ury]], Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg.&lt;ref&gt;Ury, William J., Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg, Getting Disputes Resolved: Designing Systems to Cut the Costs of Conflict, the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, MA (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; (Ury, Brett and Goldberg in particular described conflict resolution within organizations in terms of interests, rights and power and the possibility of looping back from rights-based processes to interest-based solutions.) Cathy Costantino and Cristina S Merchant,&lt;ref&gt;Costantino, C. and C.S. Merchant. 1996, Designing conflict management systems. San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; and Karl A. Slaikeu and Ralph H. Hasson&lt;ref&gt;Slaikeu. K.A. and R.H. Hasson. 1998. Controlling the costs of conflict: How to design a system for your organization. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; extensively explored issues of designing conflict management systems.

The concept of an ''integrated'' conflict management system was conceived and developed by Mary Rowe, in numerous articles in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;See http://web.mit.edu/ombud/publications/ for a list&lt;/ref&gt; She saw the need to offer options for complainants and therefore a linked system of choices within an organizational system.&lt;ref&gt;See "People Who Feel Harassed Need a Complaint System with both Formal and Informal Options" in ''Negotiation Journal'', April, 1990, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 161–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a systems approach has endured well. In recent years however, there has been discussion as to whether conflict should be "managed" by the organization—or whether the goal is to understand, deal with and learn from conflict. There is also concern about practical and theoretical issues in "integrating" a system, with some observers{{Who|date=November 2010}} preferring the idea of "coordinating" a conflict system. However 2012 research by David Lipsky ''et al.'', suggests that an increasing number of corporations see themselves as having "integrated conflict management systems," or "ICMS."

There is also a major need{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} to collect, review and understand the nature of conflict management and complaint systems around the world. Studies and citations are needed about how complaint systems work for women as well as men. Research is needed as to how systems work for many different national groups, for people of different socio-economic classes, and different ages, and different religions, and especially for contract workers and immigrant workers, in every country. Studies (and citations) are needed about complaint systems in health care, in faith-based organizations, in schools, in political organizations, in the military and in many specialized occupations. Studies are needed{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} about important specialized issues like free speech.

A number of [[artificial intelligence]] technologies are helpful in complaint resolution process, understanding the attitudes of involved parties and reasoning about them, in particular, based on the [[belief–desire–intention model]]. Concept learning is an adequate formalism to reason about complaints.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Galitsky, B. and Josep Lluis de la Rosa ''"Concept-based learning of human behavior for customer relationship management"'' [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025510004007 Information Sciences] Volume 181, Issue 10, 15 May 2011, pp 2016-2035 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Censorshiplolcat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lolcat]] images are often shared through the same networks used by online activists.|alt=A picture of a striped cat in an apparent seated position with its legs spread, looking at the camera. In the upper left corner is the text "Why U Wanna Censor Me?" in white capital letters]]

The '''cute cat theory of digital activism''' is a [[theory]] concerning [[Internet activism]], [[Web censorship]], and "cute cats" (a term used for any low-value, but popular online activity) developed by [[Ethan Zuckerman]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=fa/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; It posits that most people are not interested in activism; instead, they want to use the web for mundane activities, including surfing for [[pornography]] and [[lolcat]]s ("cute cats").&lt;ref name=wch/&gt; The tools that they develop for that (such as [[Facebook]], [[Flickr]], [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]], [[Twitter]], and similar platforms) are very useful to [[social movement]] activists, who may lack resources to develop dedicated tools themselves.&lt;ref name=wch/&gt; This, in turn, makes the activists more immune to reprisals by governments than if they were using a dedicated activism platform, because shutting down a popular public platform provokes a larger public outcry than shutting down an obscure one.&lt;ref name=wch/&gt;

==The Internet and censorship==
Zuckerman states that "[[Web 1.0]] was invented to allow physicists to share research papers. [[Web 2.0]] was created to allow people to share pictures of cute cats."&lt;ref name=wch/&gt; Zuckerman says that if a tool passes "cute cat" purposes, and is widely used for low-value purposes, it can be and likely is used for online activism, too.&lt;ref name=wch/&gt;

If the government chooses to shut down such generic tools, it will hurt people's ability to "look at cute cats online", spreading dissent and encouraging the activists' cause.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name="wch"/&gt;

==Chinese model==
According to Zuckerman, [[internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]], which relies on its own, self-censored, Web 2.0 sites, is able to circumvent the cute-cat problem because [[Government of China|the government]] is able to provide people with access to cute-cat content on domestic, [[Self-censorship|self-censored]] sites while blocking access to Western sites, which are less popular in China than in many other places worldwide.&lt;ref name=wch/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cute Cat Theory: The China Corollary"/&gt;

"Sufficiently usable read/write platforms will attract porn and activists. If there's no porn, the tool doesn't work. If there are no activists, it doesn't work well," Zuckerman has stated.&lt;ref name=wch/&gt;

[[File:Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement-en.svg|thumb|[[Graham's hierarchy of disagreement]]]]
[[File:Glasl's Model of Conflict Escalation.svg|thumb|[[Friedrich Glasl's model of conflict escalation]] and de-escalation]]
'''De-escalation''' refers to behavior that is intended to escape [[Conflict escalation|escalations]] of [[Conflict (process)|conflicts]]. It may also refer to approaches in [[conflict resolution]]. [[Escalation of commitment|Escalations of commitment]] are often hard from spiraling out of proportions without specific measures being taken.

==Verbal De-escalation in Psychiatric Settings==
De-escalation is aimed at calmly communicating with an agitated client in order to understand, manage and resolve their concerns. Ultimately, these actions should help reduce the client’s agitation and potential for future aggression or violence. An inadequate intervention, or one occurring too late, may leave staff needing to utilize coercive measures to manage an aggressive or violent client. Coercive measures, such as chemical or mechanical restraints and seclusion, are damaging to the therapeutic relationship and harmful to clients and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duxbury|first=J.|date=2002-06-01|title=An evaluation of staff and patient views of and strategies employed to manage inpatient aggression and violence on one mental health unit: a pluralistic design|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2850.2002.00497.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=325–337|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2850.2002.00497.x|issn=1365-2850}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huckshorn|first=Kevin Ann|date=2006-07-01|title=Re-Designing State Mental Health Policy to Prevent the Use of Seclusion and Restraint|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10488-005-0011-5|journal=Administration and Policy in Mental Health and Mental Health Services Research|language=en|volume=33|issue=4|pages=482–491|doi=10.1007/s10488-005-0011-5|issn=0894-587X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the importance of de-escalation in promoting a non-coercive psychiatric environment, a review of the literature conducted by Mavandadi, Bieling and Madsen (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mavandadi|first=V.|last2=Bieling|first2=P.

Furthermore, a valiant attempt to synthesize the various models and definitions was conducted by Price &amp; Baker (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Owen|last2=Baker|first2=John|date=2012-08-01|title=Key components of de-escalation techniques: A thematic synthesis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1447-0349.2011.00793.x/abstract|journal=International Journal of Mental Health Nursing|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=310–319|doi=10.1111/j.1447-0349.2011.00793.x|issn=1447-0349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic analysis of 11 eligible studies converged on seven themes: three related to staff skills (e.g. empathetic concern, calm appearance and gentle tone of voice) and four related to the process of intervening (e.g. establish rapport, maintain safety, problem solve and set limits). The available literature provides clinical descriptions of effective de-escalation based on qualitative data and professional observations. However, these thematic analyses need to be supported by more objective data; one hallmark of such objectivity would be an empirical scale or quantitative measure of de-escalation.

==English Modified version of the ‘De-Escalating Aggressive Behaviour Scale’ (EMDABS)==

1. '''Valuing the client:''' Provides genuine acknowledgement that the client’s concerns are valid, important and will be addressed in a meaningful way.

2. '''Reducing fear:''' Listens actively to the client and offers genuine empathy while suggesting that the client’s situation has the potential for positive future change.

3. '''Inquiring about client’s queries and anxiety:''' Can communicate a thorough understanding of the client’s concerns, and works to uncover
the root of the issue.

4. '''Providing guidance to the client:''' Suggests multiple ways to the help the client with their current concerns and recommends preventative measures.

5. '''Working out possible agreements:''' Takes responsibility for the client’s care and concludes the encounter with an agreed-upon short-term solution and a long-term action plan.

6. '''Remaining calm:''' Maintains a calm tone of voice and steady pace that is appropriate to the client’s feelings and behaviour.

7. '''Risky:''' Maintains a moderate distance from the client to ensure safety, but does not appear guarded and fearful.

This often involves techniques such as taking a [[Child time-out|time-out]], and deflecting the conversation to individuals in the group who are less passionately involved. This is commonly used by Fee Team in [[mental health nursing]] practice. It is also used as an anger management tool to remove tension between two participants in a conflictual relationship or intervention.

'''Friendship books''' (also known as '''"FBs"''' in their abbreviated form) are small booklets made by stapling paper together, or are sometimes just sheets or strips of paper. They are usually decorated and the person who starts the book writes their name and address as the first person sending the book. People often include a list of interests as well. The FB is then passed around from penpal to penpal, and can often also become a way for one to meet new penpals. Most people hope to see the book again once it is full so they add their return address to the back cover of the book too, or inscribe "Return to Sender" on it. People also sometimes make FBs for someone else rather than themselves, in which case they write the name and address of the recipient on the front/at the top. Some people find friendship books fun because you can see where they have been in a trail back to the original sender/recipient.

The German friendship books (or [[:de:Poesiealbum|poetry albums]]) serve a similar purpose but are kept, not sent away. Access is considered more intimate; sometimes the book even has a lock. The information given about oneself often includes quotations, poetry and worldly wisdom. Typically they are more like shared journals between two best friends or a couple and are kept at one of their houses.

Friendship books that require entrants to make drawings, use stickers or magazine photographs are known as "deco" friendship books or just simply "decos".  Typically, each entrant in the "deco" must use one full page to express themselves.  Glitter, sequins, feathers and other scrapbooking supplies are frequently used in "decos."  Despite the artistic expressions used in these types of friendship books, the basic rules of passing the friendship book to person to person is the same.

When a 'friendship book' is only one page (no staples), it's called a 'friendship sheet.'  If the page is small, like the size of a postcard, or smaller, it's called a 'cram.'  Friendship books that have a musical theme, where you have to add lyrics to your entry, are called "lyrix" or "lyrics sheets".

==Slams==
Slams are friendship books that include a theme of questions, either "Sign if you did/like the following", "What is your favorite" or other similar questions.  These usually include one page as a "sign in", several pages of questions, and then a "sign out" or "shout out" page at the end. 
Slams can be themed or regular.  Typically they are small like a standard friendship book.  Often they have a "sign-in" page where you put your label or name, then each page will often contain a question which you answer (i.e. When was the last time you said "I love you") and the signer would write the appropriate response.  At the end there is often a sign-out page as well where it's dated.  Slams have many variations and can be "sign if" slams (you sign only if the statement or question applies to you).  These are handled in a number of ways, but most of them become more clear when you have it in-hand.

==Crams==
Crams are like friendship sheets or book, but no one includes any personal information.  The idea (as the name implies) is to "cram" as many names and addresses into the provided space.

==Friendship sheet==
As the name implies, friendship sheets are nearly the same as friendship books, but they are made on a single sheet of paper or stationery.

==Deco==
Decos are similar to FBs, but are often larger in size.   The cover is often decorated with interesting materials like magazine pictures, rubber stamps, decorative papers, and other embellishments.  Each person who signs decorates a full page in the book.  Sometimes the book has a theme, for example cats.  Then, each person decorates their page following the theme.  As with FBs, when these are full, they are sent home to the person for whom the book was made.

==Lyrix==
Lyrix are much like decos except that each page is decorated using lyrics from a song.  Some are more plain with the words simply written in them, others are as artistic as decos with pictures and other ornamental adornments.

==Quotes==
Quotes are like Lyrics, but instead of song lyrics they contain quotes from movies. These can also be themed, such as Brad Pitt movie quotes. Quotes can be plain text or decorative.

{{Original research|section|date=October 2008}}

Sometimes a friendship book can get misplaced and take several years to reach its intended maker. It is considered common courtesy to pass the friendship books on to another pen pal as quickly as possible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Another rule of thumb with friendship books is that after two years of circulation, the friendship book should be returned home to its owner. With the popularity of the internet, some pen pals include their email address along with their snail mail address so people can make sure their letter will successfully make it to the intended pen pal.

== Commonly used abbreviations ==
*A/A = Answers All
*A/O = Answers Only
*A/S = Answers Some
*A/M - Answers Most
*AVF = Answers Very Few
*ICR = I Can Return (meaning this person can return the friendship book back to the owner)
*LLP = Long Letter Pal (meaning this person is looking for pals that will send lengthy letters)
*N&amp;N FBS = Nice and Neat Friendship Books

The '''Hobbesian trap''' (or '''Schelling's dilemma''') is a theory that explains why [[preemptive strike]]s occur between two groups, out of bilateral fear of an imminent attack. Without outside influences this situation will lead to a fear spiral ([[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]], [[vicious circle]], [[Nash equilibrium]]) in which fear will lead to an [[arms race]] which in turn will lead to increasing fear. The Hobbesian trap can be explained in terms of [[game theory]]. Although cooperation would be the better outcome for both sides, mutual distrust leads to the adoption of strategies that have negative outcomes for individual players and all players combined.&lt;ref name="Baliga Sjöström"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baliga|first=Sandeep|author2=Tomas Sjöström|title=The Hobbesian Trap|date=2010-09-21|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/baliga/htm/hobbesiantrap.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been used to explain outbreaks of conflicts and violence, spanning from individuals to states.&lt;ref name="Pinker BAooN"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.|publisher=Penguin Group USA|isbn=978-0143122012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theory is most commonly associated with [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Thomas Schelling]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Examples==
[[Steven Pinker]] is a proponent of the theory of the Hobbesian trap and has applied the theory to many conflicts and outbreaks of violence between people, groups, tribes, societies and states.&lt;ref name="Pinker BAooN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinker TBS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature|year=2002|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0142003343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of gun control have been described as a Hobbesian trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danseconpolicy.blog.com/2012/12/16/the-gun-craze/ |title=The Gun Craze |last=Ocampo |first=Dan |date=December 16, 2012 |website= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419014702/http://danseconpolicy.blog.com/2012/12/16/the-gun-craze/ |archivedate=April 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example is the dilemma that both the armed burglar and the armed homeowner face when they meet each other. Neither side may want to shoot, but both are afraid of the other party shooting first so they may be inclined to fire pre-emptively, although the favorable outcome for both parties would be that nobody be shot.&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_10_29_nytbookreview.html|title = All About Evil.

Fear and mutual distrust between the actors increased the likelihood of a [[preemptive strike]].&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil" /&gt;

==Avoidance==
The Hobbesian trap can be avoided by influences that increase the trust between the two parties.&lt;ref name="Baliga Sjöström" /&gt; In the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], for example, [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Khrushchev]] realized that they were caught in a Hobbesian trap which helped them to make concessions that reduced distrust and fear.&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil" /&gt;

'''Intimate media''' are [[recording medium|media]] artifacts created and collected by individuals, friends, and families to capture and commemorate aspects of [[family]] and intimate relationships. Intimate media includes such things as personal and family [[photo]] collections, home [[video]]s and [[film]]s, [[diary|diaries and journals]], and [[letter (message)|letter]]s. Depending on the meaning and values attributed to an object, anything could be considered intimate media.&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Great value is placed on intimate media possessions due to its ability to serve as "proof" that an event or memory actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print,p.220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intimate Media In Relation To Technology==
[[File:StateLibQld 2 171951 Intimate portrait of a man writing a letter, 1900-1910.jpg|thumb|Intimate portrait of a man writing a letter, 1900-1910 ([[State Library of Queensland]] courtesy)]]

"''Our memory and the stories we create, share, retell and live are a powerful way in which we determine and express who we are.''"&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print, p.219.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their chapter of ''The New Everyday: Views on Ambient Intelligence'', entitled Intimate Media: Emotional Needs and Ambient Intelligence, John Cass, Lorna Goulden, and Slava Kozlov discuss the ways in which humans, as they "become familiar with the potential of new technologies in their workplaces...find ways to re-use what they have encountered there and find benefits in other parts of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; This process has led to the onset of digital and social media-based "intimate media," such as digital scrapbooks, email, text messaging, [[Pinterest]] pages, blogs, the "messages" portion of Facebook, online photo-sharing websites such as [[Flickr]], and websites like [[YouTube]]. Human memory and computer memory are quite different in terms of their accuracy and durability.&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; Storing intimate media on a computer mechanism helps to preserve the accuracy of the memory and lengthens its life as well. One potential problem with fusing intimate media and technology is that most technological intimate media is stored rather than displayed—it lives on hard drives, CDs, and the internet. The decorative nature of non-technological intimate media allows a person to imbue their living space with memories, triggers of happy moments, sentimental objects, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of technologies such as digital photo-frames, however, has begun to solve these technological deficiencies. This new virtual digital domain opens up a whole world of possibilities.
With intimate media now becoming increasingly digitalized, its potential for mobility, sharing, and copying is increasing drastically. Not only can a person transfer intimate media from one person or household to another, but the same intimate media can also be viewed simultaneously in a limitless number of locations. This opens up a new realm: [[ambient intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print, p.222&lt;/ref&gt; Now intimate media is no longer confined to bookshelves, mantles, closets, and coffee tables. It can travel with a person in her/his pocket, via cell phone or other digital device, wherever s/he goes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2646">{{about|an auction on behalf of a government|auctions open to the public|Auction}}
A '''public auction''' is an [[auction]] held on behalf of a [[government]] in which the property to be auctioned is either property owned by the government, or property which is sold under the authority of a [[court of law]] or a government agency with similar authority.

When the term "[[government auctions|Government Auction]]" is used it generally means that specific auctioneers and agents are contracted to deal with stock that needs to be liquidated by various government bodies.

==Sale of property owned by the government==

Government property sold at public auction may include surplus government equipment, [[abandoned property]] over which the government has asserted ownership, property which has passed to the government by [[escheat]], [[government land]], and intangible assets over which the government asserts authority, such as [[Broadcasting|broadcast frequencies]] sold through a [[spectrum auction]].

Public auctions of government property may be conducted by whichever agency is auctioning the property. Some substantial items have been sold at public auction. For example, the [[United States Navy]] [[cruiser]] [[USS Philadelphia (C-4)|''Philadelphia'']] was sold at such an auction at the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] in 1927.

==Sale of private property in a public auction==
Private property may be sold in a public auction for a number of reasons. It may be seized through a governmental process to satisfy a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] rendered by a court or agency, or to liquidate a [[mortgage foreclosure]], [[tax lien]], or [[tax sale]]. Usually, prices obtained at a public auction to satisfy a judgment are distressed - that is, they are much lower than the price which would be obtained for that property if the seller were free to hold out for an optimal time to sell. In the [[United States]], public auctions to satisfy judgments are usually conducted under the authority of the [[sheriff]] of the county or city in which the property to be auctioned was seized pursuant to the judgment, and an auction held for such a purpose is also called a '''Sheriff's sale'''.

[[Real property]] may be subject to a public auction in order to [[Partition (law)|partition]] the property between [[Concurrent estate|joint tenants]] who can not agree as to how the property should be divided. An [[estate sale]] conducted at the direction of a [[probate court]] may also be conducted as a public auction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24213">In [[sociology]], '''racialization''' or '''ethnicization''' is the process of ascribing [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[Race (human classification)|racial identities]] to a relationship, social practice, or group that did not identify itself as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racialization or ethnicization is often borne out of the interaction of a group with a group that it [[Domination (sociology)|dominates]] and ascribes identity for the purpose of continued domination. While it is often borne out of domination, the racialized and ethnicized group often gradually identifies with and even embraces the ascribed identity and thus becomes a self-ascribed race or ethnicity. These processes have been common across the history of [[imperialism]], [[nationalism]], and racial and ethnic hierarchies.

== History of Racialization ==
Racial categories have historically been used as a way to allow an oppressive figure or group discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gans|first=Herbert J.|title=Racialization and racialization research|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4030486/mod_resource/content/2/Racialization%20and%20racialization%20research.pdf|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=341–352|doi=10.1080/01419870.2017.1238497|via=Routledge, Taylor and Francis Group|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denny|first=Walter Bell|date=Jul-Oct 1983|title=Orientalism in European Art|journal=The Muslim World|volume=73| issue = 3–4|pages=262–277|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1983.tb03268.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of the most prominent examples of [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] work in art is a piece by [[Eugène Delacroix]] titled ''[[Women of Algiers|Women of Algiers in their Apartment]].''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/france/articles/the-top-10-orientalist-artworks/|title=An Introduction To 'Orientalist' Art In 10 Famous Works|last=Morfin|first=Marcelina|work=Culture Trip|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a [[harem]] in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fine [[textile]]s, [[hookah]]s, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through [[Orientalism]] led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many [[North Africa]]n and [[Middle East]]ern countries were colonized by European nations, such as [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coldwarstudies.com/2013/01/11/history-of-colonization-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa-mena-precursor-to-cold-war-conflict/|title=History of Colonization in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA): Precursor to Cold War Conflict|last=|first=|date=|website=coldwarstudies.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries were not fully independent until the mid-twentieth century, a time in which [[globalization]] began to rise both economically and politically.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With the rise of globalization came an expanding cultural influence and an increase in [[immigration]] to Western nations. New cultures, ethnic groups, and ideals have contributed to the process of racialization which is familiar in modern society. Racialization is a long process, and members of each group are categorized based on their perceived differences relative to those who are considered elite within a society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another major contributor to the process of racialization is the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; News outlets, films, television shows, and other forms of public communication portray racial groups to often reflect [[stereotype]]s which contribute to the public’s opinion of certain cultural groups. These opinions and stereotypes may become institutionalized and racial groups must then encounter the [[Institutionalized Racism|institutionalized racism]] that is a result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dominant groups in a society tend to racialize others because new cultural and racial groups are seen as threatening to their society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These threats instill fear into the dominant members of the society due to the possibility of [[downward mobility]] or perceived loss of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While threats can be imagined or real, they are most prominent when there is some other issue in the nation, such as a poorly performing [[economy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The effects of racialization are often more harmful to racial and ethnic groups than the actual racialization itself, a few examples being [[Systemic racism|systemic]] and [[structural racism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further significant research in this area is aiding politicians and policy makers in creating a more equal society that embraces and supports different racial and ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Racialized incorporation ==
The process of racialization can affect newly arriving immigrants as well as their second-generation children in the United States. The concept of racialized incorporation bridges the idea of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] with [[Critical race theory|critical race studies]] in general and the concept of racialization in particular.&lt;ref name="Chaudhary 318–354"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Racialized Incorporation: The Effects of Race and Generational Status on Self-Employment and Industry-Sector Prestige in the United States|journal = International Migration Review|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1747-7379|pages = 318–354|volume = 49|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/imre.12087|language = en|first = Ali R.|last = Chaudhary}}&lt;/ref&gt; While immigrants may possess specific ethnic and cultural identities associated with their countries of origin, once they arrive in the U.S., they are incorporated into a society that is largely organized along the lines of race. The racial hierarchy in the United States is pervasive in many aspects of life including housing, education, and employment. The racialized incorporation perspective argues that regardless of the ethnic and cultural differences across immigrant groups, racial identification is the ultimate and primary principle of social organization in the United States. So an immigrant from Sweden and his/her U.S. born second-generation children are likely to be incorporated into the White mainstream, while an immigrant from Ghana and his/her U.S. born second-generation children are likely to be incorporated into the Black community.  Because the lived experiences of Whites and Blacks in U.S. society diverge in most areas of social life, the racialized category that immigrants and their children are incorporated into will largely determine their experiences and opportunities in the United States. The concept of racialized incorporation is relatively new and was recently applied in a study of self-employment in the United States.&lt;ref name="Chaudhary 318–354"/&gt;

==Racialization of religion==
An ongoing scholarly debate covers the racialization of religious communities. Adherents to [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] can be racialized when they are portrayed as possessing certain physical characteristics, despite many individual adherents to those religions not visibly sharing in those characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meer|first=Nasar|date=2013-03-01|title=Racialization and religion: race, culture and difference in the study of antisemitism and Islamophobia|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=36|issue=3|pages=385–398|doi=10.1080/01419870.2013.734392|issn=0141-9870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joshi|first=Khyati Y.|date=2006-09-01|title=The Racialization of Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism in the United States|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|volume=39|issue=3|pages=211–226|doi=10.1080/10665680600790327|issn=1066-5684}}&lt;/ref&gt; This racialization extends to the descendants of the adherents, even though those descendants may often convert away from active observance of the religion of their forebears but also retain the lingering cultural aspects of the religion for familial and community purposes.

The most immediate effect of the racialization of religion is said to be the [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalization]] of such racialization by the descendants of adherents, whereby the descendants of adherents accept and internalize their religiously-influenced familial culture as an ethnoracial distinction and identity. One of the applications of this racialization is [[nationalism]], whereby the created race seeks to assert cultural and [[nation]]al aspirations which are compatible and accommodating to other groups. Another one of the applications of this racialization is [[racism]] and [[discrimination]], whereby those who are racialized are barred from participation in any public or private function of [[society]] due to the negative "attributes" of the race assigned to them.

==Racialization of labor==
The racialization of labor is said to involve the segregation and appointment of workers based on perceived ethnic differences.&lt;ref&gt;Marta Maria Maldonado, {{"'}}It is their nature to do menial labour': the racialization of 'Latino/a workers' by agricultural employers", ''[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]'', vol. 32 no. 6 (July 2009), 1026. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a910770329 Link] (accessed April 14, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; This racialization of labor is said to produce a hierarchical arrangement which limits employee agency and mobility based on their race. The process of racialization is reinforced through presupposed, stereotypical qualities which are imposed upon the racialized person by the racializer.&lt;ref name=Racializationrocess&gt;Marta Maria Maldonado, "Racial Triangulation of Latino/a Workers by Agricultural Employers", ''Human Organization'', Vol. 65 No. 4, Winter 2006, 360. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a910770329 Link] (accessed April 14, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Racialization is then [[Normalization (sociology)|normalized]] by the promotion of "colourblindness" through the use of "soft" language which avoids highlighting ethnic differences.&lt;ref name=Racializationrocess /&gt;

The racialization of labor specially limits [[Labor mobility|labor mobilization]] up the workforce ladder based on race. Dominant racialized labor groups, mainly White/European workers, are generally presented more privileges than subordinate labor groups, mainly Black or Hispanic workers. The subordinate labor groups face the denial of basic citizenship rights, more exploitation, and inferior working conditions. Furthermore, they are less likely to move up in rank within a company or advance to a higher job position.

Members of the dominant race (e.g., whites) benefit from the privileges of whiteness, whether these are material or psychological, and are maintained and reproduced within social systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murga, A. (2011). The Racialization of Day Labor Work in the U.S. Labor Market: Examining the Exploitation of Immigrant Labor. Journal of Labor Research. doi:10.1007/s12122-014-9191-7|title=Examining the U.S. Labor Market Performance of Immigrant Workers in the Presence of Network Effects|url=|journal=Journal of Labor Research|volume=36|pages=9–26|via=|doi=10.1007/s12122-014-9191-7|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, immigrant workers, especially Latino and Black workers, experience poor working conditions in day labor work. Day laborers experience "race" and this has impacted their integration into the [[Labour economics|labor market]].

Furthermore, research by Edna Bonacich, Sabrina Alimahomed Jake B. Wilson, 2008 regarding the effects of race and criminal background on employment indicates that black men need to work more than twice as hard as white men to secure the same job. Being black in America today is about the same as having a felony conviction in terms of one’s chances of finding a job. Specifically, “the combination of minority status and criminal background appears to intensify employers’ negative reactions, leaving few employment prospects for black ex-offenders (200 applications resulted in only 10 callbacks)”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonacich, E., Alimahomed, S., &amp; Wilson, J. B. (2008). The Racialization of Global Labor. American Behavioral Scientist, 52(3), 342-355. doi:10.1177/0002764208323510|title=The Racialization of Global Labor|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=52|issue=3|pages=342–355|via=|doi=10.1177/0002764208323510|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, According to Chetty, Hendren, Kline, and Saez, the effect of [[race segregation]] impacts the labor market, saying “upward income mobility is significantly lower in areas with larger African American Populations”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Race segregation may lead to divergent economic outcomes due to the fact that areas with larger black population tend to be more segregated by income and race and have adverse effects.

Lastly, the decline of [[Labor-unions|labor unions]] has negatively affected racialization of labor. Those who would have benefited from union membership no longer will as labor unions continue to diminish. In Jake Rosenfeld’s article, ''Little Labor: How Union Decline Is Changing the American Landscape'', he describes the people what no longer can benefit from labor unions: “an immigrant employee who once would have been organized, a female African -American worker no longer able to rely on a union wage to reduce pay gaps with her white counterpart, or a less-educated worker lacking the training, resources, and knowledge to participate in politics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rosenfeld, J. (2014). What Unions No Longer Do. doi:10.4159/harvard.9780674726215|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.4159/harvard.9780674726215|title=What Unions No Longer do|year=2014|isbn=9780674726215}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is less upward mobility when unions are not controlling wages and benefits.

== Racialization in Education ==
Racialization in an educational setting is apparent based on the teacher and the background they come from. The teacher’s race along with their views that came along through [[socialization]] growing up can affect the way the students portray themselves in a classroom setting. It also has to do with the amount of people who come from the same background because the majority of a population will dictate which group is being racialized. An example of students being racialized by their teachers and institutions can be seen through the way high schools teach in America today. Schools tend to teach classes that focus on a more Anglo-Saxon point of view without incorporating any diverse classes that would accommodate for the population of students that come from diverse backgrounds like Latinos, African, and Native Americans.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=San Pedro|first=Timothy|date=2016|title=Youth Voices, Public Spaces, and Civic Engagement: Truth, in the End, Is Different From What We Have Been Taught"Re-Centering Indigenous Knowledges in Public Schooling Spaces|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=68–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Desert View High School in Arizona has a great population of Native American students who wish to learn more about their [[Culture|cultural background]]  and where they came from. However, author Timothy J. San Pedro who wrote “Truth, in the End, Is Different From What We Have Been Taught: Re-Centering Indigenous Knowledges in Public Schooling Spaces” found that the school mainly focuses on the “Americanized” perspective of history that does not tell the whole story on what came to be in the Native American population. For example, San Pedro describes how the Desert View High School has posters of history classes that glorify “explorers” that were really conquerors of people who initially settled in areas that were “discovered” (San Pedro 2016). This idea of limiting the Native American population from learning about themselves forces them to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] to the culture where they are being racialized in an educational setting. They are forced to conform and be put under a racial category among their American teachers and learn things that do not pertain to their culture or [[Identity (social science)|social identity]].

== Racialization and Gender ==
Through the process of racializing [[social group]]s are distinguished and subjected to differential and unequal treatment on the basis of supposedly biological, phenotypic, cultural, and gender characteristics. Racialization can affect anyone in any race. Therefore, racialization and gender can often intersect (Elabor-Idemudia. 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The racialization of gender in the social construction of immigrant women in Canada: A case study of African women in a prairie province. Canadian Woman Studies, 19(3), 38-44|last=Elabor-Idemudia|first=P.|date=1999|website=.lib.umich.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=1999|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as [[racism]] and gender intersect or [[discrimination]] and gender intersect it is easy for racialization to overlap with gender. During racialization, certain racial categories are created and distinctive and stereotypical characteristics are attributed to that specific category. Within these categories, there can also be subcategories of racialization such as Caucasian man or African American women. Often immigrants who migrate to the U.S are affected by racialization if they are not white and fit more into a [[minority group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Mental images and political stories: Tracing the implicit effects of race and gender rhetoric on public opinion (Order No. 3029457).|last=Winter|first=N.J.G|date=2001|website=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=2001|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, African American women may often be [[stereotype]]d as uneducated, loud, or improper. Through Racialization if a woman of African descent immigrated to the U.S people will attribute those same stereotypes to her because through a racial lens she fits the African American woman category. Therefore, those same stereotypes will be applied to her as well. Racialization combined with gender can also be seen through the actions of the person that is racializing the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/cared/racialization|title=Racialization: Framing and Learning Anti-Racism.|last=Changnon-Greyeyes|first=C.|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such as someone crossing the street so they do not have to walk past men who appear to be African American due to the stereotypes related to African American men.

==Racialization and Incarceration==
Coming to fruition in the 1980s, the United States began to enact extensive legal reforms that worked to create a more punitive society. These reforms include mandatory [[Mandatory sentencing|minimum sentences]], trying juveniles as adults, [[Three-strikes law|three strikes and you’re out laws]], [[Truth in sentencing|truth in sentencing practices]], and many other policies and practices which served to increase our reliance on imprisonment in response to crime. As a result, U.S. society has been pegged with a “[[mass incarceration]]” structure. A recent report has concluded that nearly 1 in 100 U.S. adults are incarcerated and nearly 7.3 million Americans are either in prison or under parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Solomon|title=Prison Spending Outpaces All but Medicaid|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these reforms were intended to apply to all citizens regardless of race, this has not proven to be the reality. Statistically, these punitive reforms have disproportionately impacted African Americans. Specifically, those who are uneducated and/or live in [[low-income]] areas. Some have renamed the emergence of the “mass incarceration” society as rather the emergence of “racialized mass incarceration.” The numbers are much more alarming for African Americans behind bars. Nearly 1 in 15 African Americans are incarcerated and more narrowly 1 in 9 African American Men are incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Justice Fact Sheet|url=http://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/|website=NAACP|publisher=NAACP}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers point to an obvious discrimination towards blacks in the U.S. criminal justice system. 
	
One clear reason for these disproportionate imprisonment rate can be tied to poverty and social structures. In particular, a pronounced weak attachment to [[Employment|labor]] among many [[working-age]] adults in black communities has fostered a common experience of poverty and economic hardship. Ultimately this has served to create social spaces where bonds of family and community begin to fray and fall apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ditton|first1=Paula|title=Truth in Sentencing in State Prisons|journal=U.S. Department of Justice|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of environments have created higher levels of [[juvenile crime]], drug use, and even violent and gang-oriented crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Institute of Medicine and National Research|first1=Council 2001|title=Juvenile Justice|publisher=The National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although white Americans too have a history of living in [[poverty]], the average national rate of family disruption and poverty among blacks is two to four times higher than among whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sampson|first1=Robert|title=Toward a Theory of Race, Crime, and Urban Inequality|journal=Harvard|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, another reason for the United States racialized prison system can be seen with the war on drugs. Despite similar rates of drug use among blacks and whites, blacks make up 50% of those incarcerated for drug use compared to only 26% of whites. 
	
While the two examples above point to definite explanations for the United States racialized prison system, ultimately the most salient explanation for disproportionate imprisonment rates is public opinion and [[prejudice]]. Social stereotypes and stigmas have created assumptions about African Americans that make them more susceptible to arrest and imprisonment. These latter factors are often influenced by society’s outlook on the prison system. Most educated, middle to upper-class individuals, are in favor of things such as the [[death penalty]], minimum sentences, and trying juveniles as adults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bobo|first1=Lawrence|title=Unfair by Design: The War on Drugs, Race, and the Legitimacy of the Criminal Justice System|journal=Brown|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined with social stigmas make blacks unfairly disadvantaged in the realm of [[criminal justice]]. For example, in recent times, these effects can be seen in an increase in [[police brutality]] towards minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wines|first1=Sarah|title=Police Killings Rise Slightly, Though Increased Focus May Suggest Otherwise|website=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistically, it is 2.5 times more likely for blacks to be killed than whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowery|first1=Wesley|title=More Whites killed by police, but blacks 2.5 times more likely to be killed|website=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science Week Ireland''' is an annual week-long event in Ireland each November, celebrating [[science]] in our everyday lives. Science Week is an initiative of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahlstrom|first1=Dick|title=Science Week offers parents a look at alternative paths for students|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/innovation/science-week-offers-parents-a-look-at-alternative-paths-for-students-1.3292760|website=The Irish Times Online|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the largest science festival in the country, engaging tens of thousands of members of the general public in workshops, science shows, talks, laboratory demonstrations, science walks and other science-related events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Events|url=http://www.sfi.ie/events/|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Week is a collaboration of events involving industry, colleges, schools, libraries, teachers, researchers and students throughout Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key objective of Science Week is to inspire young people to take up careers in area|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/key-objective-of-science-week-is-to-inspire-young-people-to-take-up-careers-in-area-1.1971458|website=Irish Times Online|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Over the years, Science Week Ireland has grown from a small pilot initiative to a large promotional and event engine to its current identity as a recognised vehicle for regional activity supported by a national promotional campaign.&lt;ref name="oak1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahlstrom|first1=Dick|title=Science Week: From small acorn to giant oak tree . . .|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sponsored/science-week-from-small-acorn-to-giant-oak-tree-1.2403471|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The first Science Week in Ireland was held in 1996.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; It was organised by Forfás on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation under the name 'Information Technology and Science Week'. The week aimed to raise general awareness of the benefits of science and information technology to people, young and old throughout society. In 1997 it was renamed as Science Week. Professional bodies, voluntary groups, colleges, businesses and the public sector combined to organise 50 events countrywide.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; Events included conferences, lectures, interactive exhibitions, debates, and competitions for primary school students. 

SFI took over Science Week from the Forfás Discover Science and Engineering programme in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New legislation to focus scientific research on turning good ideas into good jobs|url=https://www.irishbuildingmagazine.ie/2012/12/12/new-legislation-to-focus-scientific-research-on-turning-good-ideas-into-good-jobs|publisher=Irish Building Magazine|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Week continued to grow and develop over the following years into what it represents today, a week-long&lt;ref name="sfi ie1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Week|url=http://www.sfi.ie/engagement/science-week/|website=sfi.ie|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebration of STEM public engagement, enhancing the public’s interest in STEM and enabling them to see the relevance of STEM to their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Discover Programme Call 2017|url=http://www.sfi.ie/funding/funding-calls/sfi-discover-programme/1.-SFI-Discover-Programme-Call-2017-FINAL.pdf|website=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4466">The '''Social Science History Association''', formed in 1976, brings together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in [[social history]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Statement of Purpose:''' To bring together members of various disciplines (including economics, sociology, demography, anthropology, and history) who work with historical materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/affiliated-societies/social-science-history-association American History Association entry for SSHA]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social Science History]] is a quarterly, peer-reviewed academic journal. It is the official journal of the Social Science History Association. Its articles bring an analytic, theoretical, and often quantitative approach to historical evidence. The journal's founders intended to "improve the quality of historical explanation" with "theories and methods from the social science disciplines" and to make generalizations across historical cases.&lt;ref name=founders&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1170928 Editors' Foreword], 1976. ''Social Science History'', 1(1): i-ii&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue came out in the fall of 1976.&lt;ref name=founders/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lccn.loc.gov/77640161 Library of Congress Catalog Record: Social Science History]&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's articles that are most-accessed and cited through [[JSTOR]] are about [[social movements|social]] and [[political movements]] and associated narratives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/action/showMostAccessedArticles?journalCode=socisciehist ''Social Science History'': Most accessed] at JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/action/showMostCitedArticles?journalCode=socisciehist ''Social Science History'': Most cited] at JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Social Science History Association" was formed in 1976 as an interdisciplinary group with a journal ''[[Social Science History]]'' and an annual convention. The goal was to incorporate in historical studies perspectives from all the social sciences, especially political science, sociology and economics. The pioneers shared a commitment to quantification. However, by the 1980s the first blush of quantification had worn off, as critics complained that quantification undervalued the role of contingency, and warned against a naive positivism. Meanwhile quantification  became well-established inside economics, in the field of cliometrics, as well as in political science. In history, quantification remained central to demographic studies, but slipped behind in political and social history.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey J. Graff, "The Shock of the 'New’ (Histories)': Social Science Histories and Historical Literacies," ''Social Science History'' 25.4 (2001) 483-533  in Project Muse&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Carl Hovland]] and his colleagues worked at the War Department upon this during the 1940s and then continued experimental studies at [[Yale University]]. They built upon the work of researchers in the first half of the 20th century who had developed a ''Source-Message-Channel-Receiver'' model of communication and, with [[Muzafer Sherif]], developed this as part of their theories of persuasion and [[social judgment theory|social judgement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Self |first=Charles C |chapter=Credibility |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QehvhW0wA9AC&amp;pg=PA424 |pages=424–5 |title=An Integrated approach to communication theory and research |editor1-last=Salwen |editor1-first=Michael B. |editor2-last=Stacks |editor2-first=Don W|isbn=9780805816310 |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGrbK6_3KeEC&amp;pg=PA297 |pages=297–299 |title=Communication Yearbook |volume=27 |first=Pamela J. |last=Kalbfleisch |year=2003 |isbn= 978-0-8058-4819-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hovland1951&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovland|first=Carl I.|author2=Weiss, Walter |title=The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=1951|volume=15|issue=4|pages=635|doi=10.1086/266350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tellis2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tellis |first=Gerald J. |title=Effective Advertising: Understanding When, How, and Why Advertising Works |publisher=SAGE Publications |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-7619-2253-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
'''Source credibility theory''' is an established theory that explains how communication's persuasiveness is affected by the perceived credibility of the source of the communication.&lt;ref name=Hovland1951/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berlo1969&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berlo|first=David K.|author2=Lemert, James B. |author3=Mertz, Robert J. |title=Dimensions for Evaluating the Acceptability of Message Sources|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|date=1969|volume=33|issue=4|pages=563–576|doi=10.1086/267745|jstor=2747566}}&lt;/ref&gt; The credibility of all communication, regardless of format, has been found to be heavily influenced by the ''perceived'' credibility of the source of that communication.&lt;ref name=Lowry2013/&gt;

The idea of credibility was first derived from [[Aristotle]] who argued that the speaker's reliability must be built and established in speech and that what the speaker did or said before such a speech was not of importance. Aristotle divided the aspects of persuasion into three categories: [[ethos]] (credibility), [[pathos]] (emotion) and [[logos]] (logic). As credibility refers to people believing who they trust, emotion and logic indicate a person's emotional connection and means of reasoning to convince one of a particular argument and/or speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aristotle|title=Rhetoric|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area of source credibility is studied for practical applications in [[communication]], [[marketing]], [[law]], and [[political science]].&lt;ref name="Tellis2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marcus1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus |first=George E. |title=With Malice Toward Some: How People Make Civil Liberties Judgments |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date= 1995 |isbn=978-0-521-43997-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaller1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaller |first=John R. |title=The Nature and Originss of Mass Opinion |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions==
There are several dimensions of credibility that affect how an audience will perceive the speaker: competence, extraversion, composure, character, and sociability. These dimensions can be related to [[John R. P. French|French]] &amp; [[Bertram Raven|Raven]]'s [[French and Raven's five bases of power|five bases of power]] (see below). These characteristics are fluid and affect each other as well as the speaker's transactional credibility. One dimension may strengthen the speaker's credibility if he/she struggles in another.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann /&gt;

The audience can perceive these attributes through certain behaviors in which the speaker delivers results, is concise and direct with the audience members. If a speaker displays characteristics of honesty, integrity, sincerity, and can show that they are trustworthy and ethical, the audience will be more inclined to believe the message being communicated to them, even if they do not remember every aspect of the interaction. They will, however, recall how the presenter made them feel, how they took in the information and what they may share with others once the presentation has concluded.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann /&gt;

For instance, if a speaker presents the audience with a short clip and includes a witty joke at the conclusion of the video to drive the point home, members of the audience may only remember the joke. Although the joke may only be a small element of the entire speech, someone will recall it and share it with others and perhaps speak kindly of the speaker and wish to interact with that person again, or promise to purchase product or feel inclined to tell anyone who will listen about what they learned. This is when terminal credibility comes into play, but is dependent on how well the speaker presented the information to the audience.

Speakers must also present themselves to be likable since people are more inclined to trust those they generally like or feel comfortable with in a room. Being friendly, easy going, warmhearted, nice and kind can carry the speaker into a very comfortable space with the audience. Once the audience is at ease, the speaker can generally present their information, and it will be perceived positively.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann /&gt;

The late Dr. James C. McCroskey ([[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]) was known for his research in the dimensions of source credibility. His scales for the measurement of source credibility have been widely used in communication research. He noted in his 1975 article, "Image of Mass Media News Sources", that "the available scales for the measurement of source credibility should not be assumed to be universally applicable measures of source credibility."&lt;ref name=McCroskey1975&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCroskey|first=James C.|author2=Jenson, Thomas A. |title=Image of Mass Media News Sources|journal=Journal of Broadcasting|date=1975|volume=19|issue=2|series=2|pages=169–180|doi=10.1080/08838157509363777}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his research and his proposed scale from 1975 are still foundations for source credibility research.

In McCroskey's work, he further breaks down each dimension as follows:&lt;ref name=McCroskey1975/&gt;

=== Competence ===

The measurement of competence is based on seven values. These values are qualification, expertise, reliability, believability, openness (i.e. intellectual vs. narrow), value, and currency (i.e., informed vs. uninformed).

=== Character ===

The measurement of character has four values. These are kindness, sympathy, selflessness (i.e., unselfish vs. selfish), and virtue.

=== Sociability ===

The measurement of sociability has three values. These are friendliness, cheer, and temperament (i.e., good natured vs. irritable). Character and sociability may be combined by some researchers. In that case, researchers will employ the seven values under one "Character-Sociability" measurement.

=== Composure ===

Four seemingly synonymous values are assigned to the measurement of composure. These are excitability (composed vs. excitable), calmness (calm vs. anxious), tension (relaxed vs. tense), and poise (poised vs. nervous).

=== Extroversion ===

Like composure, extroversion is composed of four seemingly synonymous values. These are aggressiveness, boldness, talkativeness (i.e. talkative vs. silent), and voice (i.e., verbal vs. quiet).

Dr. McCroskey's research concluded that of the five dimensions of credibility, competence, character and sociability were the most important in establishing and maintaining credibility.&lt;ref name=McCroskey1975/&gt;

==Dynamics==
[[File:Dynamics of Source Credibility.jpg|thumb|Dynamics of source credibility]]
Initial credibility is established before a speaker appears before an audience to deliver a particular message. If there are few people in the audience who know the speaker, the level of credibility is at a low, and just the opposite can apply if the speaker is known. The levels are incredibly high with well-known authors, personalities, celebrities, politicians, professors and the like. For instance, the credibility would be incredibly low if a recently published author walked on a stage as opposed to [[Stephen King]] gracing the place with his presence. One simply has more of a trust/believable factor than the other.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Buhlmann|first=Hans|title=A Course in Credibility Theory and its Applications|date=2006|publisher=Springer Publishing|location=New York|author2=Gisler, Alois }}&lt;/ref&gt;

B.J. Fogg identified initial credibility as surface credibility in his 2003 book ''Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do.'' He defined it as credibility that derives from "initial judgments based on surface traits such as a persons' looks, his or her dress, or hairstyle"&lt;ref name=Fogg2003&gt;{{cite book|last=Fogg|first=B.J.|title=Persuasive technology using computers to change what we think and do|date=2003|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9781558606432|page=132|edition=[Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same can be said for [[advertising|advertisements]]. Generally, people are familiar with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Puma SE|Puma]] and [[New Balance]]. A fairly new shoe company would have to work harder to gain customers. If a person/company is virtually unknown, they must create a sense of trust, believability in themselves and their product. People need to see evidence that the person/company can be trusted.  The well-known person/company has to live up to the previous expectations and not disappoint those who have shown up to see them speak and possibly purchase product. The advertising and [[marketing]] industry calls this [[brand management]].&lt;ref name=Buhlmann/&gt;

Transactional credibility is based on what takes place after initial credibility is established and during the course of interaction. Several factors affect credibility at this stage. How the audience receives the speaker's message, if the speaker will make a new or reaffirm old impressions, and how the speaker conveys his/her confidence or lack thereof are just a few. These factors could affect credibility either way for the speaker and affect how well the speaker's message is received. Either consciously or subconsciously, the audience examines the speaker's competence, likeability, passion, character, and, depending on the environment of the interaction, professionalism. To maintain credibility, the speaker should be knowledgeable about the subject, sincere in his/her approach, enthusiastic and even relaxed. All of this will make the audience lean more towards trusting and having faith in the speaker rather than the opposite. In this sense, the audience comes with an expectation and hopes to leave with a better feeling about themselves as it relates to the person, product and/or company.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann/&gt;

Terminal credibility refers to what the audience takes away with them once the interaction has concluded. If the audience felt the speaker had good dimensions of source credibility, the terminal credibility will be high. On the other hand, if the speaker was incompetent, lacked character, did not maintain composure, and came off as unsociable and introverted, the terminal credibility will be low. This final form of credibility hinges on how the audience perceives the speaker and if the speaker uses valid information to get specific points across to those listening. Terminal credibility in one interaction will affect initial credibility in the next.

For example, a teacher delivers a lecture and informs the students that the works of [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]] are not considered [[magical realism]] and uses one article in which to defend this argument to make it fit the speech. If students are intrigued and decide to go and delve further into the works of Marquez and finds several articles to prove that the author not only uses magical realism, but is credited with being its founder, then the credibility of the instructor is tarnished, and the students may not trust what is said in the classroom for the remainder of the school year. To ensure that the terminal credibility is positive, enhancing the speech itself is beneficial. A connection should be made with the audience, common ground displayed and speaking with conviction. The key is to build a substantial rapport with the audience so that the terminal credibility is positive.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann/&gt;

==Five bases of power==
{{Main| French and Raven's five bases of power}}
Source credibility has an explicit effect on the bases of power used in persuasion.&lt;ref name=Nesler1993&gt;{{Cite journal | journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=23 |issue=17 |pages=1407–1425 |year=1993 |first=Mitchell S. |last=Nesler |first2=Herman |last2=Aguinis |first3=Brian M. |last3=Quigley |first4=James T. |last4=Tedeschi |title=The Effect of Credibility on Perceived Power |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1993.tb01040.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Source credibility, the bases of power, and objective power, which is established based on variables such as position or title, are interrelated. The levels of each have a direct relationship in the manipulation and levels of one another.

The [[social psychologist]]s [[John R. P. French]] and [[Bertram Raven]] introduced the five bases of power: Coercive, Reward, Legitimate, Referent, and Expert.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven&gt;French, J. R. P., Raven, B. H. The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright and A. Zander. Group dynamics. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by Raven's subsequent identification in 1965 of a sixth separate and distinct base of power: informational power.&lt;ref name= Raven1965&gt;Raven, B. H. (1965). Social influence and power. In I.D. Steiner &amp; M. Fishbein (Eds.), Current studies in social psychology (pp. 371–382). New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reward power ===

Reward power is based on the perception that the persuading agent has the ability to provide reward, either positive or a decrease in negative result, for the target of the influence.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven/&gt; Character and sociability are dimensions of credibility that can help establish reward power.

=== Coercive power ===

Coercive power is based on the perception that the persuading agent has the ability to provide negative results, such as punishment or other reprimand, for the target of the influence.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven/&gt;

=== Legitimate power ===

Legitimate power is based on the perception that the persuading agent has the right, such as through a specific role or position, to influence and obtain compliance from the target of the influence.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven/&gt;

=== Referent power ===

Referent power is based on the identification with or association with persuading agent by the target of the influence.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven/&gt; Character, composure, extroversion and sociability are the dimensions of credibility that help establish referent power.

=== Expert power ===

Expert power is based on the perception that the persuading agent has special knowledge that can be provided to the target of the influence.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven/&gt; Competence is the single dimension of credibility that can be directly linked to establishing expert power.

=== Informational power ===

Informational power is based on the information, or logical argument, that the persuading agent can provide information or obtain information for the target of the influence.&lt;ref name= Raven1965/&gt;

The relationship between measures of power and credibility correlate considerably with one another, indicating that the French and Raven bases of power are not statistically independent concepts. The level of objective power affects the relationship between credibility and perceived social power. Credibility has a direct effect on perceived power. Therefore, individuals with the highest credibility also have the most perceived social power on all of the power bases. When individuals have a low amount of objective power, credibility significantly affects social power ratings.  High credibility increases judgments of perceived reward, coercive, referent, and legitimate powers. Expert powers are also influenced positively, but do not correlate at the highest levels of credibility. Therefore, the highest amount of credibility does not elevate perceived expert powers to the highest levels. However, credibility does not have considerable influence on the perceived social power of individuals with high initial objective power, due to perceptions of powerfulness based on this power.&lt;ref name=Nesler1993/&gt;

==In interpersonal relationships==
[[Interpersonal relationship|Interpersonal]] credibility is based on a listener's perceptions of a speaker's expertness, reliability, intentions, activeness, personal attractiveness and the majority opinion of the listener's associates. First impressions play a significant role in interpersonal credibility and may be enduring.&lt;ref name=Griffin1967&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=K.|title=The Contribution of Studies of Source Credibility to a Theory of Interpersonal Trust in the Communication Process|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1967|volume=68|issue=2|pages=104–120|doi=10.1037/h0024833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both children and adults take confidence and accuracy into account when judging credibility. Adults also take into account calibration (i.e., the speaker's own estimation of their accuracy as demonstrated by confidence and accuracy) and change their assessments of credibility if the speaker is revealed to have inaccurate calibration (e.g. is over- or underconfident). Children believe confident speakers over ones lacking in confidence and do not appear to take calibration into account, possibly because children have not reached the same stage of cognitive development as adults.&lt;ref name=Tenney2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tenney|first=E.|author2=Small, J. |author3=Kondrad, R. |author4=Jaswal, V. |author5= Spellman, B. |title=Accuracy, Confidence, and Calibration: How Young Children and Adults Assess Credibility|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2011|volume=47|issue=4|pages=1065–1077 |doi=10.1037/a0023273 |pmid=21443337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
Candidates in [[political campaign]]s use credibility extensively to influence the attitudes and opinions of [[voting|voters]].&lt;ref name= Druckman1965&gt;{{Cite journal | journal= The Journal of Politics |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1180–1202 |year=2004 |first=James N. |last=Druckman |first2=Lawrence R. |last2=Jacobs |first3=Eric |last3= Ostermeier |title= Candidate Strategies to Prime Issues and Image |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3816.2004.00295.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They attempt to prime, or connect specific issues or personality traits, to persuade voters to focus on those issues favorable to the candidate to influence a more positive opinion of the candidate.

A candidate's credibility is important in determining the effectiveness of political advertising.&lt;ref name= Lee2011&gt;{{Cite journal | journal= The Social Science Journal |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=659–671 |year=2011 |first=Yu-Kang |last=Lee |first2=Chun-Tuan |last2=Chang |title= Missing ingredients in political advertising: The right formula for political sophistication and candidate credibility |doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2011.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisements for candidates with high credibility have a greater impact on influencing audiences and potential voters. Low credibility reduces the impact and influence of negative or comparative advertising supporting the candidate. A candidate with high credibility will better withstand the influences of any negative advertising.

Another application of credibility in politics is endorsements by celebrities attempting to use their status to influence voters.&lt;ref name= Morin2012&gt;Morin, D. T., Ivory, J. D., &amp; Tubbs, M. (2012, December). Celebrity and politics: Effects of endorser credibility and sex on voter attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors. Social Science Journal, Volume 49, Issue 4, p. 413-420&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrity credibility is based on numerous attributes, the most influential of which are trustworthiness and competence. High-credibility and low-credibility celebrity endorsers are perceived very differently. However, the level of credibility of celebrity endorsers, while important in the conveyance of their messages, does not influence the credibility of or attitudes toward candidates. They, therefore, may not change the political public opinions or voting behaviors of their audience.

==Media credibility==
Media credibility refers to the perceived believability of [[content (media)|media content]] "beyond any proof of its contentions."&lt;ref name=West1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=Mark Douglas|title=Validating a Scale for the Measurement of Credibility: A Covariance Structure Modeling Approach|journal=Journalism Quarterly|date=1994|volume=71|issue=1|pages=159–168|doi=10.1177/107769909407100115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its roots are in Hovland's classic persuasion research on source credibility, media credibility research has shifted the focus from characteristics of individual, personal sources to characteristics of media behaviors such as objectivity, accuracy, fairness, and lack of bias.&lt;ref name=Gaziano1986&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaziano|first=Cecilie|author2=McGrath, Kristin |title=Measuring the Concept of Credibility|journal=Journalism Quarterly|date=1986|volume=63|issue=3|pages=451–462|doi=10.1177/107769908606300301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research has found that media credibility is an important part, along with message characteristics and audience characteristics, of effective communication.&lt;ref name=Zhu2002/&gt;

According to [[Dan Gillmor]] when becoming [http://mediactive.com/book/table-of-contents-2/ mediactive] (i.e., an active consumer of media) source credibility is a very important aspect. He suggests that users be skeptical; they should be on the lookout for [[fallacy|fallacies]], such as the two-side fallacy, and people who are paid to persuade. He also believes that people need to exercise judgment, the idea of assuming that everything is lying is just as much a problem as assuming that everything posted or published is the truth.  Opening your mind is another important concept when considering source credibility. Most people are likely to consider a source credible if the content reflects ideas that the user also holds. Finally, Gillmor advises that people keep asking questions and follow up on sources to help realize their credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillmor|first=Dan|title=Mediactive|url=http://mediactive.com/2-0-chapter-2-becoming-an-active-user-principles/|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credibility is a core value of American [[journalism]].&lt;ref name=Miller2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=A.|author2=Kurpius, D. |title=A Citizen-Eye View of Television News Source Credibility|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=2010|pages=137–156|doi=10.1177/0002764210376315|volume=54|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Credibility also is essential to the business aspect of the media. Loss of credibility may translate to loss of [[audience]]. [[Journalists]] themselves view loss of credibility as the biggest issue facing the industry.&lt;ref name=Doherty2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doherty|first=C.|title=The Public Isn't Buying Press Credibility|journal=Nieman Reports|date=2005|issue=Summer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the media occupies a significant part of people's daily lives, it significantly impacts the [[social constructionism|social construction of reality]], the shape of public consciousness and the direction of [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] change.&lt;ref name=Bandura2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=A.|title=Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication|journal=Media Psychology|date=2001|pages=265–299|doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0303_03|volume=3|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, media's credibility is as important as the message itself.

=== Journalist credibility ===

The actions of some journalists have raised questions about credibility. [[Joe McGinniss]] was criticized for misleading accused killer [[Jeffrey MacDonald]] about whether or not he believed MacDonald innocent. [[Janet Cooke]] fabricated a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning story in [[The Washington Post]]. [[Jack Kelley (journalist)|Jack Kelley]] fabricated stories that appeared in [[USA Today]] over a period of years. [[Jayson Blair]] plagiarized and fabricated [[New York Times]] stories. [[Dan Rather]]'s career at [[CBS News]] ended after issues surrounding the credibility of a story. Numerous other examples of journalism [[scandal]]s center on credibility issues. But, while credibility issues may end an individual journalist's career, those scandals do not seem to have much impact on public opinion; the public is mostly unaware of individual transgressions; when it is aware, it is not shocked; a majority of the public surveyed said news organizations sometimes made up stories.&lt;ref name=Doherty2005/&gt;

=== Source credibility ===

[[Television]] viewers distinguish between the credibility of official (or elite) and citizen (or nonelite) [[Source (journalism)|sources]].&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt; Expert ratings alter subjects' judgments of source credibility.&lt;ref name=Markham1965&gt;{{cite book|last=Markham|first=D.H.|title=The Dimensions of Source Credibility of Television Newscasters|date=1965|publisher=The University of Oklahoma|location=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Race (human classification)|Race]] does not affect credibility. Debate about the credibility of [[elite]] versus nonelite sources dates back to at least the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt; [[Walter Lippmann]] argued in favor of elite sources in his 1922 book [[Public Opinion]]. [[John Dewey]] argued citizens are credible sources in his 1927 book [[The Public and its Problems]]. Elite, male sources outnumber nonelite, female and minority sources in American journalism.  Television news viewers perceive stories with elite sources as significantly more credible than stories with nonelite sources. Source titles and manner of dress played a larger role in viewer estimations of credibility than did either race or even what the sources said on air.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;

=== Hard news and soft news ===

Journalists and television viewers distinguish between hard news and soft news (or [[infotainment]]). Television viewers find hard news more credible than soft news.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;

=== Media type ===

Whether a story appears in a [[magazine]], [[newspaper]] or on television may also affect credibility. The credibility assigned to different media varies by race and gender of news consumers.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;

=== No-source stories ===

Television viewers do not assign significantly more credibility to stories that include sources than they do to no-source stories.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;  This aligns with research suggesting that citing authorities in speeches that advocate a position makes little difference in shifting listener opinion.&lt;ref name=Markham1965/&gt;

=== Overall media credibility ===

Viewers do not hold broadcast news as particularly credible and the credibility of broadcast news in the public's eyes is in decline. There is increasing evidence of public skepticism of media content.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt; The [[General Social Survey]] charts a slide in media credibility ratings since the late 1980s. Contributory factors may include a perception that powerful people and organizations influence the press, doubt about media fairness, doubt about journalists' willingness to admit error, cynicism about standards and performance, and questions about values, morals and partisanship.&lt;ref name=Doherty2005/&gt;

=== New media ===

New media, such as [[blog]]s, are changing journalism. One study found that random citizens who contributed to a blog increased their credibility over time, to the point that traditional media outlets quoted them as sources.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;

=== Education ===

Less educated people trust media content more than more educated people.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;

=== Media Credibility Index (from the International Council for Press and Broadcasting)===

The Media Credibility Index is a relatively new publication, produced annually by the [[Next Century Foundation]] (NCF), together with the [[International Council for Press and Broadcasting]]. It was launched at the NCF's 2011 [[International Media Awards]]. It is currently being developed to try and cover a wide range of publications, assessing them in terms of press freedom, accuracy, incitement, bias, sensitivity and transparency, awarding plus or minus points as is seen fit. Points awarded are only based on items reported to the International Council for Press and Broadcasting that have been posted on the NCF media blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncfpeace.org/drupal/aggregator |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724053941/http://www.ncfpeace.org/drupal/aggregator |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Index is to foster good journalism, responsible editing, balanced broadcasting and more responsible treatment of media professionals. It mostly focuses on Anglo-American media, the Middle East and South Asia.

==The Internet==
The development of the internet and its delivery of online information have created a new information environment that can affect perceptions of the credibility of that information. Online information can be created by amateur sources (e.g., [[blog]]s and [[citizen journalism]]) posted on personal sites or on news websites (e.g., comments on news stories, [[CNN]]'s [[iReport]]). Seeking to satiate the insatiable online audience with "instant" news can result in inaccuracies and premature conclusions. Online "[[opinion poll|polls]]" intended to allow the audience to express opinions are insufficient in that they are neither random nor representative samples. The freedom for anyone to publish anything and the convergence of information genres (i.e., [[infotainment]]) affect editorial review and credibility.&lt;ref name=Rubin2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Rebecca B.|title=Communication Research Measures II: A Sourcebook|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=Florence, KY|page=96|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/sooner/Doc?id=10305773&amp;ppg=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the impact of the internet on value orientations in mainland [[China]] by Jonathan Zhu and Zhou He ([[University of Hong Kong]]) revealed that credibility of the internet was far more important than conventional media to Chinese citizens. This may be because conventional media has a historical record of being credible whereas internet sources, especially [[user-generated content]], can be questionable.&lt;ref name=Zhu2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Jonathan J. H.|author2=He, Zhou |title=Information Accessibility, User Sophistication, and Source Credibility: The Impact of the Internet on Value Orientations in Mainland China|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=January 2002|volume=7|issue=2|pages=0|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2002.tb00138.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Websites are often the first or only interaction consumers have with a company. Also, these interactions are usually short- in the magnitude of a few seconds to a few minutes. Source credibility can be established online in a number of ways to include [[logo]] design, website sophistication, and [[citation|source citation]]. Lowry, Wilson and Haig (2013) showed that well designed logos that are [[synergy|synergistic]] with the company's product/service can trigger positive credibility judgments about the company's website and results in greater trust and willingness to interact with the company. These effects are magnified when the [[website design]] extends and complements the logo design.&lt;ref name=Lowry2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowry|first=Paul Benjamin|author2=Wilson, David W. |author3=Haig, William L. |title=A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words: Source Credibility Theory Applied to Logo and Website Design for Heightened Credibility and Consumer Trust|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction|date=June 2013|volume=30|issue=1|pages=63–93|ssrn=2273535|accessdate=|doi=10.1080/10447318.2013.839899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional source credibility theory research has shown that [[color scheme]]s and other [[visual language|visual elements]] can predict perceptions of credibility.&lt;ref name=Gianluigi2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gianluigi|first=Guido|author2=Prete, M. Irene |author3=Sammarco, Luigi |title=Prototypes Versus Examples: A New Model of Online Credibility for Commercial Websites|journal=Journal of Targeting, Measurement &amp; Analysis for Marketing|date=March 2010|volume=18|issue=1|pages=3–16|doi=10.1057/jt.2009.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[social media]] sites, source credibility can be ascribed based on the number of followers and the ratio between followers and follows a user has. Research by Westerman, Spence and Van Der Heide (2011) shows that there is a curvilinear effect for the number of followers, "such that having too many or too few connections results in lower judgments of expertise and trustworthiness." A narrow gap between followers and follows may also result in a higher perception of competence (i.e., if a user has many followers but does not follow many others, that person may be regarded as less of an expert).&lt;ref name=Westerman2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westerman|first=David |author2=Spence, Patric R. |author3=Van Der Heide, Brandon |title=A Social Network as Information: The Effect of System Generated Reports of Connectedness on Credibility on Twitter|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2012|volume=28|pages=199–206|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research showed that frequency of updates led to higher perception of credibility.&lt;ref name=Klout&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Chad|author2=Spence, Patric R. |author3=Gentile, Christina J. |author4=Edwards, America |author5= Edwards, Autumn |title=How Much Klout Do You Have... A Test of System Generated Cues on Source Credibility|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2013|volume=29|issue=5|pages=A12–A16|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Klout|Klout.com]] is a [[social analytics|social media analytic]] website and [[mobile application software|app]] that ranks users according to online social influence and assigns a "Klout Score". Research by Westerman et al. has shown that a higher "Klout Score" results in higher perceived competence and character but has no bearing on the caring (i.e., sociability) dimension of credibility.&lt;ref name=Klout/&gt;

Focus groups have also shown that users evaluation criteria of [[blog]] credibility slightly differed from that of traditional media credibility. Participants indicated that the source of the blog was the first component evaluated and factors such as the source's knowledge, passion, transparency, reliability, and influence impacted credibility judgements. Participants also indicated that the blog's message/content needed to be authentic, insightful, informative, consistent, accurate, timely, popular, fair, and focused.&lt;ref name=Klout/&gt;

==Popular culture==
Source credibility has an enormous role in [[popular culture]]. [[Celebrity]] [[Testimonial|endorsement]] is a popular [[communication]] strategy in advertising and relies heavily on source credibility, at least in the [[United States]]. Dr. Roobina Ohanian developed a scale for assessing celebrity credibility and assessed the impact of celebrity credibility on consumers' purchase intentions. Her scale measured three components: attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise. Though not as precise as McCroskey's scale, Ohanian's scale has been widely used in the United States.&lt;ref name=Ohanian1990&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ohanian|first=Roobina|title=Construction and Validation of a Scale to Measure Celebrity Endorsers' Perceived Expertise, Trustworthiness, and Attractiveness|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=1990|volume=19|issue=3|pages=39–52|issn=0091-3367|doi=10.1080/00913367.1990.10673191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kan2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Kan|first=Ying Che Ruth|title=Dissertation: Celebrity Advertising and Source Credibility in Hong Kong|date=2012|publisher=University of Newcastle|location=Newcastle, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional sports|Professional athletes]]' credibility is also important to pop culture. An athlete's credibility differs a little, however, from typical celebrity endorsers. Research indicates that negative information about an endorsing athlete can lead to negative impact directed toward the endorsed brand or product. Issues outside the realm of sport have been considered the source of negative information about an athlete (e.g., a [[scandal]] or [[crime]]). For example, when [[Tiger Woods]]' sex scandal became known to the public, [[Gatorade]] immediately severed its ties. Likewise, when [[Michael Phelps]] was indicted for [[substance abuse|illegal drug use]], [[Kellog's]] dropped him from their [[advertising campaign]]s.&lt;ref name=Koo2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koo|first=Gi-Yong|author2=Ruihley, Brody J |author3=Dittmore, Stephen W |title=Impact of Perceived On-Field Performance on Sport Celebrity Source Credibility|journal=Sport Marketing Quarterly|date=2012|volume=21|pages=147–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic performance, however, has come into question of whether it affects source credibility and, remarkably, it does. A study by Koo, Ruihley, and Dittmore (2012) shows that athletic performance is seen subconsciously as a reflection of a celebrity athlete's [[trustworthiness]]. Additionally, maintained or increased athletic performance following negative news may help the celebrity athlete to maintain or quickly regain his/her credibility.&lt;ref name=Koo2012/&gt;

Celebrity source credibility goes beyond product/brand endorsement, though. [[Oprah Winfrey]], for example, was touted as the "doyenne of [[daytime television]]," and, as such, had an incredible following. She was able to utilize her credibility in a number of ways. Her [[Oprah's Book Club|book club]] would bring nearly instant success to any featured author. Her [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|talk show]] would bring out the best (and worst) in its guests. And, most recently, she has been able to use her credibility and past success as the foundation for a media empire.&lt;ref name=Oprah2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Oprah's Achievement|newspaper=USA TODAY|date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical attractiveness is another component relative to pop culture that has been researched. [[Physical attractiveness]] has been linked to credibility as an aspect of likability which can be classified under sociability or trustworthiness.&lt;ref name=Patzer1983&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patzer|first=Gordon L.|title=Source Credibility as a Function of Communicator Physical Attractiveness|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=1983|volume=11|issue=2|pages=229–241|doi=10.1016/0148-2963(83)90030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research shows age has an effect on credibility. Steinhaus and Lapitsky showed that women of varying ages ascribe more credibility to older [[Model (profession)|fashion models]] than younger ones. Their research concluded that "similarity between older models and older consumers resulted in significant positive effects for source credibility and interpersonal attraction. Younger consumers evaluated older models higher than younger models on one dimension of credibility, but indicated no other significant differences in attitudes toward younger or older models."&lt;ref name=Steinhaus1986&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinhaus|first=Nancy H.|author2=Lapitsky, Mary |title=Fashion Model's Age as an Influence on Consumers' Attitudes and Purchase Intent|journal=Family &amp; Consumer Sciences|date=March 1986|volume=14|issue=3|pages=294–305|doi=10.1177/1077727X8601400303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Summit Series was founded in April 2008 by Elliott Bisnow, Brett Leve, Jeff Rosenthal, Jeremy Schwartz, and Ryan Begelman. Summit was launched with an invitation-only event organized for young entrepreneurs to meet and gain advice from one another that was hosted at a ski resort in [[Park City, Utah]] and attended by 19 people.&lt;ref name=cnet&gt;{{cite news |title=Young entrepreneurs bond on the beach|work=CNET|author=Courtney McCarthy|date=November 25, 2008|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/young-entrepreneurs-bond-on-the-beach/|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes2011&gt;{{cite news |title=Summit Series Takes the Party to the Open Seas|work=Forbes Magazine|author=Steven Bertoni|date=April 6, 2011|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0425/focus-summit-series-branson-thiel-schmooze-cruise.html|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2008, the group held a similar gathering in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=inc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inc.com/30under30/2009/profile_summit_series.html |title=30 Under 30 |date=2009 |work=Inc.

[[File:Winn Army Community Hospital Pharmacy Stays Online During Power Outage.jpg| thumb | alt=Pharmacists filling prescriptions at a computer | Pharmacy personnel deliver [[medical prescription]]s electronically; remote delivery of [[prescription drugs]] is a feature of '''telepharmacy'''.]]
'''Telepharmacy''' is the delivery of [[pharmaceutical care]] via [[telecommunications]] to patients in locations where they may not have direct contact with a [[pharmacist]]. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of [[telemedicine]], as implemented in the field of [[pharmacy]]. Telepharmacy services include [[drug therapy]] monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization for [[prescription drugs]], and monitoring of [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] compliance with the aid of [[teleconferencing]] or [[videoconferencing]]. [[Remote dispensing]] of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities.

The term can also refer to the use of videoconferencing in pharmacy for other purposes, such as providing education, training, and management services to pharmacists and pharmacy staff remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Angaran | first = DM | title = Telemedicine and Telepharmacy: Current Status and Future Implications | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 15 Jul 1999 | volume = 56 | pages = 1405–1426 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/56/14/1405.abstract | issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and drawbacks==
A primary appeal of telepharmacy is its potential to expand access to pharmacy care in smaller rural communities, some of which cannot support a full-time pharmacist or cannot easily recruit a pharmacist to reside in their region. Telepharmacy can potentially give patients in remote locations access to professional pharmacy care that could not be received locally, which can lower costs and improve patient safety through better patient counseling, drug administration monitoring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff | title = Telepharmacy Increases the Safety of Chemotherapy Preparation | journal = [[US Pharmacist]] | date = 19 November 2007 | volume = 32 | number = 11 | page = 73 | url = http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/c/10195/?t=men's_health,chemotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compliance monitoring. Sharing of pharmacists between sites can also decrease costs in existing facilities, which might no longer need to employ a full-time pharmacist.

The potential costs of telepharmacy are broadly the same as those associated with all forms of [[telemedicine]]: potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friesner | first = Daniel L. | last2 = Scott | first2 = David M. | last3 = Rathke | first3 = Ann M. | last4 = Peterson | first4 = Charles D. | last5 = Anderson | first5 = Howard C. | title = Do remote community telepharmacies have higher medication error rates than traditional community pharmacies?

==Implementation==
The implementation of telepharmacy varies by region and jurisdiction. Factors including geography, laws and regulations, and economics influence its implementation.

===Australia===
A form of telepharmacy has been in use by [[Australia]]'s [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]] since 1942. Medical chests containing medications and equipment are placed in remote communities where they can be administered to patients during a [[telehealth]] consultation. Some 3,500 chests were distributed around Australia as of 2006. In one year, [[Queensland]] recorded 21,470 telehealth consultations, of which 13.7% resulted in administration of a medication from a medical chest. The medication types administered most often are [[antibiotic]]s, [[analgesic]]s and [[gastrointestinal medication]]s. This system improves access to both emergency and routine medical care in remote parts of Australia and reduces the need for patients to travel to seek medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Rural Remote Health |year=2008 |issue=Apr-Jun |volume=8 |page=937 |title=Tele-pharmacy in remote medical practice: the Royal Flying Doctor Service Medical Chest Program |last1=Margolis |first1=S. A. |last2=Ypinazar |first2=V. A. |pmid=18489239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application of telepharmacy in Queensland has been the provision of pharmaceutical reviews in rural hospitals that lack on-staff pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicalpharmacy.org.uk/volume1_2/2010/july/july10_commentary.pdf |title=Telepharmacy — opportunity or threat? |first=James |last=Davies |journal=The British Journal of Clinical Pharmacy |volume=2 |date=July–August 2010 |pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although broader use of telepharmacy could help alleviate a shortage of pharmacists, Australia has lagged the United States in its implementation of telepharmacy, partly because doctors, nurses, and other health care workers provide pharmacy services in rural and remote areas where there are no pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/telepharmacy/KimberPetersonTelepharmacy.pdf |title=Telepharmacy—Enabling Technology to Provide Quality Pharmacy Services in Rural and Remote Communities |first1=
Michael B |last1=Kimber |first2=Gregory M |last2=Peterson |journal=Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research |volume=36 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=128–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Implementation of telepharmacy in the United States began in the 2000s. A combination of factors, including [[Medicare Part D|changes in Medicare reimbursement for medications]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Radford | first = Andrea | last2 = Slifkin | first2 = Rebecca | last3 = Fraser | first3 = Roslyn | last4 = Mason | first4 = Michelle | last5 = Mueller | first5 = Keith | title = The Experience of Sole Community Rural Independent Pharmacies with Medicare Part D: Reports from the Field | journal = Policy Paper P2006-3 | publisher = RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis | date = November 2006 | url = http://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/rural/pubs/report/WP87.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Recession|recession of 2007&amp;ndash;8]], led to a decline in the number of independent pharmacies in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boyle | first = Kaitlin | last2 = Ullrich | first2 = Fred | last3 = Mueller | first3 = Keith | title = Independently owned pharmacy closures in rural America, 2003&amp;ndash;2010 | journal = Rural Policy Brief | publisher = RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis | date = June 2011 | url = http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/rupri/publications/policybriefs/2011/Independent%20Pharmacies.pdf| format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the need for alternative means of delivering pharmacy in services in rural communities lacking a full-time pharmacist, several [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] and [[northwestern United States|northwestern]] states with extensive rural areas have led much of the development of policy and implementation methods for telepharmacy.

In 2001, North Dakota became the first U.S. state to pass regulations allowing retail pharmacies to operate without requiring a pharmacist to be physically present. The next year, state agencies and grants established the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project, which now supports more than fifty remote retail and hospital pharmacy sites throughout North Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The North Dakota Telepharmacy Project | url = http://www.ndsu.edu/telepharmacy/ | publisher = North Dakota State University | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this program, a licensed pharmacist at a central site communicates with remote site [[pharmacy technician]]s and patients through [[videoconferencing]]. A 2004 study of the program found that telepharmacy delivered the same quality of pharmacy services as traditional facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Peterson | first = Charles D. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = Howard C., Jr | title = The North Dakota Telepharmacy Project: Restoring and retaining pharmacy services in rural communities | journal = Journal of Pharmacy Technology | year = 2004 | volume = 20 | pages = 28–39 | url = http://www.jpharmtechnol.com/abstracts/volume20/January-February/28.html | doi=10.1177/875512250402000107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a study of the operation of one North Dakota telepharmacy business from 2002 through 2004 found that, while medication inventory turnover was lower than the industry average, the remote sites were able to be operated profitably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Khan | first = Shamima | last2 = Snyder | first2 = Herbert W. | last3 = Rathke | first3 = Ann M. | last4 = Scott | first4 = David M. | last5 = Peterson | first5 = Charles D. | title = Is there a successful business case for telepharmacy? | journal = Telemedicine Journal and e-Health | publisher = [[American Telemedicine Association]] | date = April 2008 | volume = 14 | number = 3 | pages = 235–244 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2007.0045 | pmid=18570546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success and expansion of this program were an inspiration and model for programs and laws in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolpack | first = Dave | title = Telepharmacy project expands across country | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | date = 12 September 2008 | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-12-virtual-pharmacy_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community Health Association of Spokane, a network of [[community health centers]] in [[Spokane, Washington]], started a telepharmacy program in 2001. The program delivers remote medication dispensing and health counseling to patients at six urban and rural clinics; remote site personnel are connected to pharmacists at the base site by [[videoconferencing]]. A survey found that most patients at the remote sites strongly agreed or agreed that they would have had difficulty affording their medications without this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clifton | first = G. Dennis | last2 = Byer | first2 = Heather | last3 = Heaton | first3 = Kristi | last4 = Haberman | first4 = Deborah J. | last5 = Gill | first5 = Harbir | title = Provision of Pharmacy Services to Underserved Populations Via Remote Dispensing and Two-Way Videoconferencing | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = Dec 15, 2003 | volume = 60 | pages = 2577–2582 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/60/24/2577.abstract | issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaska Native Medical Center]], a hospital in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], providing telehealth services to [[Alaska Native]] populations, established a telepharmacy program in 2003 to improve its pharmaceutical services in rural native settlements. The [[American Society of Health-System Pharmacists]] gave the program its 2006 Award for Excellence in Medication-Use Safety, concluding that the use of telepharmacy had improved access to pharmaceutical care and enabled pharmacists to monitor medication safety and encourage medication adherence, as well as making pharmacy care more cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashpfoundation.org/MainMenuCategories/Awards/AwardforExcellenceinMedicationUseSafety/2006AwardsRecipients.aspx | title = 2006 Awards Recipients | publisher = ASHP Foundation | accessdate = 6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] Bureau of Medicine operates a large-scale telepharmacy program for the use of service personnel. After piloting the program in 2006 at [[Naval Hospital Pensacola]] in Florida and Naval Hospital Bremerton in Washington, in 2010 the Navy expanded it to more sites throughout the world. This program represents the largest implementation of telepharmacy to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Traynor | first = Kate | title = Navy takes Telepharmacy Worldwide | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 15 July 2010 | volume = 67 | pages = 1134–1136 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/67/14/1134.full | doi = 10.2146/news100051 | issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]] passed a Telehealth Advancement Act in 2011 to update the state's legal definitions of telehealth, simplify approval processes for telehealth services, and broaden the range of medical services that may be provided via telehealth. The law establishes legal parity between the direct and remote delivery of pharmacy care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Telehealth Advancement Act | publisher = Center for Connected Health Policy, California | url = http://cchpca.org/telehealth-advancement-act | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iowa]]'s first telepharmacy opened in September 2012 after receiving a three-year waiver from the Iowa Board of Pharmacy that allows the facility to operate without a pharmacist on-site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Miller | first = Vanessa | title = Telepharmacy could save rural Iowa sites | newspaper = [[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]] | location = Cedar Rapids, Iowa | date = 18 October 2012 | url = http://thegazette.com/2012/10/18/pharmacy-draft/ | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study of the various American states' [[rural health]] offices found that telepharmacy in rural medical facilities varied in prevalence across the United States but was still not widespread, and that many states had not yet clearly defined regulations for telepharmacy in hospitals.&lt;ref name="Casey1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Casey | first = Michelle M. | last2 = Sorensen | first2 = Todd D. | last3 = Elias | first3 = Walter | last4 = Knudson | first4 = Alana | last5 = Gregg | first5 = Walter | title = Current practices and state regulations regarding telepharmacy in rural hospitals | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 1 July 2010 | volume = 67 | pages = 1085-1092 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/67/13/1085.abstract | doi = 10.2146/ajhp090531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption and implementation of telepharmacy methods has been slow compared to the spread of the basic technologies involved ([[internet access]], [[Data compression|audio/video compression]] algorithms, [[microphones]] and [[video cameras]]), despite periodic predictions of a forthcoming boom in the industry. Aside from more intangible factors (such as physicians' and pharmacists' personal uneasiness with the lack of physical interaction with patients), the major obstacles to telepharmacy implementation appear to have been the lack of clear legal regulations for telepharmacy, and the lack of network and software systems to manage (and secure) all of the data used in a professional pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Stephania H. | title = What's holding up the telemedicine explosion? | journal = Connected Planet | date = 1 June 1998 | url = http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_whats_holding_telemedicine/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, many of the telepharmacy facilities in active operation were operating as pilot programs or under temporary waivers issued by state regulators because many states still had no clear legal framework for the regulation of remote pharmaceutical sites without pharmacists. Even in states that had regulated retail telepharmacy practices, regulations were often not in place to permit the implementation of telepharmacy in hospital settings.&lt;ref name="Casey1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey2"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Casey | first = Michelle M. | last2 = Elias | first2 = Walter | last3 = Knudson | first3 = Alana | last4 = Gregg | first4 = Walter | title = Implementation of Telepharmacy in Rural Hospitals: Potential for Improving Medication Safety | journal = Final Report #8 | publisher = Upper Midwest Rural Health Research Center | year = 2008 | url = https://www.nodakpharmacy.com/pdfs/UMRHfirstDose.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some pharmacy facilities that might otherwise consider telepharmacy, the cost and complexity of the infrastructure needed to manage patient data across multiple sites can be prohibitive. In addition to the computer hardware required for patient data storage, distribution and teleconferencing, telepharmacy programs must deploy network security tools and procedures adequate to [[Protected health information|protect patient medical information]] in compliance with [[HIPAA]] and other patient privacy regulations. In 2010 the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project estimated that the computer hardware needed for a typical retail installation costs US$17,300 per site, with an additional cost of US$5,000 to buy a mobile cart for a hospital installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Rathke | first = Ann | title = North Dakota Telepharmacy Project: An Update | booktitle = North Dakota Pharmacist Association Convention | date = 23–25 April 2010 | location = Minot, North Dakota | publisher = NDTP | url = http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/telepharmacy/NDTP_PPt__Update.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Adoption of telepharmacy in [[Canada]] began as a response to a nationwide shortage of pharmacists. Canada's first telepharmacy service was started by a hospital in [[Cranbrook, British Columbia]], in June 2003 in order to assist a hospital in a nearby town that was unable to hire a pharmacist. To meet the need for service, a hospital pharmacist in Cranbrook began using telepharmacy technology to oversee pharmacy technicians at the other hospital. A similar service was subsequently extended to other small hospitals in the province; it is also used to provide coverage when a hospital's sole pharmacist is absent due to illness or vacation.&lt;ref name=CADTH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadth.ca/products/environmental-scanning/health-technology-update/issue2/telepharmacy |title=Virtual pharmacists provide long-distance care |journal=Health Technology Update |issue=2 |date=January 2006 |publisher=Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Remote dispensing]] machines for medication began operation in [[Ontario]], Canada, in 2007. After a patient inserts a prescription into the dispensing machine, the prescription is scanned and the patient is connected by telephone videoconference to a pharmacist at a remote site. The pharmacist reviews the prescription, discusses the patient's medication history, and authorizes the machine to dispense medication to the patient. The machines proved successful, with one assessment revealing that 96% of patients using them had their prescription filled in under five minutes.&lt;ref name="BJCP"/&gt; As of 2009, a hospital in [[Ontario]], Canada, was using telepharmacy services in addition to retaining a pharmacist at the hospital; the telepharmacist reviews medication orders, while the on-site pharmacist works with patients and oversees medication safety in the facility. Thus telepharmacy support allows the on-site pharmacist to focus on the more sensitive and nuanced tasks for which physical presence is most helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ross Memorial Hospital, Lindsay, Ontario | journal = Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy | date = September–October 2009 | volume = 62 | number = 5 | page = 424 | pmc=2830020 | pmid=22478928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===

After their success in Canada, remote medication dispensing machines were scheduled to be tested at several hospital locations in the [[United Kingdom]] beginning in 2010.&lt;ref name="BJCP"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.clinicalpharmacy.org.uk/volume1_2/2010/july/july10_news_feature.pdf| title=Remote dispensing machines to be tested in UK hospitals |journal=The British Journal of Clinical Pharmacy |volume=2 |date=July–August 2010 |pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Maxor National Pharmacy Services, a U.S. company, reported that its remote dispensing machines for medication were being used in [[Bahrain]], [[Belgium]], [[Cuba]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Guam]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Spain]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amarillo.com/blog-post/bizstream/2013-04-24/maxor-expands-puerto-rico-operations |title=Maxor expands Puerto Rico operations |author=Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corp. |date=April 25, 2013 |type=press release |work=Amarillo Globe-News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Mannings]] drugstores became the first in [[Hong Kong]] to use videoconferencing to allow patients at outlets without full-time pharmacists to consult with pharmacists at other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Tele-Pharmacy on Show at Mannings Stores in Hong Kong | journal = Thistle: The Magazine of [[Jardine Matheson]] | year = 2010 | volume = 3 | page = 8 | url = http://www.jardines.com/assets/files/NewsAndEvents/thistle/10_vol3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man''''' is a 1962 book by [[Marshall McLuhan]], in which the author analyzes the effects of [[mass media]], especially the [[printing press]], on European [[culture]] and human consciousness. It popularized the term ''[[global village (term)|global village]]'',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.31: "But certainly the electro-magnetic discoveries have recreated the simultaneous "field" in all human affairs so that the human family now exists under conditions of a "global village.""&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the idea that [[mass communication]] allows a village-like mindset to apply to the entire world; and ''Gutenberg Galaxy'',&lt;ref&gt;Note that Marshall McLuhan himself states quite clearly that "although the main theme of this book is the Gutenberg Galaxy or a configuration of events, which lies far ahead of alphabet and of scribal culture, it needs to be known why, without alphabet, there would have been no Gutenberg. McLuhan 1962, p.40"&lt;/ref&gt; which we may regard today to refer to the accumulated body of recorded works of human art and knowledge, especially [[books]].

McLuhan studies the emergence of what he calls Gutenberg Man, the subject produced by the change of [[consciousness]] wrought by the advent of the printed book. Apropos of his axiom, "[[The medium is the message]]," McLuhan argues that [[technology|technologies]] are not simply inventions which people employ but are the means by which people are re-invented. The invention of [[movable type]] was the decisive moment in the change from a culture in which all the senses partook of a common interplay to a tyranny of the visual. He also argued that the development of the [[printing press]] led to the creation of [[nationalism]], [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], domination of [[rationalism]], automatisation of scientific research, uniformation and standardisation of culture and [[Social alienation|alienation]] of [[individual]]s.

Movable type, with its ability to reproduce texts accurately and swiftly, extended the drive toward homogeneity and repeatability already in evidence in the emergence of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspectival art]] and the exigencies of the single "point of view". He writes:

:''the world of visual perspective is one of unified and homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of spoken words. So language was the last art to accept the visual logic of Gutenberg technology, and the first to rebound in the electric age.''&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

==The format of the book—a ''mosaic''==
The book is unusual in its design. McLuhan described it as one which "develops a [[mosaic]] or field approach to its problems".&lt;ref&gt;(McLuhan 1962, first line of the unnamed preface on "page 0")&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic image to be constructed from data and quotations would then reveal "causal operations in history".&lt;ref&gt;(McLuhan 1962, p.0)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book consists of five parts:

* '''Prologue''',&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1"&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Gutenberg Galaxy''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.11-263&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Galaxy Reconfigured''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.265-79. The full title of this "epilogue" is "THE GALAXY RECONFIGURED or the Plight of Mass Man in an Individualist Society.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bibliographic Index''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.281-89&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Index of Chapter Glosses'''.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.291-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body of the book, part 2, "The Gutenberg Galaxy", consists of 107 short "chapters",
many of which are just three, two, or even one page(s) in length.
Such a large collection of small chapters does fit the picture of a mosaic.

Apparently, McLuhan also had some ideas about how to browse a book. ''Marshall McLuhan, the guru of The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (1962), recommends that the browser turn to page 69 of any book and read it. If you like that page, buy the book."&lt;ref&gt;John Sutherland 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Such apparent arbitrariness fits with picking a particular piece (or part) of a mosaic and deciding if you like it. Certainly the McLuhan test can be applied to the Gutenberg Galaxy itself. Doing so will reveal a further insight into the purpose of his own book.&lt;ref&gt;"To show by exactly what historical process ["modern man has desacralized his world and assumed a profane existence"] was done is the theme of The Gutenberg Galaxy." McLuhan 1962, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prologue===
McLuhan declares his book to be "complementary to ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'' by Albert B. Lord."&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1" /&gt; The latter work follows on from the Homeric studies of [[Milman Parry]] who turned to "the study of the Yugoslave epics"&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1" /&gt; to prove that the poems of Homer were oral compositions.

==Four epochs of history==
The book may also be regarded as a way of describing four epochs of history:

&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oral tribe culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuscript culture&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan himself proposes to demonstrate that "manuscript culture is intensely audile-tactile compared to print culture; and that means that detached habits of observation are quite uncongenial to manuscript cultures, whether ancient Egyptian, Greek, or Chinese or medieval." 1962, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gutenberg galaxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronic age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the break between the time periods in each case the occurrence of a new medium is responsible, the ''hand-writing'' terminates the oral phase, the printing and the electricity revolutionizes afterwards culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel morisse and Uwe lehmann, Marshall McLuhan Project, Philosophy, The Gutenberg Galaxy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given the clue of "hand-writing" that terminates the "oral phase" one expects "printing" to terminate the manuscript phase and the "electrifying" to bring an end to the Gutenberg era. The strangeness of the use of "electrifying" is entirely appropriate in the McLuhan context of 1962. The Internet did not exist then.

McLuhan himself suggests that the last section of his book might play the major role of being the first section:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The last section of the book, "The Galaxy Reconfigured," deals with the clash of electric and mechanical, or print, technologies, and the reader may find it the best prologue.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.0&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oral tribe culture===
The [[oral tradition]] is not dead. In schools or at home or in the street, where children are taught to learn by heart, to memorize, [[nursery rhyme]]s or poems or songs, then they can be said to participate in the oral tradition. The same is often true of the children belonging to religious groups who are taught to learn to say their prayers. In other words, childhood is one of [[All the world's a stage|the ages of man]] (in Shakespeare's sense) and is essentially an oral tribal culture. The transition from this oral culture takes place when the child is taught to read and write. Then the child enters the world of the manuscript culture.

McLuhan identifies [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as a key that unlocks something of the nature of the oral culture.&lt;ref name="Joyce-1964"&gt;"The fall of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early in bed and later on life down through all Christian minstrelsy." Joyce 1964, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;"

Of particular importance to the Oral Culture is the [[Art of memory]].

====The village====
In commenting on the then [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref&gt;We have gone from the Soviet Union of McLuhan's day to the Russian Federation today.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan puts "the advertising and PR community" on a par with them in so far that both "are concerned about access to the media and about results."&lt;ref name="gloss 18"&gt;'''gloss 18''': "The interiorization of the technology of the phonetic alphabet translates man from the magical world of the ear to the neutral visual world." McLuhan 1962, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; More remarkably he asserts that "Soviet concern with media ''results'' is natural to any oral society where interdependence is the result of instant interplay of cause and effect in the total structure. Such is the character of a village, or since electric media, such is also the character of global village."&lt;ref name="gloss 18" /&gt;

===Manuscript culture===
The culture of the manuscript (literally hand-writing) is often referred to by McLuhan as [[Print culture|scribal culture]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Medieval illumination, gloss, and sculpture alike were aspects of the art of memory, central to scribal culture.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Associated with this epoch is the [[Art of memory]] (in Latin Ars Memoriae).

===Gutenberg galaxy===
Finnegans Wake:
Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (like Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'') is one of the texts which McLuhan frequently uses throughout the book in order to weave together the various strands of his argument.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Throughout ''Finnegans Wake'' Joyce specifies the [[Tower of Babel]] as the tower of Sleep,
that is, the tower of the witless assumption, or what [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] calls the reign of the Idols.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Movable type====
His episodic and often rambling history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic tribal humankind to the [[Electronics|electronic age]]. According to McLuhan, the invention of [[movable type]] greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means [[phonemic orthography]]. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic [[alphabet]] from [[logographic]]/logogramic writing systems, like [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] or [[ideograms]].)

Print culture, ushered in by the [[Gutenberg press]] in the middle of the fifteenth century, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting with approval an observation on the nature of the printed word from ''Prints and Visual Communication'' by [[William Ivins]], McLuhan remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background. [...] The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, "formal" causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' pp. 124-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main concept of McLuhan's argument (later elaborated upon in ''[[The Medium is the Massage]]'') &lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt;is that new technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits ("visual homogenizing of experience"), which in turn affects social interactions ("fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook"). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the [[Modern age|Modern]] period in the [[Western world]]: [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[Protestantism]], [[capitalism]] and [[nationalism]]. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology's principle of "segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification."&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic age===

====The global village====
In the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called "electronic interdependence": when [[electronic media]] would replace [[visual culture]] with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a "tribal base." McLuhan's coinage for this new social organization is the ''[[Global Village (term)|global village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "global village"  specifically as such. According to McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a ''Wake'' scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term. &lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_2art2.htm | publisher=''McLuhan Studies'' (issue 2) | title=The source of the term 'global village' | author=Eric McLuhan | year=1996 | accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', but McLuhan himself was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of tending towards a vast [[Alexandrian library]] the world has become a [[computer]], an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of [[science fiction]]. And as our senses have gone outside us, [[Authoritarianism|Big Brother]] goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the [[Western world]] a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Key to McLuhan's argument is the idea that technology has no ''per se'' moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual's and, by extension, a society's self-conception and realization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than [[manuscript]] culture could ever do. Print is the technology of [[individualism]]. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. "But", someone says, "we didn't know it would happen." Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The moral [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of technology's effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter seventeenth century with the modern concern for the "end of the book." If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that "there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies."

Though the [[World Wide Web]] was invented thirty years after ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' was published, McLuhan may have coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term "[[surfing]]" to refer to rapid, irregular and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements like "[[Heidegger]] surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as [[Descartes]] rode the mechanical wave." [[Paul Levinson]]'s 1999 book ''Digital McLuhan'' explores the ways that McLuhan's work can be better understood through the lens of the digital revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.cyberchimp.co.uk/U75102/levinson.htm#ch3 | author=Paul Levinson | title=Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium | publisher=Routledge | year=1999 | ISBN=0-415-19251-X}} Book has been translated into Japanese, Chinese, Croatian, Romanian, and Korean.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Bill Stewart (internet historian)|Bill Stewart]]'s 2007 "Living Internet" website describes how McLuhan's "insights made the concept of a global village, interconnected by an electronic nervous system, part of our popular culture well before it actually happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Stewart | first = Bill | title = Marshall McLuhan Foresees The Global Village | work = Living Internet | date = 2000-01-07 | url=http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_mcluhan.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan frequently quoted [[Walter Ong]]'s ''Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue'' (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''. Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in ''America''.&lt;ref&gt;''America'' 107 (Sept. 15, 1962): 743, 747.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' as "a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 8 (1967): 838.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan himself said of the book, "I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [''The Gutenberg Galaxy'']. It seems to me a book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of ''Understanding Media'' [the 1960 NAEB report] that I'm doing now." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' won Canada's highest literary award, the [[Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction|Governor-General's Award for Non-Fiction]], in 1962.  The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan's colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, [[Northrop Frye]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18792">'''William Frend''' (22 November 1757 – 21 February 1841) was an English clergyman (later Unitarian), social reformer and writer. After a high-profile university trial in Cambridge, which deprived him of his residency rights as fellow of his college, he became a leading figure in London radical circles.

[[File:William Frend.jpg|thumb|William Frend, 1793 engraving by [[Andrew Birrell]], after [[Sylvester Harding]].]]

==Early life==

He was born on 22 November 1757 at [[Canterbury]], the second son of George Frend, a tradesmen, [[alderman]], and twice [[Mayors of Canterbury (Kent)|its mayor]]. His mother was buried in the cloister yard on 7 February 1763, and his father married at [[Canterbury Cathedral|the cathedral]], on 25 September 1764, Jane Kirby. Frend was educated at [[The King's School, Canterbury|The King's School]] until 1771; among his companions were his cousin [[Herbert Marsh]], and [[Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden|Charles Abbott]]. His father intended him for business, and he was sent to [[Saint-Omer]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] to learn French, and then to a mercantile house (trading company) in [[Quebec]], where he remained for a few weeks. During his time there he served as a volunteer at the beginning of the troubles with the American colonies.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Frend, William|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At Cambridge==
On his return home Frend expressed a wish to train for the ministry within the [[Church of England]], and on the recommendation of [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Moore (archbishop of Canterbury)|John Moore]] he entered [[Christ's College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=FRNT775W|name=Frend, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 18 December 1775, where [[William Paley]] was one of the college tutors. After gaining various college prizes he took the degree of B.A. in 1780, being [[second wrangler]] and winning [[Smith's Prize]]. Having gained the notice of [[Lynford Caryl]], Master of [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], he migrated there, becoming a Fellow and tutor in 1781.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt;

At the end of 1780 he was admitted deacon in the Church of England, and advanced to the priesthood in 1783, when he was presented to the living of [[Madingley]], near Cambridge, where he officiated zealously until June 1787. During this period of his life the post of tutor to the Archduke Alexander of Russia was offered to him, but he declined it.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1787 Frend left the [[Church of England]], in which he had been ordained, to become a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]. At that time, candidates for the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] had to "subscribe to" (state their belief in&amp;mdash;the literal meaning is "sign below") the [[Thirty-nine Articles]], the historically defining statements of doctrines of the Church of England with respect to the controversies of the [[English Reformation]]. Frend published his ‘Address to the Inhabitants of Cambridge’ in favour of his new creed, and he supported vigorously a proposal introduced into [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|the senate house]] (i.e. the governing body of the university) on 11 December 1787 that would render this statement of belief no longer necessary.

Frend was removed by [[Richard Beadon]] from the office of tutor by an order dated 27 September 1788, and his appeal was dismissed by [[Visitor|the visitor]], the [[Bishop of Ely]], by a decree dated 29 December 1788.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

He took, in company with an old schoolfellow called Richard Tylden, a lengthy tour in France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, and Switzerland. When he returned home he resumed the study of Hebrew. [[Joseph Priestley]] devised in 1789 a plan for a new translation of the scriptures, with Frend, [[Michael Dodson]] and [[Theophilus Lindsey]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Priestley, Joseph|volume=46|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through 1790 Frend was engaged on translating the historical books of the Old Testament. He also became close to the Baptist [[Robert Robinson (Baptist)|Robert Robinson]], who died in 1790, and he corrected Robinson's posthumous volume of ''Ecclesiastical Researches''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Trial and aftermath==
In 1793 Frend wrote a tract entitled ''Peace and Union recommended to the Associated Bodies of Republicans and Anti-republicans'', in which he denounced abuses and condemned much of the [[liturgy]] of the church of England. On 4 March certain members of the senate met on the invitation of the vice-chancellor, Dr. [[Isaac Milner]], and resolved that Frend should be prosecuted in the vice-chancellor's court. They deputed a committee of five to conduct the proceedings, one of the leaders being [[Thomas Kipling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=15641|title=Kipling, Thomas|first=Robert|last=Hole}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April a summons was issued by that official requiring Frend's presence in the law schools on 3 May to answer the charge of having violated the laws and statutes of the university by publishing the pamphlet. After several sittings and a long defence by Frend, the vice-chancellor and heads gave their decision on 28 May that the authorship had been proved and that Frend had offended against the statute ‘de concionibus.’&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Frend was ordered to retract and confess his error, and as he declined was ‘banished from the university’ (30 May). An appeal against the sentence followed, and the university counsel including the barrister [[Simon Le Blanc]] became involved;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Le Blanc, Simon|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was unanimously affirmed by the delegates on 29 June, and on 26 November 1795 the [[Court of King's Bench]] discharged a rule which Frend had obtained for restoring him to the franchises of a resident M.A. The master and fellows of Jesus College decided, on 3 April 1793, that in consequence of this pamphlet he should not be allowed to reside in the college until he could produce satisfactory proofs of good behaviour. He thereupon appealed to the visitor, but on 13 July that appeal was dismissed. In spite of all these proceedings he enjoyed the emoluments of his fellowship until his marriage, and remained, while he lived, a member of his college and of the senate of the university.

==Accounts of the trial==
The proceedings attracted wide attention. One of Frend's supporters was [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], then an undergraduate. [[Henry Gunning]], in his ''Reminiscences'' (i. 280–309), reprints an account of the trial, and, while condemning the tone of the pamphlet, describes the proceedings as a party move and vindicates the tract from the accusation of sedition. He adds that the vice-chancellor was biased against the accused, and that the undergraduates, among whom Coleridge was conspicuous, were unanimous in his favour. [[Augustus De Morgan]] wrote that chalked graffiti "Frend for ever" appeared; bishop-to-be [[Herbert Marsh]] was apprehended, while two other future establishment pillars, [[John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst|John Singleton Copley]] and [[William Rough]] escaped.&lt;ref name=Budget&gt;{{cite wikisource|wslink=Budget of Paradoxes/F|first=Augustus |last=De Morgan|author-link=Augustus De Morgan|title=A Budget of Paradoxes|date=1872|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milner later wrote identifying Frend and his "party" in the university as "Jacobinical", and commenting that the trial had been a turning point for them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]], ''Coleridge: Early Visions'' (1990), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

His trial was described by Frend himself in 'An Account of the Proceedings in the University of Cambridge against William Frend,' 1793, and in 'A Sequel to the Account &amp;c.', which dealt with the application to the court of king's bench in 1795. [[John Beverley (administrator)|John Beverley]] also published accounts of the proceedings in 1793. Two letters from [[Richard Farmer]] to [[Samuel Parr]] on this trial are in Parr's ''Works'',&lt;ref&gt;Parr, Works, vol.i., pp.447–8&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same set&lt;ref&gt;Parr, Works, vol.viii., pp.30–2&lt;/ref&gt; is a long letter from Frend on the treatment which [[Thomas Fyshe Palmer]], another reformer, had just received.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Many years later, in 1837, Frend gave [[Henry Crabb Robinson]] some anecdotes about his trial; and said that the promoters wished to expel him from the university, but that he had demanded a sight of the university roll, and on reference to the original document it was discovered that an informality existed which made his expulsion invalid.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Later life==
On leaving Cambridge he came to London. He maintained himself by teaching and writing, to supplement his continuing fellowship stipend.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; It was at Frend's house that [[William Wordsworth]] met [[William Godwin]], on 27 February 1795. The company there that evening included [[George Dyer (poet)|George Dyer]], [[Thomas Holcroft]], [[James Losh]], and [[John Tweddell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Juliet Barker]], ''Wordsworth: A Life'' (2001, abridged), pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Frend was one of the orators in the mass meetings called by the [[London Corresponding Society]] in late 1795, with [[John Ashley (radical)|John Ashley]], Matthew Brown, Richard Hodgson, [[John Gale Jones]], [[John Richter (radical)|John Richter]], and [[John Thelwall]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ehrman]], ''The Younger Pitt'' Vol. II (1983), p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; Also of this circle was [[Mary Hays]]; an attachment to Frend ended in an unsatisfactory fashion, Frend claiming that marriage was not possible on financial grounds; and she wrote autobiographically about the relationship in her first novel, ''Memoirs of Emma Courtney'' (1796).&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=37525|title=Hays, Mary|first=Marilyn L.|last=Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frend was one of the group of reformers who supported at this time the early activities of the [[Royal Literary Fund|Literary Fund]] set up by [[David Williams (philosopher)|David Williams]]. There he worked alongside [[Thomas Christie]], [[Alexander Jardine (British Army officer)|Alexander Jardine]], [[James Martin (UK politician)|James Martin]], and [[John Hurford Stone]]. Their views, however, did not have it all their own way.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=29494|title=Williams, David|first=Damian Walford|last=Davies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806 he took part in the formation of the [[Rock Life Assurance Company]], to which he was appointed as [[actuary]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He continued in radical activities, participating around 1810 in a fundraising committee,  with [[Timothy Brown (radical)|Timothy Brown]], [[John Cartwright (political reformer)|John Cartwright]], [[William Cobbett]], and [[Robert Waithman]], to support [[Gwyllym Lloyd Wardle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=74221|title=Brown, Timothy|first=Michael T.|last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A severe illness in 1826 compelled him to offer his resignation, which was accepted in 1827 when an annuity was given to him. His health subsequently recovered, and he resumed an active life. Frend and [[Joshua Milne]], another actuary, were consulted by the statistician [[John Rickman]] about the 1831 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000107/http://histpop.org.uk/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Essays%20%28by%20geography%29/England%20and%20Wales/General&amp;active=yes&amp;mno=2060}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840 he was attacked by paralysis. He lingered with almost total loss of speech and motion, though mentally alert. He died at his house, [[Tavistock Square]], London, on 21 February 1841.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Associations, influence and views==
In 1808 Frend married a daughter of the Rev. Francis Blackburne,{{efn|the son of [[Francis Blackburne (priest)]]}} vicar of [[Brignall]] in Yorkshire, and granddaughter of Archdeacon [[Francis Blackburne (priest)|Francis Blackburne]]. They had seven children, and their eldest daughter, [[Sophia Elizabeth De Morgan|Sophia Elizabeth]], married in the autumn of 1837 [[Augustus De Morgan]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Among Frend's pupils were [[Edward Daniel Clarke]], [[Ada Lovelace]], [[John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst|John Singleton Copley]], and [[Robert Malthus]]; he was himself the last of "the learned anti-Newtonians and a noted oppugner of all that distinguishes Algebra from Arithmetic."&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Budget/&gt; In Cambridge the leading intellectual dissenters formed a circle including George Dyer, [[Benjamin Flower]], [[Robert Hall (minister)|Robert Hall]] and [[Robert Tyrwhitt]], as well as Frend and Robert Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=8347|title=Dyer, George|first=Nicholas|last=Roe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frend was a Unitarian and a Whig by conviction. Reformers such as [[Francis Burdett]] and [[John Horne Tooke]] were his friends, and he maintained correspondence with supporters of radicalism.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt; [[Francis Place]] acknowledged an intellectual debt to Frend.&lt;ref name=Budget/&gt; Frend's Unitarian network, as well as the group round Priestley, included [[James Gifford the elder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=10662|title=Gifford, James|first=M. J.|last=Mercer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Hibbert (Anti-Trinitarian)|Robert Hibbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=13196|title=Hibbert, Robert|first=Alan|last=Ruston}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to Godwin, Frend like others had difficulties with his [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Gill, ''William Wordsworth: A Life'' (1989), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was frequently consulted by [[John Palmer (postal innovator)|John Palmer]] in support of his claim for a public grant for his services in improving the transmission of letters. Frend thought that the rate of postage should be reduced to a fixed charge of one or two pennies, and drew up a statement to that effect. It reached a member of [[Robert Peel]]'s cabinet, but nothing came of it at that time.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Works==
Frend's works dealt with many subjects. His publications were:

* ''An Address to the Inhabitants of Cambridge and its Neighbourhood ... to turn from the false Worship of Three Persons to the Worship of the One True God'' (St. Ives, 1788). The second edition was entitled ''An Address to the Members of the Church of England and to Protestant Trinitarians in General'', and it was followed by ''A Second Address to the Members of the Church of England''. These were reprinted in ''Six Tracts in Vindication of the Worship of One God'', and in other unitarian publications, and were answered by the Rev. [[Henry William Coulthurst]], by George Townsend of Ramsgate in two tracts (1789), and by [[Alexander Pirie]] in a volume issued at Perth (1792). Frend responded in ''Thoughts on Subscription to religious tests ... in a letter to the Rev. H. W. Coulthurst'', and in ''Mr. Coulthurst's blunders exposed, or a review of his several texts''. For these pamphlets Frend was expelled from the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]] (''An Account of some late Proceedings of the Society'' (1789).

Frend, besides contributing two articles to ''Tracts on the Resolution of Affected Algebraick Equations'', edited by Francis Maseres in 1800, and one tract to the same editor's ''Scriptores Logarithmici'' (vol. vi. 1807), suggested other matters to him in the same publications. Maseres in his ''Tracts on the Resolution of Cubick and Biquadratick Equations'', published supplements to his appendix to Frend's ''Principles of Algebra''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;
