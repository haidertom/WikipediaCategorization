The '''Bernoulli''' family ({{IPA-de|bɛʁˈnʊli}}&lt;ref&gt;German pronunciation from Mangold, Max (1990) ''Duden — Das Aussprachewörterbuch''. 3. Auflage. Mannheim/Wien/Zürich, Dudenverlag. In a tradition going back to the 18th century (
Tronson du Coudray, ''L'artillerie nouvelle'', 1773, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=k0NgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 195]), the name was spelled ''Bernouilli'' in France, and accordingly given the French pronunciation of [bɛʁnuˈji]. This is no longer the case, and the name is now spelled in the original form ''Bernoulli'' also in French-language context.  ''Rue Bernoulli'' in [[8th arrondissement of Paris|Paris 8]] was named ''rue Bernouilli'' in 1867 and renamed to the correct spelling in 1994 ([http://www.v2asp.paris.fr/commun/v2asp/v2/nomenclature_voies/Voieactu/0906.nom.htm v2asp.paris.fr]). [[Bernoulli crater]] was spelled ''Bernouilli'' in the moon atlas by Beer &amp; Mädler (1836), and hence adopted as the official name by the [[IAU]] in 1935;  the IAU changed the official name to ''Bernoulli'' in 2003. The [[French submarine Bernouilli]] (1906) was named for [[Daniel Bernoulli]].&lt;/ref&gt;) of [[Basel]] is a patrician family, notable for having produced  eight mathematically gifted academics who, between them, contributed to the foundations of applied mathematics and physics during the [[Early Modern Switzerland|early modern period]]. Originally from [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], they moved to Basel and gained Swiss citizenship in 1620.&lt;ref name=HLS&gt;{{HLS|20951|author=René Bernoulli-Sutter|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The family was related by marriage to the prominent  French academic dynasty, [[Curie family]] through [[Johann Bernoulli]] (1667&amp;ndash;1748).
While their origin in Antwerp is certain, proposed connections with the Dutch family ''Bornouilla, Bernoullie'' or the Castilian family ''de Bernuy'' (''Bernoille, Bernouille'') are uncertain.&lt;ref name=HLS/&gt;

The first known member of the family was Leon Bernoulli (d. 1561),  a doctor in [[Antwerp]], at that time, part of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. His son, Jacob, emigrated to [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1570 to escape from the Spanish persecution of the [[Protestant]]s. 
Jacob's grandson, a spice trader, also named Jacob, moved to [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] in 1620, and was granted Basel citizenship in 1622.&lt;ref name=HLS/&gt; His son, Niklaus (Nicolaus, 1623&amp;ndash;1708), Leon's great-great-grandson, married Margarethe Schönauer. 
Niklaus had four sons, of which Johann and Hieronyus became the progenitors of the "greater" and the "lesser" branch of the family, respectively.
The four sons of Niklaus were:
* [[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1654&amp;ndash;1705; also known as James or Jacques) mathematician after whom [[Bernoulli numbers]] are named, and author of the early probability text ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]''
* Nicolaus Bernoulli (1662&amp;ndash;1716) painter and [[alderman]] of Basel
* [[Johann Bernoulli]] (1667&amp;ndash;1748; also known as Jean) mathematician and early adopter of [[infinitesimal calculus]]
* Hieronymus Bernoulli (1669&amp;ndash;1760), m.  Catharina Ebneter

In addition to those mentioned above, the Bernoulli family produced many notable artists and scientists, in particular, a number of famous [[mathematician]]s in the 18th century:
* [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli]] (1687&amp;ndash;1759) mathematician;
* [[Nicolaus II Bernoulli]] (1695&amp;ndash;1726) mathematician; worked on curves, [[differential equations]], and [[probability]], and originator of the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]
* [[Daniel Bernoulli]] (1700&amp;ndash;1782) developer of [[Bernoulli's principle]] and originator of the concept of [[utility|expected utility]] for resolving the St. Petersburg paradox
* [[Johann II Bernoulli]] (1710&amp;ndash;1790; also known as Jean) mathematician and physicist
* [[Johann III Bernoulli]] (1744&amp;ndash;1807; also known as Jean) astronomer, geographer, and mathematician
* [[Jacob II Bernoulli]] (1759&amp;ndash;1789; also known as Jacques) physicist and mathematician
* [[Hans Benno Bernoulli|Hans Bernoulli]], (1876&amp;ndash;1959) architect, designer of the Bernoullihäuser in Zurich and Grenchen SO
* [[Elisabeth Bernoulli]] (1873-1935), suffragette and campaigner against alcoholism

The surname survives in Switzerland, with ten entries in the white pages for the city of Basel as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tel.search.ch/?was=Bernoulli&amp;wo=Basel&amp;pages=2 tel.search.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''Brown measure''' of an operator in a finite [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]] is a probability measure on the complex plane which may be viewed as an analog of the spectral counting measure (based on [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#algebraic multiplicity|algebraic multiplicity]]) of matrices. 

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite factor with the canonical normalized trace &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. For every operator &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, the function

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda \mapsto \tau(\log \left|A-\lambda I\right|), \; \lambda \in \mathbb{C},&lt;/math&gt;

is [[Subharmonic function|subharmonic]] and its [[Laplacian]] in the [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributional]] sense is a probability measure on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; which is called the Brown measure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''counting board''' is the precursor of the [[abacus]], and the earliest known form of a counting device (excluding fingers and other very simple methods). Counting boards were made of stone or wood, and the counting was done on the board with beads, or pebbles etc. Not many boards survive because of the perishable materials used in their construction. 

The oldest known counting board, the [[Salamis Tablet]] (''c.'' 300 BC) was discovered on the Greek island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ju.edu/ssundbe/salamis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103213141/http://users.ju.edu/ssundbe/salamis.html |archivedate=2008-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought to have been used by the Babylonians in about 300 BC and is more of a gaming board than a calculating device. It is marble, about 150 x 75 x 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm, and is in the [[Greek National museum]] in [[Athens]].  It has carved Greek letters and parallel grooves. 

The German mathematicican [[Adam Ries]] described the use of counting boards in ''Rechenbuch auf Linien und Ziphren in allerlei Handthierung / geschäfften und Kaufmanschafft''. In the novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', [[Hilary Mantel]] refers to [[Thomas Cromwell]] using a counting board in 16th-century England.

The '''differential analyser''' is a mechanical [[analogue computer]] designed to solve [[differential equation]]s by [[integral|integration]], using wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Irwin|first=William|url=http://amg.nzfmm.co.nz/differential_analyser_explained.html|title=The Differential Analyser Explained|work=|accessdate=2010-07-21|publisher=Auckland Meccano Guild|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first advanced computing devices to be used operationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The original machines could not add, but then it was noticed that if the two wheels of a rear differential are turned, the drive shaft will compute the average of the left and right wheels. A simple gear ratio of 1:2 then enables multiplication by two, so addition (and subtraction) are achieved. Multiplication is just a special case of integration, namely integrating a [[constant function]].&lt;ref&gt;John von Neumann, ''The Computer and the Brain'', Part 1, p.3, Yale University Press, The Silliman Memorial Lectures Series, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:KayMcNultyAlyseSnyderSisStumpDifferentialAnalyzer.jpg|thumb|[[Kay McNulty]], Alyse Snyder, and Sis Stump operate the differential analyser in the basement of the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], c.&amp;nbsp;1942–1945.]]
[[Image:NASA Differential Analyzer.jpg|thumb|A differential analyser at the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] [[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory]], 1951]]
Research on solutions for differential equations using mechanical devices, discounting [[planimeter]]s, started at least as early as 1836, when the French physicist [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] designed a mechanical device to integrate [[differential equation]]s of the first order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gaspard-Gustave |last= Coriolis| authorlink=Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/ConsulterElementNum?O=NUMM-16380&amp;Deb=11&amp;Fin=15&amp;E=PDF |title=Note sur un moyen de tracer des courbes données par des équations différentielles |journal=[[Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées]] |series=series I 1 |pages=5–9 |year=1836|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first description of a device which could integrate differential equations of any order was published in 1876 by [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], who was born in [[Belfast]] in 1822, but lived in [[Scotland]] from the age of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomson, James |title=An Integrating Machine having a new Kinematic Principle |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=24 |issue= 164–170|pages=262–5 |year=1876 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1875.0033 }} Reprinted in {{cite book | last = Thomson | first = James | title = Collected Papers in Physics and Engineering by James Thomson | editor=Joseph Larmor &amp; James Thomson | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1912 | pages = xvii, 452–7| url = https://archive.org/details/collectedpapersi00thomrich | isbn = 0-404-06422-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Thomson called his device an "integrating machine", it is his description of the device, together with the additional publication in 1876 of two further descriptions by his younger brother, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], which represents the invention of the differential analyser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

One of the earliest practical uses of Thomson's concepts was a [[tide-predicting machine]] built by Kelvin starting in 1872-3. On Lord Kelvin's advice, Thomson's integrating machine was later incorporated into a [[fire-control system]] for naval gunnery being developed by [[Arthur Pollen]], resulting in an electrically driven, mechanical analogue computer, which was completed by about 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollen |first=Anthony |title=The Great Gunnery Scandal – The Mystery of Jutland |publisher=Collins |year=1980 |page=23 |isbn=0-00-216298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian mathematician [[Ernesto Pascal]] also developed [[integraph]]s for the mechanical integration of differential equations and published details in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Miei Integrafi per Equazioni Differenziali |last= Pascal |first= Ernesto |year= 1914 |publisher= B. Pellerano |location= Naples |language=it}} See also [[Integraph]].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first widely practical general purpose differential analyser was constructed by [[Harold Locke Hazen]] and [[Vannevar Bush]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], 1928–1931, comprising six mechanical integrators.&lt;ref&gt;Karl L. Wildes and Nilo A.

The output of each integrator was intended to drive other parts of the machine; however, the output was too feeble to do so. Hazen recognized that a "torque amplifier", which had been invented in 1925 by Henry W. Nieman and which was intended to allow workers to control heavy machinery, could be used to provide the necessary power.

[[Douglas Hartree]] of [[Manchester University]] brought Bush's design to England, where he constructed his first "[[proof of concept]]" model with his student, Arthur Porter, during 1934: as a result of this, the university acquired a full scale machine incorporating four mechanical integrators in March 1935, which was built by [[Metropolitan-Vickers]], and was, according to Hartree, "[the] first machine of its kind in operation outside the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Tim (June 2005), ''op. cit.'', Hartree, D.R.

In [[Norway]], the locally built [[Oslo Analyzer|Oslo Analyser]] was finished during 1938, based on the same principles as the MIT machine. This machine had 12 integrators, and was the largest analyser built for a period of four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holst, P.A. |title=Svein Rosseland and the Oslo analyzer |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=16–26 |date=Oct–Dec 1996 |doi=10.1109/85.539912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, further differential analysers were built at the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] in [[Maryland]] and in the basement of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania during the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Randell|Randell, Brian]] (ed.), ''The Origins of Digital Computers Selected Papers'' (3rd edition, 1982), Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 297.

At [[Osaka Imperial University]] (present-day [[Osaka University]]) around 1944, 
a complete differential analyser machine was developed (illustrated) to calculate the movement of an object and other problems with mechanical components, and then draws graphs on paper with a pen. It was later transferred to the [[Tokyo University of Science]] and has been displayed at the school’s Museum of Science in Shinjuku Ward. Restored in 2014  is one of only two still operational differential analyzers produced before the end of World War II.&lt;ref name="KABATA"&gt;HISATOSHI KABATA (2014), "[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/sci_tech/technology/AJ201412020060 Early computer dating to 1944 solving complex equations again after long 'reboot']", [[The Asahi Shimbun]]/Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, a differential analyser was constructed at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1948 by [[Beatrice Helen Worsley]], but it appears to have had little or no use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Campbell, Scott M. |title=Beatrice Helen Worsley: Canada's Female Computer Pioneer |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=53–4 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |date=October-December 2003 |url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/scampbell/campbell03.pdf |doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253890 |accessdate=2010-07-24 |quote= [Worsley's] research was suggested by Samuel H.

Constructed from about CAD$75 worth of Meccano, the analyzer was minimally modified from the original design but offered slight improvements to the electrical power distribution system, the design of the torque amplifiers, and the output pen support. Unfortunately, there is no information regarding what use, if any, the analyzer was put to or why Worsley built it}} For more on Beatrice Worsley, see [[UTEC#UTEC|UTEC]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A differential analyser may have been used in the development of the [[bouncing bomb]], used to attack [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, William (2009-07). ''Op. cit.'' "It is rumoured that a differential analyser was used in the development of the "bouncing bomb" by Barnes Wallis for the "Dam Busters" attack on the Ruhr valley hydroelectric dams in WW2. This was first mentioned in [[Museum of Transport and Technology|MOTAT]] [New Zealand] literature in 1973. However after extensive enquiries and literature searches over the last few years, no evidence can be found that the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/account/3031/object/955 differential analyser held by MOTAT], nor any other differential analyser, was used for this purpose. Considering the secrecy surrounding war time activities at the time it could still be possible, but most people from that era are now deceased. Two remaining personalities still alive from that era were consulted, namely Arthur Porter and [[Maurice Wilkes]], but neither could substantiate the rumour."&lt;/ref&gt; Differential analysers have also been used in the calculation of [[soil erosion]] by river control authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Electronic Brains: Stories from the Dawn of the Computer Age|first=Mike|last=Hally|publisher=Granta|year=2005|isbn=9781862076631|page=xx}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The differential analyser was eventually rendered obsolete by [[electronic analogue computer]]s and, later, digital computers.

The model differential analyser built at Manchester University in 1934 by Douglas Hartree and Arthur Porter made extensive use of [[Meccano]] parts: this meant that the machine was less costly to build, and it proved "accurate enough for the solution of many scientific problems".&lt;ref name=CamDA&gt;{{harv|Hartree|Porter|1934–1935}},{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://amg.nzfmm.co.nz/differential_analyser.html|title= Differential Analyser |work=|accessdate=2010-07-21|publisher=Auckland Meccano Guild|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar machine built by J.B.

In 1948, this machine was bought by Professor [[Harry Whale]] of Auckland, for 100 pounds sterling, and he then took it to Auckland for use at the Seagrave Radio Research Centre.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Tim (June 2005), ''op. cit.'': Robinson states that "[Prof. Whale] had earlier used the Meccano model in his Ph.D. studies". {{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/account/3031/object/955|title=Differential Analyser|work=|accessdate=2010-07-21|publisher=NZMuseums|date=}} {{cite web|url=http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/tech/7627BB58BAFE998DCC257317001AA6D1|title=Meccano ‘Dam Busters’ computer stars at MOTAT|publisher=computerworld.co.nz|date=2007-07-16|accessdate=2007-07-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817020213/http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/tech/7627BB58BAFE998DCC257317001AA6D1|archivedate=2007-08-17|df=}}

{{term|[[Chain rule]]}}
{{defn|The '''chain rule''' is a [[formula]] for computing the [[derivative]] of the [[Function composition|composition]] of two or more [[function (mathematics)|functions]].

:&lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)'=(f'\circ g)\cdot g'.&lt;/math&gt;

This may equivalently be expressed in terms of the variable. Let {{math|1=''F'' = ''f'' {{large|∘}} ''g''}}, or equivalently, {{math|1=''F''(''x'') = ''f''(''g''(''x''))}} for all ''x''. Then one can also write
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f'(g(x)) g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The chain rule may be written in [[Leibniz's notation]] in the following way. If a variable ''z'' depends on the variable ''y'', which itself depends on the variable ''x'', so that ''y'' and ''z'' are therefore [[dependent variable]]s, then ''z'', via the intermediate variable of ''y'', depends on ''x'' as well.  The chain rule then states,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{dy} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}. &lt;/math&gt;

The two versions of the chain rule are related; if &lt;math&gt;z=f(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then

Design of robust and reliable networks and [[network service]]s relies on an understanding of the [[network traffic|traffic]] characteristics of the network. Throughout history, different models of network traffic have been developed and used for evaluating existing and proposed networks and services.

Demands on [[computer network]]s are not entirely predictable. Performance modeling is necessary for deciding the [[quality of service]] (QoS) level. Performance models in turn, require accurate [[traffic model]]s that have the ability to capture the statistical characteristics of the actual traffic on the network. Many traffic models have been developed based on traffic measurement data. If the underlying traffic models do not efficiently capture the characteristics of the actual traffic, the result may be the under-estimation or over-estimation of the performance of the network. This impairs the design of the network. Traffic models are hence, a core component of any performance evaluation of networks and they need to be very accurate.

“Teletraffic theory is the application of mathematics to the measurement, modeling, and control of traffic in [[telecommunications network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Mathematics Meets the Internet|publisher=AMS|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199808/paxson.pdf|author=Willinger and Paxson|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of traffic modeling is to find stochastic processes to represent the behavior of traffic. Working at the Copenhagen Telephone Company in the 1910s, [[A. K. Erlang]] famously characterized telephone traffic at the call level by certain probability distributions for arrivals of new calls and their holding times. Erlang applied the traffic models to estimate the telephone switch capacity needed to achieve a given call blocking probability. The Erlang blocking formulas had tremendous practical interest for public carriers because telephone facilities (switching and transmission) involved considerable investments. Over several decades, Erlang’s work stimulated the use of queuing theory, and applied probability in general, to engineer the public switched [[telephone network]]. Teletraffic theory for packet networks has seen considerable progress in recent decades.&lt;ref name=parkwill&gt;{{cite book | last1=Park | first1=Kihong | last2=Willinger|first2=Walter|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/047120644X.fmatter_indsub/pdf|title=Self-similar network traffic and performance evaluation | publisher=Wiley | publication-place=New York | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-471-31974-0 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adas&gt;{{cite journal | last=Adas | first=A. | title=Traffic models in broadband networks | journal=IEEE Communications Magazine | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=35 | issue=7 | year=1997 | issn=0163-6804 | doi=10.1109/35.601746 | pages=82–89 | ref=harv}}

==Network traffic models usage==
Measurements are useful and necessary for verifying the actual [[network performance]]. However, measurements do not have the level of abstraction that makes traffic models useful. Traffic models can be used for hypothetical problem solving whereas traffic measurements only reflect current reality. In probabilistic terms, a traffic trace is a realization of a [[random process]], whereas a traffic model is a random process. Thus, traffic models have universality. A traffic trace gives insight about a particular traffic source, but a traffic model gives insight about all traffic sources of that type. Traffic models have three major uses. One important use of traffic models is to properly dimension network resources for a target level of [[Quality of service|QoS]]. It was mentioned earlier that Erlang developed models of [[voice call]]s to estimate telephone switch capacity to achieve a target call blocking probability. Similarly, models of packet traffic are needed to estimate the bandwidth and buffer resources to provide acceptable packet delays and [[packet loss]] probability. Knowledge of the average traffic rate is not sufficient. It is known from [[queuing theory]] that queue lengths increase with the variability of traffic.&lt;ref name="Kleinrock1975"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kleinrock | first=Leonard | title=Queueing systems | publisher=Wiley | publication-place=New York | year=1975 | isbn=978-0-471-49110-1 | language=de | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, an understanding of traffic burstiness or variability is needed to determine sufficient buffer sizes at nodes and link capacities.&lt;ref name="Barakat Thiran Iannaccone Diot 2003 pp. 2111–2124"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barakat | first=C. | last2=Thiran | first2=P. | last3=Iannaccone | first3=G. | last4=Diot | first4=C. | last5=Owezarski | first5=P. | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.2.8066&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Modeling internet backbone traffic at the flow level | journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=51 | issue=8 | year=2003 | issn=1053-587X | doi=10.1109/tsp.2003.814521 | pages=2111–2124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second important use of traffic models is to verify network performance under specific traffic controls. For example, given a packet scheduling algorithm, it would be possible to evaluate the network performance resulting from different traffic scenarios. For another example, a popular area of research is new improvements to the TCP congestion avoidance algorithm. It is critical that any algorithm is stable and allows multiple hosts to share bandwidth fairly, while sustaining a high throughput. Effective evaluation of the stability, fairness, and throughput of new algorithms would not be possible without realistic source models. A third important use of traffic models is admission control. In particular, connection oriented networks such as ATM depends on admission control to block new connections to maintain QOS guarantees. A simple admission strategy could be based on the peak rate of a new connection; a new connection is admitted if the available bandwidth is greater than the peak rate. However, that strategy would be overly conservative because a variable bit-rate connection may need significantly less bandwidth than its peak rate. A more sophisticated admission strategy is based on effective bandwidths.&lt;ref name="Statistical Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web | title=Notes on effective bandwidths | website=Statistical Laboratory | url=http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~frank/eb.html | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source traffic behavior is translated into an effective bandwidth between the peak rate and average rate, which is the specific amount of bandwidth required to meet a given QoS constraint. The effective bandwidth depends on the variability of the source.&lt;ref name=chen2007/&gt;

==Network traffic models steps==
Traffic modeling consists of three steps:
* (i) selection of one or more models that may provide a good description of the traffic type
* (ii) estimation of parameters for the selected models
* (iii) statistical testing for election of one of the considered models and analysis of its suitability to describe the traffic type under analysis.
Parameter estimation is based on a set of statistics (e.g. mean, variance, density function or auto covariance function, multifractal characteristics) that are measured or calculated from observed data. The set of statistics used in the inference process depends on the impact they may have in the main performance metrics of interest.&lt;ref name=nogueira&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nogueira | first=António | last2=Salvador | first2=Paulo | last3=Valadas | first3=Rui | last4=Pacheco | first4=António | journal=Telecommunication Systems | title=Modeling Network Traffic with Multifractal Behavior|publisher=Springer Nature | volume=24 | issue=2/4 | year=2003 | issn=1018-4864 | doi=10.1023/a:1026183318200 | pages=339–362 | ref=harv|url=
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7c27/a4732bc89057878b7bbf0db8772d2b13d6bd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network traffic models parameter==
In recent years several types of traffic behavior, that can have significant impact on network performance, were discovered: long-range dependence, [[self-similarity]] and, more recently, multifractality.
There are two major parameters generated by network traffic models: packet length distributions and packet inter-arrival distributions. Other parameters, such as routes, distribution of destinations, etc., are of less importance. Simulations that use traces generated by network traffic models usually examine a single node in the network, such as a router or switch; factors that depend on specific network topologies or routing information are specific to those topologies and simulations.&lt;ref name=arrowsmith&gt;{{cite web|author=D.K. Arrowsmith, R.J. Mondragon|title=Modelling Network Data Traffic|location=Queen Mary, University of London|url=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~arrow/BrisComp06.pdf|year=2006| access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of packet size distribution is fairly well-understood today. Existing models of packet sizes have proven to be valid and simple. Most packet size models do not consider the problem of order in packet sizes. For example, a TCP datagram in one direction is likely to be followed by a tiny ACK in the other direction about half of one Round-Trip Time (RTT) later. The problem of packet inter-arrival distribution is much more difficult. Understanding of network traffic has evolved significantly over the years, leading to a series of evolutions in network traffic models.

==Self-similar traffic models==
One of the earliest objections to self-similar traffic models was the difficulty in mathematical analysis. Existing self-similar models could not be used in conventional queuing models. This limitation was rapidly overturned and workable models were constructed. Once basic self-similar models became feasible, the traffic modeling community settled into the “detail” concerns. TCP’s congestion control algorithm complicated the matter of modeling traffic, so solutions needed to be created. Parameter estimation of self-similar models was always difficult, and recent research addresses ways to model network traffic without fully understanding it.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
[[File:Let us start from scratch.jpg|thumb|100px|Ilkka Norros]]
* [[Fractional Brownian motion]]:
When self-similar traffic models were first introduced, there were no efficient, analytically tractable processes to generate the models. [[Ilkka Norros]] devised a stochastic process for a storage model with self-similar input and constant bit-rate output. While this initial model was continuous rather than discrete, the model was effective, simple, and attractive.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* SWING:
All self-similar traffic models suffer from one significant drawback: estimating the self-similarity parameters from real network traffic requires huge amounts of data and takes extended computation. The most modern method, wavelet multi-resolution analysis, is more efficient, but still very costly. This is undesirable in a traffic model. SWING uses a surprisingly simple model for the network traffic analysis and generation. The model examines characteristics of users, Request-Response Exchanges (RREs), connections, individual packets, and the overall network. No attempt is made to analyze self-similarity characteristics; any self-similarity in the generated traffic comes naturally from the aggregation of many ON/OFF sources.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wilson | first=Michael L. | title=A Historical View of Network Traffic Models | website=wustl.edu |year=2006| url=https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-06/ftp/traffic_models2/ | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pareto distribution]] process:
The Pareto distribution process produces independent and identically distributed (IID) inter-arrival times. In general if X is a random variable with a Pareto distribution, then the probability that X is greater than some number x is given by P(X &gt; x) = (x/x_m)-k for all x ≥ x_m where k is a positive parameter and x_m is the minimum possible value of Xi The probability distribution and the density functions are represented as:
F(t) = 1 – (α/t)β where α,β ≥ 0 &amp; t ≥ α
f(t) = βαβ t-β-1
The parameters β and α are the shape and location parameters, respectively. The Pareto distribution is applied to model self-similar arrival in packet traffic. It is also referred to as double exponential, power law distribution. Other important characteristics of the model are that the Pareto distribution has infinite variance, when β ≥ 2 and achieves infinite mean, when β ≤ 1.
* [[Weibull distribution]] process:
The Weibull distributed process is heavy-tailed and can model the fixed rate in ON period and ON/OFF period lengths, when producing self-similar traffic by multiplexing ON/OFF sources. The distribution function in this case is given by:
F(t) = 1 – e-(t/β)α t &gt; 0
and the density function of the weibull distribution is given as:
f(t) = αβ-α tα-1 e -(t/β)α t &gt; 0
where parameters β ≥ 0 and α &gt; 0 are the scale and location parameters respectively.
The Weibull distribution is close to a normal distribution. For β ≤ 1 the density function of the distribution is L shaped and for values of β &gt; 1, it is bell shaped. This distribution gives a failure rate increasing with time. For β &gt; 1, the failure rate decreases with time. At, β = 1, the failure rate is constant and the lifetimes are exponentially distributed.
* [[Autoregressive model]]s:
The Autoregressive model is one of a group of linear prediction formulas that attempt to predict an output y_n of a system based on previous set of outputs {y_k} where k &lt; n and inputs x_n and {x_k} where k &lt; n. There exist minor changes in the way the predictions are computed based on which, several variations of the model are developed. Basically, when the model depends only on the previous outputs of the system, it is referred to as an auto-regressive model. It is referred to as a Moving Average Model (MAM), if it depends on only the inputs to the system. Finally, Autoregressive-Moving Average models are those that depend both on the inputs and the outputs, for prediction of current output. Autoregressive model of order p, denoted as AR(p), has the following form:
Xt = R1 Xt-1 + R2 Xt-2 + ... + Rp Xt-p + Wt
where Wt is the white noise, Ri are real numbers and Xt are prescribed correlated random numbers. The auto-correlation function of the AR(p) process consists of damped sine waves depending on whether the roots (solutions) of the model are real or imaginary. Discrete Autoregressive Model of order p, denoted as DAR(p), generates a stationary sequence of discrete random variables with a probability distribution and with an auto-correlation structure similar to that of the Autoregressive model of order p.[3]
* [[Regression model]]s:
Regression models define explicitly the next random variable in the sequence by previous ones within a specified time window and a moving average of a white noise.[5]
* [[TES model]]s :
Transform-expand-sample (TES) models are non-linear regression models with modulo-1 arithmetic. They aim to capture both auto-correlation and marginal distribution of empirical data. TES models consist of two major TES processes: TES+ and TES–. TES+ produces a sequence which has positive correlation at lag 1, while TES– produces a negative correlation at lag 1.&lt;ref name="Jelenkovic1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jelenkovic | first=P.R. | last2=Melamed | first2=B. | title=Algorithmic modeling of TES processes | journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=40 | issue=7 | year=1995 | issn=0018-9286 | doi=10.1109/9.400470 | pages=1305–1312|url=http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~predrag/mypub/TES95.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-self-similar traffic models==
Early traffic models were derived from telecommunications models and focused on simplicity of analysis. They generally operated under the assumption that aggregating traffic from a large number of sources tended to smooth out bursts; that burstiness decreased as the number of traffic sources increased.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* [[Poisson distribution]] model:
One of the most widely used and oldest traffic models is the Poisson Model. The memoryless Poisson distribution is the predominant model used for analyzing traffic in traditional telephony networks. The Poisson process is characterized as a renewal process. In a Poisson process the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed with a rate parameter λ: P{An ≤ t} = 1 – exp(-λt). The Poisson distribution is appropriate if the arrivals are from a large number of independent sources, referred to as Poisson sources. The distribution has a mean and variance equal to the parameter λ.
The Poisson distribution can be visualized as a limiting form of the binomial distribution, and is also used widely in queuing models. There are a number of interesting mathematical properties exhibited by Poisson processes. Primarily, superposition of independent Poisson processes results in a new Poisson process whose rate is the sum of the rates of the independent Poisson processes. Further, the independent increment property renders a Poisson process memoryless. Poisson processes are common in traffic applications scenarios that consist of a large number of independent traffic streams. The reason behind the usage stems from Palm's Theorem which states that under suitable conditions, such large number of independent multiplexed streams approach a Poisson process as the number of processes grows, but the individual rates decrease in order to keep the aggregate rate constant. Nevertheless, it is to be noted that traffic aggregation need not always result in a Poisson process. The two primary assumptions that the Poisson model makes are:&lt;ref name=chandra&gt;{{cite web | last=Chandrasekaran | first=Balakrishnan | title=Survey of Network Traffic Models | website=Washington University in St. Louis - Computer Science &amp; Engineering at WashU | date=2006-11-27 | url=http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-06/ftp/traffic_models3/index.html | ref=harv | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1. The number of sources is infinite
2. The traffic arrival pattern is random.
* [[Compound Poisson process|Compound Poisson traffic models]]:
In the compound Poisson model, the base Poisson model is extended to deliver batches of packets at once. The inter-batch arrival times are exponentially distributed, while the batch size is geometric Mathematically, this model has two parameters, λ, the arrival rate, and ρ in (0,1), the batch parameter. Thus, the mean number of packets in a batch is 1/ ρ, while the mean inter-batch arrival time is 1/ λ. Mean packet arrivals over time period t are tλ/ ρ.
The compound Poisson model shares some of the analytical benefits of the pure Poisson model: the model is still memoryless, aggregation of streams is still (compound) Poisson, and the steady-state equation is still reasonably simple to calculate, although varying batch parameters for differing flows would complicate the derivation.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* [[Markov model|Markov]] and Embedded Markov Models:
Markov models attempt to model the activities of a traffic source on a network, by a finite number of states. The accuracy of the model increases linearly with the number of states used in the model. However, the complexity of the model also increases proportionally with increasing number of states. An important aspect of the Markov model - the Markov Property, states that the next (future) state depends only on the current state. In other words, the probability of the next state, denoted by some random variable Xn+1, depends only on the current state, indicated by Xn, and not on any other state Xi, where i&lt;n. The set of random variables referring to different states {Xn} is referred to as a Discrete Markov Chain.
* [[Packet train]]s:
Another attempt at providing a bursty traffic model is found in Jain and Routhier’s Packet Trains model.&lt;ref name="Jain Routhier 1986 pp. 986–995"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jain | first=R. | last2=Routhier | first2=S. | title=Packet Trains--Measurements and a New Model for Computer Network Traffic | journal=IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=4 | issue=6 | year=1986 | issn=0733-8716 | doi=10.1109/jsac.1986.1146410 | pages=986–995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was principally designed to recognize that address locality applies to routing decisions; that is, packets that arrive near each other in time are frequently going to the same destination. In generating a traffic model that allows for easier analysis of locality, the authors created the notion of packet trains, a sequence of packets from the same source, traveling to the same destination (with replies in the opposite direction). Packet trains are optionally sub-divided into tandem trailers. Traffic between a source and a destination usually consists of a series of messages back and forth. Thus, a series of packets go one direction, followed by one or more reply packets, followed by a new series in the initial direction. Traffic quantity is then a superposition of packet trains, which generates substantial bursty behavior. This refines the general conception of the compound Poisson model, which recognized that packets arrived in groups, by analyzing why they arrive in groups, and better characterizing the attributes of the group. Finally, the authors demonstrate that packet arrival times are not Poisson distributed, which led to a model that departs from variations on the Poisson theme. The packet train model is characterized by the following parameters and their associated probability distributions:
*mean inter-train arrival time
*mean inter-car arrival time
*mean truck size (in the tandem trailer model)
*mean train size.
The train model is designed for analyzing and categorizing real traffic, not for generating synthetic loads for simulation. Thus, little claim has been made about the feasibility of packet trains for generating synthetic traffic. Given accurate parameters and distributions, generation should be straightforward, but derivation of these parameters is not addressed.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;

==Traffic models today==
[[NS-2]] is a popular network simulator;&lt;ref name="ns and nam Sourceforge home 2010"&gt;{{cite web | title=nsnam | website=ns and nam Sourceforge home | date=2010-04-05 | url=http://nsnam.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; PackMimeHTTP is a web traffic generator for NS-2, published in 2004. It does take long-range dependencies into account, and uses the [[Weibull distribution]]. Thus, it relies on [[Long tail|heavy tails]] to emulate true [[self-similarity]]. Over most time scales, the effort is a success; only a long-running simulation would allow a distinction to be drawn. This follows suggestions from where it is suggested that self-similar processes can be represented as a superposition of many sources each individually modeled with a heavy-tailed distribution. It is clear that self-similar traffic models are in the mainstream.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;

'''Iatromathematicians''' (from Greek ἰατρική "medicine" and μαθηματικά "mathematics") were a school of physicians in 17th-century Italy who tried to apply the laws of [[mathematics]] and [[mechanics]] in order to understand the functioning of the human body. They were also keen students of [[anatomy]]. These iantromathematicians made an effort to prove that applying a purely mechanical conception to the study of the human body is futile. The mechanical conceptions that they had referred to was [[Leonardo da Vinci]]’s studies of the human body, and the writings of  Aristotle about the motion of animals related to geometric analysis. Iantromathematicians considered the bodies functioning to be measured by quantifiable numbers, weights, and measures.

==Iatromathematics==
The field of iatromathematics is allied to science; however, it lacks the applicability of the proper scientific method and is therefore considered a form of [[pseudoscience]]. It applies the study of [[astrology]] to medicine.

Iatromathematicians viewed the human body through astrological reasoning as well as mechanics. They associate various stars, or zodiac signs with the functioning of the human body. The twelve astrological signs contribute to each part of the body from head to toe. Moreover, planets and existing cosmos in space are correlated with certain parts of the body. Through examining a [[natal chart]], iatromathematicians attempt to predict biological setbacks in an individual.

Iatromathematicians examine the active and energetic temperament of the human body. Moreover, they explore the causes of various health problems and attempt to find ways to treat certain detrimental diseases. In iatromathematics, there is a particular assumption that there is an impact of various energetic fields caused on the star bodies. The star body of an individual is often referred to by astrologists as an energetic matrix and is believed to be spawned by heavenly bodies such as the sun, moon, planets, and several other astrological signs.

Iatromathematicians study these conceptions and try to regulate the path of the star body of individuals so that it will give a positive, rather than a negative result. By doing so, they believe that it will contribute to a healthier lifestyle. Its doctrine is based on [[cosmobiology]] in which several emotional and physiological dilemmas in the body are associated with the positioning of celestial bodies in outer space.

Iatromathematics is closely correlated with [[biomechanics]] because the field of biomechanics investigates macrobiotic bodies to a macroscopic degree through the appliance of several engineering principles. The perspective of iatromathematicians differed from that of iatrophysicists and iatrochemists in terms of the way human bodies function. Iatrophysicists predicted the deviations from the biological norm of the body through the appliance of physics, while iatrochemists measured the detrimental problems of the body by chemical means.

==Ibn Ezra==

Several individuals contributed to this field study of iatromathematics. For example, [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] (Rabbi Avraham Ben Meir Ibn Ezra) wrote nine different astrological treatises. He covered all the subsections of astrology which include the branches of natal, medicinal, horary, electional, and mundane. Ibn Ezra’s best known work was known as ''The Beginning of Wisdom''. Over time, various individuals studied his works comprehensively. One such person was [[George Sarton]], who is the founder of the [[History of Science Society]].

Recently, [[Archibald Pitcairne]] was mentioned as the "forgotten father of mathematical medicine" and his contribution praised to creating the bases of iatromathematics.&lt;ref name=pitc-lancet&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashrafian|first=Hutan|title=Mathematics in medicine: the 300-year legacy of iatromathematics|journal=Lancet|date=November 30, 2013|volume=382|page=1780|url=http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS014067361362543X.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2014|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62542-8|pmid=24290588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pitcairne&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guerrini|first=Anita|title=Archibald Pitcairne and Newtonian Medicine|journal=Medical History|year=1987|volume=31|pages=70–83|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139685/pdf/medhist00068-0074.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2014|pmc=1139685|pmid=3543564|issue=1|doi=10.1017/s0025727300046329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7113">In [[mathematics]], an '''indexed family''' is informally a collection of objects, each associated with an index from some index set. For example, a ''family of [[real number]]s, indexed by the set of [[integer]]s'' is a collection of real numbers, where a given function selects for each integer one real number (possibly the same).

More formally, an indexed family is a  [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] together with its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''I'' and [[Image (mathematics)|image]] ''X''. Often the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] of the set ''X'' are referred to as making up the family. In this view indexed families are interpreted as collections instead of as functions. The set ''I'' is called the ''index (set)'' of the family, and ''X'' is the ''indexed set''.

==Mathematical statement==

'''Definition.''' Let ''I'' and ''X'' be sets and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; a [[surjective function]], such that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 x\colon I &amp;\to X \\
 i &amp;\mapsto x_i = x(i),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
then this establishes a '''family of elements in ''X'' indexed by ''I'' ''', which is denoted by (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; or simply (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), when the index set is assumed to be known. Sometimes angle brackets or braces are used instead of parentheses, the latter with the risk of mixing-up families with sets.

An indexed family can be turned into a set by considering the set &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{X} = \{ x_i : i \in I \} &lt;/math&gt;, that is, the image of ''I'' under ''x''. Since the mapping x is not required to be [[Injective function|injective]], there may exist &lt;math&gt;i,j \in I &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i = x_j&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;| \mathcal{X}| \leq |I|,&lt;/math&gt; where |''A''| denotes the cardinality of the set ''A''.

The index set is not restricted to be countable, and, of course, a subset of a powerset may be indexed, resulting in an '''indexed family of sets'''. For the important differences in sets and families see below.

==Examples==

===Index notation===
Whenever [[index notation]] is used the indexed objects form a family. For example, consider the following sentence.
*The vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are linearly independent. 
Here (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈ {1, …, ''n''}&lt;/sub&gt; denotes a family of vectors. The ''i''-th vector ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; only makes sense with respect to this family, as sets are unordered and there is no ''i''-th vector of a set. Furthermore, [[linear independence]] is only defined as the property of a collection; it therefore is important if those vectors are linearly independent as a set or as a family. 

If we consider ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 2 and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (1, 0), the ''set'' of them consists of only one element and is linearly independent, but the family contains the same element twice and is linearly dependent.

===Matrices===
Suppose a text states the following:
*A square matrix ''A'' is invertible, [[if and only if]] the rows of ''A'' are linearly independent. 

As in the previous example it is important that the rows of ''A'' are linearly independent as a family, not as a set. For Example, consider the matrix
:&lt;math&gt; A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} . &lt;/math&gt;
The ''set'' of rows only consists of a single element (1, 1) and is linearly independent, but the matrix is not invertible. The ''family'' of rows contains two elements and is linearly dependent. The statement is therefore correct if it refers to the family of rows, but wrong if it refers to the set of rows. (The statement is also correct when "the rows" is interpreted as referring to a [[multiset]], in which the elements are also kept distinct but which lacks some of the structure of an indexed family.)

== Functions, sets and families ==
[[Surjective]] [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and families are formally equivalent, as any function ''f'' with [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''I'' induces a family (''f''(''i''))&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;.  In practice, however, a family is viewed as a collection, not as a function: being ''an element of a family'' is equivalent with being in the range of the corresponding function. A family contains any element exactly once, [[if and only if]] the corresponding function is [[injective]]. 

Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], a family is a container and any set ''X'' gives rise to a family (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''x''∈''X''&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus any set naturally becomes a family. For any family (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; there is the set of all elements {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; | ''i''∈''I''}, but this does not carry any information on multiple containment or the structure given by ''I''.  Hence, by using a set instead of the family, some information might be lost.

== Examples ==
Let '''n''' be the finite set {1, 2, …, ''n''}, where ''n'' is a positive [[integer]].
* An [[ordered pair]] is a family indexed by the two element set '''2'''&amp;nbsp;= {1, 2}.
* An [[tuple|''n-''tuple]] is a family indexed by '''n'''.
* An infinite [[sequence]] is a family indexed by the [[natural numbers]].
* A [[tuple|list]] is an ''n-''tuple for an unspecified ''n'', or an infinite sequence.
* An ''n''×''m'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is a family indexed by the [[cartesian product]] '''n'''&amp;times;'''m'''.
* A [[net (mathematics)|net]] is a family indexed by a [[directed set]].

==Operations on families==

Index sets are often used in sums and other similar operations. For example, if (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is a family of numbers, the sum of all those numbers is denoted by

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i\in I}a_i. &lt;/math&gt;

When (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[family of sets]], the [[union (set theory)|union]] of all those sets is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i. &lt;/math&gt;

Likewise for [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]s and [[cartesian product]]s.

==Subfamily==

A family (''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt; is a '''subfamily''' of a family (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;, [[if and only if]] ''J'' is a subset of ''I'' and for all ''i'' in ''J'' 
:''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;

==Usage in category theory==
{{main|Diagram (category theory)}}

The analogous concept in [[category theory]] is called a '''[[diagram (category theory)|diagram]]'''. A diagram is a [[functor]] giving rise to an indexed family of objects in a [[category theory|category]] '''''C''''', indexed by another category '''''J''''', and related by [[morphism]]s depending on two indices.

The '''International Centre for Mathematical Sciences''' ('''ICMS''') is a mathematical research centre based in [[Edinburgh]]. According to its website, the Centre is "designed to bring together mathematicians and practitioners in science, industry and commerce for research workshops and other meetings." 

The Centre was jointly established in 1990 by the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[Heriot-Watt University]], under the supervision of Professor [[Elmer Rees]], with initial support from [[Edinburgh District Council]], the [[Scottish Development Agency]] and the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]]. In April 1994 the Centre moved to 14 India Street, Edinburgh, the birthplace of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and home of the [[James Clerk Maxwell Foundation]]. In 2010 it relocated to 15 South College Street to accommodate larger events. The current scientific director (appointed in 2016) is Professor Paul Glendinning.

'''Jorge Luis Borges and mathematics''' concerns several modern [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts found in certain essays and short stories of [[Argentina|Argentinian]] author [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (1899-1986), including concepts such as [[set theory]], [[recursion]], [[chaos theory]], and [[infinity|infinite]] [[sequence]]s,&lt;ref name=martinez&gt;{{cite web|last=Martínez|first=Guillermo|title=Borges and Mathematics|url=http://logicophilosophicus.org/guillermo-martinez/borges-and-mathematics.html|date=19 February 2003|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  although Borges' strongest links to mathematics are through [[Georg Cantor]]'s theory of infinite sets, outlined in "The Doctrine of Cycles" (''La doctrina de los ciclos''). Some of Borges' most popular works such as "[[The Library of Babel]]" (''La Biblioteca de Babel''), "[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]" (''El Jardín de Senderos que se Bifurcan''), "[[The Aleph (short story)|The Aleph]]" (''El Aleph''), an allusion to Cantor's use of the Hebrew letter [[aleph]] (&lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt;) to denote cardinality of transfinite sets,&lt;ref name=cosmicweb&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayles|first=N.

According to Argentinian mathematician [[Guillermo Martínez (writer)|Guillermo Martínez]], Borges at least had a knowledge of mathematics at the level of first courses in [[algebra]] and analysis at a university – covering [[logic]], [[paradox]]es, infinity, [[topology]] and [[probability theory]]. He was also aware of the contemporary debates on the foundations of mathematics.&lt;ref name=martinez /&gt; 

==Infinity and cardinality==
His 1939 essay "Avatars of the Tortoise" (''Avatares de la Tortuga'') is about infinity, and he opens by describing the book he would like to write on infinity: “five or seven years of metaphysical, theological, and mathematical training would prepare me (perhaps) for properly planning that book.”&lt;ref name=otherinquisitions&gt;"Los avatares de la tortuga", en Sur, nº 63, Buenos Aires, diciembre 1939, pp. 18-23. (Recogido en Discusión, Buenos Aires, Emecé, 1957) Original quote says: "Cinco, sietes años de aprendizaje metafísico, teológico, matemático, me capacitarían (tal vez), para planear decorosamente ese libro."&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
[[File:Illustration nested intervals.svg|300px|thumb|right|Visualizing a [[measure (mathematics)|measure zero]] set as the limit of a sequence of [[nested intervals]]. Pages in "[[The Book of Sand]]" have measure zero.]] 

In Borges' 1941 story, "The Library of Babel", the narrator declares that the collection of books of a fixed number of [[orthography|orthographic]] symbols and pages is unending.&lt;ref name=collfiction&gt;{{cite book|last=Borges|first=Jorge Luis|title=Collected Fictions|year=1998|publisher=Viking|isbn=0-670-84970-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the [[permutation]]s of twenty-five orthographic symbols is finite, the library has to be [[periodic function|periodic]] and self-repeating.&lt;ref name=cosmicweb /&gt; 

In his 1975 short story "[[The Book of Sand]]" (''El Libro de Arena''), he deals with another form of infinity; one whose elements are a [[dense set]], that is, for any two elements, we can always find another between them. This concept was also used in the physical book the short-story came from, [[The Book of Sand (book)|''The Book of Sand'' book]].&lt;ref name=martinez /&gt; The narrator describes the book as having pages that are "infinitely thin", which can be interpreted either as referring to a set of [[measure (mathematics)|measure zero]], or of having [[infinitesimal]] length, in the sense of [[second order logic]].&lt;ref name=wgbloch&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=William Goldbloom|title=The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533457-9|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_unimaginable_mathematics_of_Borges_L.html?id=ebILwSGlUlgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1936 essay "The Doctrine of Cycles" (''La doctrina de los ciclos''),&lt;ref&gt;''La doctrina de los ciclos'', en Sur, nº 20, Buenos Aires, mayo 1936, pp. 20-29. (Recogido en Historia de la eternidad, Buenos Aires, Viau y Zona, 1936. Fechado 1934)&lt;/ref&gt; published in his essay anthology of the same year [[Historia de la eternidad]], Borges speculated about a universe with infinite time and finite mass: "The number of all the atoms that compose the world is immense but finite, and as such only capable of a finite (though also immense) number of permutations. In an infinite stretch of time, the number of possible permutations must be run through, and the universe has to repeat itself. Once again you will be born from a belly, once again your skeleton will grow, once again this same page will reach your identical hands, once again you will follow the course of all the hours of your life until that of your incredible death."&lt;ref&gt;The original quote at the beginning of the essay says "El número de todos los átomos que componen el mundo es, aunque desmesurado, finito, y sólo capaz como tal de un número finito (aunque desmesurado también) de permutaciones. En un tiempo infinito, el número de las permutaciones posibles debe ser alcanzado, y el universo tiene que repetirse. De nuevo nacerás de un vientre, de nuevo crecerá tu esqueleto, de nuevo arribará esta misma página a tus manos iguales, de nuevo cursaras todas las 
horas hasta la de tu muerte increíble."&lt;/ref&gt; As usual with many of Borges' ideas and constructions, this line of thought was received as metaphysical speculation, a language and philosophical game. Yet almost one century later theoretical physicists are crossing the same paths, this time as a possible consequence of string theory: "“Well, if the universe is really accelerating its expansion, then we know that it’s going to get infinitely large, and that things will happen over and over and over.” And if you have infinitely many tries at something, then every possible outcome is going to happen infinitely many times, no matter how unlikely it is.".&lt;ref name=jbrookman&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookman|first=John|title=The Universe: Leading Scientists Explore the Origin, Mysteries, and Future of the Cosmos|year=2014|publisher=Harper Perennial|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18730155-the-universe|isbn= 0062296086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometry and topology==
Borges in "The Library of Babel" states that "The Library is a [[sphere]] whose exact center is any [[hexagon]] and whose circumference is unattainable". The library can then be visualized as being a 3-[[manifold]], and if the only restriction is that of being locally [[euclidean geometry|euclidean]], it can equally well be visualized as a topologically non-trivial manifold such as a [[torus]] or a [[Klein bottle]].&lt;ref name=wgbloch /&gt; 

In his 1951 essay "Pascal's sphere" (''La esfera de Pascal''),&lt;ref&gt;''La esfera de Pascal'', en La Nación, Buenos Aires, 14 enero 1951, 2.ª sec., p. 1. (Recogido en Otras inquisiciones, Buenos Aires, Sur, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; Borges writes about a "sphere with center everywhere and circumference nowhere". A realization of this concept can be given by a sequence of spheres with contained centres and increasingly large radii, which eventually encompasses the entire space. This can be compared to the special point in "The Aleph" by the process of [[inversion transformation|inversion]].&lt;ref name=martinez /&gt;

[[File:Schroedingers cat film.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Schrödinger's cat]]: the two outcomes can be interpreted as occurring in alternate universes with equal validity]]

==Quantum physics==
In "The Garden of Forking Paths", Borges describes a novel by the fictional [[people of China|Chinese]] scholar Ts'ui Pên, whose plot bifurcates at every point in time. The idea of the flow of time branching can be compared to the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] and the notion of [[multiverse]]s present in some versions of [[string theory]].&lt;ref name=fmerrel&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrel|first=Floyd|title=Unthinking Thinking: Jorge Luis Borges, Mathematics, and the New Physics|year=1991|publisher=Purdue University Press|location=West Lafayette|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Unthinking_thinking.html?id=3IY67Ck-TFQC|isbn=1-55753-011-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[infinity|infinitude]] of diverging, infinite universes in mathematical [[cosmology]] is reflected Borges' rejection of linear, absolute time.&lt;ref name=thiher&gt;{{cite book|last=Thiher|first=Allen|title=Fiction refracts science: modernist writers from Proust to Borges|year=2005|publisher=University of Missouri Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fiction_refracts_science.html?id=uNZsdTLq1UUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borges' writings address the nature of [[entity]] and the possibility of infinite "realities", as in his essay "New Time Refutations" (1946).&lt;ref name=jams&gt;{{cite journal|last=Di Marco|first=Oscar Antonio|title=Borges, the Quantum Theory and Parallel Universes|journal=The Journal of American Science|year=2006|url=http://www.jofamericanscience.org/journals/am-sci/0201/01-marco-0117.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaos theory==
[[Bifurcation theory]] is a  model in [[chaos theory]] of order appearing from a disordered system, and is a local theory that describes behavior of systems at local points. Borges anticipated the development of bifurcation theory in mathematics, through "The Garden of Forking Paths" in 1941. In "Garden", Borges captured the idea of a system splitting into multiple, uncorrelated states. For example, if a leaf floating in a river comes across a rock, it must flow across either side of the rock, and the two possibilities are statistically uncorrelated.&lt;ref name=chaosnorder&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayles|first=N. Katherine|title=Chaos and order: complex dynamics in literature and science|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226321436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14268">'''Model order reduction (MOR)''' is a technique for reducing the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of [[mathematical model]]s in [[numerical simulation]]s. As such it is closely related to the concept of [[metamodeling]] with applications in all areas of [[mathematical model]]ling.

== Overview ==
Many modern [[mathematical model]]s of real-life processes pose challenges when used in [[numerical simulation]]s, due to complexity and large size (dimension). '''Model order reduction''' aims to lower the computational complexity of such problems, for example, in simulations of large-scale [[dynamical system]]s and [[control system]]s. By a reduction of the model's associated [[state space]] dimension or [[degrees of freedom]], an approximation to the original model is computed which is commonly referred to as a reduced order model.

Reduced order models are useful in settings where it is often unfeasible to perform [[numerical simulation]]s using the complete full order model.  This can be due to limitations in [[computational resource]]s or the requirements of the simulations setting, for instance [[Real-time computing|real-time simulation]] settings or many-query settings in which a large number of simulations needs to be performed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lassila |first1=Toni |last2=Manzoni |first2=Andrea |last3=Quarteroni |first3=Alfio |last4=Rozza |first4=Gianluigi |title=Model Order Reduction in Fluid Dynamics: Challenges and Perspectives |journal=Reduced Order Methods for Modeling and Computational Reduction |date=2014 |pages=235–273 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-02090-7_9 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-02090-7_9 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rozza|first=G.|last2=Huynh|first2=D.

T.|date=2008-05-21|title=Reduced Basis Approximation and a Posteriori Error Estimation for Affinely Parametrized Elliptic Coercive Partial Differential Equations|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11831-008-9019-9|journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=229–275|doi=10.1007/s11831-008-9019-9|issn=1134-3060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Real-time simulation settings include [[controller (control theory)|control systems]] in electronics and [[Data visualization|visualization]] of model results while examples for a many-query setting can include [[optimization]] problems and design exploration. In order to be applicable to real-world problems, often the requirements of a reduced order model are:&lt;ref name=Schilders&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schilders |first1=Wilhelmus |last2=van der Vorst |first2=Henk |last3=Rommes |first3=Joost |title=Model Order Reduction: Theory, Research Aspects and Applications |date=2008 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-3-540-78841-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antoulas|first1=A.C.|date=July 2004|title=Approximation of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems: An Overview|url=|journal=IFAC Proceedings Volumes|volume=37|issue=11|pages=19–28|doi=10.1016/S1474-6670(17)31584-7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A small [[approximation error]] compared to the full order model.
* Conservation of the properties and characteristics of the full order model (E.g. stability and [[Passivity (engineering)|passivity]] in electronics).
* Computationally efficient and robust reduced order modelling techniques.

== Methods ==

Model order reduction techniques used most commonly nowadays can be broadly classified into 4 classes:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Silva|first=João M. S.|title=Outstanding Issues in Model Order Reduction|date=2007|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-540-71980-9_13|last2=Villena|first2=Jorge Fernández|last3=Flores|first3=Paulo|last4=Silveira|first4=L.

T. |title=Reduced Basis Techniques for Stochastic Problems |journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering |date=16 October 2010 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=435–454 |doi=10.1007/s11831-010-9056-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Balancing methods
* simplified physics&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benner|first=Peter|last2=Gugercin|first2=Serkan|last3=Willcox|first3=Karen|date=2015|title=A Survey of Projection-Based Model Reduction Methods for Parametric Dynamical Systems|url=http://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/130932715|journal=SIAM Review|language=en-US|volume=57|issue=4|pages=483–531|doi=10.1137/130932715|issn=0036-1445|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or operational based reduction methods.&lt;ref name=Schilders /&gt;

The simplified physics approach can be described to be analogous to the traditional [[Mathematical model]]ling approach, in which a less complex description of a system is constructed based on assumptions and simplifications using physical insight or otherwise derived information. However, this approach is not often the topic of discussion in the context of model order reduction as it is a general method in science, engineering and mathematics and is not the subject of the current article.

The remaining listed methods fall into the category of projection-based reduction. Projection-based reduction relies on the  projection of either the model equations or the solution onto a basis of reduced dimensionality compared to the original solution space. Methods that also fall into this class but are perhaps less commonly found are:

* [[Proper generalized decomposition]]&lt;ref name=PGD&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chinesta |first1=Francisco |last2=Ladeveze |first2=Pierre |last3=Cueto |first3=Elías |title=A Short Review on Model Order Reduction Based on Proper Generalized Decomposition |journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering |date=11 October 2011 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=395–404 |doi=10.1007/s11831-011-9064-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Model order reduction finds application within all fields involving mathematical modelling and many reviews exist for the topics of [[electronics]], [[Fluid mechanics|fluid-]] and [[structural mechanics]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=PGD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ref/id/CBO9780511622700|title=Turbulence, Coherent Structures, Dynamical Systems and Symmetry|last=Holmes|first=Philip|last2=Lumley|first2=John L.|last3=Berkooz|first3=Gal|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511622700|location=Cambridge|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511622700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Fluid mechanics===

Current Problems in fluid mechanics involve large [[dynamical system]]s representing many effects on many different scales. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] studies often involve models solving the navier-stokes with a number of [[degrees of freedom]] in the order of magnitude upwards of &lt;math&gt;10^6&lt;/math&gt;. The first usage of model order reduction techniques dates back to the work of Lumley in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lumley |first1=J.L. |title=The Structure of Inhomogeneous Turbulence," In: A. M. Yaglom and V. I. Tatarski, Eds., Atmospheric Turbulence and Wave Propagation |date=1967 |publisher=Nauka |location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was used to gain insight into the mechanisms and intensity of [[turbulence]] and [[Coherent turbulent structure|large coherent structure]]s present in fluid flow problems. Model order reduction also finds modern applications in [[Aeronautics]] to model the flow over the body of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walton|first=S.|last2=Hassan|first2=O.|last3=Morgan|first3=K.|date=2013|title=Reduced order modelling for unsteady fluid flow using proper orthogonal decomposition and radial basis functions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0307904X13002771|journal=Applied Mathematical Modelling|volume=37|issue=20-21|pages=8930–8945|doi=10.1016/j.apm.2013.04.025|issn=0307-904X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example can be found in Lieu et al&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lieu|first=T.|last2=Farhat|first2=C.|last3=Lesoinne|first3=M.|date=2006|title=Reduced-order fluid/structure modeling of a complete aircraft configuration|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0045782505005153|journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering|volume=195|issue=41-43|pages=5730–5742|doi=10.1016/j.cma.2005.08.026|issn=0045-7825|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the full order model of an [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F16]] fighter-aircraft with over 2.1 million degrees of freedom, was reduced to a model of just 90 degrees of freedom. Additionally reduced order modelling has been applied to study [[rheology]] in [[Hemodynamics]] and the [[Fluid–structure interaction]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;between the blood flowing through the vascular system and the vascular walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=D.|last2=Yang|first2=P.|last3=Fang|first3=F.|last4=Xiang|first4=J.|last5=Pain|first5=C.C.|last6=Navon|first6=I.M.|date=2016|title=Non-intrusive reduced order modelling of fluid–structure interactions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0045782516300068|journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering|volume=303|pages=35–54|doi=10.1016/j.cma.2015.12.029|issn=0045-7825|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colciago|first=C.M.|last2=Deparis|first2=S.|last3=Quarteroni|first3=A.|date=2014|title=Comparisons between reduced order models and full 3D models for fluid–structure interaction problems in haemodynamics|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0377042713005049|journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics|volume=265|pages=120–138|doi=10.1016/j.cam.2013.09.049|issn=0377-0427|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Moderne Algebra''''' is a two-volume German textbook on graduate [[abstract algebra]] by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|first=Bartel Leendert |last=van der Waerden|year1=1930|year2=1931}}, originally based on lectures given by [[Emil Artin]] in 1926 and by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Emmy Noether|first=Emmy|last=Noether|year=1929}} from 1924 to 1928. The English translation of 1949–1950 had the title '''''Modern algebra''''', though a later, extensively revised edition in 1970 had the title '''''Algebra'''''.

The book was one of the first [[textbook]]s to use an abstract axiomatic approach to [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, and was by far the most successful, becoming the standard reference for [[graduate school|graduate]] algebra for several decades. It "had a tremendous impact, and is widely considered to be the major text on algebra in the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Behan &amp; [[Karl Sigmund]] (2008) "A Short Tale of Two Cities: Otto Schrier and the Hamburg–Vienna Connection", p 33, [[Mathematical Intelligencer]] 30(3):27&amp;ndash;35&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 van der Waerden described the sources he drew upon to write the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=van der Waerden | first1=Bartel Leendert | author1-link=Bartel Leendert van der Waerden | title=On the sources of my book  Moderne Algebra | doi=10.1016/0315-0860(75)90034-8 | MR=0465721 | year=1975 | journal=[[Historia Mathematica]] | issn=0315-0860 | volume=2 | pages=31–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 [[Saunders Mac Lane]] recollected the book's influence:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Mac Lane | first1=Saunders | author1-link=Saunders Mac Lane | title=Van der Waerden's  Modern algebra | year=1997 | journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9920 | volume=44 | issue=3 | pages=321–322|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199703/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Upon its publication it was soon clear that this was the way that algebra should be presented.
* Its simple but austere style set the pattern for mathematical texts in other subjects, from [[Banach algebra]]s to [[topological group]] theory.
* [Van der Waerden's] two volumes on modern algebra ... dramatically changed the way algebra is now taught by providing a decisive example of a clear and perspicacious presentation. It is, in my view, the most influential text of algebra of the twentieth century.

==Publication history==

'''''Moderne Algebra''''' has a rather confusing publication history, because it went through many different editions, several of which were extensively rewritten with chapters and major topics added, deleted, or rearranged. In addition the new editions of first and second volumes were issued almost independently and at different times, and the numbering of the English editions does not correspond to the numbering of the German editions. In 1955 the title was changed from "Moderne Algebra" to "Algebra" following a suggestion of Brandt, with the result that the two volumes of the third German edition do not even have the same title.

For volume 1, the first German edition was published in 1930, the second in 1937 (with the axiom of choice removed), the third in 1951 (with the [[axiom of choice]] reinstated, and with more on [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Zelinsky | first1=Daniel | authorlink=Daniel Zelinsky | title=Book Review: Moderne Algebra | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1090/S0002-9904-1951-09496-3 | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1951-09496-3 | year=1951 | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9904 | volume=57 | issue=3 | pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth edition appeared in 1955 (with the title changed to ''Algebra''), the fifth in 1960, the sixth in 1964, the seventh in 1966, the eighth in 1971, the ninth in 1993. For volume 2, the first edition was published in 1931, the second in 1940, the third in 1955 (with the title changed to ''Algebra''), the fourth in 1959 (extensively rewritten, with elimination theory replaced by algebraic functions of 1 variable),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Algebra, Part 2 (4th ed. of Moderne Algebra)'' by B.

The German editions were all published by Springer.

The first English edition was published in 1949–1950 and was a translation of the second German edition. There was a second edition in 1953, and a third edition under the new title '''Algebra''' in 1970 translated from the 7th German edition of volume 1 and the 5th German edition of volume 2. The three English editions were originally published by Ungar, though the 3rd English edition was later reprinted by Springer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3579">The '''Moschovakis coding lemma''' is a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] from descriptive [[set theory]] involving sets of [[real number]]s in the [[axiom of determinacy]] (the principle that every two-player integer game is determined). The lemma was developed and named after the mathematician, [[Yiannis N. Moschovakis]].

The lemma may be expressed generally as follows:

Let Γ be a non-selfdual point-class closed under ∃ ω ω and ∧ , and ≺ a Γ well-founded relation on ω ω of rank θ ∈ ON. Let R ⊆ dom( ≺ ) × ω ω be such that ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ y R ( x,y ) . Then there is a Γ set A ⊆ dom( ≺ ) × ω ω which is a choice set for R , that is: 1. ∀ α &lt; θ ∃ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ y [ | x | ≺ = α ∧ A ( x,y )] . 2. ∀ x ∀ y A ( x,y ) → [ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∧ R ( x,y )] . Proof. We may assume θ is minimal so that the theorem fails, and fix ≺ , R , and a good universal set U ⊆ ( ω ω ) 3 for the Γ subsets of ( ω ω ) 2 . Easily, θ is a limit ordinal. For δ &lt; θ , say u ∈ ω ω codes a δ -choice set provided (1) holds for α ≤ δ using A = U u , and (2) holds for A = U u where we replace x ∈ dom( ≺ ) with x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∧| x | ≺ ≤ δ . By minimality of θ , for all δ &lt; θ there are δ -choice sets. Play the game where I, II play out u,v ∈ ω ω , and II wins provided that if u codes a δ 1 -choice set for some δ 1 &lt; θ , then v codes a δ 2 -choice set for some δ 2 &gt; δ 1 . If I has a winning strategy, we get a Σ 1 1 set B of reals coding δ -choice sets for arbitrarily large δ &lt; θ . Define then A ( x,y ) ↔∃ w ∈ B U ( w,x,y ), which easily works. Suppose now τ is a winning strategy for II. From the s - m - n theorem, let s : ( ω ω ) 2 → ω ω be continuous such that for all {{lang|el|ϵ}},x,t,w, U ( s ({{lang|el|ϵ}},x ) ,t,w ) ↔ ∃ y ∃ z [ y ≺ x ∧ U ({{lang|el|ϵ}},y,z ) ∧ U ( z,t,w )]. By the recursion theorem, let {{lang|el|ϵ}} 0 be such that U ({{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ) ↔ z = τ ( s ({{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x )). A straightforward induction on | x | ≺ for x ∈ dom( ≺ ) shows that ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ ! z U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ), and ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∀ z [ U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ) → z codes a ≥| x | ≺ -choice set]. Let A ( x,y ) ↔∃ z ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ w [ U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,z,w ) ∧ U ( w,x,y )].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Protractor2.jpg|thumb|right|A half circle protractor marked in degrees (180°).]]
A '''protractor''' is a [[measuring instrument]], typically made of transparent plastic or glass, for measuring [[angle]]s. Most protractors measure angles in
[[degree (angle)|degree]]s (°). Radian-scale protractors measure angles in [[radians]]. Most protractors are divided into 180 equal parts.

They are used for a variety of mechanical and engineering-related applications, but perhaps the most common use is in geometry lessons in schools.

Some protractors are simple half-discs.  More advanced protractors, such as the [[#Bevel protractor|bevel protractor]], have one or two swinging arms, which can be used to help measure the angle.

==Bevel protractor==
{{Expert-subject|date=January 2012}}

A bevel protractor is a graduated circular protractor with one pivoted arm; used for measuring or marking off angles. Sometimes [[Vernier scale]]s are attached to give more precise readings. It has wide application in architectural and mechanical drawing, although its use is decreasing with the availability of modern drawing software or [[CAD]].

Universal bevel protractors are also used by toolmakers; as they measure angles by mechanical contact they are classed as mechanical protractors.&lt;ref name="Magazines1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=7 July 2011|date=December 1993|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=76–|ISSN=00324558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The bevel protractor is used to establish and test angles to very close tolerances. It reads to 5 minutes or 1/12°{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} and can measure any angle from 0° to 360°.
  
The bevel protractor consists of a beam, a graduated dial and a blade which is connected to a swivel plate (with Vernier scale) by thumb nut and clamp. When the edges of the beam and blade are parallel, a small mark on the swivel plate coincides with the zero line on the graduated dial. To measure an angle between the beam and the blade of 90° or less, the reading may be obtained direct from the graduation number on the dial indicated by the mark on the swivel plate. To measure an angle of over 90°, subtract the number of degrees as indicated on the dial from 180°, as the dial is graduated from opposite zero marks to 90° each way.
  
Since the spaces, both on the main scale and the Vernier scale, are numbered both to the right and to the left from zero, any angle can be measured. The readings can be taken either to the right or to the left, according to the direction in which the zero on the main scale is moved.

The above picture illustrates a variety of uses of the bevel protractor.
 
Reading the Vernier scale:

The bevel protractor Vernier scale may have graduations of 5′ (minutes) or 1/12°. Each space on the Vernier scale is 5′ less than two spaces on the main scale{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}. Twenty four spaces on the Vernier scale equal in extreme length twenty three double degrees{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}. Thus the difference between the space occupied by 2° on a main scale and the space of the Vernier scale is equal to one twenty-fourth of 2°, or 5′.

Read off directly from the main scale the number of whole degrees between 0 on this scale and the 0 of the Vernier scale. Then count, in the same direction, the number of spaces from the zero on the Vernier scale to a line that coincides with a line on the main scale; multiply this number by 5 and the product will be the number of minutes to be added to the whole number of degrees.
 
For example: Zero on the vernier scale has moved 28 whole degrees to the right of the 0 on the main scale and the 3rd line on the vernier scale coincides with a line upon the main scale as  indicated. Multiplying 3 by 5, the product, 15, is the number of minutes to be added to the whole number of degrees, thus indicating a setting of 28 degrees and 15 minutes.

== Two Sided Protractor ==
Protractors have traditionally been one-sided. This is thought to be because early manufacturing methods set the tone of future production. Unfortunately, the two number scales on a one-sided protractor often confuse learners when first learning to measure and draw angles. However, in 2009, Jake Adamson, a maths teacher working at Musselburgh Grammar School invented and patented the first two sided protractor trademarked "The Angler". This was a double sided protractor with one scale on each side, avoiding the confusion of having two scales together and enabling easier measuring and drawing of angles. "The Angler" protractor has been widely adopted by schools in the UK.

In [[mathematics]], the '''secondary polynomials''' &lt;math&gt;\{q_n(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; associated with a [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;\{p_n(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; of [[polynomials]] [[orthogonal polynomials|orthogonal]] with respect to a density &lt;math&gt;\rho(x)&lt;/math&gt; are defined by

: &lt;math&gt; q_n(x) = \int_\mathbb{R}\! \frac{p_n(t) - p_n(x)}{t - x} \rho(t)\,dt. &lt;/math&gt;

To see that the functions &lt;math&gt;q_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; are indeed polynomials, consider the simple example of &lt;math&gt;p_0(x)=x^3.&lt;/math&gt; Then,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} q_0(x) &amp;{}
= \int_\mathbb{R} \! \frac{t^3 - x^3}{t - x} \rho(t)\,dt \\
&amp;{}
= \int_\mathbb{R} \! \frac{(t - x)(t^2+tx+x^2)}{t - x} \rho(t)\,dt \\
&amp;{}
= \int_\mathbb{R} \! (t^2+tx+x^2)\rho(t)\,dt \\
&amp;{}
= \int_\mathbb{R} \! t^2\rho(t)\,dt
+ x\int_\mathbb{R} \! t\rho(t)\,dt

The '''Seneca effect''', or '''Seneca cliff''' or '''Seneca collapse''', is a [[mathematical model]], proposed by [[Ugo Bardi]]. This model is aimed to describe a class of problems in nature in which the decline is faster than growth, under the condition of some constraints. This model is closely related to the work ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' issued by the [[Club of Rome]] in the Seventies&lt;ref&gt;[https://sustainable.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2763500/MSSI-ResearchPaper-4_Turner_2014.pdf Turner, Graham. Is Global Collapse Imminent?. University of Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; and its main application is to describe various kind of economics under the condition of shortage of [[fossil fuel]]s, e.g. in relation to the [[Hubbert curve]].

The reference to the Latin philosopher and writer [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] of the model's name lies in the verse: ''the raise is gradual, the ruin is precipitous'' (Lucius Anneus Seneca, ''[[Letters to Lucilius]]'', 91–63).

In [[set theory]] and its applications to [[logic]], [[mathematics]], and [[computer science]], '''set-builder notation''' is a [[mathematical notation]] for describing a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] by enumerating its elements or stating the properties that its members must satisfy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rosen| first=Kenneth| year=2007 | title=Discrete Mathematics and its Applications | edition=6th | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York, NY | isbn=978-0-07-288008-3| pages=111–112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYZfQgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defining sets by properties is also known as '''set comprehension''', '''set abstraction''' or as defining a set's '''[[intension]]'''.

Set-builder notation is sometimes simply referred to as ''set notation'', although this phrase may be better reserved for [[set notation|the broader class of means of denoting sets]].

== Sets defined by enumeration ==

A [[set (mathematics)|set]] is an  unordered collection of ''elements''.  (An ''element'' may also be referred to as a ''member''.)  An element may be any mathematical entity.

A set can be described directly by enumerating all of its elements between curly brackets, as in the following two examples:

* &lt;math&gt;\{ 7, 3, 15, 31\}&lt;/math&gt; is a set holding the four numbers 3, 7, 15, and 31.
* &lt;math&gt;\{a, c, b\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set containing 'a','b', and 'c'.

This is sometimes called the "roster method" for specifying a set.&lt;ref&gt;
Richard Aufmann, Vernon C. Barker, and Joanne Lockwood, 2007, ''Intermediate Algebra with Applications'', Brooks Cole, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it is desired to denote a set that contains elements from a regular sequence an [[ellipsis|ellipses]] notation may be employed, as shown in the next examples:

* &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100 \}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[natural number]]s.
* &lt;math&gt;\{\ldots,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}= \{0, 1, -1, 2, -2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all integers.

There is no order among the elements of a set (this explains and validates the equality of the last example), but with the ellipses notation we show an ordered sequence before (or after) the ellipsis as a convenient notational vehicle for explaining to a reader which elements are in a set.  The first few elements of the sequence are shown then the ellipses indicate that the simplest interpretation should be applied for continuing the sequence. Should no terminating value appear to the right of the ellipses then the sequence is considered to be unbounded.

In each preceding example, each set is described by enumerating its elements. Not all sets can be described in this way, or if they can, their enumeration may be too long or too complicated to be useful. Therefore, many sets are defined by a property that characterizes their elements. This characterization may be done informally using general prose, as in the following example.

* &lt;math&gt;\{&lt;/math&gt; addresses on Pine Street &lt;math&gt;\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all addresses on Pine Street.

However, the prose approach may lack accuracy or be ambiguous. Thus, set builder notation is often used with a predicate characterizing the elements of the set being defined, as described in the following section.

== Sets defined by a predicate ==
Set builder notation can be used to describe sets that are defined by a predicate, rather than explicitly enumerated.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J Cullinan, 2012, ''A Transition to Mathematics with Proofs'', Jones &amp; Bartlett, pp.&amp;nbsp;44ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, set builder notation has three parts: a variable, a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] or [[vertical bar]] separator, and a logical [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]. Thus there is a variable on the left of the separator, and a rule on the right of it. These three parts are contained in curly brackets:
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\{x : \Phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The vertical bar, which can also be written as a colon, is a separator that can be read as "'''such that'''", &lt;!--bold, because "such that" redirects here--&gt; "for which", or "with the property that".  The formula {{math|&amp;Phi;(''x'')}} is said to be the ''rule'' or the ''predicate''.   All values of ''x'' for which the predicate holds (is true) belong to the set being defined. All values of {{math|''x''}} for which the predicate does not hold do not belong to the set.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all values of {{math|''x''}} that satisfy the formula {{math|&amp;Phi;}}. It may be the [[empty set]], if no value of {{math|''x''}} satisfies the formula.

=== Specifying the domain ===

A [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] {{math|''E''}} can appear on the left of the vertical bar: 
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in E  \mid  \Phi(x)\},&lt;/math&gt; 
or by adjoining it to the predicate:
:&lt;math&gt;\{ x \mid x \in E \text{ and } \Phi(x)\}\quad\text{or}\quad\{ x \mid x \in E \land \Phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt; 
The &amp;isin; symbol here denotes [[set membership]], while the &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; symbol denotes the logical "and" operator, known as [[logical conjunction]]. This notation represents the set of all values of {{math|''x''}} that belong to some given set {{math|''E''}} for which the predicate is true. (see "[[#Set existence axiom|Set existence axiom]]" below)

In general, it is not a good idea to consider sets without defining a domain, as this would represent the subset of ''all possible things that may exist'' for which the predicate is true. This can easily lead to contradictions and paradoxes. For example, [[Russell's paradox]] shows that the expression &lt;math&gt;\{x ~|~ x\not\in x\},&lt;/math&gt; although seemingly well formed as a set builder expression, can not define a set without producing a contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1=Andrew David | last1=Irvine | first2=Harry | last2=Deutsch | orig-year=1995 | date=9 October 2016 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/ | title=Russell's Paradox | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where the set ''E'' is clear from context, it may be not explicitly specified.  It is common in the literature for an author to state the domain ahead of time, and then not specify it in the set builder notation. For example, an author may say something such as, "Unless otherwise stated, variables are to be taken to be natural numbers."

=== Examples ===
The following examples illustrate particular sets defined by set builder notation via predicates. In each case, the domain is specified on the left side of the vertical bar, while the rule is specified on the right side. 
* &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in \mathbb{R}   \mid  x &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all strictly [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]]s, which can be written in interval notation as &lt;math&gt;(0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in \mathbb{R}  \mid |x| = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\{-1, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set can also be defined as &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x^2 = 1\}&lt;/math&gt;; see [[#Equivalent predicates yield equal sets|equivalent predicates yield equal sets]] below.
* For each integer ''m'',  we can define &lt;math&gt;G_m = \{x  \in \mathbb{Z}  \mid  x \ge m \} = \{ m, m + 1, m + 2, \ldots\},&lt;/math&gt;. As an example, &lt;math&gt;G_3 = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \ge 3 \} = \{ 3, 4, 5, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_{-2} = \{ -2, -1, 0, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \mid 0 &lt; y &lt; f(x) \}&lt;/math&gt;  is the set of pairs of real numbers such that ''y'' is greater than 0 and less than ''f''(''x''), for a given [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''.   Here the [[cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of ordered pairs of real numbers. 
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{n   \in \mathbb{N} \mid  (\exists k)  [k\in \mathbb{N}\land n = 2k]  \} &lt;/math&gt; is the set of all [[even number|even]] [[natural number]]s. The &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; sign stands for "and", which is known as [[logical conjunction]].    The &amp;exist; sign stands for "there exists", which is known as [[existential quantification]].   So for example, &lt;math&gt; (\exists x) P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is read as  'there exists an ''x'' such that ''P''(''x'')".
&lt;!-- --&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;\{n \mid  (\exists k \in \mathbb{N} )  [n = 2k]  \} &lt;/math&gt; is a notational variant for the same set of even natural numbers. It is not necessary to specify that {{math|''n''}} is a natural number, as this is implied by the formula on the right.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{a \in \mathbb{R} \mid (\exists p\in \mathbb{Z} )(\exists q\in \mathbb{Z} )[ q \not = 0 \land aq=p] \}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[rational number]]s; that is, real numbers that can be written as the ratio of two [[integer]]s.

== More complex expressions on the left side of the notation ==

An extension of set-builder notation replaces the single variable {{math|''x''}} with a [[First order logic#Terms|term]] that may include one or more variables, combined with functions acting on them. So instead of  &lt;math&gt;\{ x \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;, we may have &lt;math&gt;\{ \Psi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\},&lt;/math&gt; which should be read
:&lt;math&gt;\{ \Psi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\}=\{y\mid\exists (x_1, \ldots, x_n), y=\Psi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\text{ and }\Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\}&lt;/math&gt;

For example:
* &lt;math&gt;\{2 n \mid n \in \mathbb N\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all natural numbers, is the set of all even natural numbers.
* &lt;math&gt;\{p/q  \mid p,q \in \mathbb Z, q \not = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all integers, is the set of all rational numbers ({{math|'''Q'''}}).
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 2 t + 1 \mid  t \in  \mathbb Z\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of odd integers.
* &lt;math&gt;\{ (t, 2 t + 1) \mid  t \in \mathbb Z\}&lt;/math&gt;  creates a set of pairs, where each pair puts an integer into correspondence with an odd integer.

When inverse functions can be explicitly stated, the expression on the left can be eliminated through simple substitution.  Consider the example set &lt;math&gt;\{ 2 t + 1 \mid  t \in  \mathbb Z\}&lt;/math&gt;. Make the substitution &lt;math&gt;u = 2t + 1&lt;/math&gt;, which is to say &lt;math&gt; t = (u-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;, then replace ''t'' in the set builder notation to find 
:&lt;math&gt;\{ 2 t + 1 \mid  t \in \mathbb Z\} = \{ u \mid  (u- 1)/2 \in  \mathbb Z\}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Equivalent predicates yield equal sets ==

Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. Sets defined by set builder notation are equal if and only if their set builder rules, including the domain specifiers, are equivalent. That is 
:&lt;math&gt; \{ x \in A \mid P(x) \}=\{ x \in B \mid Q(x) \} &lt;/math&gt; 
if and only if 
:&lt;math&gt; (\forall t)[ (t \in A \land P(t)) \Leftrightarrow (t \in B \land Q(t))]&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore, in order to prove the equality of two sets defined by set builder notation, it suffices to prove the equivalence of their predicates, including the domain qualifiers.

For example,
:&lt;math&gt; \{ x \in \mathbb{R}\mid  x^2 = 1 \} = \{ x \in \mathbb{Q} \mid |x| = 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
because the two rule predicates are logically equivalent:
:&lt;math&gt; (x \in \mathbb{R} \land x^2 = 1) \Leftrightarrow (x \in \mathbb{Q} \land |x| = 1).&lt;/math&gt;
This equivalence holds because, for any real number ''x'', we have &lt;math&gt;x^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''x'' is a rational number with &lt;math&gt;|x|=1&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, both sets are equal to the set &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Set existence axiom ==

In many formal set theories, such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], set builder notation is not part of the formal syntax of the theory. Instead, there is a [[axiom of comprehension|set existence axiom scheme]], which states that if ''E'' is a set and Φ(x) is a formula in the language of set theory, then there is a set ''Y'' whose members are exactly the elements of ''E'' that satisfy Φ:
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall E)(\exists Y)(\forall x)[x \in Y \Leftrightarrow x \in E \land \Phi(x)].&lt;/math&gt;
The set ''Y'' obtained from this axiom is exactly the set described in set builder notation as &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in E \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Z notation ==
{{Main article|Z notation}}
In [[Z notation]], the set of all ''x'' in a universe of discourse ''A'' that satisfy the condition ''P''(''x'') is written
:&lt;math&gt;\{x : A \mid P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
In Z, the [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] of an element ''x'' in set ''A'' is written as &lt;math&gt;(x : A)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;(x \in A)&lt;/math&gt;. Versions of set builder notation are also available in Z which allow for terms more complicated than a single variable, using a bullet to indicate the form of members of the set. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\{x : A \mid P(x) \bullet F(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; 
denotes the set of all values ''F''(''x''), where ''x'' is in ''A'' and ''P''(''x'') holds.

== Parallels in programming languages ==
{{main article|List comprehension}}
A similar notation available in a number of [[programming languages]] (notably [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) is the [[list comprehension]], which combines [[map (higher-order function)|map]] and [[filter (higher-order function)|filter]] operations over one or more [[list (computing)|lists]].

In Python, the set-builder's braces are replaced with square brackets, parentheses, or curly braces, giving list, [[generator (computer science)|generator]], and set objects, respectively. Python uses an English-based syntax. Haskell replaces the set-builder's braces with square brackets and uses symbols, including the standard set-builder vertical bar.

The same can be achieved in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] using Sequence Comprehensions, where the "for" keyword returns a list of the yielded variables using the "yield" keyword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Scala | url=http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/sequence-comprehensions.html | title=Sequence Comprehensions | accessdate=6 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider these set-builder notation examples in some programming languages:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Example 1 !! Example 2
|-
! Set-builder
| &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{l\ |\ l \in L\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  || &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{(k, x)\ |\ k \in K \wedge x \in X \wedge P(x) \}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
| &lt;source lang="python"&gt;{l for l in L}&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="python"&gt;{(k, x) for k in K for x in X if P(x)}&lt;/source&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]
| &lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;[l | l &lt;- ls]&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;[(k, x) | k &lt;- ks, x &lt;- xs, p x]&lt;/source&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]
| &lt;source lang="scala"&gt;for (l &lt;- L) yield l&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="scala"&gt;for (k &lt;- K; x &lt;- X if P(x)) yield (k,x)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[SQL]]
| &lt;source lang="sql"&gt;SELECT l FROM L_set&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="sql"&gt; SELECT k, x FROM K_set, X_set WHERE P(x)&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The set builder notation and list comprehension notation are both instances of a more general notation known as ''monad comprehensions'', which permits map/filter-like operations over any [[monad (functional programming)|monad]] with a [[zero element]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10163">{{Distinguish|Structuralism (philosophy of science)}}
'''Structuralism''' is a theory in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] that holds that mathematical theories describe structures of [[mathematical object]]s.  Mathematical objects are exhaustively defined by their place in such structures.  Consequently, structuralism maintains that mathematical objects do not possess any [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic properties]] but are defined by their external relations in a system. For instance, structuralism holds that the integer 1 is exhaustively defined by being the successor of 0 in the structure of the theory of natural numbers. By generalization of this example, any integer is defined by their respective place in this structure of the [[number line]]. Other examples of mathematical objects might include [[line (geometry)|line]]s and [[Plane (geometry)|planes]] in geometry, or elements and operations in [[abstract algebra]].

Structuralism is an [[epistemologically]] [[realism (philosophy)|realistic]] view in that it holds that mathematical statements have an objective [[truth value]]. However, its central claim only relates to what ''kind'' of entity a mathematical object is, not to what kind of ''existence'' mathematical objects or structures have (not, in other words, to their [[ontology]]). The kind of existence mathematical objects have would clearly be dependent on that of the structures in which they are embedded; different sub-varieties of structuralism make different ontological claims in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = James | title = Philosophy of Mathematics | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2008 | page = 62 | isbn = 978-0-415-96047-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics is particularly associated with [[Paul Benacerraf]], [[Geoffrey Hellman]], [[Michael Resnik]] and [[Stewart Shapiro]].

==Historical motivation==
The historical motivation for the development of structuralism derives from a fundamental problem of [[ontology]].  Since [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval]] times, philosophers have argued as to whether the ontology of mathematics contains [[abstract objects]].  In the philosophy of mathematics, an abstract object is traditionally defined as an entity that: (1) exists independent of the mind; (2) exists independent of the empirical world; and (3) has eternal, unchangeable properties.  Traditional mathematical [[Platonism]] maintains that some set of mathematical elements–[[natural numbers]], [[real numbers]], [[Functions (mathematics)|functions]], [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[systems]]–are such abstract objects.  Contrarily, mathematical [[nominalism]] denies the existence of any such abstract objects in the ontology of mathematics.  

In the late 19th and early 20th century, a number of anti-Platonist programs gained in popularity.  These included [[intuitionism]], [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], and [[predicativism]].  By the mid-20th century, however, these anti-Platonist theories had a number of their own issues.  This subsequently resulted in a resurgence of interest in Platonism.  It was in this historic context that the motivations for structuralism developed.  In 1965, [[Paul Benacerraf]] published a paradigm changing article entitled "What Numbers Could Not Be".&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be"&gt;Benacerraf, Paul (1965), "What Numbers Could Not Be", ''Philosophical Review'' Vol. 74, pp. 47–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Benacerraf concluded, on two principal arguments, that set-theoretic Platonism cannot succeed as a philosophical theory of mathematics.  

Firstly, Benacerraf argued that Platonic approaches do not pass the ontological test.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  He developed an argument against the ontology of set-theoretic Platonism, which is now historically referred to as [[Benacerraf's identification problem]].  Benacerraf noted that there are [[elementarily equivalent]], [[set-theoretic]] ways of relating natural numbers to [[pure sets]].  However, if someone asks for the "true" identity statements for relating natural numbers to pure sets, then different set-theoretic methods yield contradictory identity statements when these elementarily equivalent sets are related together.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  This generates a set-theoretic falsehood.  Consequently, Benacerraf inferred that this set-theoretic falsehood demonstrates it is impossible for there to be any Platonic method of reducing numbers to sets that reveals any abstract objects.  

Secondly, Benacerraf argued that Platonic approaches do not pass the [[epistemological]] test. Benacerraf contended that there does not exist an empirical or rational method for accessing abstract objects.  If mathematical objects are not spatial or temporal, then Benacerraf infers that such objects are not accessible through the [[causal theory of knowledge]].&lt;ref name ="Mathematical Truth"&gt;Benacerraf, Paul (1973). "Mathematical Truth", in Benacerraf &amp; Putnam, ''Philosophy of Mathematics: Selected Readings'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition. 1983, pp. 403–420.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fundamental epistemological problem thus arises for the Platonist to offer a plausible account of how a mathematician with a limited, empirical mind is capable of accurately accessing mind-independent, world-independent, eternal truths.  It was from these considerations, the ontological argument and the epistemological argument, that Benacerraf's anti-Platonic critiques motivated the development of structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics.

Shapiro divides structuralism into three major schools of thought.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;Shapiro, Stewart, "Mathematical Structuralism", ''Philosophia Mathematica'', '''4'''(2), May 1996, pp. 81–2.&lt;/ref&gt; These schools are referred to as the ''ante rem'', the ''in re'', and the ''post rem''.  

The '''''ante rem'' structuralism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro1997"&gt;Shapiro, Stewart (1997), ''Philosophy of Mathematics: Structure and Ontology'', New York, Oxford University Press. p. 9. {{isbn|0195139305}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ("before the thing"), or '''abstract structuralism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; or '''abstractionism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logicism/ Logicism and Neologicism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[abstractionist Platonism]].&lt;/ref&gt; (particularly associated with [[Michael Resnik]],&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; [[Stewart Shapiro]],&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; and [[Edward N. Zalta]])&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Zalta and Uri Nodelman, [http://www.bris.ac.uk/structuralism/media/zalta-slides.pdf "A Logically Coherent Ante Rem Structuralism "], Ontological Dependence Workshop, University of Bristol, February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; has a similar ontology to [[Mathematical Platonism|Platonism]] (see also [[modal neo-logicism]]). Structures are held to have a real but abstract and immaterial existence. As such, it faces the standard epistemological problem, as noted by Benacerraf, of explaining the interaction between such abstract structures and flesh-and-blood mathematicians.&lt;ref name="Mathematical Truth"/&gt; 

The '''''in re'' structuralism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro1997"/&gt; ("in the thing"),&lt;ref name="Shapiro1997"/&gt; or '''modal structuralism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; (particularly associated with [[Geoffrey Hellman]]),&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; is the equivalent of [[Philosophy of mathematics#Aristotelian realism|Aristotelian realism]]&lt;ref&gt;Jairo José da Silva, ''Mathematics and Its Applications: A Transcendental-Idealist Perspective'', Springer, 2017, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; (realism in truth value, but [[anti-realism]] about [[abstract object]]s in ontology). Structures are held to exist inasmuch as some concrete system exemplifies them. This incurs the usual issues that some perfectly legitimate structures might accidentally happen not to exist, and that a finite physical world might not be "big" enough to accommodate some otherwise legitimate structures.

The '''''post rem'' structuralism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nefdt, Ryan M. (2018). "Inferentialism and Structuralism: A Tale of Two Theories." PhilSci preprint.&lt;/ref&gt; ("after the thing"), or '''eliminative structuralism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; (particularly associated with [[Paul Benacerraf]]),&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; is [[anti-realism|anti-realist]] about structures in a way that parallels [[nominalism]]. Like nominalism, the ''post rem'' approach denies the existence of abstract mathematical objects with properties other than their place in a relational structure.  According to this view mathematical ''systems'' exist, and have structural features in common. If something is true of a structure, it will be true of all systems exemplifying the structure. However, it is merely instrumental to talk of structures being "held in common" between systems: they in fact have no independent existence.
